2	"Cardinal  criticises  Iraq  war  cost  |||    Billions  of  pounds  spent  on  conflict  in  Iraq  and  in  the  Middle  East  should  have  been  used  to  reduce  poverty,  Cardinal  Cormac  Murphy-O'Connor  has  said.  |||    The  head  of  the  Catholic  Church  in  England  and  Wales  made  the  comments  on  BBC  Radio  4  and  will  re-iterate  his  stance  in  his  Christmas  Midnight  Mass.  The  cardinal  used  a  Christmas  message  to  denounce  the  war  in  Iraq  as  a  ""terrible""  waste  of  money.  He  and  the  Archbishop  of  Canterbury  have  both  spoken  out  about  the  war.  |||    Speaking  on  BBC  Radio  4's  Thought  for  the  Day  slot,  he  criticised  the  fact  that  ""billions""  have  been  spent  on  war,  instead  of  being  used  to  bring  people  ""out  of  dire  poverty  and  malnourishment  and  disease"".  The  cardinal  said  2005  should  be  the  year  for  campaigning  to  ""make  history  poverty"".  He  added:  ""If  the  governments  of  the  rich  countries  were  as  ready  to  devote  to  peace  the  resources  they  are  willing  to  commit  to  war,  that  would  be  to  see  with  new  eyes  and  speak  with  a  new  voice  and  perhaps  then  others  would  listen  to  us  with  new  ears.""  The  cardinal  will  touch  on  this  theme  again  on  Friday  night  when  he  will  tell  the  congregation  of  2,000  at  Westminster  Cathedral  that  peace  is  ""worth,  always,  striving  for"".  |||    ""How  is  it  that  peace  has  not  arrived?,""  the  cardinal  will  ask.  ""How  is  it  that  there  is  war  in  Iraq,  violence  in  the  Holy  Land,  and  the  horror  of  pain  and  death  amongst  the  poor  and  deprived  who  suffer  from  injustice  and  thus  do  not  find  peace?""  ""How  can  one  wish  a  happy  Christmas  for  our  fellow  Christians  in  Iraq  or  in  the  Holy  Land  or  those  who  suffer  in  Africa  unless  you  and  I,  in  whatever  way  is  open  to  us,  say  and  do  what  makes  for  peace?""  Both  the  Cardinal  and  Archbishop  of  Canterbury  Dr  Rowan  Williams  appealed  for  the  weapons  inspectors  to  be  given  more  time  in  Iraq  before  the  war  started.  Dr  Williams  has  since  criticised  the  government  over  its  case  for  war,  saying  the  failure  to  find  weapons  of  mass  destruction  had  damaged  faith  in  the  political  system.  |||    On  Friday,  the  Cardinal  will  ask  the  congregation  to  search  for  peace.  ""It  is  possible,  it  is  real,  it  is  worth,  always,  striving  for,  because  of  the  promise  of  Our  Saviour,""  he  will  say.  ""I  also  wish  you  peace  in  your  homes  because  peace  in  your  home  is  the  beginning  of  peace  in  the  homes  of  the  community.  ""  A  spokesman  said  Downing  Street  had  no  comment  to  make.  But  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  has  said  he  will  put  Africa  at  the  top  of  the  agenda  when  Britain  chairs  the  G8  summit  next  year."

Barclays'  chief  John  Varley  said  the  bank  had  ""caught  the  winds""  of  a  very  strong  world  economy.  Earnings  at  Barclays  Capital  investment  bank  rose  25%  to  £1.04bn,  but  investment  in  branch  operations  held  back  growth  in  its  UK  retail  business.  |||    The  group  is  the  first  of  Britain's  five  big  banks  to  report  2004  results.  According  to  analysts'  forecasts,  HSBC,  the  biggest  UK  bank  by  stock  market  valuation,  will  report  profits  of  £9.4bn  later  this  month.  |||    Barclays  results  were  in  line  with  market  expectations.  Its  Global  Investors  wing  made  £347m,  an  82%  jump  on  2003  figures.  Profits  at  Barclaycard  rose  by  5%  to  £801m  but  were  said  to  have  been  affected  by  a  series  of  interest  rate  rises  and  investment  to  grow  its  customer  base.  The  bank  also  blamed  margins  pressure  on  its  mortgage  business  and  spending  on  its  branches  over  the  past  year  for  a  1%  fall  in  profits  in  its  UK  retail  division  to  £1.13bn.  |||    ""The  outlook  for  2005  is  good  as  a  result  of  balance  sheet  growth  and  investments  made  in  2004,""  Mr  Varley  said.  Barclays  cautioned  that  growth  this  year  may  be  slower  than  in  2004  on  the  back  of  softer  US  and  Chinese  economies  and  the  impact  of  interest  rate  rises  on  household  spending  in  the  UK.  It  added  its  bid  to  acquire  a  controlling  stake  in  South  Africa's  leading  retail  bank  Absa,  was  being  considered  by  regulatory  authorities.  Speaking  on  BBC  Radio  4,  Mr  Varley  declined  to  be  drawn  on  reports  that  Barclays  had  held  merger  talks  with  US  bank  Wells  Fargo.  A  tie-up  between  Barclays  and  California-based  Wells  Fargo  would  create  the  world's  fourth  biggest  bank,  valued  at  $180bn.  At  1405  GMT,  shares  in  Barclays  were  trading  down  0.67%  at  590  pence.  ""The  headline  numbers  are  in  line,  but  the  story  is  costs,""  said  analyst  Alex  Potter  at  Lehman  Brothers.  ""They  are  a  bit  more  aggressive  than  we  had  expected.  The  cost  overshoot  is  not  in  Barclays  Capital  but  in  the  UK  bank.""" 

2	"Blair  and  Brown  criticised  by  MPs  |||    Labour  MPs  have  angrily  criticised  Tony  Blair  and  Gordon  Brown  amid  renewed  reports  of  a  rift  between  the  two  men.  |||    A  meeting  of  the  Parliamentary  Labour  Party  saw  a  succession  of  normally  loyal  members  warn  that  feuding  could  jeopardise  Labour's  election  hopes.  The  PM  insisted  nothing  would  derail  Labour's  campaign,  despite  a  new  book  saying  he  has  upset  his  chancellor  by  backing  out  of  a  pledge  to  stand  aside.  Mr  Brown  will  again  be  in  the  public  eye  at  the  party's  new  poster  launch.  In  what  the  party  had  hoped  would  be  perceived  as  a  show  of  unity,  he  is  due  to  line  up  alongside  Alan  Milburn  -  the  man  controversially  appointed  as  the  party's  election  supremo  -  and  deputy  leader  John  Prescott  for  the  event  in  London  on  Tuesday.  Relations  between  Mr  Brown  and  Mr  Milburn  are  widely  reported  to  be  cool  ever  since  Mr  Blair  brought  the  latter  back  into  the  Cabinet  to  run  Labour's  election  campaign,  a  role  successfully  carried  out  by  Mr  Brown  in  both  1997  and  2001.  |||    Mr  Blair  told  the  Parliamentary  Labour  Party  on  Monday:  ""I  know  from  everyone  here,  in  Cabinet  and  government,  nothing  is  going  to  get  in  the  way  of  a  unified  Labour  Party  with  a  unified  position  and  winning  the  third  term  people  desperately  need.""  |||    The  prime  minister  and  his  chancellor  arrived  within  seconds  of  each  other  for  the  meeting  of  the  PLP  and  were  seemingly  in  good  spirits  as  it  started.  New  speculation  about  the  state  of  their  relationship  was  sparked  by  claims  in  Brown's  Britain,  by  Sunday  Telegraph  journalist  Robert  Peston,  which  suggested  Mr  Blair  went  back  on  a  pledge  to  make  way  for  Mr  Brown.  Labour's  Paul  Flynn  said  Mr  Blair  and  Mr  Brown  had  a  ""scorching""  from  MPs  adding:  ""It  was  a  Parliamentary  Labour  Party  meeting  like  no  other.""  |||    Backbencher  Stephen  Pound  said  some  MPs  had  threatend  to  expose  those  fuelling  the  reports  if  Mr  Blair  and  Mr  Brown  did  not  ""stop  this  nonsense,  this  poisonous  briefing"".  Lord  Campbell-Savours,  a  former  MP,  challenged  Mr  Brown  to  deny  reports  that  he  had  told  the  prime  minister  he  did  not  believe  anything  he  said.  Mr  Prescott  said  MPs  were  entitled  to  complain  about  discipline  after  reading  recent  press  reports.  |||    ""They  told  us  very  clearly,  it  was  the  troops  telling  the  leaders:  get  in  line,""  he  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  on  Tuesday.  Mr  Prescott  said  there  were  occasional  disagreements  in  any  government.  But  he  argued  Mr  Blair  and  Mr  Brown  could  work  successfully  together  and  had  produced  a  strong  economy  and  better  public  services.  |||    The  new  book  claims  Mr  Prescott  hosted  a  dinner  in  November  2003  where  the  prime  minister  told  Mr  Brown  he  would  stand  down  before  the  next  election  because  he  had  lost  trust  over  the  Iraq  war.  He  had  then  changed  his  mind  in  June  2004,  following  intervention  from  Cabinet  allies  and  suspicion  that  the  chancellor  was  manoeuvring  against  him,  writes  Mr  Peston.  Mr  Prescott  said  there  was  a  dinner  but  the  discussions  were  confidential.  ""Of  course  as  a  waiter  for  10  years  I  have  a  professional  ability  here,""  he  joked.  Mr  Blair  has  insisted  he  has  done  no  deals  over  the  premiership  while  Mr  Brown  says  he  will  not  let  ""gossip""  distract  him  from  helping  a  unified  election  campaign.  The  Conservatives  say  the  two  men  are  behaving  like  squabbling  schoolboys  and  the  Liberal  Democrats  claim  personal  ambition  is  obstructing  good  government." 

0	"Turkey  knocks  six  zeros  off  lira  |||    Turkey  is  to  relaunch  its  currency  on  Saturday,  knocking  six  zeros  off  the  lira  in  the  hope  of  boosting  trade  and  powering  its  growing  economy.  |||    The  change  will  see  the  end  of  such  dizzyingly-high  denominations  as  five  million  lira  -  enough  for  a  short  taxi  ride  -  and  the  20m  note,  worth  $15.  These  valuations  were  the  product  of  decades  of  inflation  which,  as  recently  as  2001,  was  as  high  as  70%.  Inflation  has  since  been  tamed  and  economic  prospects  are  improving.  |||    The  currency  -  officially  to  be  known  as  the  new  lira  -  will  be  launched  at  midnight  on  1  January.  From  that  point,  the  one-million  lira  note  will  become  the  new  one-lira  coin.  The  government  hopes  the  change  will  be  seen  as  a  promise  of  growing  economic  stability  as  Turkey  embarks  on  the  long  process  of  trying  to  join  the  European  Union.  |||    On  an  everyday  level,  it  is  hoped  the  change  will  stimulate  more  international  trade  and  end  confusion  among  foreign  investors  and  Turks  alike.  ""The  transition  to  the  new  Turkish  lira  shows  clearly  that  our  economy  has  broken  the  vicious  circle  that  it  was  imprisoned  in  for  long  years,""  said  Sureyya  Serdengecti,  head  of  the  Turkish  Central  Bank.  ""The  new  lira  is  also  the  symbol  of  the  stable  economy  that  we  dreamed  of  for  long  years.""  |||    The  Turkish  economy  teetered  on  the  brink  of  collapse  in  2001  when  the  lira  plunged  in  value  and  two  million  people  lost  their  jobs.  |||    Turkey  had  to  turn  to  the  International  Monetary  Fund  for  financial  assistance,  accepting  a  $18bn  loan  in  return  for  pushing  through  a  wide-ranging  austerity  programme.  These  tough  measures  have  borne  fruit.  Inflation  fell  below  10%  earlier  this  year  for  the  first  time  in  decades  while  exports  are  up  30%  this  year.  Meanwhile,  the  economy  is  expanding  at  a  healthy  rate,  with  7.9%  growth  expected  in  2004.  The  government  hopes  that  the  new  currency  will  cement  the  country's  economic  progress,  two  weeks  after  EU  leaders  set  a  date  for  the  start  of  Turkey's  accession  talks.  |||    The  slimmed-down  lira  is  likely  to  be  widely  welcomed  by  the  business  community.  |||    ""The  Turkish  lira  has  been  like  funny  money,""  Tevfik  Aksoy,  chief  Turkish  economist  for  Deutsche  Bank,  told  Associated  Press.  ""Now  at  least  in  cosmetic  terms  it  will  look  like  real  currency.""  However,  some  do  not  feel  quite  so  happy  about  seeing  the  nominal  value  of  their  investments  reduced.  ""If  a  person  has  10  billion  lira  in  investments  this  will  suddenly  decrease,""  shop  owner  Hayriye  Evren,  told  Associated  Press.  ""This  will  definitely  affect  people  psychologically.""" 

2	"'EU  referendum  could  cost  £80m'  |||    It  could  cost  £80m  to  run  a  UK  referendum  on  the  European  constitution,  ministers  have  revealed.  |||    In  a  written  parliamentary  answer,  Constitutional  Affairs  Minister  Chris  Leslie  said  the  poll  was  likely  to  cost  the  same  as  a  general  election.  Mr  Leslie  said  the  cost  could  not  be  compared  with  the  only  previous  British  referendum,  held  30  years  ago.  Ministers  say  the  constitution  would  make  the  European  Union  work  better  but  critics  fear  creating  a  ""super  state"".  Labour  MP  John  Cryer,  whose  question  revealed  the  price  estimate,  said  the  cost  surprised  him  but  was  not  a  central  factor  as  it  was  important  people  had  their  say.  But  he  said  it  would  have  been  better  to  have  rejected  the  constitution  so  avoiding  the  need  for  a  referendum.  The  2001  election  cost  £80m.  No  date  for  the  vote  has  been  set  but  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw  has  suggested  it  is  unlikely  to  be  held  until  early  2006  -  after  the  predicted  date  for  the  next  election.  Most  voters  said  the  UK  should  stay  in  the  Common  Market  in  the  1975  referendum." 

2	"Boothroyd  calls  for  Lords  speaker  |||    Betty  Boothroyd  has  said  the  House  of  Lords  needs  its  own  Speaker  and  that  peers  should  lead  the  way  on  reforming  the  upper  chamber.  |||    Baroness  Boothroyd,  who  was  the  first  woman  to  be  Commons  Speaker,  said  she  believed  Tony  Blair  initiated  reforms  without  a  clear  outcome  in  mind.  ""Now  we  have  to  take  care  of  it  ourselves  and  make  the  best  of  it,""  she  told  the  BBC's  Breakfast  with  Frost.  In  1999  Labour  removed  all  but  92  of  the  Lords'  750  hereditary  peers.  That  was  billed  as  the  first  stage  of  reform  of  the  institution.  The  lord  chancellor  hinted  further  reforms  could  be  unveiled  in  the  next  Labour  manifesto.  |||    ""I  think  we  need  to  look  very  carefully  at  the  relationship  between  the  Lords  and  the  Commons,""  Lord  Falconer  told  BBC1's  Breakfast  With  Frost.  ""How  it  interacts  with  the  Commons  is  a  very,  very  important  issue.  ""We  need  to  address  the  issue  in  the  manifesto,  but  you  will  have  to  wait  for  when  the  manifesto  comes.""  The  lord  chancellor  currently  has  the  role  of  House  of  Lords  speaker.  He  is  also  head  of  the  judiciary  and  a  member  of  the  Cabinet  as  constitutional  affairs  secretary.  |||    Lady  Boothroyd  said  she  believed  it  was  unacceptable  for  the  lord  chancellor  to  have  the  role  of  Speaker.  ""I  would  really  like  to  see  a  Speaker  of  the  House  of  Lords,""  she  said.  ""I  don't  go  for  the  idea  of  somebody  -  a  lord  chancellor  -  who  is  head  of  the  judiciary,  a  senior  Cabinet  minister  and  Speaker  of  the  Lords.  ""I  want  somebody  there  who  is  going  to  look  after  that  House  and  do  a  job  there." 

2	"Regiments'  group  in  poll  move  |||    A  regiments'  campaign  group  is  to  target  nine  marginal  Labour  seats  at  the  General  Election.  |||    Save  the  Scottish  Regiments  will  also  field  a  candidate  against  Armed  Forces  Minister  Adam  Ingram  in  East  Kilbride.  The  group,  which  is  unhappy  at  defence  merger  plans,  is  endorsing  opposition  candidates  in  nine  seats.  The  marginals  are  Aberdeen  South,  Dumfriesshire,  Dundee  East  and  West,  South  West  Edinburgh,  Ochil,  Stirling,  East  Renfrewshire  and  Western  Isles.  The  campaigners  unveiled  a  huge  poster  featuring  Black  Watch  soldiers  fighting  the  war  in  Iraq  before  they  announced  their  election  plans.  |||    Former  Scots  Guardsman  Allan  Hendry  will  challenge  Mr  Ingram.  The  group  said  it  is  well  organised,  with  350  volunteers,  and  will  be  announcing  at  least  one  other  candidate  later.  It  added  that  it  can  only  be  stopped  from  inflicting  serious  damage  on  Labour  if  the  government  reverses  its  plan  to  merge  the  six  Scottish  regiments.  |||    Scotland's  only  Conservative  MP  Peter  Duncan  said  the  Save  the  Scottish  Regiments  had  done  a  ""superb  job""  in  fighting  against  defence  cuts.  He  added:  ""Their  actions  have  reflected  the  pride  that  most  people  in  this  country  have  in  our  troops,  and  have  shown  a  steely  determination  to  make  Labour  pay  for  their  betrayal.  ""I  have  been  honoured  to  speak  at  their  rallies  throughout  Scotland.""  Scottish  National  Party  leader  Alex  Salmond  said  it  had  received  a  ""big  boost""  from  the  campaign's  decision  to  endorse  SNP  candidates  in  four  marginal  seats.  |||    ""Labour's  arrogance  has  been  their  undoing.  In  trying  to  get  rid  of  Scotland's  historic  regiments,  Labour  MPs  will  end  up  being  scrapped  themselves,""  he  said.  However,  Labour  MP  George  Foulkes  said  the  campaigners  would  not  make  any  difference  to  the  outcome  of  the  election  and  would  not  win  the  argument.  ""A  serving  soldier  knows  that  what  Labour  is  proposing  is  right,""  he  said.  As  well  as  their  election  move,  Save  the  Scottish  Regiments  will  join  other  campaigners  at  a  rally  in  London  in  the  spring.  Defence  Secretary  Geoff  Hoon  announced  last  year  that  Scotland's  regiments  would  be  combined  into  a  single  unit.  The  move  was  part  of  overall  Army  reforms." 

3	"Republic  to  face  China  and  Italy  |||    The  Republic  of  Ireland  have  arranged  friendlies  against  China  and  Italy  which  will  take  place  at  Lansdowne  Road  in  March  and  August.  |||    Brian  Kerr's  side  will  face  the  54th  ranked  Chinese  on  29  March  -  just  three  days  after  the  World  Cup  qualifier  against  Israel  in  Tel  Aviv.  Italy  will  visit  on  17  August  in  what  will  be  a  warm-up  game  ahead  of  the  autumn  World  Cup  qualifiers.  In  their  last  meeting,  the  Irish  beat  Italy  in  the  1994  World  Cup  Finals.  However,  that  is  the  Republic's  only  victory  in  eight  attempts  against  the  Italians  who  have  won  all  the  other  seven  games.  The  29  March  game  will  be  the  second  time  the  Republic  have  played  China  -  the  previous  encounter  back  in  June  1984  with  the  Irish  winning  1-0  in  Sapporo,  Japan.  Brian  Kerr  said:  ""China  have  made  great  progress  over  the  last  few  years  and  will  provide  difficult  opposition.  ""We  all  witnessed  the  performances  of  the  Asian  teams  in  the  last  World  Cup,  and  China  play  a  similar  type  of  football.  ""As  for  Italy,  they  make  a  welcome  return  to  Dublin  and  will  be  a  massive  attraction  because  they  are  one  of  the  great  traditional  powers  in  the  world.  ""The  game  will  be  ideal  preparation  for  the  three  important  World  Cup  qualifiers  in  the  autumn.""  Ireland  round  off  their  World  Cup  campaign  with  games  against  France  on  7  September,  Cyprus  on  8  October  and  Switzerland  on  12  October." 

2	"Short  attacks  US  over  tsunami  aid  |||    Former  Cabinet  minister  Clare  Short  has  criticised  the  US-led  tsunami  aid  coalition,  saying  the  UN  should  be  leading  efforts.  |||    President  Bush  has  announced  that  an  alliance  of  the  US,  India,  Australia  and  Japan  will  co-ordinate  a  humanitarian  drive.  But  Ms  Short  said  the  effect  of  the  parallel  coalition  would  be  to  undermine  the  UN.  She  said  only  the  UN  had  the  ""moral  authority""  to  lead  the  relief  work.  Ms  Short  resigned  as  international  development  secretary  over  the  Iraq  war.  ""I  think  this  initiative  from  America  to  set  up  four  countries  claiming  to  co-ordinate  sounds  like  yet  another  attempt  to  undermine  the  UN  when  it  is  the  best  system  we  have  got  and  the  one  that  needs  building  up,""  she  said.  ""Only  really  the  UN  can  do  that  job,""  she  told  BBC  Radio  Four's  PM  programme.  ""It  is  the  only  body  that  has  the  moral  authority.  But  it  can  only  do  it  well  if  it  is  backed  up  by  the  authority  of  the  great  powers.""  Ms  Short  said  the  countries  involved  could  not  boast  good  records  on  their  response  to  major  disasters.  The  US  was  ""very  bad  at  coordinating  with  anyone""  and  India  had  its  own  problems,  Ms  Short  said.  ""I  don't  know  what  that  is  about  but  it  sounds  very  much,  I  am  afraid,  like  the  US  trying  to  have  a  separate  operation  and  not  work  with  the  rest  of  the  world  through  the  UN  system,""  she  added."

AEFA  has  more  than  12,000  advisers  selling  financial  advice,  funds  and  insurance  to  2.5  million  customers.  Over  the  years  it  has  delivered  poor  profits  and  even  some  losses.  |||    ""This  is  an  excellent  move  by  American  Express  to  focus  on  its  core  businesses,  and  sell  off  a  laggard  division,  which  has  been  a  problem  for  quite  some  time,""  said  Marquis  Investment  Research  analyst  Phil  Kain.  Analysts  estimate  that  a  stand-alone  AEFA  could  have  a  market  value  of  $10bn  (£5.3bn).  The  unit  was  acquired  by  American  Express  20  years  ago  as  Investors  Diversified  Service,  of  Minneapolis,  at  a  time  when  firms  were  amassing  one-stop  financial  empires.  However,  the  business  of  selling  investments  was  never  integrated  with  the  rest  of  the  group."

It  is  currently  arguing  against  an  offer  from  Swiss  Xstrata,  which  the  firm  raised  to  A$8.4bn  last  week  after  WMC  said  it  was  an  undervaluation.  Now  reports  say  that  the  Australian  government  is  against  the  deal.  |||    Trade  Minister  Mark  Vaile  has  said  that  the  bid  may  be  ""against  the  national  interest"".  Mr  Vaile,  who  was  quoted  in  the  Australian  Financial  Review,  compared  Xstrata's  attempt  to  take  over  WMC  to  a  similar  bid  by  oil  giant  Shell  for  Australia's  Woodside  Petroleum  in  2001.  The  bid  was  thrown  out  by  Treasurer  Peter  Costello  on  national  interest  grounds.  WMC's  interests  in  uranium  deposits  were  a  contributing  factor,  Mr  Vaile  said.  WMC  itself,  however,  has  no  objection  in  principle  to  being  bought  out,  having  spun  off  its  aluminium  operations  in  2002  to  make  itself  a  more  tempting  target  -  as  long  as  the  price  is  right.  Its  stellar  performance  in  2004  has  been  built  on  sky-high  prices  for  metals.  Copper  and  nickel  in  particular  have  been  in  high  demand  thanks  to  China's  booming  economy,  which  expanded  more  than  9%  in  each  of  the  past  two  years.  Nickel  prices  rose  43%  during  the  year,  with  copper  up  36%." 

2	"Choose  hope  over  fear  -  Kennedy  |||    Voters  will  have  a  clear  choice  between  the  politics  of  fear  and  the  politics  of  hope  in  the  next  general  election,  said  Charles  Kennedy.  |||    In  his  New  Year  message  the  Liberal  Democrat  leader  said  Labour  and  the  Conservatives  were  united  in  relying  on  fear  and  ""populist  scares"".  He  said  his  party  was  the  one  of  hope  and  was  ready  for  a  2005  poll.  On  the  Asian  tsunami  he  said  it  had  been  ""very  heartening""  to  learn  of  the  generosity  being  shown  by  Britons.  Mr  Kennedy  said  his  thoughts  were  with  all  those  caught  up  in  the  disaster,  which  had  dominated  the  Christmas  and  New  Year  period.  At  home  he  said  many  people  were  turning  to  the  Liberal  Democrats  as  they  became  disheartened  with  the  politics  of  the  other  two  main  parties.  |||    The  general  election  would  be  a  three-party  struggle,  as  the  Conservative  party  ""fades  away""  as  a  national  force  and  the  Liberal  Democrats  challenge  Labour  in  its  heartlands,  he  said.  ""A  clear  division  is  emerging  in  British  politics  -  the  politics  of  fear  versus  the  politics  of  hope.  ""Labour  is  counting  on  the  politics  of  fear,  ratcheting  up  talk  of  threats,  crime  and  insecurity.  While  the  Conservatives  are  re-working  their  populist  scares  about  asylum  and  the  European  'menace',""  he  said.  He  said  the  government  was  using  this  climate  of  fear  to  try  to  strip  away  civil  liberties.  |||    It  was  already  using  detention  without  trial  at  Belmarsh  Prison,  ignoring  a  recent  Law  Lords  judgement  that  this  contravenes  basic  human  rights,  he  said.  He  also  criticised  attempts  to  bring  in  trial  without  jury,  plans  to  lower  the  burden  of  proof  in  some  criminal  trials,  curbing  of  rights  to  protest,  increased  stop  and  search  powers  and  ID  card  plans.  He  said  while  everyone  had  the  right  to  be  secure  they  also  had  the  right  to  be  protected  against  unfair  discrimination.  ""But  at  the  same  time,  an  overmighty  state  is  a  dangerous  one,""  he  said.  His  party  ""instinctively""  understood  the  ""new  liberal  Britain""  which  is  no  longer  a  nation  with  one  family  structure,  and  one  colour,  he  said.  ""We  are  less  deferential;  more  inclined  to  think  for  ourselves;  more  open  about  sexuality  and  equality.  ""Our  national  institutions  are  changing  too.  We  are  no  longer  a  nation  of  one  church;  we  are  a  nation  of  many  faiths.  In  our  attitudes  and  the  way  we  live  our  lives,  this  is  in  many  ways  a  liberal  Britain.""" 

1	"Grammys  honour  soul  star  Charles  |||    The  memory  of  soul  legend  Ray  Charles  dominated  the  music  world's  leading  music  ceremony  on  Sunday  as  he  was  given  eight  posthumous  Grammy  Awards.  |||    Charles,  who  died  in  2004,  got  honours  including  record  and  album  of  the  year,  while  Alicia  Keys  and  actor  Jamie  Foxx  performed  a  musical  tribute  to  him.  R&B  star  Keys  won  four  awards  herself  at  the  Grammy  ceremony  in  Los  Angeles.  U2,  Usher,  Norah  Jones  and  Kanye  West  got  three  each.  West  led  the  race  going  into  the  ceremony  with  10  nominations.  |||    Charles'  last  album,  Genius  Loves  Company,  a  collection  of  duets  that  has  sold  more  than  two  million  copies,  was  named  album  of  the  year  and  best  pop  vocal  album.  His  song  Here  We  Go  Again  with  Norah  Jones  won  record  of  the  year  and  best  pop  vocal  collaboration,  while  Heaven  Help  Us  All  with  Gladys  Knight  picked  up  best  gospel  performance.  Jones  said:  ""I'm  glad  he's  getting  recognised,  because  of  who  he  is  and  how  much  I  love  him.""  Actor  Jamie  Foxx  -  who  is  nominated  for  an  Oscar  for  playing  Charles  in  the  hit  movie  Ray  -  dedicated  a  rendition  of  Georgia  on  My  Mind  to  ""old  friends"".  Keys,  looking  to  replicate  her  Grammys  success  of  2002,  when  she  won  five,  picked  up  best  R&B  song  for  You  Don't  Know  My  Name  and  best  R&B  album  for  The  Diary  of  Alicia  Keys.  She  also  shared  the  award  for  best  R&B  vocal  performance  by  a  duo  or  group  with  Usher  for  My  Boo.  |||    Usher's  other  victories  were  for  best  contemporary  R&B  album  for  Confessions  and  best  rap/sung  collaboration  for  Yeah!,  featuring  Lil  Jon  and  Ludacris.  Kanye  West  dominated  the  rap  categories,  winning  best  rap  song  for  Jesus  Walks  and  best  rap  album  for  The  College  Dropout.  But  in  one  of  the  night's  biggest  shocks,  he  lost  out  in  the  battle  to  be  named  best  new  artist  to  pop  rock  act  Maroon  5.  Vertigo  by  rock  giants  U2  won  three  trophies  -  best  rock  song,  best  short  video  and  best  rock  vocal  performance  by  a  duo  or  group.  One  of  the  other  main  awards,  song  of  the  year,  went  to  US  singer-songwriter  John  Mayer  for  Daughters.  Mayer  also  won  best  male  pop  vocal  performance.  Britney  Spears  picked  up  her  first  ever  Grammy  for  her  song  Toxic,  which  was  named  best  dance  recording.  |||    Rod  Stewart  also  won  the  first  Grammy  of  his  career,  getting  the  best  traditional  pop  album  award  for  Stardust...  The  Great  American  Songbook:  Volume  III.  In  2003,  Stewart  said  he  was  ""astounded""  he  had  never  won  a  Grammy  -  but  ""they  tend  not  to  give  it  to  the  British  unless  you're  Sting"".  There  were  few  other  high-profile  British  victors  this  year.  Annie  Lennox,  metal  group  Motorhead  and  dance  act  Basement  Jaxx  all  took  home  trophies.  But  Elvis  Costello,  who  had  four  nominations,  and  Joss  Stone  and  Franz  Ferdinand,  who  were  both  up  for  three  awards,  got  nothing.  |||    Beach  Boys  veteran  Brian  Wilson  was  another  first-time  winner  -  for  best  rock  instrumental  performance.  ""It  represents  triumph  and  achievement  in  music  that  I  feel  that  I  deserved,  and  I'm  really  glad  I  won,""  he  said.  A  live  recording  of  composer  John  Adams'  11  September  tribute,  On  the  Transmigration  of  Souls,  performed  by  the  New  York  Philharmonic,  won  three  classical  prizes.  And  former  US  President  Bill  Clinton  picked  up  the  second  Grammy  of  his  career,  winning  the  spoken  word  award  for  the  audio  version  of  his  autobiography  My  Life." 

2	"Blunkett  unveils  policing  plans  |||    People  could  be  given  the  mobile  phone  number  of  their  local  bobby  under  an  overhaul  of  policing  in  England  and  Wales  unveiled  by  David  Blunkett.  |||    The  plans  include  a  dedicated  policing  team  for  each  neighbourhood  and  a  10  point  compulsory  customer  charter.  The  home  secretary  said  targets  would  be  put  in  place  to  ensure  that  the  public  got  a  good  response  from  police.  Local  people  would  also  be  able  to  ""trigger""  action  on  specific  problems  if  they  felt  nothing  was  being  done.  Local  councillors  would  have  to  show  certain  conditions  had  been  met  before  invoking  the  power.  And  police  could  refuse  the  request  if  the  complaints  were  frivolous,  would  only  cause  annoyance  or  would  pose  too  heavy  a  burden  on  resources.  |||    Mr  Blunkett  said  a  new  three  digit  number  would  be  created  for  non-emergency  phone  calls  to  police.  The  best  performing  police  services  would  get  more  cash  and  extra  freedoms,  he  said,  but  he  would  not  shirk  from  stepping  in  where  the  public  was  being  failed.  The  home  secretary's  powers  to  suspend  or  sack  chief  constables  are  being  reviewed  after  Mr  Blunkett's  battle  with  Humberside  chief  David  Westwood  over  intelligence  failures  on  Soham  murderer  Ian  Huntley.  |||    Opposition  parties  also  want  more  local  policing  to  tackle  nuisance  behaviour  and  other  crime  but  they  accuse  ministers  of  tying  the  police  up  with  paperwork.  Tory  spokesman  David  Davis  said  the  proposals  were  ""little  more  than  a  taxpayer-funded  PR  exercise""  ahead  of  a  general  election  predicted  for  next  May.  |||    Police  forces  were  already  ""buried""  under  existing  government  initiatives  and  there  was  little  in  the  latest  plans  to  reassure  them,""  said  Mr  Davis.  Earlier  Lib  Dem  home  affairs  spokesman  Mark  Oaten  said  the  government  was  right  to  want  to  increase  the  links  between  local  people  and  the  police.  ""But  these  measures  will  only  work  if  they're  matched  with  a  cut  in  the  amount  of  paperwork  -  and  investment  in  modern  equipment  to  keep  the  police  out  on  the  streets.""  |||    Before  delivering  a  statement  to  MPs,  Mr  Blunkett  was  joined  by  Tony  Blair  at  Welling  School,  in  south  east  London,  which  is  at  the  heart  of  a  community  policing  initiative.  Mr  Blunkett  said  he  wanted  ""to  go  back  to  a  time  when  I  was  very  young,  when  you  expected  the  police  to  be  part  of  the  community  and  the  community  to  be  part  of  policing  and  where  people  were  joined  together  in  partnership  making  it  work"".  The  prime  minister  said  the  law-abiding  citizen  should  be  in  charge  of  the  community  and  ""not  the  minority  who  want  to  cause  trouble"".  |||    Mr  Blunkett  already  boasts  about  producing  record  police  numbers.  He  has  also  started  to  recruit  25,000  Community  Support  Officers  (CSOs)  and  the  new  plans  would  allow  all  police  forces  to  give  them  the  power  to  detain  suspects.  An  extra  £50m  was  promised  on  Tuesday  so  2,000  new  CSOs  can  be  recruited  now  rather  than  next  year.  Within  two  years,  every  force  will  be  expected  to  keep  to  a  ""coppers'  contract""  on  what  kind  of  service  the  public  can  expect.  A  Mori  poll  this  summer  suggested  policing,  unlike  health  and  education,  was  the  one  major  public  service  where  people  were  less  satisfied  the  more  contact  they  had  with  it.  The  plans  also  include  the  idea  of  allowing  people  join  police  forces  at  different  levels  rather  than  the  traditional  way  of  making  everybody  spend  specific  amounts  of  time  as  a  constable  before  being  promoted.  There  will  also  be  ""specific  exercises""  to  encourage  black  and  Asian  people  to  join  the  police  at  senior  ranks." 

2	"Blair  joins  school  sailing  trip  |||    The  prime  minister  has  donned  a  life  jacket  and  joined  school  children  in  a  sailing  dinghy  as  he  sought  to  sell  his  party's  education  policies.  |||    Tony  Blair  sailed  across  the  lake  in  Bromsgrove,  Worcestershire,  while  on  a  visit  with  Education  Secretary  Ruth  Kelly  to  back  school  outings.  Mr  Blair  later  stressed  Labour's  election  pledge  to  focus  on  education,  when  he  met  parents  in  the  area.  The  Conservatives  and  Lib  Dems  both  say  his  pledges  are  ""worthless"".  All  the  parties  are  stepping  up  campaigning  ahead  of  a  General  Election  widely  expected  to  be  held  on  5  May.  Mr  Blair,  looking  a  little  windswept,  joined  two  girls  from  St  Egwin's  Middle  School  in  Evesham  and  an  instructor  for  a  trip  in  the  Wayfarer  dinghy,  closely  followed  by  a  boat  full  of  photographers.  |||    Afterwards  he  said  outdoor  activities  were  beneficial  for  children  but  accepted  that  lots  of  teachers  now  worried  about  taking  part  for  fear  of  being  sued  if  something  went  wrong.  ""What  we're  doing  is  introducing  some  simple  guidelines  so  if  teachers  follow  those  they  are  not  going  to  be  at  risk  of  legal  action,""  Mr  Blair  said.  ""When  you  are  doing  these  types  of  activities  you've  got  to  exercise  some  common  sense  there  obviously.  ""You  can't  have  a  situation  where  parents  or  teachers  end  up  being  worried  that  they're  going  to  be  subject  to  all  sorts  of  legal  action  if  they  take  children  sailing  or  doing  outdoor  activity  that  is  actually  good  for  the  kids  and  good  for  their  health  and  their  character.""  |||    The  pledge  on  education  -  ""your  child  achieving  more""  -  was  one  of  six  election  pledges  unveiled  by  Mr  Blair  last  week.  If  it  wins  a  third  term  in  the  general  election  expected  this  year,  Labour  is  committed  to  giving  parents  more  choice  between  schools;  allowing  all  secondary  schools  to  take  on  specialist  status;  opening  200  city  academies  and  creating  100,000  more  sixth-form  places.  It  aims  to  improve  discipline  in  schools  by  adopting  a  ""zero  tolerance""  approach  to  disruption  of  classes  and  introducing  fixed  penalty  notices  for  truants.  Labour  also  plans  to  give  head  teachers  at  groups  of  local  schools  control  over  funding  for  units  to  handle  disruptive  pupils.  |||    Parents  and  teachers  who  met  Mr  Blair  on  Tuesday  were  invited  to  the  informal  discussion  after  writing  to  their  MPs  to  raise  concerns  about  education.  It  is  the  latest  in  a  series  of  events  designed  to  show  the  prime  minister  is  speaking  directly  to  voters  in  the  run-up  to  the  election  -  and  that  he  has  not  lost  touch.  For  the  Conservatives,  shadow  education  secretary  Tim  Collins  said:  ""Mr  Blair&#191;s  government  is  all  talk.  He  must  be  judged  on  what  he  has  done  in  two  terms,  not  what  he  mendaciously  claims  he  would  do  in  a  third.  That  judgment  will  be  damning.""  The  Liberal  Democrats  are  promising  to  cut  class  sizes  for  the  youngest  children  and  ensure  all  children  are  taught  by  a  qualified  teacher  in  each  subject." 

3	"O'Connell  rejects  Lions  rumours  |||    Ireland  and  Munster  lock  Paul  O'Connell  has  dismissed  media  reports  linking  him  to  the  captaincy  of  the  Lions  tour  to  New  Zealand  this  summer.  |||    O'Connell  is  rumoured  to  be  among  the  front-runners  for  the  job,  but  says  he  is  totally  focused  on  Sunday's  Six  Nations  crunch  clash  with  England.  ""I  honestly  don't  think  about  these  reports,""  he  told  BBC  Sport.  ""The  Lions  thing  is  all  speculation  and  newspaper  talk,  nothing  more.  I  just  ignore  it  and  get  on  with  my  job.""  He  added:  ""The  only  thing  that  annoys  me  after  reading  some  reports  is  what  the  opposition  locks  think.  ""I  can  just  imagine  them  saying  'I'm  going  to  show  this  guy  what's  what  about  second  row  play'.  That's  the  one  thing  that  makes  me  cringe.""  O'Connell,  who  made  a  try-scoring  international  debut  against  Wales  two  years  ago,  is  enjoying  his  meteoric  rise  into  rugby's  shop  window  -  but  refuses  to  be  drawn  on  the  Lions.  |||    ""I  have  spoken  to  Sir  Clive  Woodward  a  few  times,  but  not  for  very  long,  certainly  nothing  about  summer  holidays,""  he  joked.  He  also  said  he  remains  wary  of  wounded  England's  abilities  coming  into  Sunday's  game  after  two  straight  defeats,  dismissing  predictions  of  a  certain  Irish  victory.  ""It's  very  dangerous  to  think  that.  This  England  team  has  so  much  experience  and  skill.  You  do  not  become  a  bad  team  overnight.  ""They  have  two  world  class  game-breakers  in  Josh  Lewsey  and  Jason  Robinson,  while  Charlie  Hodgson  is  just  ready  to  click  into  place.""  He  insisted  Ireland  will  not  make  the  mistake  of  being  over-confident.  ""That's  not  going  to  happen  in  our  squad.  No  Ireland  team  lining  up  to  play  England  will  ever  fall  into  that  trap,""  he  said.  ""Every  time  we  play  England  we  know  what  a  big  task  it  is.  Look  at  what  they  did  to  us  two  years  ago.  I  remember  that  game  all  too  well,  and  it  was  not  a  good  feeling.  ""I  came  on  as  a  replacement  and  we  were  losing  13-6,  and  ended  up  getting  hammered  42-6,  so  I  know  what  can  happen  when  England  come  to  Dublin.  ""They  could  so  easily  have  been  coming  to  Dublin  with  two  wins  and  staring  a  Grand  Slam  in  the  face  as  well.""" 

2	"New  rules  tackle  'sham  weddings'  |||    New  rules  on  marriage  for  foreign  nationals  living  in  the  UK  are  coming  into  force.  |||    From  Tuesday,  most  non-EU  citizens  will  need  Home  Office  approval  to  marry.  The  Home  Office  says  the  new  rules  are  aimed  at  reducing  the  number  of  sham  marriages,  of  which  there  are  estimated  to  be  up  to  15,000  a  year.  But  immigrants'  group  the  Joint  Council  for  the  Welfare  of  Immigrants  (JCWI)  says  the  rules  breach  human  rights  law  and  it  may  mount  a  legal  challenge.  When  the  changes  were  unveiled  last  year,  immigration  minister  Des  Browne  said:  ""Our  aim  is  to  avoid  unnecessary  disruption  of  genuine  marriages,  while  providing  firm  controls  to  prevent  abuse.""  Under  the  previous  regulations  anybody  wishing  to  get  married  in  the  UK  only  had  to  produce  evidence  they  had  been  resident  in  the  country  for  a  week  and  give  15  days  notice  of  the  wedding  at  the  local  register  office.  |||    But  from  Tuesday  all  non-EU  nationals,  apart  from  citizens  of  Switzerland,  Liechtenstein,  Iceland  or  Norway,  intending  to  wed  in  the  UK  must  either  obtain  a  visa  allowing  them  to  get  married  before  they  enter  the  country  or  apply  for  a  Home  Office  'certificate  of  marriage  approval'.  To  get  a  certificate,  costing  £135,  applicants  will  have  to  send  proof  that  they  have  a  legal  right  to  be  in  the  UK.  Those  without  a  settled  status,  such  as  asylum  seekers  awaiting  a  decision  on  their  application,  will  have  no  right  to  marry  in  the  UK.  |||    Once  they  have  the  necessary  documentation,  those  subject  to  immigration  controls  wishing  to  get  married  in  England  or  Wales  must  register  their  intention  to  marry  at  one  of  76  specially-designated  register  offices.  They  can,  however,  marry  at  the  register  office  or  church  of  their  choice.  Rhian  Beynon  of  the  JCWI  said  the  new  rules  were  ""not  proportionate""  and  ""discriminatory"".  |||    ""These  rules  means  in  some  cases  the  Home  Secretary  is  going  to  be  a  marriage  registrar  of  last  resort.  ""We're  currently  taking  a  legal  opinion  on  this.  We'll  be  looking  for  people  whose  right  to  marry  is  breached  and  we'll  be  looking  at  taking  a  case  on  this  to  the  Human  Rights  Court,""  Ms  Beynon  said.  The  new  rules  have  also  been  called  into  question  by  the  parliamentary  Joint  Committee  on  Human  Rights.  In  a  report  published  last  July  the  cross-party  committee  stated  there  was  a  ""significant  risk""  the  new  procedures  were  incompatible  with  the  right  to  marry  because  they  introduced  restrictions  which  were  ""disproportionate"".  The  committee  believed  the  new  laws  might  be  incompatible  with  the  Human  Rights  Act  on  the  grounds  of  religion,  belief  and  nationality,  the  report  added.  |||    Over  the  last  year  immigration  service  operations  against  marriages  of  convenience  have  been  stepped  up  resulting  in  a  growing  number  of  convictions.  In  January  25  people  who  took  part  in  a  sham  marriage  network  based  in  Leicester  were  jailed  for  a  total  of  35  years.  And  last  November  Samuel  Amoah,  a  Belgian  national  who  set  up  two  sham  weddings  for  couples  who  wanted  to  remain  in  the  UK,  was  jailed  for  three  years.  Several  other  cases  are  currently  going  through  the  courts.  The  role  of  registrars  who  under  the  Asylum  and  Immigration  Act  1999  were  obliged  to  report  suspected  sham  marriages  to  the  Home  Office,  has  been  key  in  many  prosecutions.  Registrars'  spokesman,  Mark  Rimmer,  said  they  welcomed  the  new  marriage  regulations  and  believed  they  would  be  an  significant  deterrent.  ""They  will  effectively  remove  most  of  the  blatant  cases.  Certainly  those  who  are  illegals  in  this  country,  of  which  we  had  quite  a  few,  will  no  longer  be  getting  married,""  Mr  Rimmer  said.  Mr  Rimmer,  the  service  director  for  registrations  of  marriages  at  Brent  Council  in  north-west  London,  said  he  did  not  consider  the  new  law  to  be  an  infringement  of  civil  liberties.  ""It  may  be  seen  to  be  far  more  draconian  than  it  has  been  but  certainly  it's  still  not  as  difficult  to  marry  in  the  UK  than  it  is  to  marry,  for  example,  in  Holland,  Germany  or  France.  ""I  think  it's  a  proportionate  response  by  government  to  what  was  a  very  large  problem,""  Mr  Rimmer  said." 

2	"Blair  to  face  MPs  amid  feud  talk  |||    Tony  Blair  faces  his  first  prime  minister's  questions  of  2005  after  a  week  of  renewed  speculation  about  his  relationship  with  Gordon  Brown.  |||    Meanwhile,  the  chancellor  is  leaving  Britain  on  a  high-profile  tour  of  Africa  to  highlight  poverty  issues.  But  before  doing  so,  he  insisted  he  still  trusted  Mr  Blair,  despite  claims  to  the  contrary  in  a  new  book.  Labour  MPs  have  warned  against  disunity  and  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  may  well  take  up  the  theme  in  the  Commons.  The  Tories  have  already  accused  the  prime  minister  and  his  chancellor  of  behaving  like  ""schoolboys  squabbling  in  a  playground"".  |||    Michael  Howard  is  likely  to  want  to  capitalise  further  on  the  spat  when  he  goes  head-to-head  with  the  prime  minister  in  the  Commons.  At  a  campaign  poster  launch  on  Tuesday,  Mr  Brown  was  joined  by  Alan  Milburn,  who  Mr  Blair  controversially  put  in  charge  of  election  planning  in  place  of  the  chancellor.  |||    Later  this  week  the  prime  minister  is  due  to  set  out  the  themes  of  his  party's  next  election  manifesto,  which  for  the  past  two  polls  have  been  drawn  up  by  the  chancellor.  Mr  Brown,  meanwhile,  is  visiting  Tanzania,  Mozambique  and  Kenya  to  highlight  the  plight  of  many  Africans  hit  by  Aids,  war  and  famine  -  issues  which  Mr  Blair  has  also  spoken  out  on.  The  prime  minister  and  chancellor  faced  backbench  discontent  at  Monday's  meeting  of  the  Parliamentary  Labour  Party  over  claims  made  in  journalist  Robert  Peston's  new  book.  Mr  Blair  told  MPs  and  peers:  ""I  know  from  everyone  here,  in  Cabinet  and  government,  nothing  is  going  to  get  in  the  way  of  a  unified  Labour  Party  with  a  unified  position  and  winning  the  third  term  people  desperately  need.""  Labour's  Paul  Flynn  said  the  pair  had  had  a  ""scorching""  from  MPs.  |||    On  Tuesday,  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Mr  Prescott  told  BBC  News:  ""They  told  us  very  clearly,  it  was  the  troops  telling  the  leaders:  get  in  line.""  The  new  book  claims  Mr  Prescott  hosted  a  dinner  in  November  2003  where  the  prime  minister  told  Mr  Brown  he  would  stand  down  before  the  next  election  because  he  had  lost  trust  over  the  Iraq  war.  Mr  Blair  then  changed  his  mind  in  June  2004,  after  Cabinet  allies  intervened  and  amid  suspicion  the  chancellor  was  manoeuvring  against  him,  writes  Mr  Peston.  In  Mr  Peston's  book  Mr  Brown  is  alleged  to  have  told  the  prime  minister:  ""There  is  nothing  you  could  ever  say  to  me  now  that  I  could  ever  believe.""" 

2	"Faith  schools  citizenship  warning  |||    Schools  must  improve  the  quality  of  citizenship  lessons  -  or  social  cohesion  and  democracy  will  suffer,  says  the  education  watchdog.  |||    Independent  faith  schools  were  singled  out  by  Ofsted  chief,  David  Bell,  for  not  doing  enough  to  promote  the  ""wider  tenets  of  British  society"".  Mr  Bell  said  Muslim,  Jewish  and  Evangelical  Christian  schools  must  be  ""intolerant  of  intolerance"".  Diversity  ""certainly  must  not  mean  segregated  or  separate"",  he  said.  Mr  Bell's  speech  called  for  a  much  greater  effort  in  all  types  of  schools  to  teach  citizenship  -  with  an  accompanying  survey  showing  that  young  people  knew  little  about  politics  and  had  no  enthusiasm  to  find  out  more.  |||    Badly-taught  citizenship  lessons  have  previously  been  criticised  by  Mr  Bell,  and  in  a  speech  to  the  Hansard  Society,  he  warned  that  it  was  failing  to  pass  on  an  understanding  of  democracy,  public  service  and  shared  values.  He  highlighted  his  particular  concern  for  citizenship  in  the  growing  number  of  independent  faith  schools  -  which  he  said  included  about  100  Muslim,  100  Evangelical  Christian  and  50  Jewish  schools.  |||    Mr  Bell  expressed  concern  about  schools  which  did  not  teach  children  enough  about  a  ""common  heritage""  and  needed  to  do  more  to  promote  principles  of  mutual  tolerance  and  social  inclusion.  ""I  worry  that  many  young  people  are  being  educated  in  faith-based  schools,  with  little  appreciation  of  their  wider  responsibilities  and  obligations  to  British  society,""  said  Mr  Bell.  The  Ofsted  chief  said  his  forthcoming  annual  report  would  make  particular  reference  to  Muslim  schools.  ""Many  must  adapt  their  curriculum  to  ensure  that  it  provides  pupils  with  a  broad  general  knowledge  of  public  institutions  and  services  in  England  and  helps  them  to  acquire  an  appreciation  of  and  respect  for  other  cultures  in  a  way  that  promotes  tolerance  and  harmony.""  Mr  Bell  said  such  questions  of  religion  and  cultural  identity  were  ""tricky  issues"".  But  he  argued  that  ""we  must  not  allow  our  recognition  of  diversity  to  become  apathy  in  the  face  of  any  challenge  to  our  coherence  as  a  nation"".  ""I  would  go  further  and  say  that  an  awareness  of  our  common  heritage  as  British  citizens,  equal  under  the  law,  should  enable  us  to  assert  with  confidence  that  we  are  intolerant  of  intolerance,  illiberalism  and  attitudes  and  values  that  demean  the  place  of  certain  sections  of  our  community,  be  they  women  or  people  living  in  non-traditional  relationships,""  said  Mr  Bell."

""Nothing  like  it  has  ever  been  seen  in  Ireland  before,""  said  Justin  Green,  spokesman  for  organisers  MCD  Promoters.  ""We  could  have  sold  a  million  tickets.""  The  Dublin  dates  on  June  24  and  25  form  part  of  the  worldwide  Vertigo  tour.  The  tour  begins  in  San  Diego  on  28  March  and  will  cover  13  US  cities.  The  band  will  also  play  24  European  gigs,  finishing  in  Lisbon  in  August.  |||    Mr  Green  said  that  ticket  outlets  had  been  ""bombarded""  by  U2  fans.  ""Unfortunately  there's  thousands  and  thousands  of  disappointed  fans  all  over  the  country  which  is  disappointing,  but  there's  only  two  dates  confirmed,""  he  said.  Many  fans  camped  on  the  streets  of  the  Irish  capital  for  three  days  to  ensure  they  were  first  in  line  at  Ticketmaster  in  St  Stephen's  Green  Shopping  Centre,  where  the  tickets  went  on  sale  on  Friday.  However  the  majority  of  tickets,  priced  at  between  59.50  and  80  euro  each,  were  sold  online.  Earlier  this  week,  Bono  announced  that  the  band  would  play  two  shows  at  the  venue,  which  holds  almost  80,000  people,  due  to  the  phenomenal  demand  for  tickets." 

1	"Hoffman  hits  out  over  modern  film  |||    Hollywood  legend  Dustin  Hoffman  has  hit  out  at  the  quality  of  current  films  and  theatre  productions.  |||    The  star  of  Rain  Man  and  Tootsie  said  the  film  culture  was  ""in  the  craphouse""  at  a  press  conference  on  Tuesday.  The  67-year-old  also  said  he  stopped  working  a  few  years  ago  because  he  lost  his  ""spark""  for  acting.  Hoffman  is  in  the  UK  to  publicise  his  new  comedy,  Meet  the  Fockers,  which  also  stars  Robert  De  Niro,  Barbra  Streisand  and  Ben  Stiller.  |||    He  said:  ""You  go  to  the  cinema  and  you  realise  you're  watching  the  third  act.  There  is  no  first  or  second  act.  ""There  is  this  massive  film-making  where  you  spend  this  incredible  amount  of  money  and  play  right  to  the  demographic.  ""You  can  tell  how  much  money  the  film  is  going  to  make  by  how  it  does  on  the  first  weekend.  ""The  whole  culture  is  in  the  craphouse.  It's  not  just  true  in  the  movies,  it's  also  true  in  the  theatre.  ""Broadway,  and  now  London  is  the  same,  special  effects  are  in  great  demand.  It's  not  a  good  time  culturally.""  |||    Hoffman  also  said  he  stopped  working  a  few  years  ago  and  moved  into  directing  and  writing.  He  said:  ""I  just  lost  that  spark  I  always  had.  ""A  couple  of  years  ago  I  didn't  like  the  parts  I  was  getting.  ""Studios  weren't  interested  in  the  kind  of  films  that  people  of  my  generation  wanted  to  see.  ""I  thought  I  would  stop  and  just  try  writing  and  directing.  I  wasn't  aware  of  the  depression  that  set  in.""  Recently,  Hoffmann  has  returned  to  film,  with  roles  in  I  Heart  Huckabees,  Finding  Neverland  and  now  Meet  the  Fockers,  which  is  the  sequel  to  Meet  the  Parents.  Meet  The  Fockers  opens  in  the  UK  on  Friday." 

0	"UK  'risks  breaking  golden  rule'  |||    The  UK  government  will  have  to  raise  taxes  or  rein  in  spending  if  it  wants  to  avoid  breaking  its  ""golden  rule"",  a  report  suggests.  |||    The  rule  states  that  the  government  can  borrow  cash  only  to  invest,  and  not  to  finance  its  spending  projects.  The  National  Institute  of  Economic  and  Social  Research  (NIESR)  claims  that  taxes  need  to  rise  by  about  £10bn  if  state  finances  are  to  be  put  in  order.  The  Treasury  said  its  plans  were  on  track  and  funded  until  2008.  According  to  NIESR,  if  the  government's  current  economic  cycle  runs  until  March  2006  then  it  is  ""unlikely""  the  golden  rule  will  be  met.  Should  the  cycle  end  a  year  earlier,  then  the  chances  improve  to  ""50/50"".  Either  way,  fiscal  tightening  is  needed,  NIESR  said.  |||    The  report  is  the  latest  to  call  into  question  the  viability  of  government  spending  projections.  Earlier  this  month,  accountancy  firm  Ernst  &  Young  said  that  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer  Gordon  Brown's  forecasts  for  tax  revenues  were  too  optimistic.  |||    It  claimed  revenues  were  likely  to  be  £6bn  below  estimates  by  the  end  of  the  tax  year  despite  the  economy  growing  in  line  with  forecasts.  A  Treasury  spokesperson  dismissed  the  latest  claims,  saying  it  was  ""on  track  to  meeting  spending  rules  and  the  golden  rule  in  the  current  cycle  and  beyond"".  ""Spending  plans  have  been  set  out  until  2008  and  they  are  fully  affordable.""  Other  than  its  warning  on  possible  tax  hikes,  the  NIESR  report  was  optimistic  about  the  state  of  the  UK  and  global  economy.  |||    It  said  the  recent  record-busting  surge  in  oil  prices  would  have  a  limited  effect  on  worldwide  expansion,  saying  that  if  anything  the  ""world  economy  will  continue  to  grow  strongly"".  Global  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  is  tipped  to  be  4.1%  this  year,  dipping  to  4%  in  2005,  before  picking  up  again  to  4.2%  in  2006.  The  US  will  continue  to  drive  expansion  until  2006,  albeit  at  a  slightly  slower  rate,  as  will  be  the  case  in  Japan.  Hinting  at  better  times  for  UK  exporters,  NIESR  said  the  euro  zone  ""is  expected  to  pick  up  speed"".  |||    Growth  in  Britain  also  is  set  to  accelerate,  it  forecast.  ""Despite  weak  growth  in  the  third  quarter,  the  forces  sustaining  the  upswing  remain  intact  and  the  economy  will  expand  robustly  in  2005  and  2006,""  NIESR  said,  adding  that  ""the  economy  will  become  better  balanced  over  the  next  two  years  as  exports  stage  a  recovery"".  GDP  is  expected  at  3.2%  in  2004,  and  2.8%  in  both  2005  and  2006.  The  main  cloud  on  the  horizon,  NIESR  said,  was  the  UK's  much  analysed  and  fretted  over  property  market." 

2	"Whitehall  shredding  increasing  -  Tories  |||    Civil  servants  have  drastically  stepped  up  the  shredding  of  official  documents,  figures  compiled  by  the  Tories  suggest.  |||    Some  government  departments  had  doubled  the  number  of  documents  being  shredded  ahead  of  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act's  implementation  on  1  January.  Departments  for  defence,  environment  and  trade,  which  had  all  increased  file  destruction,  said  they  were  following  rules  governing  public  records.  But  the  Tories  want  the  information  commissioner  to  investigate.  The  Freedom  of  Information  Act  will  for  the  first  time  give  members  of  the  public  access  to  government  records  previously  kept  secret  for  30  years.  But  BBC  Political  Correspondent  James  Hardy  said  the  prospect  of  outsiders  poking  their  noses  into  the  inner  workings  of  Whitehall  appeared  to  be  causing  jitters  among  the  mandarins.  |||    Liberal  Democrat  Alan  Beith  -  who  chairs  the  select  committee  which  monitors  the  Department  of  Constitutional  Affairs  -  said  if  the  claims  were  true,  Whitehall  was  ""acting  entirely  against  the  spirit  of  the  new  Act"".  ""Both  the  information  commissioner  and  the  select  committee  will  have  to  keep  this  issue  under  very  close  scrutiny.""  Fellow  Lib  Dem  Norman  Baker  said  the  episode  painted  an  ""unflattering  picture  of  the  inner  workings  of  government"".  ""It  is  clear  that  the  government's  initial  enthusiasm  for  open  government  has  turned  to  self-serving  cynicism.""  Dr  Julian  Lewis,  the  Conservative  spokesman  for  the  Cabinet  Office,  said  he  had  discovered  a  huge  acceleration  in  shredding  from  a  series  of  parliamentary  answers.  |||    The  Department  of  Work  and  Pensions  destroyed  nearly  37,000  files  last  year  -  up  22,000  on  four  years  ago  when  the  Act  was  passed.  The  number  of  files  destroyed  by  the  Ministry  of  Defence  and  the  departments  of  Environment,  Food  and  Rural  Affairs  and  Trade  and  Industry  has  also  risen  dramatically.  Dr  Lewis  has  called  for  an  investigation  by  the  information  commissioner  Richard  Thomas.  Earlier  this  week,  Mr  Thomas  said  he  was  looking  into  Cabinet  Office  orders  telling  staff  to  delete  e-mails  more  than  three  months  old.  He  said  he  ""totally  condemned""  the  deletion  of  e-mails  to  prevent  their  disclosure  under  freedom  of  information  laws  coming  into  force  on  1  January.  |||    Government  guidance  said  e-mails  should  only  be  deleted  if  they  served  ""no  current  purpose"",  Mr  Thomas  said.  A  Cabinet  Office  spokeswoman  said  the  move  was  not  about  the  new  laws  or  ""the  destruction  of  important  records"".  The  Freedom  of  Information  Act  will  cover  England,  Wales  and  Northern  Ireland  from  next  year.  Similar  measures  are  being  brought  in  at  the  same  time  in  Scotland.  It  provides  the  public  with  a  right  of  access  to  information  held  by  about  100,000  public  bodies,  subject  to  various  exemptions." 

0	"Dollar  hovers  around  record  lows  |||    The  US  dollar  hovered  close  to  record  lows  against  the  euro  on  Friday  as  concern  grows  about  the  size  of  the  US  budget  deficit.  |||    Analysts  predict  that  the  dollar  will  remain  weak  in  2005  as  investors  worry  about  the  state  of  the  US  economy.  The  Bush  administration's  apparent  unwillingness  to  intervene  to  support  the  dollar  has  caused  further  concern.  However,  trading  has  been  volatile  over  the  past  week  because  of  technical  and  automated  trading  and  light  demand.  This  has  amplified  reactions  to  news,  analysts  said,  adding  that  they  expect  markets  to  become  less  jumpy  in  January.  |||    The  dollar  was  trading  at  $1.3652  versus  the  euro  on  Friday  morning  after  hitting  a  fresh  record  low  of  $1.3667  on  Thursday.  One  dollar  bought  102.55  yen.  |||    Disappointing  business  figures  from  Chicago  triggered  the  US  currency's  weakness  on  Thursday.  The  National  Association  of  Purchasing  Management-Chicago  said  its  manufacturing  index  dropped  to  61.2,  a  bigger  fall  than  expected.  ""There  are  no  dollar  buyers  now,  especially  after  the  Chicago  data  yesterday,""  said  ABN  Amro's  Paul  Mackel.  At  the  same  time,  German  Chancellor  Gerhard  Schroeder  and  Italian  Prime  Minister  Silvio  Berlusconi  voiced  concerns  about  the  strength  of  the  euro.  Mr  Berlusconi  said  the  euro's  strength  was  ""absolutely  worrying""  for  Italian  exports.  Mr  Schroeder  said  in  a  newspaper  article  that  stability  in  foreign  exchange  markets  required  a  correction  of  global  economic  imbalances.  Investors  will  now  look  towards  February's  meeting  of  finance  ministers  from  the  G7  industrialised  nations  in  London  for  clues  as  to  whether  central  banks  will  combine  forces  to  stem  the  dollar's  decline." 

0	"Air  Jamaica  back  in  state  control  |||    The  Jamaican  government  is  regaining  control  of  Air  Jamaica  in  an  bid  to  help  the  ailing  company  out  of  its  financial  difficulties.  |||    The  firm  has  failed  to  make  money  since  the  state  sold  a  majority  stake  to  hotel  tycoon  Gordon  Stewart  in  1994.  In  common  with  many  carriers,  Air  Jamaica,  with  debts  of  $560m  (£291m),  has  been  hit  by  high  fuel  costs  and  the  impact  of  the  11  September  attacks.  The  company  will  be  restructured  with  the  aim  of  finding  a  new  buyer.  ""The  administration  is  committed  to  a  viable  national  airline  that  will  serve  as  a  major  catalyst  for  our  economy,""  said  Finance  Minister  Omar  Davies.  The  35-year-old  airline  transports  about  55%  of  all  passengers  to  the  island  and  its  pilots  are  reportedly  among  the  best  paid  in  the  industry,  with  senior  members  of  staff  earning  in  excess  of  $234,000  a  year." 

0	"Call  centre  users  'lose  patience'  |||    Customers  trying  to  get  through  to  call  centres  are  getting  impatient  and  quicker  to  hang  up,  a  survey  suggests.  |||    Once  past  the  welcome  message,  callers  on  average  hang  up  after  just  65  seconds  of  listening  to  canned  music.  The  drop  in  patience  comes  as  the  number  of  calls  to  call  centres  is  growing  at  a  rate  of  20%  every  year.  ""Customers  are  getting  used  to  the  idea  of  an  'always  available'  society,""  says  Cara  Diemont  of  IT  firm  Dimension  Data,  which  commissioned  the  survey.  However,  call  centres  also  saw  a  sharp  increase  of  customers  simply  abandoning  calls,  she  says,  from  just  over  5%  in  2003  to  a  record  13.3%  during  last  year.  When  automated  phone  message  systems  are  taken  out  of  the  equation,  where  customers  have  to  pick  their  way  through  multiple  options  and  messages,  the  number  of  abandoned  calls  is  even  higher  -  a  sixth  of  all  callers  give  up  rather  than  wait.  One  possible  reason  for  the  lack  in  patience,  Ms  Diemont  says,  is  the  fact  that  more  customers  are  calling  'on  the  move'  using  their  mobile  phones.  |||    The  surge  in  customers  trying  to  get  through  to  call  centres  is  also  a  reflection  of  the  centres'  growing  range  of  tasks.  ""Once  a  call  centre  may  have  looked  after  mortgages,  now  its  agents  may  also  be  responsible  for  credit  cards,  insurance  and  current  accounts,""  Ms  Diemont  says.  Problems  are  occurring  because  increased  responsibility  is  not  going  hand-in-hand  with  more  training,  the  survey  found.  |||    In  what  Dimension  Data  calls  an  ""alarming  development"",  the  average  induction  time  for  a  call  centre  worker  fell  last  year  from  36  to  just  21  days,  leaving  ""agents  not  equipped  to  deal  with  customers"".  This,  Ms  Diemont  warns,  is  ""scary""  and  not  good  for  the  bottom  line  either.  Poor  training  frustrates  both  call  centre  workers  and  customers.  As  a  result,  call  centres  have  a  high  ""churn  rate"",  with  nearly  a  quarter  of  workers  throwing  in  the  towel  every  year,  which  in  turn  forces  companies  to  pay  for  training  new  staff.  Resolution  rates  -  the  number  of  calls  where  a  customer's  query  is  resolved  to  mutual  satisfaction  -  are  running  at  just  50%.  When  the  query  is  passed  on  to  a  second  or  third  person  -  a  specialist  or  manager  -  rates  rise  to  about  70%,  but  that  is  still  well  below  the  industry  target  of  an  85%  resolution  rate.  |||    Suggestions  that  ""outsourcing""  -  relocating  call  centres  to  low-cost  countries  like  India  or  South  Africa  -  is  to  blame  are  wrong,  Ms  Diemont  says.  |||    There  are  ""no  big  differences  in  wait  time  and  call  resolution""  between  call  centres  based  in  Europe  or  North  America  and  those  in  developing  countries  around  the  world.  ""You  can  make  call  centres  perform  anywhere  if  you  have  good  management  and  the  right  processes  in  place,""  she  says.  However,  companies  that  decide  to  ""offshore""  their  operations  are  driven  not  just  by  cost  considerations.  Only  42%  of  them  say  that  saving  money  is  the  main  consideration  when  closing  domestic  call  centre  operations.  Half  of  them  argue  that  workers  in  other  countries  offer  better  skills  for  the  money.  But  not  everybody  believes  that  outsourcing  and  offshoring  are  the  solution.  Nearly  two-thirds  of  all  firms  polled  for  the  survey  have  no  plans  to  offshore  their  call  centres.  They  give  three  key  reasons  for  not  making  the  move:  |||    -  call  centre  operations  are  part  of  their  business  ""core  function"",      -  they  are  worried  about  the  risk  of  going  abroad,      -  they  fear  that  they  will  damage  their  brand  if  they  join  the  offshoring  drive.  The  survey  was  conducted  by  Sunovate  on  behalf  of  Dimension  Data,  and  is  based  on  in-depth  questionnaires  of  166  call  centres  in  24  countries  and  five  continents.  What  are  your  experiences  with  call  centres?  Are  you  happy  to  listen  to  Vivaldi  or  Greensleeves,  or  do  you  want  an  immediate  response?  And  if  you  work  in  a  call  centre:  did  your  training  prepare  you  for  your  job?" 

0	"Weak  dollar  hits  Reuters  |||    Revenues  at  media  group  Reuters  slipped  11%  during  2004,  mainly  due  to  the  weakness  of  the  dollar,  the  group  said.  |||    The  company  said  it  was  optimistic  about  growth  even  as  revenues  slipped  11%  from  £3.24bn  ($6.13bn)  in  2003  to  £2.89bn  in  2004.  Reuters  beat  profit  forecasts,  posting  a  52%  rise  in  profits  for  the  year  to  £198m  from  the  £130m  seen  a  year  earlier.  Reuters  also  beat  its  savings  target  for  2004,  delivering  £234m  of  cuts.  Under  its  three-year  Fast  Forward  turnaround  plan  it  had  aimed  to  save  £220m  during  the  12  months  to  31  December.  |||    Reuters  also  managed  to  slow  a  decline  in  underlying  revenues  to  5.4%  from  10.2%  in  2003  and  cut  its  debt  back  to  £160m  from  £610m  a  year  earlier.

""Improving  customer  relationships,  more  competitive  products  and  continued  strong  cost  discipline  position  us  well  for  2005,""  chief  executive  Tom  Glocer  said,  adding  the  company  was  beginning  ""to  look  beyond  recovery  to  growth""." 

1	"Horror  film  heads  US  box  office  |||    A  low-budget  horror  film  produced  by  Evil  Dead  director  Sam  Raimi  has  topped  the  North  American  box  office.  |||    Boogeyman,  which  focuses  on  a  man  who  returns  to  his  childhood  home  to  confront  his  traumatic  past,  took  $19.5m  (£14.9m)  in  three  days.  Last  week's  chart-topper,  the  Robert  de  Niro  thriller  Hide  and  Seek,  fell  to  number  four.  Other  new  entries  included  The  Wedding  Date,  a  comedy  starring  Will  and  Grace's  Debra  Messing,  at  number  two.  |||    The  road-trip  comedy  Are  We  There  Yet?  and  multiple  Oscar  nominee  Million  Dollar  Baby  completed  the  top  five.  Other  Oscar  contenders,  including  The  Aviator  and  Sideways,  continued  to  perform  strongly  at  the  box  office.  The  Aviator  has  taken  $75m  (£40m)  so  far,  while  Sideways  has  taken  $46.8m  (£24.8m)  in  a  more  limited  release.  |||    Boogeyman,  which  cost  just  $7m  (£3.5m)  to  make,  performed  well  even  though  it  was  not  screened  to  critics  before  release  -  normally  a  sign  that  a  film  will  get  bad  reviews  or  perform  poorly  at  the  box  office.  ""I  certainly  believe  it's  a  genre  where  people  are  going  to  be  more  moved  by  the  marketing  materials  for  the  movie  than  by  what  the  critics  say,""  said  Rory  Bruer,  head  of  distribution  for  Sony  Pictures,  which  released  the  film  in  the  US.  Overall  the  weekend  box  office  was  strong  despite  the  fact  that  it  was  American  football's  Super  Bowl  weekend  -  a  time  when  cinema  admissions  generally  fall.  This  year,  the  top  12  films  grossed  around  $91m  (£48.3m),  compared  to  2004's  Super  Bowl  weekend  when  the  total  box  office  was  $73.4m  (£38.9m)." 

2	"Tories  outlining  policing  plans  |||    Local  communities  would  be  asked  to  go  to  the  polls  to  elect  their  own  area  police  commissioner,  under  plans  unveiled  by  the  Conservatives.  |||    Party  leader  Michael  Howard  said  the  new  role  would  replace  ""inconspicuous""  police  authorities.  He  said  the  new  office  would  not  supersede  the  job  of  a  chief  constable.  The  Lib  Dems  said  the  plan  could  let  extreme  groups  run  policing,  while  Labour  criticised  ""extravagant""  Tory  promises  on  policing.  |||    Responding  to  the  plans,  the  chairman  of  the  Police  Federation  of  England  and  Wales,  which  represents  rank  and  file  officers,  said  it  was  essential  operational  independence  was  retained.  |||    Jan  Berry  said:  ""It  is  a  service,  not  a  political  football  to  be  kicked  around  every  time  an  election  approaches.  ""These  plans  could  result  in  those  with  extreme  political  views  dictating  what  actually  happens  on  the  ground,""  she  warned.  Outlining  his  crime  manifesto,  Mr  Howard  said  elected  police  commissioners  would  be  more  accountable  than  police  authorities  which  are  made  up  of  local  councillors  and  magistrates.  ""The  commissioner  will  have  the  powers  which  existing  police  authorities  have,""  he  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme.  ""The  trouble  is,  and  it's  no  reflection  on  the  people  who  are  on  the  police  authority  -  they  are  good  people  -  but  hardly  anyone  knows  who  they  are.""  Mr  Howard  said  the  authorities  were  not  ""providing  the  local  accountability  that  we  want  to  see""  and  that  elected  police  commissioners  would  be  more  visible.  |||    Critics  fear  the  move  could  hand  control  of  the  police  to  single-issue  campaigners  who  would  ignore  the  needs  of  the  wider  community.  Lord  Harris,  who  sits  on  the  executive  of  Association  of  Police  Authorities,  said  the  plans  seemed  to  suggest  chief  constables  should  be  told  what  to  do  by  a  single  politician.  ""That  is  overturning  nearly  200  years  of  the  way  in  which  we  have  organised  policing  in  this  country  to  avoid  the  politicisation  of  policing  decisions,""  he  said.  |||    Liberal  Democrat  home  affairs  spokesman  Mark  Oaten  said  the  plan  was  dangerous  and  ""could  create  conflict  between  chief  constables  and  elected  officials"".  Mr  Oaten  said  local  people  had  too  little  control  over  policing  but  a  far  better  solution  would  be  for  elected  councillors  to  draw  up  a  ""minimum  policing  guarantee""  with  their  chief  constables.  A  Labour  Party  spokesman  criticised  Michael  Howard's  record,  saying  police  numbers  had  fallen  by  1,132  when  he  was  home  secretary.  He  said:  ""Today  the  Tories  are  making  more  extravagant  promises  on  the  police  without  making  clear  how  they  would  pay  for  them,  other  than  through  fantasy  savings  to  the  asylum  system.""  The  Tories  insists  the  commissioner  role  would  not  be  like  that  of  an  American  sheriff.  Other  Tory  law  and  order  plans  include  building  more  prisons  and  making  criminals  serve  full  jail  sentences."

Clark  is  scheduled  to  welcome  in  the  New  Year  on  the  ABC  network,  a  job  he  has  done  for  33  years.  The  presenter  said  that  he  is  ""hopeful""  of  getting  better  in  time  to  lead  the  festivities  in  New  York's  Times  Square.  Clark's  publicist  Paul  Shefrin  said  the  television  host  was  ""recovering""  and  there  was  no  cause  for  alarm.  Clark,  who  produces  the  Golden  Globe  and  American  Music  Awards,  disclosed  last  year  that  he  was  suffering  from  diabetes.  |||    His  popular  music  show  American  Bandstand  was  first  broadcast  in  1952,  and  attracted  an  audience  of  20  million  people  after  it  was  picked  up  by  ABC  in  1957.  The  long-running  weekly  series,  which  featured  guests  including  Elvis  Presley,  Buddy  Holly  and  Aretha  Frankin,  came  to  an  end  in  1989.  Clark  was  inducted  into  the  Rock  and  Roll  Hall  of  Fame  in  1993  for  his  contribution  to  the  music  industry.  He  has  also  been  responsible  for  television  series  such  as  TV  Bloopers,  Celebrity  Boxing  and  drama  American  Dreams.  Clark  is  also  expected  to  act  as  executive  producer  for  the  upcoming  Golden  Globe  Awards  ceremony,  which  is  taking  place  on  16  January."

She  also  carved  out  a  successful  television  career,  appearing  for  many  years  in  ITV's  well-loved  comedy  Bless  This  House.  Rowlands  died  in  Hove  on  Saturday  morning,  her  agent  said.  |||    Born  in  January  1934,  Rowlands  won  a  scholarship  to  the  Guildhall  School  of  Speech  and  Drama  scholarship  when  she  was  just  15.  |||    After  spending  several  years  at  the  Players  Theatre  in  London,  she  made  her  film  debut  in  1963  in  Tom  Jones,  directed  by  Tony  Richardson.  She  made  her  first  Carry  On  film  in  1969  where  she  appeared  in  Carry  On  Again  Doctor.  Rowlands  played  the  hard-done-by  wife  or  the  put-upon  employee  as  a  regular  Carry  On  star.  She  also  appeared  in  Carry  On  at  your  Convenience,  Carry  On  Matron  and  Carry  On  Loving,  as  well  as  others.  |||    In  recent  years  she  appeared  in  BBC  mini-series  The  Cazalets  and  played  Mrs  Potts  in  the  London  stage  version  of  Beauty  and  the  Beast.  Agent  Simon  Beresford  said:  ""She  was  just  an  absolutely  favourite  client  She  never  complained  about  anything,  particularly  when  she  was  ill,  she  was  an  old  trouper.  ""She  was  of  the  old  school  -  she  had  skills  from  musical  theatre  and  high  drama,  that  is  why  she  worked  with  the  great  and  the  good  of  directors.  ""She  didn't  mind  always  being  recognised  for  the  Carry  On  films  because  she  thoroughly  enjoyed  making  them.  She  was  a  really  lovely  person  and  she  will  be  much  missed.""

0	"Weak  data  buffets  French  economy  |||    A  batch  of  downbeat  government  data  has  cast  doubt  over  the  French  economy's  future  prospects.  |||    Official  figures  showed  on  Friday  that  unemployment  was  unchanged  at  9.9%  last  month,  while  consumer  confidence  fell  unexpectedly  in  October.  At  the  same  time,  finance  minister  Nicolas  Sarkozy  warned  that  high  oil  prices  posed  a  threat  to  French  growth.  ""[Oil  prices]  will  weigh  on  consumer  spending  in  the  short  term,  and  potentially  on  confidence,""  he  said.  World  oil  prices  have  risen  by  more  than  60%  since  the  start  of  the  year  as  production  struggles  to  keep  pace  with  soaring  demand.  |||    Analysts  said  French  companies,  keen  to  protect  their  profit  margins  at  a  time  of  rising  energy  costs,  were  reluctant  to  take  on  extra  staff.  ""[The  unemployment  figures]  show  the  main  problem  of  the  French  economy:  we  have  growth  but  without  an  improvement  in  employment,""  said  Marc  Touati,  an  economist  at  Natexis  Banques  Populaires.  ""Politicians  must  have  the  will  and  guts  to  solve  structural  unemployment  with  thorough  reforms,  otherwise  in  five  or  ten  years,  it  will  be  too  late.""  Obligatory  employer  contributions  to  worker  welfare  programmes  mean  that  it  costs  more  to  hire  staff  in  France  than  in  many  other  European  economies.  Many  economists  have  urged  the  government  to  stimulate  employment  by  reducing  non-wage  payroll  costs,  and  by  scrapping  restrictions  on  working  hours.  The  French  statistics  agency,  INSEE,  expects  the  economy  to  grow  by  about  2.4%  this  year,  buoyed  by  strong  consumer  spending  and  business  investment.  That  is  above  the  projected  eurozone  average  of  just  above  2%." 

2	"UKIP  candidate  suspended  in  probe  |||    Eurosceptic  party  UKIP  have  suspended  a  candidate  for  allegedly  suggesting  the  criminally  insane  should  be  killed.  |||    John  Houston,  54,  was  due  to  stand  in  the  East  Kilbride  seat  in  Lanarkshire  at  the  next  election.  But  he  was  suspended  after  his  reported  views,  including  the  return  of  the  British  Empire,  were  sent  to  two  Scottish  newspapers.  UKIP  spokesman  Mark  Croucher  said  those  who  selected  Mr  Houston  knew  nothing  of  his  views.  The  episode  comes  at  a  difficult  time  for  UKIP,  soon  after  the  high-profile  departure  of  MEP  Robert  Kilroy-Silk.  Mr  Houston  is  alleged  to  have  said  that  the  organs  of  the  criminally  insane  should  be  ""made  available  to  law-abiding  members  of  the  community""  and  proposed  the  legalisation  of  drugs  and  the  sex  trade.  The  document  reportedly  said:  ""We're  looking  for  the  resurrection  of  the  British  Empire.  ""The  problems  for  the  human  race  -  environmental  and  others  -  can  only  be  dealt  with  on  a  global  scale,  and  that  calls  for  a  radical  alliance  of  the  English-speaking  nations,  which  they  are  uniquely  able  to  do.""  Mr  Croucher  said  the  main  issue  would  be  that  Mr  Houston's  reported  views  had  been  presented  as  UKIP  policy,  which  they  were  not.  He  said  they  might  have  been  submissions  to  a  committee  working  on  the  party's  manifesto,  but  would  not  have  been  matched  to  Mr  Houston  when  he  was  standing  to  become  a  candidate.  He  told  BBC  News:  ""He  appears  to  have  said  these  things.  We  have  suspended  him  as  a  member  and  as  a  candidate.  ""By  all  accounts  none  of  this  was  mentioned  at  his  selection  meeting.  ""It  is  simply  a  distraction  from  the  task  in  hand,  the  EU  constitution,  not  individual  idiocies.""  Mr  Houston  was  quoted  in  the  Herald  newspaper  saying:  ""I  feel  UKIP  have  over-reacted  and  overshot  the  runway.""  |||    Peter  Nielson,  who  is  UKIP  Scotland  chairman,  said  he  had  suspended  Mr  Houston  on  Friday  night.  ""He  will  remain  suspended  while  the  matter  is  being  investigated  and  then  we  will  decide  if  and  what  further  action  will  be  taken.""  He  said  that  any  evidence  would  be  looked  into  and  Mr  Houston  may  be  interviewed  by  the  party.  He  added:  ""I  can't  comment  too  much  at  the  moment,  I  have  one  version  from  him  but  I  haven't  seen  the  papers  yet.""" 

1	"Aviator  'creator'  in  Oscars  snub  |||    The  man  who  said  he  got  Oscar-nominated  movie  The  Aviator  off  the  ground  and  signed  up  Leonardo  DiCaprio  has  been  shut  out  of  the  Academy  Awards  race.  |||    Charles  Evans  Jr  battled  over  his  role  with  the  people  who  eventually  made  the  film,  and  won  a  producer's  credit.  But  he  is  not  on  the  list  of  producers  who  can  win  a  best  film  Oscar  due  to  a  limit  on  the  number  of  nominees.  The  Oscars  organisers  have  picked  two  of  The  Aviator's  four  producers  to  be  nominated  for  best  film.  |||    Up  to  three  producers  can  be  named  per  film  but  the  studios  behind  The  Aviator  and  Million  Dollar  Baby  failed  to  trim  their  credits  -  so  the  Academy  of  Motion  Pictures  Arts  and  Sciences  (Ampas)  has  done  it  for  them.  The  Aviator's  nominated  producers  are  Michael  Mann  and  Graham  King  -  with  Mr  Evans  and  Sandy  Climan,  Mr  Mann's  former  deputy,  left  off.  Mr  Evans  sued  Mr  Mann  in  2001,  claiming  he  came  up  with  the  idea,  spent  years  developing  it  and  persuaded  DiCaprio  to  play  Hughes  -  but  said  he  was  later  excluded  from  the  project.  The  two  sides  settled  out  of  court  in  a  deal  that  has  remained  secret  apart  from  the  fact  Mr  Evans'  name  has  appeared  as  a  producer  when  the  film's  credits  roll.  At  the  Golden  Globes,  Mr  Evans  -  who  was  named  among  the  winners  when  the  film  won  best  drama  film  -  evaded  a  security  guard  to  have  his  photo  taken  with  DiCaprio,  director  Martin  Scorsese,  Mr  Mann  and  Mr  King.  |||    Ampas  decided  to  limit  the  number  of  producers  who  could  be  nominated  after  Shakespeare  in  Love's  victory  in  1999  saw  five  producers  collect  awards.  The  eligible  names  for  The  Aviator  and  Million  Dollar  Baby  were  decided  by  Ampas'  producers  branch  executive  committee  on  Wednesday.  The  decision  also  saw  Clint  Eastwood  get  his  third  personal  nomination  for  Million  Dollar  Baby.  He  is  now  named  in  the  best  film  category  as  well  as  being  nominated  for  best  director  and  best  lead  actor.  The  Academy  Awards  ceremony  will  be  held  in  Hollywood  on  27  February.  Chinese  actress  Ziyi  Zhang,  star  of  Crouching  Tiger,  Hidden  Dragon,  Hero  and  House  of  Flying  Daggers,  is  the  latest  name  to  be  added  to  the  list  of  presenters  on  the  night." 

2	"BAA  support  ahead  of  court  battle  |||    UK  airport  operator  BAA  has  reiterated  its  support  for  the  government's  aviation  expansion  plans  to  airports  throughout  the  country.  |||    The  comments  come  a  day  ahead  of  a  High  Court  challenge  by  residents'  groups  and  local  councils  to  the  government's  White  Paper.  The  judicial  review  will  centre  on  government  plans  for  expansion  at  Heathrow,  Stansted  and  Luton  airports.  BAA,  which  operates  all  three,  said  it  was  consulting  with  local  communities.  ""We  are...consulting  on  voluntary  compensation  schemes  which  go  beyond  our  statutory  obligations,""  a  BAA  spokesman  said.  |||    Groups  challenging  the  plans  include  Stop  Stansted  Expansion,  Heathrow  anti-noise  campaigners  HACAN  Clearskies  and  the  London  boroughs  of  Hillingdon  and  Wandsworth.  At  Heathrow,  Gatwick,  Edinburgh  and  Glasgow  airports,  BAA  launched  a  series  of  consultations  on  blight  to  properties  from  the  proposed  expansion  in  September  2004,  which  will  close  next  week.  The  company  is  also  offering  to  buy  noise-hit  properties  for  an  index-linked,  unblighted  price.  Among  other  measures,  BAA  has  set  up  a  homeowner  support  scheme  for  people  living  near  Stansted,  and  has  launched  a  special  scheme  for  those  close  to  the  airport  but  far  enough  away  not  to  be  covered  by  the  homeowner  scheme.  At  Heathrow,  BAA  said  it  was  working  closely  with  all  interested  parties  to  see  how  the  strict  environmental,  air  quality  and  noise  targets  for  a  third  runway  can  be  met.  |||    At  Gatwick,  the  company  has  written  to  homes  and  business  likely  to  be  affected  by  any  extra  runway.  Stop  Stansted  Expansion  said  the  White  Paper,  published  in  December  2003,  was  ""fundamentally  flawed""  and  did  not  follow  the  proper  consultation  process.  ""We  do  not  underestimate  the  scale  of  the  challenge  before  us  because  the  courts  have  never  before  overturned  a  government  White  Paper,""  said  Stop  Stansted  Expansion  chairman  Peter  Sanders  said.  HACAN  chairman  John  Stewart  said:  ""Almost  exactly  a  year  ago  the  government  published  its  30-year  aviation  White  Paper  with  much  fanfare.  ""It  hoped  that  would  be  the  end  of  the  debate  and  it  could  proceed  with  its  plans  for  a  massive  expansion  of  aviation.  ""Yet,  a  year  later  the  protesters  are  still  here,  and  stronger  than  ever.  ""  A  judgement  from  Mr  Justice  Sullivan  is  expected  early  in  February." 

1	"Deal  to  ban  'homophobic'  reggae  |||    The  reggae  industry  is  to  refuse  to  release  or  stage  concerts  featuring  homophobic  songs  under  a  global  deal  struck  with  gay  rights  groups.  |||    A  damaging  campaign  against  stars  such  as  Beenie  Man  and  Sizzla  has  been  waged  over  lyrics  that  allegedly  call  for  gay  people  to  be  killed  or  assaulted.  The  campaign,  which  led  to  gigs  being  scrapped  and  a  UK  police  investigation,  will  now  be  dropped  under  the  truce.  Brett  Lock  of  gay  group  OutRage!  said  they  were  ""wiping  the  slate  clean"".  The  protests  had  been  led  by  the  Stop  Murder  Music  coalition,  an  umbrella  group  including  OutRage!,  the  Black  Gay  Men's  Advisory  Group  and  Jamaican  movement  J-Flag.  |||    That  coalition  has  reached  a  verbal  agreement  with  major  dancehall  reggae  record  labels  and  concert  promoters  covering  eight  of  the  scene's  biggest  stars.  But  the  artists  themselves  were  not  involved  in  the  negotiations  and  have  not  directly  signed  up.  Instead,  the  record  companies  have  pledged  not  to  release  or  re-release  any  offensive  songs  -  many  of  which  date  back  a  number  of  years.  And  it  is  believed  promoters  will  make  stars  agree  not  to  perform  such  tunes  on  stage.  ""The  reggae  industry  will  work  with  the  artists  while  still  maintaining  their  freedom  of  speech  and  artistic  freedom,""  according  to  media  and  PR  strategist  Glen  Yearwood,  who  is  representing  the  reggae  industry.  |||    The  industry  would  halt  any  attempt  by  an  artist  to  perform  or  release  a  song  inciting  violence  against  any  group  or  gender,  he  said.  ""We'll  advise  them  this  is  not  the  way  forward  in  a  civilised  society.""  The  Stop  Murder  Music  campaign  saw  protesters  picket  gigs,  resulted  in  Sizzla's  UK  tour  being  cancelled  in  November,  forced  Mobo  award  organisers  to  drop  artists  from  nominations  and  saw  Beenie  Man  dropped  from  an  MTV  show  in  August.  Police  have  also  been  investigating  whether  lyrics  incite  the  assault  and  murder  of  gay  people.  The  campaign  was  a  blow  to  the  reggae  industry,  Mr  Yearwood  admitted.  ""If  you  can't  have  major  stars  touring,  then  you  don't  sell  many  albums,""  he  said.  |||    But  the  artists  -  Beenie  Man,  Sizzla,  Elephant  Man,  Buju  Banton,  Bounty  Killer,  TOK,  Capleton  and  Vybz  Kartel  -  will  not  have  to  apologise  for  past  songs  or  comments.  OutRage!'s  Mr  Lock  said:  ""The  main  players  in  the  dancehall  reggae  industry  will  attempt  to  regulate  the  industry  themselves  to  ensure  that  there  aren't  any  violently  homophobic  or  gay-bashing  lyrics  in  the  future.  ""As  a  gesture  of  good  faith,  the  Stop  Murder  Music  coalition  has  agreed  to  suspend  our  aggressive  campaigning  against  murder  music.  ""So  we  shall  not  be  picketing  concerts  or  calling  for  prosecutions  to  give  the  industry  the  space  to  regulate  and  reform  itself.""  Record  companies  VP  and  Greensleeves,  distributor  Jet  Star  and  concert  promoters  including  Jammins  and  Apollo  Entertainment  are  all  on  board."

I  don't  like  doing  this  at  all.  I'd  like  to  thank  my  family  for  being  really  supportive  and  everybody  that  made  my  record  with  me.""  ""I  don't  even  know  what  to  do  right  now.  Thank  you  all  you  guys  for  voting  for  me,  I  feel  sick  right  now.""  Viewers  of  digital  music  TV  channel  MTV  Base  voted  Stone  the  winner  in  the  best  urban  act  category.  Ms  Stone  also  performed  her  song  Right  To  Be  Wrong,  backed  by  a  gospel  choir,  at  the  25th  award  ceremony  at  London's  Earls  Court.  Her  second  album  Mind,  Body  &  Soul  reached  number  one  in  the  UK  charts  last  October  and  went  straight  into  the  US  charts  at  number  11.  |||    The  teenager  also  has  Grammy  nominations  in  the  US,  normally  dominated  by  home-grown  acts.  Born  Jocelyn  Stoker,  the  Devon  diva  started  her  career  in  a  BBC  talent  programme,  and  was  then  discovered  at  a  New  York  audition  by  a  US  record  executive,  Steve  Greenberg.  Indie  Rock  group  Muse  consists  of  Matthew  Bellamy,  Chris  Wolstenholme  and  Dominic  Howard  who  met  in  their  early  teens  in  Teignmouth,  south  Devon.  Dominic  Howard  said  of  winning:  ""We  love  playing  live,  it's  very  important  for  our  band.  So  to  win  something  like  this  really  feels  great.""  The  trio  met  aged  13  and  formed  the  band  Gothic  Plague,  changing  its  name  to  Fixed  Penalty,  Rocket  Baby  Dolls  and  finally  Muse.  The  band  released  its  first  self-titled  EP  in  1998.  The  third  studio  album,  Absolution,  was  released  in  2003,  providing  the  hit  singles  Time  Is  Running  Out,  Hysteria,  and  Butterflies  And  Hurricanes."

Under  new  European  age  discrimination  rules,  a  default  retirement  age  of  65  will  be  introduced.  Workers  will  be  permitted  to  request  staying  on  beyond  this  compulsory  retirement  age,  although  employers  will  have  the  right  to  refuse.  Trade  and  Industry  Secretary  Patricia  Hewitt  said  people  would  not  be  forced  to  work  longer  than  they  wanted,  saying  the  default  age  was  not  a  statutory,  compulsory  retirement  age.  She  said  employers  would  be  free  to  continue  employing  people  for  as  long  as  they  were  competent.  |||    Under  age  discrimination  proposals  from  the  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry  last  year  workers  were  to  be  allowed  to  work  on  till  70  if  they  wished.  |||    Business  leaders  had  opposed  the  plan  as  they  said  it  would  be  too  costly  and  cumbersome.  The  British  Chambers  of  Commerce  welcomed  the  latest  proposal.  ""This  move  today  is  the  best  of  both  worlds,""  it  said.  ""Employers  have  the  ability  to  define  the  end  point  of  the  employer-employee  relationship  and  employees  have  flexibility  with  a  right  to  request  to  work  past  the  age  of  65.""  But  Age  Concern  said  imposing  a  retirement  age  of  65  was  ""cowardly""  and  a  ""complete  u-turn"".  ""This  makes  a  mockery  of  the  Government's  so-called  commitment  to  outlawing  ageism,  leaving  the  incoming  age  discrimination  law  to  unravel,""  said  Gordon  Lishman,  director  general  of  Age  Concern  England  .  ""It  is  now  inevitable  that  older  people  will  mount  legal  challenges  to  the  decision  using  European  law.""  The  decision  will  have  no  impact  on  the  age  at  which  workers  can  collect  their  state  pension,  the  government  has  said." 

2	"Howard  rejects  BNP's  claim  |||    Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  has  dismissed  claims  that  his  immigration  policy  was  ""moving  onto  the  turf""  of  the  British  National  Party  (BNP).  |||    BNP  leader  Nick  Griffin  told  the  Independent  he  expected  some  BNP  voters  to  switch  to  the  Tories  over  the  issue.  But  Mr  Howard  said  he  rejected  the  idea  that  the  Tories  and  BNP  appealed  to  the  same  voting  instincts.  Asked  if  he  would  welcome  BNP  voters  he  told  the  BBC:  ""I  don't  want  anybody  to  vote  for  these  extremist  parties"".  He  added,  on  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme:  ""If  you  want  good  community  relations  in  this  country...then  you  have  to  have  firm,  fair  immigration  controls.""  |||    The  Tories  have  promised  an  upper  limit  on  the  number  of  people  allowed  into  Britain  with  the  slogan:  ""It's  not  racist  to  impose  limits  on  immigration"".  All  parties  are  stepping  up  campaiging  in  the  run-up  to  the  general  election,  widely  expected  to  be  called  for  5  May.  Labour  has  unveiled  its  own  ""points  system""  for  ensuring  migrants  who  want  to  work  in  the  UK  have  skills  that  are  required,  but  have  rejected  immigration  quotas.  The  Liberal  Democrats  have  warned  both  parties  against  ""pandering  to  prejudice"".  |||    Mr  Griffin  told  the  Independent  the  Tories'  plans  were  ""a  definite  move  onto  our  turf"".  He  said:  ""I  quite  freely  accept  that  on  a  nationwide  basis,  the  Tories  will  con  enough  people  to  make  a  significant  hole  in  our  vote.""  Asked  whether  he  was  comfortable  with  the  perception  that  the  Conservatives  and  the  BNP  appeal  to  the  same  voting  instincts,  Mr  Howard  told  the  BBC:  ""I  reject  that  entirely"".  He  said  he  found  BNP's  policies  ""abhorrent""  but  he  said  the  UK  had  to  take  a  different  approach  to  immigration,  which  he  said  was  out  of  control.  ""The  government  doesn't  want  to  limit  it  in  any  way,  we  do,  there's  a  legitimate  difference  between  us  there  which  we  can  discuss  in  a  calm,  rational  and  reasonable  way,""  he  said.  He  again  rejected  newspaper  speculation  that  his  own  father  entered  Britain  illegally." 

2	"Royal  couple  watch  nation's  mood  |||    Prince  Charles  and  Camilla  Parker  Bowles  are  awaiting  the  nation's  reaction  after  announcing  they  are  to  be  married  on  8  April.  |||    Mrs  Parker  Bowles  will  take  the  title  HRH  Duchess  of  Cornwall  after  a  civil  ceremony  to  be  held  at  Windsor  Castle.  A  Daily  Telegraph  poll  of  1,313  people  suggests  two-thirds  of  Britons  support  the  couple's  decision  to  marry.  But  only  40%  think  Mrs  Parker  Bowles  should  become  Princess  Consort  as  planned  after  Charles  becomes  king.  Some  47%  believe  she  should  have  no  title,  while  7%  think  she  should  become  queen.  |||    The  poll  also  found  that  the  majority  of  Britons  would  prefer  the  monarchy  to  miss  a  generation,  with  the  Queen  handing  the  throne  to  her  grandson  Prince  William,  22,  on  her  death  or  abdication.  On  Thursday  night,  Prince  Charles,  56,  and  Mrs  Parker  Bowles,  57,  hosted  a  dinner  at  Windsor  Castle,  their  first  public  appearance  since  announcing  their  engagement.  Mrs  Parker  Bowles  said  the  prince  went  down  on  one  knee  to  propose  and  added:  ""I'm  just  coming  down  to  earth.""  She  displayed  her  diamond  engagement  ring  -  a  Royal  Family  heirloom  -  to  reporters.  Charles  said  he  and  his  wife-to-be  were  ""absolutely  delighted"".  Their  marriage  will  end  years  of  speculation  on  a  relationship  which  dates  back  to  1970.  |||    The  Queen  and  Duke  of  Edinburgh  said  the  news  had  made  them  ""very  happy"".  Princes  William  and  Harry  said  they  are  ""very  happy""  and  wish  the  couple  ""all  the  luck  in  the  future"".  The  wedding  will  be  a  civil  ceremony  followed  by  a  service  of  prayer  and  dedication  in  St  George's  Chapel  at  which  the  Archbishop  of  Canterbury,  Dr  Rowan  Williams,  will  preside.  |||    The  marriage  is  likely  to  be  a  sensitive  issue  because  Mrs  Parker  Bowles  is  divorced  and  her  former  husband  is  still  alive.  If  he  became  king,  Charles  would  be  the  supreme  governor  of  the  Church  of  England  and  some  Anglicans  remain  opposed  to  the  remarriage  of  divorcees.  ""His  divorce  from  Diana  and  the  disappointment  the  country  felt  over  how  Diana  had  been  treated...  opened  up  a  sense  of  disillusionment  with  [Prince  Charles],""  said  Ros  Coward,  who  wrote  the  authorised  biography  of  Diana,  princess  of  Wales.  The  Archbishop  of  Canterbury  said:  ""I  am  pleased  that  Prince  Charles  and  Mrs  Camilla  Parker  Bowles  have  decided  to  take  this  important  step.""  Tony  Blair  said  he  was  ""delighted""  for  the  couple  and  offered  his  congratulations,  as  did  Conservative  leader  Michael  Howard  and  Liberal  Democrat  leader  Charles  Kennedy.  Australia's  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  also  offered  his  congratulations,  adding  that  their  decision  to  marry  was  a  ""sensible  and  a  good  thing"".  Mrs  Parker  Bowles  has  joined  the  prince  at  numerous  engagements  in  recent  years  -  mostly  at  evening  events  for  The  Prince's  Trust.  Clarence  House  staff  were  at  pains  to  point  out  that  she  attended  these  events  in  a  private  capacity." 

0	"Giant  waves  damage  S  Asia  economy  |||    Governments,  aid  agencies,  insurers  and  travel  firms  are  among  those  counting  the  cost  of  the  massive  earthquake  and  waves  that  hammered  southern  Asia.  |||    The  worst-hit  areas  are  Sri  Lanka,  India,  Indonesia  and  Thailand,  with  at  least  23,000  people  killed.  Early  estimates  from  the  World  Bank  put  the  amount  of  aid  needed  at  about  $5bn  (£2.6bn),  similar  to  the  cash  offered  Central  America  after  Hurricane  Mitch.  Mitch  killed  about  10,000  people  and  caused  damage  of  about  $10bn  in  1998.  World  Bank  spokesman  Damien  Milverton  told  the  Wall  Street  Journal  that  he  expected  an  aid  package  of  financing  and  debt  relief.  |||    Tourism  is  a  vital  part  of  the  economies  of  the  stricken  countries,  providing  jobs  for  19  million  people  in  the  south  east  Asian  region,  according  to  the  World  Travel  and  Tourism  Council  (WTTC).  In  the  Maldives  islands,  in  the  Indian  ocean,  two-thirds  of  all  jobs  depend  on  tourism.  |||    But  the  damage  covers  fishing,  farming  and  businesses  too,  with  hundreds  of  thousands  of  buildings  and  small  boats  destroyed  by  the  waves.  International  agencies  have  pledged  their  support;  most  say  it  is  impossible  to  gauge  the  extent  of  the  damage  yet.  The  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  has  promised  rapid  action  to  help  the  governments  of  the  stricken  countries  cope.  |||    ""The  IMF  stands  ready  to  do  its  part  to  assist  these  nations  with  appropriate  support  in  their  time  of  need,""  said  managing  director  Rodrigo  Rato.  Only  Sri  Lanka  and  Bangladesh  currently  receive  IMF  support,  while  Indonesia,  the  quake's  epicentre,  has  recently  graduated  from  IMF  assistance.  It  is  up  to  governments  to  decide  if  they  want  IMF  help.  Other  agencies,  such  as  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  have  said  that  it  is  too  early  to  comment  on  the  amount  of  aid  needed.  There  is  no  underestimating  the  size  of  the  problem,  however.  The  United  Nations'  emergency  relief  coordinator,  Jan  Egeland,  said  that  ""this  may  be  the  worst  national  disaster  in  recent  history  because  it  is  affecting  so  many  heavily  populated  coastal  areas...  so  many  vulnerable  communities.  ""Many  people  will  have  [had]  their  livelihoods,  their  whole  future  destroyed  in  a  few  seconds.""  He  warned  that  ""the  longer  term  effects  many  be  as  devastating  as  the  tidal  wave  or  the  tsunami  itself""  because  of  the  risks  of  epidemics  from  polluted  drinking  water.  |||    Insurers  are  also  struggling  to  assess  the  cost  of  the  damage,  but  several  big  players  believe  the  final  bill  is  likely  to  be  less  than  the  $27bn  cost  of  the  hurricanes  that  battered  the  US  earlier  this  year.  |||    ""The  region  that's  affected  is  very  big  so  we  have  to  check  country-by-country  what  the  situation  is"",  said  Serge  Troeber,  deputy  head  of  the  natural  disasters  department  at  Swiss  Re,  the  world's  second  biggest  reinsurance  firm.  ""I  should  assume,  however,  that  the  overall  dimension  of  insured  damages  is  below  the  storm  damages  of  the  US,""  he  said.  Munich  Re,  the  world's  biggest  reinsurer,  said:  ""This  is  primarily  a  human  tragedy.  It  is  too  early  for  us  to  state  what  our  financial  burden  will  be.""  Allianz  has  said  it  sees  no  significant  impact  on  its  profitability.  However,  a  low  insurance  bill  may  simply  reflect  the  general  poverty  of  much  of  the  region,  rather  than  the  level  of  economic  devastation  for  those  who  live  there.  |||    The  International  Federation  of  the  Red  Cross  and  Red  Crescent  Societies  told  the  Reuters  news  agency  that  it  was  seeking  $6.5m  for  emergency  aid.  |||    ""The  biggest  health  challenges  we  face  is  the  spread  of  waterborne  diseases,  particularly  malaria  and  diarrhoea,""  the  aid  agency  was  quoted  as  saying.  The  European  Union  has  said  it  will  deliver  3m  euros  (£2.1m;  $4.1m)  of  aid,  according  to  the  Wall  Street  Journal.  The  EU's  Humanitarian  Aid  Commissioner,  Louis  Michel,  was  quoted  as  saying  that  it  was  key  to  bring  aid  ""in  those  vital  hours  and  days  immediately  after  the  disaster"".  Other  countries  also  are  reported  to  have  pledged  cash,  while  the  US  State  Department  said  it  was  examining  what  aid  was  needed  in  the  region.  Getting  companies  and  business  up  and  running  also  may  play  a  vital  role  in  helping  communities  recover  from  the  weekend's  events.  |||    Many  of  the  worst-hit  areas,  such  as  Sri  Lanka,  Thailand's  Phuket  island  and  the  Maldives,  are  popular  tourist  resorts  that  are  key  to  local  economies.  |||    December  and  January  are  two  of  the  busiest  months  for  the  travel  in  southern  Asia  and  the  damage  will  be  even  more  keenly  felt  as  the  industry  was  only  just  beginning  to  emerge  from  a  post  9/11  slump.  Growth  has  been  rapid  in  southeast  Asia,  with  the  World  Tourism  Organisation  figures  showing  a  45%  increase  in  tourist  revenues  in  the  region  during  the  first  10  months  of  2004.  In  southern  Asia  that  expansion  is  23%.  ""India  continues  to  post  excellent  results  thanks  to  increased  promotion  and  product  development,  but  also  to  the  upsurge  in  business  travel  driven  by  the  rapid  economic  development  of  the  country,""  the  WTO  said.  ""Arrivals  to  other  destinations  such  as...  Maldives  and  Sri  Lanka  also  thrived.""  In  Thailand,  tourism  accounts  for  about  6%  of  the  country's  annual  gross  domestic  product,  or  about  $8bn.  In  Singapore  the  figure  is  close  to  5%.  Tourism  also  brings  in  much  needed  foreign  currency.  In  the  short-term,  however,  travel  companies  are  cancelling  flights  and  trips.  That  has  hit  shares  across  Asia  and  Europe,  with  investors  saying  that  earnings  and  economic  growth  are  likely  to  slow." 

1	"Rapper  Kanye  West's  shrewd  soul  |||    US  hip-hop  star  Kanye  West  -  who  leads  the  race  for  this  year's  Grammys  with  10  nominations  -  rose  to  prominence  by  producing  songs  for  artists  such  as  Jay-Z  and  Alicia  Keys.  |||    He  then  emerged  from  his  behind-the-scenes  role  to  become  an  artist  as  well  as  a  producer.  But  his  solo  career  almost  ended  before  it  began  after  a  near-fatal  car  crash  left  West  with  his  jaw  wired  shut  in  2002.  The  resulting  song,  Through  the  Wire,  became  West's  first  UK  hit  in  April  2004  and  subsequent  album  The  College  Dropout  became  a  transatlantic  success,  both  critically  and  commercially.  West,  26,  began  rapping  as  a  teenager  at  his  Chicago  school,  inspired  by  the  beats  and  rhymes  of  1980s  pioneers  Run  DMC.  |||    Hip-hop  producer  No  ID  encouraged  West  to  sample  old  soul  and  R&B  hits  then  revive  them  with  an  updated  sound,  an  approach  that  would  become  his  trademark.  ""I  feel  like  a  lot  of  the  soul  that's  in  those  old  records  that  I  sample  is  in  me,""  he  said.  ""So  when  I  hear  them  and  I  put  them  with  the  drums  and  I  bring  them  to  the  new  millennium,  it's  just  like  God's  doing  that.  I'm  one  with  them  records  right  there.  It's  a  blessing.""  |||    Leaving  his  Chicago  art  school  after  only  one  year  -  a  move  which  would  later  inspire  the  title  of  his  album  -  West  began  his  music  career  co-producing  songs  for  artists  Mase  and  the  Madd  Rapper.  This  drew  the  attention  of  superstar  rapper  Jay-Z,  who  signed  West  up  to  his  Roc-A-Fella  record  label  to  produce  numerous  artists  on  his  roster.  West's  work  gained  mainstream  recognition  when  he  produced  the  singles  Takeover  and  Izzo  (HOVA)  on  Jay-Z's  own  2001  album  Blueprint.  Incorporating  samples  of  Five  to  One  by  The  Doors  and  the  Jackson  Five's  I  Want  You  Back  respectively,  the  hits  were  credited  with  injecting  soul  back  into  hip-hop.  |||    As  their  success  attracted  further  production  work  for  Jay-Z  ('03  Bonnie  &  Clyde)  and  artists  such  as  Ludacris  (Stand  Up)  and  Alicia  Keys  (You  Don't  Know  My  Name),  West  announced  plans  for  a  solo  album.  Driving  home  from  a  late-night  Los  Angeles  recording  session  in  October  2002,  he  was  involved  in  the  car  crash  that  left  his  jaw  fractured  in  three  places.  ""Anytime  I  hear  about  any  accident  my  heart  sinks  in  and  I  just  thank  God  that  I'm  still  here,""  he  later  said.  ""That  steering  wheel  could  have  been  two  inches  further  out,  and  that  would  have  been  it.""  |||    West's  account  of  the  accident  sampled  Chaka  Khan's  hit  Through  the  Fire  to  become  the  heart  of  his  completed  solo  album  The  College  Dropout.  Released  last  year,  it  was  by  turns  smooth,  humorous  and  sharp  and  largely  avoided  the  clich&#233;d  hip-hop  preoccupation  with  guns,  girls  and  jewellery.  |||    Through  the  Wire  was  quickly  joined  in  the  UK  and  US  charts  by  Slow  Jamz,  on  which  West  collaborated  with  rapper  Twista  and  Ray  actor  Jamie  Foxx.  The  College  Dropout  spawned  two  further  UK  hits  and  a  string  of  award  nominations.  West  was  shortlisted  for  10  Grammys  -  including  nominations  for  artist  and  album  of  the  year  -  and  took  the  best  hip-hop  artist,  producer  and  album  titles  at  last  year's  Music  of  Black  Origin  (Mobo)  Awards.  Now  a  respected  rapper  and  producer  in  the  influential  field  of  hip-hop,  Kanye  West  is  unlikely  to  regret  his  decision  to  leave  college  early." 

2	"Mayor  will  not  retract  Nazi  jibe  |||    London  mayor  Ken  Livingstone  has  again  refused  to  retract  a  Nazi  insult  made  to  a  Jewish  reporter.  |||    Labour's  Mr  Livingstone,  who  says  he  is  ""standing  by""  his  remarks,  had  accused  an  Evening  Standard  journalist  of  being  like  a  ""concentration  camp  guard"".  At  his  weekly  press  conference  on  Tuesday  he  said  his  comments  were  not  racist  and  refused  to  apologise.  He  said  to  media  representatives:  ""If  you  think  they  are  racist,  I  think  you  are  wrong.""  The  mayor  said  his  comments  would  not  affect  the  2012  Olympic  bid  and  added  that  his  determination  to  stand  up  for  what  he  believed  in  may  impress  bid  chiefs,  who  arrived  in  London  on  Tuesday.  ""I  think  it  is  important  that  the  IOC  (International  Olympic  Committee)  members  realise  that  when  we  get  the  games...they  have  a  mayor  who  is  not  going  to  panic,  change  course  or  get  in  a  great  flap  but  will  deliver  the  games  on  time  and  to  budget,""  he  said.  |||    On  Tuesday,  the  mayor  said  he  would  be  making  a  full  written  response  to  the  chairman  of  the  assembly.  Two  motions  were  passed  by  the  London  Assembly,  which  is  made  up  of  25  members  elected  to  examine  the  mayor's  activities,  on  Monday  asking  him  to  apologise  and  withdraw  his  comments.  The  mayor  said  he  had  recounted  to  the  assembly  a  number  of  ""examples  of  intrusion  by  journalists""  into  his,  and  his  family's  private  life.  ""I  don't  suggest  for  one  minute  that  has  anything  to  do  with  the  Holocaust  which  was  uniquely  the  most  evil  chapter  in  history.  ""But  when  reporters  say  to  me  I'm  only  doing  this  because  it's  my  job...  that's  the  same  abdication  of  moral  responsibility  at  the  thin  end  of  the  wedge  that  in  its  most  extreme  and  horrific  version  ends  up  with  others  being  prepared  to  stand  as  a  concentration  camp  guard.  |||    ""We  are  responsible  for  our  own  choices  in  this  life,  I  always  have  been  and  so  have  reporters.""  An  official  complaint  has  been  made  to  local  government  watchdogs  by  the  Board  of  Deputies  of  British  Jews,  demanding  an  investigation  by  the  Standards  Board  of  England.  It  has  the  power  to  suspended  or  bar  him  from  office  but  Mr  Livingstone  said:  ""There  must  have  been  20  instances  like  this  over  the  last  24  years.  |||    ""I  have  never  in  response  to  any  of  that  modified  a  policy  I  believed  to  be  right  or  modified  a  position  I  believed  to  be  right  and  I  don't  intend  to  now.  ""Because  if  I  do  that  effectively  you  hand  power  over  your  policies  and  position  to  the  editors  of  papers.""  On  tape  Mr  Livingstone,  who  once  worked  as  a  freelance  restaurant  critic  on  the  paper,  is  heard  asking  reporter  Oliver  Finegold  if  he  is  a  ""German  war  criminal"".  Mr  Finegold  replies:  ""No,  I'm  Jewish,  I  wasn't  a  German  war  criminal.  I'm  quite  offended  by  that.""  The  mayor  then  says:  ""Ah  right,  well  you  might  be,  but  actually  you  are  just  like  a  concentration  camp  guard,  you  are  just  doing  it  because  you  are  paid  to,  aren't  you?"""

He  objected  to  subsidies  on  agriculture  that  make  it  hard  for  developing  nations  like  India  to  compete.  He  also  called  for  reform  of  the  United  Nations,  the  World  Bank  and  the  IMF.  |||    Palaniappan  Chidambaram,  India's  finance  minister,  argued  that  these  organisations  need  to  take  into  account  the  changing  world  order,  given  India  and  China's  integration  into  the  global  economy.  He  said  the  issue  is  not  globalisation  but  ""the  terms  of  engagement  in  globalisation.""  Mr  Chidambaram  is  attending  the  G7  meeting  as  part  of  the  G20  group  of  nations,  which  account  for  two  thirds  of  the  world's  population.  At  a  conference  on  developing  enterprise  hosted  by  UK  finance  minister  Gordon  Brown  on  Friday,  he  said  that  he  was  in  favour  of  floating  exchange  rates  because  they  help  countries  cope  with  economic  shocks.  ""A  flexible  exchange  rate  is  one  more  channel  for  absorbing  both  positive  and  negative  shocks,""  he  told  the  conference.  India,  along  with  China,  Brazil,  South  Africa  and  Russia,  has  been  invited  to  take  part  in  the  G7  meeting  taking  place  in  London  on  Friday  and  Saturday.  China  is  expected  to  face  renewed  pressure  to  abandon  its  fixed  exchange  rate,  which  G7  nations,  in  particular  the  US,  have  blamed  for  a  surge  in  cheap  Chinese  exports.  ""Some  countries  have  tried  to  use  fixed  exchange  rates.  I  do  not  wish  to  make  any  judgements,""  Mr  Chidambaram  said.  Separately,  the  IMF  warned  on  Thursday  that  India's  budget  deficit  was  too  large  and  would  hamper  the  country's  economic  growth,  which  it  forecast  to  be  around  6.5%  in  the  year  to  March  2005.  In  the  year  to  March  2004,  the  Indian  economy  grew  by  8.5%."

Davis,  whose  65-year  career  included  credits  as  a  producer,  director,  actor  and  writer  for  stage  and  screen,  was  also  a  civil  rights  activist.  Miami  Beach  police  spokesman  Bobby  Hernandez  said  the  cause  of  death  appeared  to  be  natural.  |||    Davis's  body  was  discovered  by  his  grandson  and  paramedics  at  the  Shore  Club  hotel  in  Miami  Beach,  where  the  actor  had  been  shooting  the  film  Retirement.  Mr  Hernandez  said:  ""After  gaining  entry,  they  found  Mr  Davis  had  passed  away.  ""The  cause  of  death  appears  to  be  natural.  According  to  his  grandson  he  was  suffering  from  heart  disease.""  Some  of  Davis's  best  known  roles  included  The  Joe  Louis  Story  and  Gone  Are  the  Days  -  a  film  he  adapted  from  his  own  play,  Purlie  Victorious.  He  also  appeared  in  7  Spike  Lee  movies,  including  School  Daze,  Do  the  Right  Thing  and  Jungle  Fever.  |||    His  film  debut,  in  1950,  was  in  the  film  No  Way  Out,  starring  Sydney  Poitier  and  Ruby  Dee.  Davis  and  Dee  were  married  for  more  than  56  years  and  together  received  Kennedy  Center  honours  in  2004  for  their  body  of  work.  The  Actors'  Equity  Association  issued  a  statement  calling  Davis  ""an  icon  in  the  American  theatre""  and  he  and  Dee  ""American  treasures"".  Davis  was  also  a  prominent  figure  in  the  civil  rights  movement  and  was  a  voice  for  racial  equality.

He  said  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  had  made  him  deputy  party  leader  of  Veritas,  Latin  for  truth.  Sources  close  to  Mr  Hockney  said  around  eight  other  members  of  London  UKIP  were  also  planning  to  jump  ship.  |||    Details  of  the  coming  week's  events  were  hammered  out  at  a  meeting  at  Mr  Kilroy-Silk's  Buckinghamshire  home  on  Sunday,  the  BBC  News  Website  was  told.  The  news  came  after  UKIP  suspended  a  candidate  for  allegedly  suggesting  the  criminally  insane  should  be  killed.  John  Houston,  54,  was  due  to  stand  in  the  East  Kilbride  seat  in  Lanarkshire  at  the  next  election.  A  spokesman  for  UKIP  called  on  Mr  Hockney  to  quit  the  London  Assembly.  UKIP  asserts  that  Mr  Hockney  ""has  a  moral  obligation,  if  not  a  legal  one""  to  stand  down.  Mr  Hockney  meanwhile  told  the  BBC:  ""I  believe  that  Robert  Kilroy-Silk  can  deliver  better  as  a  leader  of  a  eurosceptic  party  than  the  current  leadership  of  the  UK  Independence  Party.""  |||    On  the  suspension  of  Mr  Houston,  UKIP  said  those  who  selected  him  knew  nothing  of  his  views.  Mr  Houston  is  alleged  to  have  said  that  the  organs  of  the  criminally  insane  should  be  ""made  available  to  law-abiding  members  of  the  community""  and  proposed  the  legalisation  of  drugs  and  the  sex  trade.  |||    The  document  reportedly  said:  ""We're  looking  for  the  resurrection  of  the  British  Empire.  ""The  problems  for  the  human  race  -  environmental  and  others  -  can  only  be  dealt  with  on  a  global  scale,  and  that  calls  for  a  radical  alliance  of  the  English-speaking  nations,  which  they  are  uniquely  able  to  do.""  UKIP  spokesman  Mark  Croucher  said  the  main  issue  would  be  that  Mr  Houston's  reported  views  had  been  presented  as  UKIP  policy,  which  they  were  not."

The  sound  of  a  mobile  phone  or  a  pager  can  result  in  a  strong  rebuke  from  either  the  Speaker  or  his  deputies.  The  Speaker  chairs  debates  in  the  Commons  and  is  charged  with  ensuring  order  in  the  chamber  and  enforcing  rules  and  conventions  of  the  House.

Russia's  newspapers  claimed  that  Baikal  was  a  front  for  gas  monopoly  Gazprom,  which  had  been  expected  to  win.  The  sale  has  destroyed  Yukos,  once  the  owner  of  Yuganskneftegas,  said  founder  Mikhail  Khodorkovsky.  ""Yuganskneftegas  has  been  sold  in  the  best  traditions  of  the  90s.  The  authorities  have  made  themselves  a  wonderful  Christmas  present  -  Russia's  most  efficient  oil  company  has  been  destroyed,""  the  Interfax  news  agency  quoted  Mr  Khodorkovsky  as  saying  via  his  lawyers.  |||    Gazprom  had  been  expected  to  win  the  auction  but  is  thought  to  have  failed  to  get  finance  for  the  deal  after  a  US  court  injunction  barred  it  from  taking  part.  Last  week,  Yukos  filed  for  Chapter  11  bankruptcy  protection  in  the  US  in  a  last-ditch  attempt  to  hang  on  to  Yuganskneftegas,  which  accounts  for  60%  of  its  output.  A  US  judge  banned  Gazprom  from  taking  part  in  the  auction  and  barred  international  banks  from  providing  the  firm  with  cash.  ""They  screwed  up  the  financing,""  said  Ronald  Smith,  an  analyst  at  Renaissance  Capital  in  Moscow.  ""And  Gazprom  doesn't  have  this  sort  of  money  lying  around.""  |||    Gazprom  has  denied  that  it  is  behind  the  purchase.  ""It  is  a  front  for  somebody  but  not  necessarily  for  Gazprom,""  said  Oleg  Maximov,  an  analyst  at  Troika  Dialog  in  Moscow.  ""We  don't  know  if  this  company  is  linked  100%  to  Gazprom.  |||    ""We  tried  to  find  it,  but  we  couldn't  and  as  far  as  I  know,  the  papers  had  the  same  result.""  The  sale  has  however  bought  time  for  Gazprom  to  raise  the  money  needed  for  the  purchase,  analysts  said.  One  scenario  is  that  Baikal  will  not  pay  when  it  is  supposed  to  in  two  weeks  time,  putting  Yuganskneftegas  back  in  the  hands  of  bailiffs  and  back  within  the  reach  of  Gazprom.  Yukos  is  not  planning  on  letting  go  of  its  unit  without  a  fight  and  has  threatened  legal  action  against  any  buyer.  Menatep,  Yukos  main  shareholders'  group,  has  also  threatened  legal  action.  Yukos  claims  that  it  is  being  punished  for  the  political  ambitions  of  its  founder,  Mikhail  Khodorkovsky,  who  is  now  in  jail  facing  separate  fraud  charges.  It  has  been  hit  with  more  than  $27bn  in  taxes  and  fines  and  many  observers  now  say  that  the  break  up  of  the  firm  that  accounts  for  20%  of  Russia's  oil  output  is  inevitable."

With  its  shares  closing  Tuesday  at  873p,  Bracknell-based  Exel  is  currently  valued  at  £2.6bn  ($6.3bn).  |||    Exel  employs  109,000  people  in  more  than  120  countries  and  has  itself  been  active  in  the  consolidation  of  the  logistics  sector,  paying  £328m  to  buy  fellow  UK  firm  Tibbett  &  Britten  last  August.  Its  customers  include  Boots,  Burberry,  Mothercare  and  consumer  products  giant  Procter  &  Gamble.  Andrew  Beh,  of  brokers  ING,  said  UPS  and  Deutsche  Post  were  the  most  likely  bidders  and  an  offer  of  950p  a  share  would  be  fair  if  a  bidding  battle  did  not  break  out.  ""It's  a  great  strategic  fit  for  both  companies,""  he  said.  ""Both  are  interested  in  expanding  in  logistics  and  you  can  make  a  decent  case  for  cost  synergies  which  could  justify  the  premium  and  that's  before  you  make  any  argument  about  revenue  synergies.""" 

2	"Nat  Insurance  to  rise,  say  Tories  |||    National  Insurance  will  be  raised  if  Labour  wins  the  next  election,  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  has  claimed.  |||    Tony  Blair  has  said  he  does  not  want  higher  tax  rates  for  top  earners  but  on  Wednesday  said  other  tax  promises  would  be  left  to  Labour's  manifesto.  Prime  minister's  questions  also  saw  Mr  Blair  predict  that  new  plans  would  probably  cut  net  immigration.  He  attacked  Tory  plans  to  process  asylum  claims  abroad  -  but  Mr  Howard  said  Labour  had  proposed  the  idea  too.  |||    The  Commons  questions  session  again  saw  the  leaders  of  the  two  biggest  parties  shape  up  for  the  forthcoming  election  campaign.  The  Tories  have  promised  £4bn  in  tax  cuts  but  have  yet  to  say  where  they  will  fall.  Mr  Howard  pointed  to  the  Institute  for  Fiscal  Studies'  predictions  that  Labour  will  need  to  increase  taxes  to  cover  an  £11bn  gap  in  its  spending  plans.  He  accused  ministers  of  wasting  money  on  unsuccessful  attempts  to  curb  bad  behaviour  and  truancy  in  schools  and  on  slow  asylum  processing.  It  was  no  good  Mr  Blair  claiming  tax  pledges  were  being  left  to  the  manifesto  as  he  had  given  one  to  MPs  on  Tuesday  about  the  top  rate  of  income  tax,  argued  Mr  Howard.  Pointing  to  national  insurance,  he  added:  ""Everyone  knows  tax  will  go  up  under  Labour:  isn't  it  now  clear  which  tax  it  would  be?""  |||    Mr  Blair  instead  hailed  Labour's  achievement  in  using  a  strong  economy  to  invest  in  public  services.  ""When  we  have  money  not  only  going  into  extra  teachers  and  nurses  but  equipment  in  schools  and  hospitals,  that  money  is  not  wasted,""  he  said.  On  the  tax  questions,  he  added:  ""We  will  make  commitments  on  tax  at  the  time  of  the  manifesto.""  Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  this  week  published  plans  for  a  new  points  system  for  economic  migrants,  with  only  high-skilled  workers  allowed  into  the  UK  from  outside  the  European  Union.  |||    Mr  Blair  said  abuses  would  be  weeded  out  and  chain  migration,  where  families  automatically  get  the  right  to  settle  with  immigrant  workers,  would  end.  That  would  probably  create  a  fall  in  the  migrant  numbers,  he  said.  The  prime  minister  ridiculed  the  Tory  plans  for  asylum  quotas  and  for  processing  all  asylum  claims  overseas.  He  challenged  the  Tories  on  which  country  would  house  their  processing  centres  -  what  he  called  a  ""fantasy  island"".  Mr  Howard  read  from  a  letter  about  the  government's  own  plans  at  the  European  Council  of  Ministers  for  processing  asylum  seekers  outside  the  EU.  But  Mr  Blair  said:  ""All  the  other  countries  could  not  agree  on  the  way  forward,  nor  could  the  UN."""

Analysts  believe  other  sporting  goods  companies  may  now  take  a  closer  look  at  Rossignol,  prompting  an  auction  and  pushing  the  sale  price  higher.

European  sporting  goods  companies  have  seen  foreign  revenues  squeezed  by  a  slump  in  the  value  of  the  US  dollar,  making  a  takeover  more  attractive,  analysts  said.  Companies  such  as  Quiksilver  would  be  able  to  cut  costs  by  selling  Rossignol  skis  through  their  shops,  they  added.  The  Boix-Vives  family  is  thought  to  have  spent  the  past  couple  of  years  sounding  out  possible  suitors  for  Rossignol,  which  also  makes  golf  equipment,  snowboards  and  sports  clothing."

The  company  also  cited  difficult  trading  conditions  and  a  lack  of  demand  for  goods  such  as  its  Slimfast  range.  Unilever,  which  owns  brands  including  Dove  soap,  said  annual  pre-tax  profit  fell  36%  to  2.9bn  euros  (£1.99bn).  Shares  fell  1%  to  510.75  pence  in  London,  and  dropped  by  1.2%  to  50.50  euros  in  Amsterdam.  |||    Under  the  restructuring  plans,  Patrick  Cescau,  the  UK-based  co-chairman,  will  become  group  chief  executive.

""We  are  leaving  behind  one  of  the  key  features  of  Unilever's  governance  but  this  is  a  natural  development  following  the  changes  introduced  last  year.""  The  company,  which  has  had  dual  headquarters  in  Rotterdam  and  London  since  1930,  will  announce  the  location  of  its  head  office  at  a  later  date.  Unilever  is  not  alone  in  trying  to  simplify  its  business.  Oil  giant  Shell  last  year  dismantled  its  dual-ownership  structure,  after  a  series  of  problems  relating  to  the  size  of  its  oil  reserves  that  hammered  its  share  price  and  led  to  the  resignation  of  key  board  members.  ""The  best  part  of  the  news  this  morning  was  that  the  company  announced  a  structure  simplification,""  said  Arjan  Sweere,  an  analyst  at  Petercam.  |||    The  company  said  the  organizational  changes  would  speed  decision  making,  and  it  also  may  make  further  changes.  |||    The  company  said  its  main  focus  will  be  on  improving  profits,  and  it  is  planning  to  accelerate  and  increase  investment  in  its  400  main  brands.  ""While  it  is  certainly  the  case  that  markets  have  been  tougher  in  the  past  eighteen  months  than  we  had  expected,  we  have  also  lost  some  market  share,""  said  Mr  Cescau.  ""We  let  a  range  of  targets  limit  our  ability  flexibility  and  did  not  adjust  our  plans  quickly  enough  to  a  more  difficult  business  environment.""  ""Our  objective  is  to  reverse  the  share  loss  that  we  experienced  in  some  markets  in  2004  and  return  to  growth.""  |||    Unilever  said  European  sales  fell  2.8%  last  year,  dragged  down  by  below  part  sales  at  its  beverage  division,  where  revenues  dipped  by  almost  4%.  |||    Sales  of  ice  cream  and  frozen  food  dipped  by  3.4%  In  the  US  last  year,  revenue  grew  by  1.5%  ""despite  disappointing  sales  in  Slimfast"",  the  company  said.  In  Asia,  leading  products  came  under  ""attack""  from  rivals  such  as  Procter  &  Gamble.  Unilever  took  a  1.5bn  euro  one-time  charge  in  the  fourth  quarter,  including  a  650m  euro  write-down  on  Slimfast  diet  foods.  Sales  of  Slimfast  products  have  been  hit  in  recent  years  by  the  popularity  of  the  Atkins  diet.  But  looking  ahead,  Unilever  said  it  was  optimistic  about  prospects  for  its  slimming  products  saying  that  demand  is  on  the  wane  for  rival  low-carbohydrate  diets.  The  company  also  said  it  planned  to  spend  500m  euros  this  year  buying  back  shares."

Parmalat  was  placed  into  bankruptcy  protection  in  2003  after  a  14bn  euro  black  hole  was  found  in  its  accounts.  More  than  130,000  people  lost  money  following  the  firm's  collapse.  Mr  Tanzi,  66,  issued  a  statement  through  his  lawyer  after  five  hours  of  questioning  by  prosecutors  in  Parma  on  15  January.  |||    Prosecutors  are  seeking  indictments  against  Mr  Tanzi  and  28  others  -  including  several  members  of  his  family  and  former  Parmalat  chief  financial  officer  Fausto  Tonna  -  for  alleged  manipulation  of  stock  market  prices  and  making  misleading  statements  to  accountants  and  Italy's  financial  watchdog.  Two  former  Parmalat  auditors  will  stand  trial  later  this  month  for  their  role  in  the  firm's  collapse.  |||    ""I  apologise  to  all  who  have  suffered  so  much  damage  as  a  result  of  my  schemes  to  make  my  dream  of  an  industrial  project  come  true,""  Mr  Tanzi's  statement  said.  ""It  is  my  duty  to  collaborate  fully  with  prosecutors  to  reconstruct  the  causes  of  Parmalat's  sudden  default  and  who  is  responsible.""  Mr  Tanzi  spent  several  months  in  jail  in  the  wake  of  Parmalat's  collapse  and  was  kept  under  house  arrest  until  last  September.  Parmalat  is  now  being  run  by  a  state  appointed  administrator,  Enrico  Bondi,  who  has  launched  lawsuits  against  80  banks  in  an  effort  to  recover  money  for  the  bankrupt  company  and  its  shareholders.  He  has  alleged  that  these  companies  were  aware  of  the  true  state  of  Parmalat's  finances  but  continued  to  lend  money  to  the  company.  The  companies  insist  they  were  the  victims  of  fraudulent  book-keeping.  Parmalat  was  declared  insolvent  after  it  emerged  that  4  billion  euros  (£2.8bn;  $4.8bn)  it  supposedly  held  in  an  offshore  account  did  not  in  fact  exist.  The  firm's  demise  sent  shock  waves  through  Italy,  where  its  portfolio  of  top-selling  food  brands  and  its  position  as  the  owner  of  leading  football  club  Parma  had  turned  it  into  a  household  name." 

1	"Sir  Paul  rocks  Super  Bowl  crowds  |||    Sir  Paul  McCartney  wowed  fans  with  a  live  mini-concert  at  American  football's  Super  Bowl  -  and  avoided  any  Janet  Jackson-style  controversies.  |||    The  62-year-old  sang  Hey  Jude  and  other  Beatles  songs  in  a  12-minute  set  at  half-time  during  the  game  in  Florida.  Last  year,  Jackson  exposed  a  breast  during  a  dance  routine,  causing  outrage  among  millions  of  TV  viewers  and  landing  the  CBS  TV  network  a  fine.  Sir  Paul,  however,  did  nothing  more  racy  than  remove  his  jacket  as  he  sang.  Organisers  were  widely  considered  to  be  playing  it  safe  this  year  by  booking  62-year-old  Sir  Paul  for  his  second  Super  Bowl  show.  |||    Three  years  ago,  he  was  invited  to  perform  at  the  first  Super  Bowl  after  the  September  11  attacks  and  performed  his  specially-written  song  Freedom.  This  time,  he  started  off  the  show,  at  the  Alltel  Stadium  in  Jacksonville,  Florida,  with  the  Beatles  numbers  Drive  My  Car  and  Get  Back.  He  then  performed  a  mellow  version  of  Live  And  Let  Die,  the  James  Bond  theme  he  recorded  with  the  band  Wings.  Finally,  he  closed  the  show  with  a  rousing  version  of  Hey  Jude.  The  former  Beatle  resisted  any  temptation  to  refer  to  Janet  Jackson's  headline-grabbing  performance  last  year,  instead  keeping  banter  between  songs  to  a  minimum  in  order  to  squeeze  as  much  music  as  he  could  into  his  slot.  The  singer  removed  his  black  jacket  halfway  through  the  show  -  but  any  fans  hoping  for  a  second  ""Nipple-gate""  were  to  be  disappointed  as  he  kept  his  red  sweatshirt  on  underneath.  |||    Earlier,  the  Black  Eyed  Peas  and  Alicia  Keys  had  provided  the  night's  other  high-profile  entertainment  by  performing  in  a  pre-game  show.  Black  Eyed  Peas  singer  Fergie  was  dressed  in  a  tight  orange  top  and  purple  hotpants,  but  nothing  in  her  performance  was  likely  to  upset  TV  watchdogs.  After  the  controversy  last  year  -  which  saw  CBS  fined  a  record  $550,000  (£292,000)  by  federal  regulators  -  Super  Bowl  organisers  had  turned  to  producer  Don  Mischer  to  oversee  this  year's  half-time  show.  His  previous  production  credits  included  Olympic  opening  and  closing  ceremonies.  The  Super  Bowl  is  watched  by  an  audience  of  144.4  million  in  the  US,  with  many  of  the  people  watching  are  said  to  tune  in  specifically  to  see  the  entertainment  put  on  around  the  event.  Michael  Jackson,  Aerosmith,  Diana  Ross,  Gloria  Estefan  and  Phil  Collins  are  among  the  stars  who  have  previously  graced  the  Super  Bowl  stage." 

0	"Ukraine  trims  privatisation  check  |||    Ukraine  is  to  review  ""dozens""  of  state  asset  sales  as  the  country's  new  administration  tackles  corruption.  |||    The  figure  announced  by  President  Viktor  Yushchenko  is  less  than  the  3,000  cases  mentioned  last  week,  but  will  cover  many  of  the  biggest  deals.  Ukraine  recently  ousted  long-serving  leader  Leonid  Kuchma  and  has  said  it  wants  closer  European  Union  links.  In  a  separate  statement,  the  EU  said  that  the  US  should  back  Ukraine's  entry  into  the  World  Trade  Organisation.  The  comments  came  as  Viktor  Yushchenko  prepared  to  head  to  Brussels  to  meet  with  US  President  George  W  Bush  and  other  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organisation  (Nato)  leaders.  He  is  the  only  non-Nato  member  leader  invited  to  attend  the  summit.  |||    Mr  Yushchenko  recently  defeated  Moscow-backed  presidential  candidate  and  Prime  Minister  Viktor  Yanukovych  at  the  polls,  and  has  made  no  secret  of  his  wish  to  fight  corruption  and  make  Ukraine  more  transparent.  |||    Earlier  this  month,  new  Prime  Minister  Yulia  Tymoshenko  said  as  many  as  3,000  firms  may  have  their  privatisations  put  under  the  spotlight.  Her  comments  raised  concerns  among  a  number  of  investors  and  Mr  Yushchenko  was  seen  on  Monday  as  trying  to  soothe  their  frayed  nerves.  ""We  acknowledge  that  business  in  Ukraine  is  now  shaped  and  98%  of  privatisations  were  carried  out  according  to  the  law,""  Mr  Yushchenko  said  on  Monday.  ""We  have  trust  in  this  business  and  want  to  defend  it  by  law,""  he  continued,  adding  that  any  review  would  focus  on  ""dozens  of  companies,  not  hundreds  or  thousands"".  He  cited  last  year's  sale  of  Ukrainian  steel  producer  Krivorizhstal  as  one  that  had  raised  concerns.  It  was  sold  in  June  2004  to  a  consortium  that  included  Viktor  Pinchuk,  son-in-law  of  former-President  Kuchma,  and  Rinat  Akhmetov,  the  country's  richest  man,  for  $800m  (£424m)  -  despite  other  higher  offers.  |||    Vice-Prime  Minister  Oleg  Rybachuk  called  on  the  EU  to  recognise  the  steps  that  Ukraine  was  taking,  fearing  that  should  the  country  not  be  rewarded  for  its  efforts  there  may  be  a  backlash  against  closer  relations  with  Brussels.  He  said  that  while  he  understood  that  Ukraine  was  not  ready  for  EU  membership,  the  country  needed  to  see  progress  on  topics  such  as  trade  and  visa  requirements.  ""We  deserve  an  honest  response,""  Mr  Rybachuk  told  the  Associated  Press  in  an  interview.  ""We  understand  the  difficulties.  We  refuse  to  understand  double  standards.""  Ukraine  may  find  it  has  a  sympathetic  ear  in  Brussels  ""The  EU  has  reiterated  that  we  support  (Ukraine's)  fast  accession  to  the  WTO  and  if  possible  we  would  like  that  to  happen  some  time  during  the  year,""  said  Claude  Veron-Reville,  a  spokesman  for  EU  trade  commissioner  Peter  Mandelson.  ""We  have  said  as  much  to  the  Americans.  We  feel  that  it  is  important  for  us  all  to  pull  together  for  Ukraine  to  be  allowed  into  the  WTO.  Mr  Yushchenko  was  careful  not  to  turn  his  back  on  Russia,  which  borders  the  country  to  the  east,  saying  it  was  important  to  maintain  'pragmatic'  ties  with  Moscow.  ""Russia  is  Ukraine's  eternal  strategic  partner,""  Mr  Yushchenko  said." 

3	"Moya  clinches  Cup  for  Spain  |||    Spain  won  the  Davis  Cup  for  the  second  time  in  their  history  when  Carlos  Moya  beat  the  USA's  Andy  Roddick  in  the  fourth  rubber  in  Seville.  |||    Moya  won  6-2  7-6  (7-1)  7-6  (7-5)  to  give  the  hosts  an  unassailable  3-1  lead  with  only  one  singles  rubber  remaining.  Roddick  battled  hard  and  had  chances  in  the  second  set,  but  Moya's  clay-court  expertise  proved  the  difference.  Mardy  Fish  beat  Tommy  Robredo  7-6  (8-6)  6-2  in  the  final  dead  rubber  to  cut  Spain's  winning  margin  to  3-2.  Spain's  only  other  Davis  Cup  title  came  in  2000,  when  they  beat  Australia  in  Barcelona.  This  time  they  chose  to  play  the  final  in  Seville  and  the  city's  Olympic  Stadium  was  revamped  to  allow  for  a  record  crowd  for  a  competitve  tennis  event  of  27,000  spectators.  And  the  home  fans  gave  vociferous  support  to  their  players,  with  18-year-old  Nadal  and  Moya  winning  both  Friday's  singles  rubbers.  American  twins  Mike  and  Bob  Bryan  gave  the  visitors  hope  with  victory  over  Juan  Carlos  Ferrero  and  Tommy  Robredo  in  Saturday's  doubles.  But  it  remained  an  uphill  task  for  a  US  team  far  happier  on  hard  courts  than  clay,  and  1998  French  Open  champion  Moya  had  too  much  for  world  number  two  Roddick.  ""This  has  been  incredible  -  the  moment  I've  been  waiting  for  for  years,""  said  Moya,  who  missed  out  in  2000  through  injury.  ""I've  prepared  myself  for  this  day.  I  knew  that  playing  on  clay  I  would  have  my  chances  to  win.  |||    ""The  Davis  Cup  is  my  dream.  I  can't  ask  for  more.  There  is  nothing  bigger  than  what  I've  lived  today.""  Moya  stormed  into  a  4-0  lead  on  his  way  to  taking  the  first  set  against  Roddick  and  recovered  immediately  from  dropping  serve  in  the  second.  The  match  came  down  to  two  tie-breaks  and  Moya  dominated  both,  clinching  victory  on  his  third  match  point.  Wild  celebrations  followed,  with  an  emotional  Moya  congratulated  by  his  team-mates,  including  Nadal,  who  at  18  years  and  187  days  becomes  the  youngest  ever  victor  in  Davis  Cup  history.  ""I  think  we  put  up  a  better  fight  here  than  in  Paris  two  years  ago,""  said  Roddick,  who  was  on  the  US  team  which  lost  to  France  in  the  2002  semi-finals  at  Roland  Garros.  ""They  were  just  better  than  us  this  weekend.  I  have  nothing  to  be  ashamed  of,  I  gave  it  my  all.  ""I  am  not  going  to  walk  out  of  here  with  my  head  down,  that's  for  sure.  ""There's  no  miracle  answer.  We  have  to  improve.""" 

2	"Taxes  must  be  trusted  -  Kennedy  |||    Public  trust  in  taxes  is  breaking  down  because  Labour  and  Tories  are  not  being  straight  with  people  on  the  issue,  Lib  Dem  leader  Charles  Kennedy  has  said.  |||    A  day  ahead  of  the  government's  pre-Budget  report,  Mr  Kennedy  used  a  speech  to  say  his  party  was  facing  up  to  ""painful  economic  realities"".  He  said  the  current  level  of  taxation  was  about  right,  although  he  would  put  a  new  50%  tax  on  top  earners.  Other  parties  have  accused  the  Lib  Dems  of  making  uncosted  promises.  Mr  Kennedy  made  it  clear  he  was  determined  to  counter  that  accusation.  The  Lib  Dems  have  already  published  what  they  say  are  the  full  costings  for  all  their  plans  and  Wednesday's  speech  did  not  announce  new  policies.  |||    Speaking  at  the  Commonwealth  Club,  Mr  Kennedy  said  it  was  critical  for  a  political  party  to  have  economic  credibility,  both  on  what  it  promised  and  what  it  was  expected  to  deliver.  He  said.  ""Budgets  have  to  add  up.  Tough  choices  are  needed  in  public  spending.""  The  Lib  Dems  would  cut  ""low  priority""  spending,  including  the  government's  ID  cards  scheme  and  the  Child  Trust  Fund.  |||    Those  cutbacks  would  free  up  funds  for  increasing  basic  state  pensions  for  over-75s,  putting  more  police  on  the  streets  and  reintroducing  fee  eye  and  dental  checks,  he  said.  The  Lib  Dems  argue  they  were  honest  about  taxes  in  the  past  by  calling  for  a  1p  rise  on  income  tax.  Now  they  say  the  only  simple  tax  rise  they  want  is  a  new  50%  tax  band  for  top  earners  to  pay  for  scrapping  university  tuition  fees,  providing  free  personal  care  for  elderly  and  disabled  people  and  keeping  local  taxes  down.  There  would  also  be  a  local  income  tax  to  replace  council  tax  and  a  number  of  changes  to  environmental  taxes  to  ensure  it  is  the  ""polluter  who  pays"".  |||    The  Lib  Dems  say  the  Tories  have  only  laid  out  possible  options  for  cutting  taxes  to  grab  headlines  while  Labour  has  hidden  most  of  its  tax  rises.  Mr  Kennedy  said:  ""That  contract  with  the  people  -  that  the  government  will  only  tax  fairly  and  will  spend  their  money  wisely  -  can  only  be  sustained  if  the  political  parties  are  straightforward  about  their  plans.  ""With  the  stealth  tax  strategy  of  Gordon  Brown,  the  obvious  unfairness  of  our  current  tax  system  -  especially  the  council  tax,  and  the  empty  promises  of  the  Conservative  party  on  this  issue  -  it  is  no  wonder  that  trust  in  taxation  is  breaking  down.""  He  challenged  the  Treasury  to  open  up  its  books  so  the  National  Audit  Office  can  report  on  the  government's  performance.  |||    Conservative  co-chairman  Liam  Fox  said:  Liam  Fox  said  ""If  Charles  Kennedy  is  serious  about  making  his  budgets  add  up  he  should  start  by  explaining  how  they  would  fund  their  100  spending  commitments.  ""The  reality  is,  the  Lib  Dems  lack  the  courage  to  tackle  waste  and  bureaucracy,  and  the  only  people  who  would  face  'tough  choices'  would  be  the  families  who  would  be  £630  worse  off  a  year.  ""  And  Chancellor  Gordon  Brown  said  the  Lib  Dem  figures  did  not  add  up.  He  accused  the  party  of  claiming  it  would  spend  less  while  across  the  country  committing  itself  to  spend  more." 

0	"LSE  'sets  date  for  takeover  deal'  |||    The  London  Stock  Exchange  (LSE)  is  planning  to  announce  a  preferred  takeover  by  the  end  of  the  month,  newspaper  reports  claim.  |||    The  Sunday  Telegraph  said  the  LSE's  plan  was  further  evidence  it  wants  to  retain  tight  control  over  its  destiny.  Both  Deutsche  Boerse  and  rival  Euronext  held  talks  with  the  London  market  last  week  over  a  possible  offer.  A  £1.3bn  offer  from  Deutsche  Boerse  has  already  been  rejected,  while  Euronext  has  said  it  will  make  an  all  cash  bid.  Speculation  suggests  that  Paris-based  Euronext  has  the  facilities  in  place  to  make  a  bid  of  £1.4bn,  while  its  German  rival  may  up  its  bid  to  the  £1.5bn  mark.  Neither  has  yet  tabled  a  formal  bid,  but  the  LSE  is  expected  to  hold  further  talks  with  the  two  parties  later  this  week.  However,  the  Sunday  Telegraph  report  added  that  there  are  signs  that  Deutsche  Boerse  chief  executive  Werner  Seifert  is  becoming  increasingly  impatient  with  the  LSE's  managed  bid  process.  |||    Despite  insisting  he  wants  to  agree  a  recommended  deal  with  the  LSE's  board,  the  newspaper  suggested  he  may  pull  out  of  the  process  and  put  an  offer  directly  to  shareholders  instead.  The  newspaper  also  claimed  Mr  Seifert  was  becoming  ""increasingly  frustrated""  with  the  pace  of  negotiations  since  Deutsche  Boerse's  £1.3bn  offer  was  rejected  in  mid-December,  in  particular  the  LSE's  decision  to  suspend  talks  over  the  Christmas  period.  Meanwhile,  the  German  exchange's  offer  has  come  under  fire  recently.  Unions  for  Deutsche  Boerse  staff  in  Frankfurt  have  reportedly  expressed  fears  that  up  to  300  jobs  would  be  moved  to  London  if  the  takeover  is  successful.  Others  claim  it  will  weaken  the  city's  status  as  Europe's  financial  centre,  while  German  politicians  are  also  said  to  be  angry  over  the  market  operator's  promise  to  move  its  headquarters  to  London  if  a  bid  is  successful.  A  further  stumbling  block  is  Deutsche  Boerse's  control  over  its  Clearstream  unit,  the  clearing  house  that  processes  securities  transactions.  LSE  shareholders  fear  it  would  create  a  monopoly  situation,  weakening  the  position  of  shareholders  when  negotiating  lower  transaction  fees  for  share  dealings.  LSE  and  Euronext  do  not  have  control  over  their  clearing  and  settlement  operations,  a  situation  which  critics  say  is  more  transparent  and  competitive."

""You  have  explored  the  possibilities  of  film  with  an  immense  talent,""  Mr  de  Vabres  said  as  he  presented  the  award.  Parker  praised  French  films,  saying:  ""Hollywood,  which  created  modern  cinema,  uses  it  only  as  a  commodity.""  He  told  the  minister:  ""I  am  honoured  to  be  thus  distinguished  by  France,  the  flag  carrier  of  cinema  throughout  the  world.""  Sir  Alan's  films  include  Oscar-winning  Fame  plus  Midnight  Express  and  The  Commitments.  |||    A  founding  member  of  the  Director's  Guild  of  Great  Britain,  he  is  a  former  chairman  of  the  UK  Film  Council  and  on  the  board  of  the  British  Film  Institute.  ""Through  your  work  and  your  campaigns,  you  have  shown  us  how  the  artist  occupies  an  essential  place  in  our  contemporary  society,""  Mr  de  Vabres  said.  ""Through  your  dreams  which  you  show  us,  through  the  links  that  you  weave,  you  question  the  world  through  the  mirror  of  your  work.""  He  also  cited  the  director's  2003  film  The  Life  of  David  Gale,  in  which  Kevin  Spacey  played  a  man  on  Death  Row,  as  proof  of  his  ""veritable  artistic  commitment  against  the  death  sentence""."

But  the  date  has  been  put  back  to  17  April  to  create  a  ""level  playing  field""  for  independent  labels.

2	"Conservative  MP  defects  to  Labour  |||    A  Conservative  MP  and  former  minister  has  defected  to  Labour.  |||    Robert  Jackson,  58,  MP  for  Wantage  in  Oxfordshire,  said  he  was  disillusioned  with  the  party's  leadership  and  its  ""dangerous""  views  on  Europe.  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  declared  himself  ""delighted"",  saying  Mr  Jackson  would  be  warmly  welcomed  by  Labour  MPs.  Mr  Jackson,  who  has  clashed  with  his  leaders  over  tuition  fees  and  Europe  in  the  past,  served  as  higher  education  minister  between  1987  and  1990.  In  a  letter  to  his  constituency  chairman  he  wrote:  ""It  is  in  the  country's  best  interest  that  Tony  Blair  rather  than  Michael  Howard  should  form  the  next  government.""  While  saying  he  admired  Mr  Blair's  ""courageous""  leadership  of  the  country,  he  bitterly  criticised  the  Conservatives  stance  on  Europe.  ""The  Conservative  Party's  hostility  to  Europe  has  now  hardened  to  the  point  at  which  it  advocates  the  unilateral  denunciation  of  Britain's  treaty  obligations,""  he  wrote.  |||    Mr  Blair  said  Mr  Jackson  was  a  ""decent,  fair-minded  and  dedicated  public  servant...  who  will  be  warmly  welcome  by  Labour  MPs  and  members"".  ""As  he  rightly  says,  [the  Conservatives]  have  learned  nothing  from  their  two  election  defeats  and  are,  if  anything,  drifting  further  rightwards,""  he  added.  A  spokesman  for  Michael  Howard  said  Mr  Jackson's  views  on  policy  issues  were  ""very  different""  from  those  of  the  party  leadership.  ""He  believes  students  should  pay  tuition  fees,  that  Tony  Blair  should  not  be  criticised  over  his  handling  of  the  Iraq  war  and  that  more  powers  should  be  given  to  Europe,""  the  spokesman  said.  He  added  that  it  was  not  surprising  Mr  Jackson  had  chosen  to  leave  the  Conservatives.  Mr  Jackson  is  due  to  stand  down  at  the  next  election.  He  is  the  third  Conservative  MP  to  defect  to  Labour  since  1997." 

1	"Three  DJs  replace  Peel  radio  show  |||    The  late  John  Peel's  BBC  Radio  1  show  is  to  be  succeeded  in  February  by  three  shows  hosted  by  three  DJs  focusing  on  diverse,  non-commercial  music.  |||    Huw  Stephens,  Ras  Kwame  and  Rob  Da  Bank  will  each  host  the  mid-week,  late-night  timeslot,  showcasing  UK  talent.  Radio  1  said  the  show  would  not  try  to  replace  Peel,  but  would  rise  to  the  ""challenge""  of  ""keeping  his  legacy  alive""  with  unpredictable  music.  Peel  died  after  suffering  a  heart  attack  in  Peru  in  October.  Radio  1  said  the  three  DJs  had  been  chosen  for  their  ""in-depth  musical  knowledge  across  a  variety  of  musical  genres"".  Rob  Da  Bank  has  been  hosting  The  John  Peel  Show  since  the  DJ's  death.  He  is  also  one  of  the  hosts  of  The  Blue  Room,  an  early  morning  weekend  show  that  plays  a  mix  of  old  and  new  electronic  and  dance  music.  Huw  Stephens  is  currently  one  half  of  the  Radio  1  Thursday  night  show  Bethan  and  Huw  in  Wales,  which  explores  new  music,  especially  up  and  coming  acts  breaking  through  in  Wales.  And  Ras  Kwame  is  the  host  of  100%  Homegrown  on  Radio  1's  digital  station  1Xtra.  His  show  is  dedicated  to  showcasing  the  best  of  UK  black  music  and  broadcasts  live  sessions,  often  giving  new  artists  their  first  chance  to  perform  on  live  national  radio.  |||    All  of  the  three  DJs  will  continue  to  host  their  current  shows  on  Radio  1.  ""It  is  widely  accepted  that  John  Peel  can  never  be  replaced,""  said  the  radio  station.  It  added  that  One  Music  would  support  both  signed  and  unsigned  talent,  and  said:  ""It  will  seek  out  those  making  music  for  music's  sake  rather  than  for  commercial  success.  ""Above  all  it  will  provide  support  to  emerging  genres  of  music  and  styles  that  have  not  yet  and  may  never  reach  the  mainstream.""  |||    One  Music  is  not  new  to  Radio  1  as  it  already  exists  as  a  website,  offering  advice  on  aspects  of  the  music  industry,  such  as  recording  a  demo  and  signing  a  record  contract.  Radio  1's  controller,  Andy  Parfitt,  said:  ""We  believe  that  by  having  a  series  of  DJs  hosting  a  selection  of  shows  under  the  One  Music  title,  we  will  ensure  that  his  legacy  lives  on.""  Stephens  said  he  grew  up  ""listening  to  John""  and  that  it  was  a  ""massive  honour""  to  continue  Peel's  work  championing  new  music.  The  show  will  be  broadcast  from  1  February  on  Tuesdays,  Wednesdays  and  Thursdays  from  2300  GMT  -  0100  GMT."

He  added  that  the  boom  has  allowed  the  government  to  collect  $950m  in  taxes.  Mr  Cartagena  said  the  industry  expects  to  see  investment  worth  $10bn  over  the  next  three  years.  |||    ""With  these  investments,  clearly  we  are  going  to  continue  being  the  principle  actor  in  the  mining  of  copper.  It's  a  consolidation  of  the  industry  with  new  projects  and  expansions  that  will  support  greater  production.""  Australia's  BHP  Billiton  -  which  operates  La  Escondida,  the  world's  largest  open  pit  copper  mine  -  is  planning  to  invest  $1.9bn  between  now  and  2007,  while  state-owned  Codelco  will  spend  about  $1bn  on  various  projects.  Chile,  the  biggest  copper  producer  in  the  world,  is  now  analyzing  ways  of  to  keep  prices  stable  at  their  current  high  levels,  without  killing  off  demand  or  leading  customers  to  look  for  substitutes  for  copper.  The  copper  price  reached  a  16-year  high  in  October  2004.  Production  in  Chile  is  expected  rise  3.5%  in  2005  to  5.5  million  tonnes,  said  Mr  Cartagena.  Cochilco  expects  for  2005  a  slight  reduction  on  copper  prices  and  forecasts  export  earnings  will  fall  10.7%."

In  The  Chorus  (Les  Choristes),  Jugnot  plays  an  inspiring  music  teacher  at  a  school  for  troubled  boys  in  1949.  Despite  starring  in  five  films  in  2004,  Depardieu  made  3.35m  Euros  (£2.31m)  putting  him  third  place  in  the  chart.  ""His  name  [Depardieu]  is  no  longer  sufficient  to  guarantee  the  success  of  a  film,""  said  Le  Figaro  newspaper.  The  Chorus,  which  Jugnot  also  co-produced,  has  drawn  an  audience  of  nearly  nine  million  people  since  its  release  last  year.  |||    Godzilla  star  Jean  Reno  was  France's  second  best-paid  actor  in  2004,  earning  3.55m  Euros  (£2.45m)  .  His  roles  include  a  recent  uncredited  cameo  in  the  Oscar-nominated  Hotel  Rwanda.  The  highest-ranking  woman  on  Le  Figaro's  list  was  Audrey  Tautou  in  10th  place,  earning  885,000  Euros  (£611,000).

""2004  reinforces  the  trend  towards  higher  losses,""  said  Swiss  Re.  Tightly  packed  populations  in  the  areas  involved  in  natural  and  man-made  disasters  were  to  partly  to  blame  for  the  rise  in  claims,  it  said.  Some  95%  of  insurance  claims  were  for  natural  catastrophes,  with  the  rest  attributed  to  made-made  events.  |||    The  largest  claims  came  from  the  US,  which  was  struck  by  four  hurricanes,  and  Japan,  which  suffered  the  highest  concentration  of  typhoons  for  decades  plus  a  major  earthquake.  |||    Europe  suffered  fewer  natural  disasters,  but  191  people  were  killed  and  more  than  2,000  injured  in  March  after  the  terrorist  attack  on  train  stations  in  Madrid.  The  damages  claimed  in  2004  eclipsed  previous  years,  including  2001  when  the  11  September  attacks  pushed  claims  up  to  $37bn.  Swiss  Re  said  it  had  registered  about  300  natural  and  man-made  disasters  around  the  world  in  2004.  Twenty-one  thousand  people  lost  their  lives  in  the  catastrophes  with  a  cost  to  the  global  economy  of  around  $105bn  (£54bn)."

They  then  took  charge  with  scores  from  Pat  Sanderson,  Kai  Horstman,  Mathew  Tait  and  Rob  Thirlby,  but  Fiji  rallied  to  force  a  tense  finale.  Scotland  were  beaten  33-15  by  Samoa  in  the  plate  semi-final  and  Ireland  lost  17-5  to  Tunisia  in  the  shield  final.  Mike  Friday's  England  side  matched  their  opponents  for  pace,  power  and  skill  in  the  final  and  led  19-7  at  half-time.  But  Neumi  Nanuku  and  Marika  Vakacegu  touched  down  for  Fiji,  only  for  a  needless  trip  by  Tuidriva  Bainivalu  on  Geoff  Appleford  to  allow  England  to  run  down  the  clock.

""This  was  a  band  that  wanted  to  lay  claim  to  this  world  and  the  next  one,  too,""  said  Springsteen.  Bono,  The  Edge,  Adam  Clayton  and  Larry  Mullen  Jr,  who  formed  U2  at  school  in  1977,  begin  a  world  tour  on  28  March.  Introducing  the  band,  Springsteen  mocked  Bono  as  the  man  who  ""single-handedly  pioneered  the  Irish  mullet"",  poking  fun  at  ""one  of  the  best  and  most  endearingly  messianic  complexes  in  rock  'n'  roll"".  But  he  also  spoke  of  the  group's  enduring  stature,  adding  that  it  was  the  only  band  of  the  last  20  years  where  he  knew  all  four  members'  names.  |||    U2's  contemporaries,  the  Pretenders,  led  by  Chrissie  Hynde  -  took  to  the  stage  to  perform  My  City  Was  Gone  with  inductee  Neil  Young.  ""We  are  a  tribute  band,""  said  Hynde,  53.  ""We're  paying  tribute  to  James  Honeyman-Scott  and  Pete  Farndon,  without  whom  we  would  not  have  been  here,""  she  said,  referring  to  the  premature  deaths  of  two  of  the  band's  guitarists  from  drug  overdoses.  |||    Britain's  Rod  Stewart  introduced  Percy  Sledge,  citing  his  best-known  hit  When  a  Man  loves  a  Woman  as  ""one  of  the  best  performances  I've  ever  heard"".  Justin  Timberlake  introduced  soul  group  the  O'Jays,  a  gospel-style  quartet  from  Ohio,  who  performed  a  medley  of  their  best-known  songs  including  Back  Stabbers,  Love  Train  and  For  the  Love  of  Money.  ""Anyone  who's  ever  written,  produced  or  performed  something  soulful  stands  in  the  shadows  of  these  giants,""  said  Timberlake.  |||    Joining  the  ceremony  at  New  York's  Waldorf  Astoria  were  legendary  R&B  star  Bo  Diddley,  who  performed  with  Eric  Clapton  and  Robbie  Robertson.  |||    Clapton,  alongside  BB  King,  also  introduced  fellow  guitarist  Buddy  Guy  and  recalled  seeing  him  play  as  a  teenager  in  England.

Also  performing  at  the  ceremony  was  veteran  musician  Jerry  Lee  Lewis  who  continued  his  reputation  as  a  rowdy  piano-pounder  despite  his  69  years,  kicking  over  his  stool  and  sitting  on  the  piano  during  a  rendition  of  Whole  Lotta  Shakin'  Goin'  On." 

2	"Howard  denies  split  over  ID  cards  |||    Michael  Howard  has  denied  his  shadow  cabinet  was  split  over  its  decision  to  back  controversial  Labour  plans  to  introduce  ID  cards.  |||    The  Tory  leader  said  his  front  bench  team  had  reached  a  ""collective  view""  after  holding  a  ""good  discussion"",  but  admitted  it  was  ""not  an  easy  issue"".  He  had  decided  to  support  the  plans  as  the  police  said  they  would  help  fight  terror,  crime  and  illegal  immigration.  The  Lib  Dems  have  pledged  to  oppose  the  bill  when  it  is  debated  next  Monday.  |||    Tory  sources  say  senior  party  figures  had  argued  vociferously  against  the  ID  card  scheme.  Among  those  reported  to  have  serious  reservations  over  the  strategy  were  senior  shadow  cabinet  members  David  Davis,  Oliver  Letwin  and  Tim  Yeo.  But  Mr  Howard  denied  Mr  Yeo,  his  transport  and  environment  spokesman,  said  the  plans  ""stink"".  He  also  said  he  was  confident  shadow  home  secretary  Mr  Davis  would  ""set  out  the  position  very  clearly""  when  he  stands  up  to  debate  the  matter  next  week.  Mr  Howard  said  the  police  had  said  ID  cards  could  ""help  them  foil  a  terror  bomb  plot  in  which  people  could  lose  their  lives"".  He  added:  ""When  the  police  say  that  you  have  to  take  them  seriously"".  |||    He  acknowledged  there  were  ""good  libertarian  arguments""  against  the  cards,  but  said  the  shadow  Cabinet  had  weighed  up  all  the  ""conflicting  interests""  before  reaching  its  decision.  ""I  don't  pretend  that  it  is  an  easy  decision  but  at  the  end  of  the  day  a  decision  has  to  be  taken.""  He  also  denied  he  was  afraid  of  looking  ""soft""  on  the  issue,  compared  to  Labour.  The  Conservatives  announced  their  support  for  the  government  plans  on  Monday  evening.  |||    Sources  within  the  party  told  the  BBC  Mr  Howard  had  always  been  in  favour  of  ID  cards,  and  tried  to  introduce  them  when  he  was  Home  Secretary.  But  the  Tories  insisted  they  would  hold  ministers  to  account  over  the  precise  purpose  of  the  scheme.  |||    They  said  they  would  also  press  Labour  over  whether  objectives  could  be  met  and  whether  the  Home  Office  would  be  able  to  deliver  them.  And  they  pledged  to  assess  the  cost  effectiveness  of  ID  cards  and  whether  people's  privacy  would  be  properly  protected.  ""It  is  important  to  remember  that  this  bill  will  take  a  decade  to  come  into  full  effect,""  a  spokesman  said.  Lib  Dem  home  affairs  spokesman  Mark  Oaten  has  branded  the  ID  scheme  a  waste  of  money  and  ""deeply  flawed"".  He  said:  ""This  has  all  the  signs  of  Michael  Howard  overruling  colleagues'  concerns  over  ID  cards.""  |||    The  chairman  of  the  Bar  Council,  Guy  Mansfield  QC  warned  there  was  a  real  risk  that  people  on  the  ""margins  of  society""  would  be  driven  into  the  hands  of  extremists.  ""What  is  going  to  happen  to  young  Asian  men  when  there  has  been  a  bomb  gone  off  somewhere?  They  are  going  to  be  stopped.  If  they  haven't  [ID  cards]  they  are  going  to  be  detained.""  Tory  ex-minister  Douglas  Hogg  said  he  opposed  the  plans  for  ID  cards  branding  them  a  ""regressive""  step  which  would  intrude  into  the  lives  of  ordinary  citizens  without  any  counterbalancing  benefits.  He  predicted  ultimately  carrying  the  cards  would  become  compulsory  and  that  would  lead  to  large  numbers  of  Britain's  ethnic  minorities  being  stopped  by  police." 

2	"How  political  squabbles  snowball  |||    It's  become  commonplace  to  argue  that  Blair  and  Brown  are  like  squabbling  school  kids  and  that  they  (and  their  supporters)  need  to  grow  up  and  stop  bickering.  |||    But  this  analysis  in  fact  gets  it  wrong.  It's  not  just  children  who  fight  -  adults  do  too.  And  there  are  solid  reasons  why  even  a  trivial  argument  between  mature  protagonists  can  be  hard  to  stop  once  its  got  going.  The  key  feature  of  an  endless  feud  is  that  everyone  can  agree  they'd  be  better  off  if  it  ended  -  but  everyone  wants  to  have  the  last  word.  |||    Each  participant  genuinely  wants  the  row  to  stop,  but  thinks  it  worth  prolonging  the  argument  just  a  tiny  bit  to  ensure  their  view  is  heard.  Their  successive  attempts  to  end  the  argument  with  their  last  word  ensure  the  argument  goes  on  and  on  and  on.  (In  the  case  of  Mr  Blair  and  Mr  Brown,  successive  books  are  published,  ensuring  the  issues  never  die.)  Now  this  isn't  because  the  participants  are  stupid  -  it's  actually  each  individual  behaving  entirely  rationally,  given  the  incentives  facing  them.  Indeed,  there's  even  a  piece  of  economic  theory  that  explains  all  this.  Nothing  as  obscure  as  ""post-neo-classical  endogenous  growth  theory""  which  the  chancellor  himself  once  quoted  -  but  a  ubiquitous  piece  of  game  theory  which  all  respectable  policy  wonks  are  familiar  with.  |||    It's  often  referred  to  as  the  ""prisoner's  dilemma"",  based  on  a  parable  much  told  in  economics  degree  courses...  about  a  sheriff  and  two  prisoners.  The  story  goes  that  two  prisoners  are  jointly  charged  with  a  heinous  crime,  and  are  locked  up  in  separate  cells.  But  the  sheriff  desperately  needs  a  confession  from  at  least  one  of  them,  to  provide  enough  evidence  to  convict  them  of  the  crime.  Without  a  confession,  the  prisoners  will  get  a  minimal  sentence  on  some  trumped  up  charge.  |||    Clearly  the  prisoners'  best  strategy  is  to  keep  their  mouths  shut,  and  take  the  short  sentence,  but  the  clever  sheriff  has  an  idea  to  induce  them  to  talk.  He  tells  each  prisoner  separately,  that  if  they  confess  -  and  they  are  the  only  one  to  confess  -  they'll  be  let  off  their  crime.  And  he  tells  them  that  if  they  don't  confess  -  and  they  are  the  only  one  not  to  confess  -  they'll  get  life.  Now,  if  you  are  prisoner  confronted  with  this  choice,  your  best  bet  is  to  confess.  If  your  partner  doesn't  confess,  you'll  get  off  completely.  And  if  your  partner  does  confess,  you'd  better  confess  to  ensure  you  don't  get  life.  The  result  is  of  course,  both  prisoners  confess,  so  the  sheriff  does  not  have  to  let  either  one  off.  Both  prisoners'  individual  logic  was  to  behave  that  way,  even  though  both  would  have  been  better  if  they  had  somehow  agreed  to  shut  up.  Don't  worry  if  you  don't  entirely  follow  it  -  you  can  to  look  it  up  on  Google,  where  there  are  283,000  entries  on  it.  |||    The  prisoners'  dilemma  and  all  its  ramifications  have  truly  captured  economists  in  the  last  couple  of  decades.  It  is  a  parable  used  to  describe  any  situation  where  there  is  an  obvious  sensible  choice  to  be  taken  collectively,  but  where  the  only  rational  choice  individually  is  to  behave  selfishly.  |||    A  cold  war  arms  race  for  example  -  a  classic  case  where  both  Russia  and  America  would  be  better  off  with  just  a  few  arms,  rather  than  a  lot  of  arms.  But  as  long  as  each  wants  just  a  few  more  arms  than  the  other,  an  arms  race  ensues  with  the  results  that  the  individually  logical  decision  to  buy  more  arms,  results  in  arms  levels  that  are  too  high.  What  economics  tells  us  is  that  once  you're  in  a  prisoners'  dilemma  -  unless  you  are  repeating  the  experience  many  times  over  -  it's  hard  to  escape  the  perverse  logic  of  it.  It's  no  good  just  exhorting  people  to  stop  buying  arms,  or  to  stop  arguing  when  all  their  incentives  encourage  them  to  carry  on.  Somehow,  the  incentives  have  to  change.  |||    In  the  case  of  the  Labour  Party,  if  you  believe  the  rift  between  Blair  and  Brown  camps  is  as  bad  as  the  reports  suggest,  Solomon's  wisdom  needs  to  be  deployed  to  solve  the  problem.  Every  parent  knows  there  are  ingenious  solutions  to  arguments,  solutions  which  affect  the  incentives  of  the  participants.  An  example,  is  the  famous  rule  that  ""one  divides,  the  other  chooses""  as  a  way  of  allocating  a  piece  of  cake  to  be  sliced  up  between  greedy  children.  In  the  case  of  an  apparently  endless  argument,  if  you  want  it  to  come  to  an  end,  you  have  to  ensure  the  person  who  has  the  last  word  is  one  who  loses  rather  than  the  one  who  wins  the  row.  The  cost  of  prolonging  the  row  by  even  one  more  briefing,  or  one  more  book  for  that  matter,  has  to  exceed  the  benefit  of  having  the  last  word,  and  getting  your  point  in.  If  the  rest  of  the  party  can  enforce  that,  they'll  have  the  protagonists  retreating  pretty  quickly."

2	"Labour's  election  love-in  |||    Peace  and  love  have  been  in  short  supply  in  the  Labour  party  in  recent  days.  |||    If  press  reports  are  to  be  believed,  Alan  Milburn  and  Gordon  Brown  have  been  at  each  other's  throats  over  the  contents  of  Labour's  next  election  manifesto.  But  the  pair  were  all  smiles  on  Tuesday  morning,  as  they  joined  John  Prescott  to  unveil  Labour's  latest  poster  campaign.  The  event  -  at  Old  Billingsgate  Fish  Market  on  the  banks  of  the  Thames  -  was  a  carefully  choreographed  show  of  unity.  And  the  surest  sign  yet  that  we  are  heading  for  a  general  election  in  the  next  few  months.  It  was  also  one  of  the  most  bizarre  photo  opportunities  of  recent  years.  |||    The  first  inkling  something  slightly  odd  was  afoot  was  when  -  in  place  of  the  soft  rock  music  normally  chosen  for  such  occasions  -  Labour's  speakers  crackled  to  life  with  the  sound  of  Booker  T  and  the  MGs.  Then  a  VW  camper  van  trundled  into  view,  decked  out  in  that  most  mind-bending  of  psychedelic  messages  -  ""lowest  mortgage  rate  for  40  years"".  As  the  side-door  slid  open,  it  looked  for  one  glorious  moment  as  if  the  Cabinet  had  decided  to  bury  their  differences  and  go  on  the  road  together,  Scooby  Doo-style.  But,  sadly,  it  wasn't  the  Cabinet  who  had  raided  the  dressing-up  box  -  just  six  rather  ill-at-ease  looking  Labour  students.  Two  were  dressed  as  Regency  dandies  -  to  unveil  a  poster  trumpeting  ""the  longest  period  of  economic  growth  for  200  years"".  Another  pair  of  students  were  in  a  Beatle  wig  and  Sgt  Pepper  jacket  to  highlight  the  ""lowest  interest  rates  since  the  1960s"".  |||    The  remaining  two  were  dressed  in  a  vague  approximation  of  disco  chic  to  demonstrate  the  ""lowest  unemployment  since  the  seventies"".  |||    The  politicians  -  led  out  by  John  Prescott  -  were  soberly-suited  as  always.  The  event  may  have  been  designed  to  highlight  Labour's  economic  success  under  Mr  Brown,  but  there  was  little  doubt  who  was  in  charge.  The  chancellor  walked  side-by-side  with  Mr  Milburn,  pointedly  exchanging  chit  chat,  as  they  approached  the  microphone.  But  it  was  Mr  Milburn  who  took  centre  stage,  speaking  of  the  ""positive  campaign""  the  party  hoped  to  stage  in  the  ""coming  weeks  and  months"".  |||    The  mobile  poster  vans  would  ""let  people  know  Britain  is  working  again"".  Mr  Brown  repeated  the  familiar  mantras  displayed  on  the  posters  and  spoke  of  Labour's  ""shared  purpose""  and  ""united  dedication"".  It  was  left  to  Mr  Prescott  to  pay  glowing  tribute  to  the  chancellor's  record  and,  in  a  final  flourish,  to  produce  his  famous  pledge  card,  from  1997,  claiming  Labour  has  met  all  of  its  promises.  The  event  was  carefully  stage-managed  to  underline  Cabinet  unity.  And,  more  specifically,  to  demonstrate  the  ""central  role""  Mr  Brown  will  play  in  the  election  campaign,  despite  being  sidelined  as  campaign  chief  in  favour  of  Mr  Milburn.  |||    But  keen  students  of  body  language  will  have  had  a  field  day.  There  was  much  forced  smiling  for  the  cameras,  but  only  Mr  Prescott,  who  revels  in  such  occasions,  seemed  to  be  truly  enjoying  himself.  Mr  Milburn  made  a  point  of  turning  to  face  the  chancellor,  as  he  spoke,  nodding  thoughtfully.  But  it  was  the  former  health  secretary's  final  gesture,  placing  an  arm  on  Mr  Brown's  back  as  they  walked  away  from  the  microphones,  which  was  perhaps  the  most  telling.  Thanks  for  dropping  by  Gordon,  he  might  have  been  saying." 

2	"Brown  calls  for  £5.5bn  Aids  fund  |||    Gordon  Brown  has  called  on  rich  nations  to  fund  a  £5.5bn  ($10bn)  plan  to  fight  the  Aids  epidemic  and  find  a  vaccine.  |||    On  the  fourth  day  of  his  six-day  tour  of  Africa,  the  UK  chancellor  predicted  a  vaccine  could  be  found  by  2012  if  the  world  stepped  up  its  funding  pledges.  Doubling  the  £400m  being  spent  yearly  on  finding  such  a  vaccine  could  advance  it  by  three  years  and  save  six  million  lives,  Mr  Brown  said  on  Thursday.  He  hopes  to  use  the  UK's  G8  presidency  to  push  the  issue  forward.  |||    ""I  believe  that  the  generation  that  provided  the  finance  to  combat,  cure  and  eradicate  the  world's  deadliest  disease  of  today  -  and  today  the  world's  least  curable  disease  -  HIV/Aids  -  will  rightly  earn  the  title  'the  great  generation',""  Mr  Brown  said  in  a  speech  during  his  African  tour.  The  problems  of  HIV/Aids  were  inseparable  from  poverty,  he  added.  ""At  least  $10  billion  per  annum  (£5.5bn)  is  needed  to  address  the  HIV/Aids  crisis  in  low  and  middle  income  countries.  ""Existing  financial  commitments  on  their  own  will  not  stop  the  pandemic.  ""The  UK's  proposal  for  an  International  Finance  Facility  is  so  important  -  increasing  world  aid  flows  by  over  $50  billion  (£27bn).  A  doubling  of  world  aid  to  halve  world  poverty.""  Mr  Brown  also  said  he  had  agreed  with  the  Italian  finance  minister  Domenico  Siniscalco  to  push  forward  with  plans  for  the  world-wide  sharing  and  co-ordination  of  research  into  the  disease.  |||    Currently  the  private  sector  was  only  spending  £60m  a  year  on  seeking  an  inoculation  and  the  market  needed  boosting,  Mr  Brown  said.  He  called  on  industrialised  nations  to  commit  themselves  to  buying  the  first  300m  vaccines  at  a  cost  of  $20  each,  thereby  boosting  the  market  for  inoculations.  This  would  be  a  ""large  enough  inducement  to  create  much  stronger  interest  from  both  large  and  small  pharmaceutical  firms"",  Mr  Brown  added.  |||    More  must  also  be  done  to  finance  the  treatment  and  care  of  those  living  with  HIV/Aids  and  their  families,  he  said.  But  Aid  charity  Actionaid  criticised  Mr  Brown's  preoccupation  with  finding  a  vaccine  and  called  on  G8  nations  to  fund  HIV/Aids  treatments.  The  charity's  head  of  HIV/Aids  in  Britain,  Simon  Wright  said:  ""While  encouraging  the  pharmaceutical  industry  to  discover  an  HIV  vaccine  is  important,  a  failure  to  provide  any  funding  for  HIV  treatments  condemns  a  generation  of  people  to  death.  ""HIV  is  decimating  African  countries,  killing  the  most  productive  adults  who  should  be  working,  caring  for  children  and  building  the  economy.  An  HIV  vaccine  is  probably  at  least  10  years  away.  Treatments  are  needed  now.""  On  Wednesday,  Mr  Brown  visited  slums  in  the  Kenyan  capital  Nairobi  .  He  will  visit  an  HIV/Aids  orphanage  in  Tanzania  and  a  women's  credit  union  in  Mozambique  before  chairing  a  meeting  of  the  Commission  for  Africa  in  Cape  Town.  The  chancellor  has  already  unveiled  proposals  for  a  G8  aid  package  which  he  has  likened  to  the  Marshall  Plan  used  by  the  United  States  to  rebuild  Europe  after  World  War  Two."

Consumer  spending  was  higher  in  December  than  November,  and  festive  sales  were  also  up  on  2003.  The  employment  picture  also  improved,  the  Fed  said.  |||    ""Labour  markets  firmed  in  a  number  of  districts,  but  wage  pressures  generally  remained  modest,""  the  Beige  Book  said.  ""Several  districts  reported  higher  prices  for  building  materials  and  manufacturing  inputs,  but  most  reported  steady  or  only  slightly  higher  overall  price  levels.""  The  report  added  that  residential  real  estate  activity  remained  strong  and  that  commercial  real  estate  activity  strengthened  in  most  districts.  ""Office  leasing  was  especially  brisk  in  Washington  DC,  and  New  York  City,  two  of  the  nation's  strongest  commercial  markets,""  the  Fed  said." 

2	"UK  heading  wrong  way,  says  Howard  |||    Tony  Blair  has  had  the  chance  to  tackle  the  problems  facing  Britain  and  has  failed,  Michael  Howard  has  said.  |||    ""Britain  is  heading  in  the  wrong  direction"",  the  Conservative  leader  said  in  his  New  Year  message.  Mr  Blair's  government  was  a  ""bossy,  interfering  government  that  takes  decisions  that  should  be  made  by  individuals,""  he  added.  But  Labour's  campaign  spokesman  Fraser  Kemp  responded:  ""Britain  is  working,  don't  let  the  Tories  wreck  it  again"".  Mr  Howard  also  paid  tribute  to  the  nation's  character  for  its  generous  response  to  the  Asian  quake  disaster.  The  catastrophe  was  overshadowing  the  hopes  for  the  future  at  this  usually  positive  time  of  the  year,  Mr  Howard  said.  |||    ""We  watched  the  scenes  of  destruction  with  a  sense  of  disbelief.  The  scale,  the  speed,  the  ferocity  of  what  happened  on  Boxing  Day  is  difficult  to  grasp.  ""Yet  Britain's  response  has  shone  a  light  on  our  nation's  character.  The  last  week  has  shown  that  the  warm,  caring  heart  of  Britain  beats  as  strong  as  ever.""  He  went  on  to  reflect  on  the  values  that  ""most  Britons  hold  dear"".  Looking  ahead  to  the  coming  general  election,  he  pledged  to  ""turn  these  beliefs  into  reality""  and  set  out  the  choices  he  says  are  facing  Britain.  ""How  much  tax  do  people  want  to  pay?  Who  will  give  taxpayers  value  for  money,  the  clean  hospitals  and  good,  disciplined  schools  they  want?  ""Who  can  be  trusted  to  get  a  grip  on  the  disorder  on  our  streets  and  the  chaos  in  our  immigration  system?""  |||    Mr  Blair  has  failed  to  tackle  these  problems,  he  claimed,  saying  he  has  the  ""wrong  solution""  to  them.  |||    ""The  result  is  big  government  and  higher  taxes  eroding  incentives,  undermining  enterprise  and  denying  people  choice.  ""Worst  of  all,  it  is  a  government  that  has  wasted  people's  money  and  failed  to  tackle  the  problems  families  face  today.""  The  Tories,  he  said,  can  cut  crime  and  improve  public  services  without  asking  people  to  pay  more  taxes.  ""We  can  have  progress  without  losing  what  makes  Britain  great  -  its  tolerance,  the  respect  for  the  rule  of  law,  the  ability  of  everyone  to  fulfil  their  potential.  ""We  simply  need  to  change  direction.  The  election  will  give  Britain  the  chance  to  change.""  This  is  the  record  Mr  Blair  will  have  to  defend  in  the  coming  months,  he  said,  urging  voters  to  hold  him  to  account.  |||    But  Labour  spokesman  Mr  Kemp  said:  ""It  would  be  more  appropriate  for  this  message  to  come  out  on  1  April,  not  1  January.""  ""Let  us  never  forget  that  when  Michael  Howard  was  in  government  Britain  suffered  mass  unemployment,  15%  interest  rates,  record  home  repossessions,  and  the  introduction  of  the  poll  tax.  ""With  Labour  Britain  is  working.  Rather  than  alluding  to  false  promises  Michael  Howard  should  be  starting  2005  with  an  apology  to  the  British  people  for  the  misery  that  the  government,  of  which  he  was  a  member,  inflicted  upon  the  country."

All  regions  saw  at  least  a  doubling  in  their  assets  during  the  past  decade.  But  Northern  Ireland  led  the  way  with  a  262%  rise,  while  Scotland  saw  the  smallest  increase  of  just  112%.  |||    The  core  retail  price  index  rose  by  just  28%  in  the  same  period,  underlining  how  effective  an  investment  in  housing  has  been  for  most  people  during  the  past  decade.  More  than  a  third  of  the  UK's  private  housing  assets  -  representing  more  than  a  trillion  pounds  in  value  -  are  concentrated  in  London  and  the  South  East,  the  Halifax's  figures  indicate.  Tim  Crawford,  Group  Economist  at  Halifax,  said:  ""The  value  of  the  private  housing  stock  continues  to  grow  and  the  family  home  remains,  by  a  large  margin,  the  most  valuable  asset  of  the  majority  of  households  in  the  UK.""  Halifax's  own  monthly  figures  on  house  sales  -  issued  on  Thursday  -  suggest  the  average  price  of  a  British  property  now  stands  at  £163,748  after  a  0.8%  rise  in  January.  Housing  experts  are  split  on  prospects  for  the  market,  with  some  saying  price  growth  will  slow  but  not  fall,  while  others  predict  a  sharp  drop  in  values." 

0	"Steel  firm  'to  cut'  45,000  jobs  |||    Mittal  Steel,  one  of  the  world's  largest  steel  producers,  could  cut  up  to  45,000  jobs  over  the  next  five  years,  its  chief  executive  has  said.  |||    The  Netherlands-based  company  is  due  to  complete  its  $4.5bn  acquisition  of  US  firm  ISG  next  month,  making  it  one  of  the  largest  global  firms  of  its  kind.  However,  Lakshmi  Mittal  has  told  investors  the  combined  company  will  have  to  shed  thousands  of  jobs.  The  Indian-born  magnate  did  not  say  where  the  job  losses  would  fall.  |||    Mr  Mittal  told  US  investors  that  once  the  acquisition  of  International  Steel  Group  was  completed,  the  company  would  aim  to  reduce  its  workforce  by  between  7,000  and  8,000  annually.  This  could  see  its  workforce  trimmed  from  155,000  to  110,000  staff  by  2010.  ""We  are  investing  in  modernisation  so  employees  will  go  down,""  Mr  Mittal  told  the  conference  in  Chicago.  |||    Mittal  Steel  was  formed  last  year  when  Mr  Mittal's  LNM  Holdings  merged  with  Dutch  firm  Ispat.  A  combination  of  Mittal  Steel  and  ISG  would  have  annual  sales  of  $32bn  (£16.7bn;  24.1bn  euros)  and  a  production  capacity  of  70  million  tonnes.  |||    A  Mittal  Steel  spokeman  said  that  no  decisions  on  job  cuts  have  been  made  yet.  ""We  are  trying  to  create  a  sustainable  steel  industry  and  if  we  want  to  do  that,  we  have  to  invest  in  new  technology,""  a  spokesman  said.  Mittal  Steel  has  operations  in  14  countries.  Many  of  its  businesses  -  particularly  those  in  eastern  Europe  -  were  previously  state  owned  and  have  huge  workforces.

""Obviously  with  a  lot  of  loss  of  life,  a  lot  of  time  is  needed  to  clean  up  the  mess,  bury  the  people  and  find  the  missing,""  said  ABN  Amro's  Eddie  Wong.  ""[But]  it's  not  necessarily  a  really  big  thing  in  the  economic  sense.""  |||    India's  Bombay  Stock  Exchange  inched  slightly  above  its  previous  record  close  on  Wednesday.  Expectations  of  strong  corporate  earnings  in  2005  drove  the  Indonesian  stock  exchange  in  Jakarta  to  a  record  high  on  Wednesday.  In  Hong  Kong,  the  Hang  Seng  index  may  be  benefiting  in  part  from  the  potential  for  its  listed  property  companies  to  gain  from  rebuilding  contracts  in  the  tsunami-affected  regions  of  South  East  Asia.  In  Sri  Lanka,  some  economists  have  said  that  as  much  as  1%  of  annual  growth  may  be  lost.  Sri  Lanka's  stock  market  has  fallen  about  5%  since  the  weekend,  but  it  is  still  40%  higher  than  at  the  start  of  2004.  |||    Thailand  may  lose  30bn  baht  (£398m;  $768m)  in  earnings  from  tourism  over  the  next  three  months,  according  to  tourism  minister  Sontaya  Kunplome.  |||    In  the  affected  provinces,  he  expects  the  loss  of  tourism  revenue  to  be  offset  by  government  reconstruction  spending.  Thailand  intends  to  spend  a  similar  sum  -  around  30bn  baht  -  on  the  rebuilding  work.  ""It  will  take  until  the  fourth  quarter  of  next  year  before  tourist  visitors  in  Phuket  and  five  other  provinces  return  to  their  normal  level,""  said  Naris  Chaiyasoot,  director  general  at  the  ministry's  fiscal  policy  office.  In  the  Maldives  the  cost  of  reconstruction  could  wipe  out  economic  growth,  according  to  a  government  spokesman.  ""Our  nation  is  in  peril  here,""  said  Ahmed  Shaheed,  the  chief  government  spokesman.  He  estimated  the  economic  cost  of  the  disaster  at  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars.  The  Maldives  has  gross  domestic  product  of  $660m.  ""It  won't  be  surprising  if  the  cost  exceeds  our  GDP,""  he  said.  ""In  the  last  few  years,  we  made  great  progress  in  our  standard  of  living  -  the  United  Nations  recognised  this.  Now  we  see  this  can  disappear  in  a  few  days,  a  few  minutes.""  Shaheed  noted  that  investment  in  a  single  tourist  resort  -  the  economic  mainstay  -  could  run  to  $40m.  Between  10  and  12  of  the  80-odd  resorts  have  been  severely  damaged,  and  a  similar  number  have  suffered  significant  damage.  |||    However,  many  experts,  including  the  World  Bank,  have  pointed  out  that  it  is  still  difficult  to  assess  the  magnitude  of  the  disaster  and  its  likely  economic  impact.  In  part,  this  is  because  of  its  scale,  and  because  delivering  aid  and  recovering  the  dead  remain  priorities.  ""Calculators  will  have  to  wait,""  said  an  IMF  official  in  a  briefing  on  Wednesday.  ""The  financial  and  world  community  will  be  turning  toward  reconstruction  efforts  and  at  that  point  people  will  begin  to  have  a  sense  of  the  financial  impact.""" 

2	"Brown  to  outline  presidency  goals  |||    Next  year  will  be  ""make  or  break""  for  development  in  poorer  countries  Gordon  Brown  will  say  as  he  sets  out  UK  goals  for  its  EU  and  G8  presidencies.  |||    The  chancellor  is  due  to  outline  a  series  of  key  targets  the  government  will  be  judged  on  in  2005.  They  will  include  doubling  aid  from  donor  countries  and  eliminating  debt  owed  by  the  poorest  nations.  Mr  Brown  also  wants  other  G8  nations  to  match  his  target  for  overseas  aid  -  spending  0.7%  of  national  income.  |||    He  also  wants  the  richer  countries  to  do  more  to  help  the  development  of  vaccines  for  Aids  and  malaria.  The  chancellor  is  travelling  to  America  next  week  as  part  of  his  persuasion  drive  over  the  issue.  He  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme:  ""We  need  more  resources  allied  to  progress  on  trade  and  progress  on  debt  relief  if  we  are  going  to  make  an  impact  on  the  problems  of  ill  health,  of  illiteracy,  of  poverty,  particularly  in  Africa  but  right  through  the  developing  countries.""  |||    His  proposals  were  effectively  a  new  ""Marshall  Plan""  for  the  world,  including  an  international  finance  facility,  which  would  issue  bonds  in  an  attempt  to  double  global  aid  cash  to  $100bn  a  year.  Agreement  in  the  Doha  development  talks  could  also  give  developing  nations  the  trading  ability  they  needed,  he  argued.  The  European  Union's  Common  Agricultural  Policy  had  caused  aggravated  trade  problems,  he  said,  but  there  was  now  an  agreement  to  end  export  subsidies.  |||    Mr  Brown  said  much  had  been  achieved  on  issues  such  as  debt  relief  in  the  last  seven  years.  But  with  30,000  children  were  dying  unnecessarily  every  day  more  was  needed,  including  100%  debt  relief  multilaterally.  ""That  is  why  next  year  is  a  test,""  he  said.  ""If  after  five  years  of  making  promises  the  world  is  not  prepared  to  honour  them,  then  people  will  be  justified  in  saying  they  promised  but  they  did  not  produce  results.""  The  Catholic  aid  agency  Cafod  will  host  Mr  Brown's  speech  on  Wednesday.  |||    Cafod  wants  Britain  to  use  its  influence  to  pressure  countries  like  the  US  to  make  firm  commitments  to  tackle  global  poverty.  Mr  Brown  said  America  too  needed  to  take  more  action  but  defended  President  George  Bush  for  guaranteeing  resources  to  countries  which  introduced  reforms  to  tackle  corruption.  Oxfam's  Paying  the  Price  report  this  week  said  45  million  children  will  die  needlessly  before  2015  and  aid  budgets  are  half  their  1960  levels.  The  charity's  director,  Barbara  Stocking,  said:  ""2005  offers  the  chance  for  an  historic  breakthrough,  but  unless  world  leaders  act  now  the  year  will  end  in  shameful  failure.""  The  report  said  the  G8  of  top  industrialised  nations  had  agreed  in  1970  to  spend  0.7%  of  their  incomes  on  aid.  |||    But  34  years  later  none  of  the  organisations  members  had  reached  this  target  and  many  had  not  yet  set  a  timetable.  Mr  Blair,  who  has  described  Africa  as  a  ""scar""  on  the  world's  conscience,  has  already  said  tackling  world  poverty  would  be  one  his  G8  priorities  along  with  climate  change  and  the  Aids  epidemic.  But  Band  Aid  founder  Bob  Geldof  in  July  said  he  was  sick  of  hearing  ""guff""  about  scars  on  the  world.  It  was  pathetic  that  Britain  was  the  4th  richest  country  in  the  world  but  only  the  11th  most  generous  aid  donor,  he  added.  Conservative  shadow  international  development  secretary  Alan  Duncan  accused  Mr  Brown  of  missing  his  target  on  providing  anti-retroviral  drug  treatment  to  three  million  Africans  by  2005.  Instead,  only  500,000  people  would  benefit,  he  said.  ""There's  no  point  in  him  demanding  praise  and  adulation  for  setting  a  whole  new  raft  of  targets  when  he  has  so  woefully  failed  to  meet  the  ones  he  already  has,""  added  Mr  Duncan."

The  move  comes  as  a  recovery  in  the  US  economy,  the  world's  biggest,  shows  signs  of  robustness  and  sustainability.  The  dollar's  record-breaking  decline,  meanwhile,  has  spooked  markets  and  along  with  high  oil  prices  has  raised  concerns  about  the  pace  of  inflation.  ""We  are  seeing  evidence  that  inflation  is  moving  higher,""  said  Ken  Kim,  an  analyst  at  Stone  &  McCarthy  Research.  ""It's  not  a  risk,  it's  actually  happening.""  Mr  Kim  added  that  borrowing  costs  could  rise  further.  |||    The  Fed  has  said  that  it  will  move  in  a  ""measured""  way  to  combat  price  growth  and  lift  interest  rates  from  their  40-year  lows  that  were  prompted  by  sluggish  US  and  global  growth.  |||    With  the  economic  picture  now  looking  more  rosy,  the  Fed  has  implemented  quarter  percentage  point  rises  in  June,  August,  September  and  November.  Although  the  US  economy  grew  at  an  annual  rate  of  3.9%  in  the  three  months  to  September,  analysts  warn  that  Fed  has  to  be  careful  not  to  move  too  aggressively  and  take  the  wind  out  of  the  recovery's  sails.  Earlier  this  month  figures  showed  that  job  creation  is  still  weak,  while  consumer  confidence  is  subdued.  ""I  think  the  Fed  feels  it  has  a  fair  amount  of  flexibility,""  said  David  Berson,  chief  economist  at  Fannie  Mae.  ""While  inflation  has  moved  up,  it  hasn't  moved  up  a  lot.""  ""If  economic  growth  should  subside...  the  Fed  would  feel  it  has  the  flexibility  to  pause  in  its  tightening.  ""But  if  economic  growth  picked  up  and  caused  core  inflation  to  rise  a  little  more  quickly,  I  think  the  Fed  would  be  prepared  to  tighten  more  quickly  as  well."""

Both  Culture  Secretary  Tessa  Jowell  and  Deputy  Prime  Minister  John  Prescott  have  welcomed  his  return.  ""He  is  a  strong  Labour  Party  member,""  Mr  Prescott  told  BBC  One's  Breakfast  With  Frost  programme.  |||    Mr  Campbell  quit  Number  10  in  August  2003  after  being  Tony  Blair's  right-hand  man  at  the  1997  and  2001  elections.  Labour  have  refused  to  discuss  his  exact  new  position  and  have  not  said  how  it  would  affect  his  Downing  Street  replacement  David  Hill.  ""Of  course  Alastair's  going  to  be  part  of  the  election  campaign  and  I  think  that  all  of  us  who  will  also  be  part  of  the  election  campaign  are  very  pleased  about  that,""  Ms  Jowell  told  Sky  News.  |||    But  she  said  his  return  would  not  put  anybody  else's  ""nose  out  of  joint"".  ""This  is  the  daft  thing  about  the  way  in  which  politics  is  written  about,""  Ms  Jowell  added.  ""There's  room  for  everybody.  We  serve  the  country  better  if  we  make  room  for  all  the  talent.""  A  Labour  source  told  the  Sunday  Times  Mr  Campbell  would  ""effectively  front""  the  election  media  campaign  but  said  he  would  be  given  no  formal  title.  |||    Labour  strategists  told  the  paper  he  would  be  ""set  loose""  on  Conservative  leader  Michael  Howard  in  attacking  his  party's  economic  record  when  it  was  in  power.  ""They  used  pictures  from  the  1970s  in  the  1992  campaign  to  remind  people  of  the  winter  of  discontent  -  and  now  it's  our  turn,""  the  source  told  the  paper.  ""Making  Michael  Howard  leader  gives  us  an  unmissable  opportunity  to  remind  people  what  it  was  like  to  pay  mortgage  rates  of  15%  even  if  it  was  more  than  a  decade  ago.""  Mr  Campbell  was  at  the  centre  of  the  government's  row  with  BBC  over  Andrew  Gilligan's  story  about  the  Iraq  weapons  dossier.  The  Hutton  inquiry  cleared  him  of  ""sexing  up""  the  dossier  in  the  run-up  to  the  Iraq  war.  Since  leaving  Downing  Street,  he  has  toured  the  country  with  his  one  man  show,  An  Audience  With  Alastair  Campbell  and  presented  a  number  of  interview  programmes  for  Channel  4."

Unions  criticised  the  possible  move  -  which  may  affect  cabin  and  maintenance  staff  -  saying  Qantas  was  profitable.  More  than  90%  of  the  airline's  staff  are  based  in  Australia.  |||    Qantas  confirmed  it  was  looking  at  whether  it  might  recruit  and  source  products  overseas  -  potentially  through  joint  ventures  -  but  said  it  would  continue  to  create  jobs  in  Australia.  |||    Despite  making  a  record  Australian  dollars  648m  ($492m)  profit  last  year,  Qantas  has  argued  that  it  needs  to  make  considerable  savings  if  it  is  to  remain  competitive.  ""We're  going  to  have  to  get  the  lowest  cost  structure  we  can  and  that  willmean  sourcing  things  more  and  more  from  overseas,""  the  newspaper  quoted  Qantas  chief  executive  Geoff  Dixon  as  saying.  Early  this  year,  Qantas  increased  the  number  of  flight  attendants  based  in  London  from  370  to  870.  If  Qantas  were  to  follow  the  lead  of  other  airlines  moving  staff  'offshore'  7,000  jobs  could  shift  overseas,  the  newspaper  reported.  In  a  statement,  Qantas  said  it  was  looking  to  build  its  operations  overseas.  However,  it  stressed  this  would  not  result  in  large  scale  redundancies  in  its  home  market,  where  most  of  its  35,000  staff  are  employed.  ""We  are  totally  committed  to  continuing  to  grow  jobs  in  Australia,""  Mr  Dixon  said.  ""We  are,  however,  operating  in  a  global  market  and  there  is  no  room  for  complacency  simply  because  we  are  currently  profitable  and  successful.""  |||    Unions  reacted  angrily  to  the  reported  disclosure,  arguing  that  Qantas  was  profitable  and  did  not  need  to  take  such  action.  ""We  could  understand  if  Qantas  was  a  struggling  airline  about  to  go  under,""  Michael  Mijatov,  international  division  secretary  of  the  Flight  Attendants  Association,  told  Agence  France  Presse.  ""Qantas  announced  a  record  profit  last  year  and  is  on  course  this  year  for  an  even  greater  profit  so  it  is  totally  unnecessary.""  In  an  effort  to  meet  the  challenge  posed  by  low  cost  carriers,  Qantas  sought  a  tie-up  with  Air  New  Zealand  last  year  However,  the  deal  was  thrown  out  by  the  New  Zealand  High  Court  on  competition  grounds."

But,  despite  missing  forecasts  of  53.7,  the  PMI  number  remained  above  50  -  indicating  expansion  in  the  sector.  The  CIPS  said  that  the  strong  pound  had  dented  exports  while  rising  oil  and  metals  prices  had  kept  costs  high.  |||    The  survey  added  that  rising  input  prices  and  cooling  demand  had  deterred  factory  managers  from  hiring  new  workers  in  an  effort  to  cut  costs.  That  triggered  the  second  successive  monthly  fall  in  the  CIPS  employment  index  to  48.3  -  its  lowest  level  since  June  2003.  The  survey  is  more  upbeat  than  official  figures  -  which  suggest  that  manufacturing  is  in  recession  -  but  analysts  said  the  survey  did  suggest  that  the  manufacturing  recovery  was  running  out  of  steam.  ""It  appears  that  the  UK  is  in  a  two-tier  economy  again,""  said  Prebon  Yamane  economist  Lena  Komileva.  ""You  have  weakness  in  manufacturing,  which  I  think  would  concern  policymakers  at  the  Bank  of  England."""

Natasha  Kaplinsky's  Strictly  Come  Dancing  win  was  top  entertainment  moment  and  a  Little  Britain  breast  feeding  sketch  won  the  comedy  prize.  The  2004  TV  Moments  will  be  shown  on  BBC  One  at  2000  GMT  on  Wednesday.  Double  gold  medal  winner  Holmes  topped  the  best  sports  moment  category,  beating  Maria  Sharapova's  Wimbledon  triumph  and  Matthew  Pinsent's  rowing  victory  at  the  Olympics.  |||    She  then  went  on  to  take  the  overall  prize  of  Golden  TV  Moment.  The  sight  of  former  royal  correspondent  Jennie  Bond  with  dozens  of  rats  crawling  over  her  in  ITV's  I'm  a  Celebrity  Get  Me  Out  of  Here  was  named  best  factual  entertainment  moment.  Michael  Buerk's  return  to  Ethiopia,  20  years  after  originally  reporting  its  famine,  topped  the  factual  category  for  BBC  programme  This  World.

In  addition  to  the  penalty,  Monsanto  also  agreed  to  three  years'  close  monitoring  of  its  business  practices  by  the  American  authorities.  It  said  it  accepted  full  responsibility  for  what  it  called  improper  activities.  |||    A  former  senior  manager  at  Monsanto  directed  an  Indonesian  consulting  firm  to  give  a  $50,000  bribe  to  a  high-level  official  in  Indonesia's  environment  ministry  in  2002.  The  manager  told  the  company  to  disguise  an  invoice  for  the  bribe  as  ""consulting  fees"".  |||    Monsanto  was  facing  stiff  opposition  from  activists  and  farmers  who  were  campaigning  against  its  plans  to  introduce  genetically-modified  cotton  in  Indonesia.  Despite  the  bribe,  the  official  did  not  authorise  the  waiving  of  the  environmental  study  requirement.  Monsanto  also  has  admitted  to  paying  bribes  to  a  number  of  other  high-ranking  officials  between  1997  and  2002.  |||    The  chemicals-and-crops  firm  said  it  became  aware  of  irregularities  at  a  Jakarta-based  subsidiary  in  2001  and  launched  an  internal  investigation  before  informing  the  US  Department  of  Justice  and  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC).  Monsanto  faced  both  criminal  and  civil  charges  from  the  Department  of  Justice  and  the  SEC.  ""Companies  cannot  bribe  their  way  into  favourable  treatment  by  foreign  officials,""  said  Christopher  Wray,  assistant  US  attorney  general.  Monsanto  has  agreed  to  pay  $1m  to  the  Department  of  Justice,  adopt  internal  compliance  measures,  and  co-operate  with  continuing  civil  and  criminal  investigations.  It  is  also  paying  $500,000  to  the  SEC  to  settle  the  bribe  charge  and  other  related  violations.  Monsanto  said  it  accepted  full  responsibility  for  its  employees'  actions,  adding  that  it  had  taken  ""remedial  actions  to  address  the  activities  in  Indonesia""  and  had  been  ""fully  co-operative""  throughout  the  investigative  process." 

2	"Blair  moves  to  woo  Jewish  voters  |||    Tony  Blair  has  pledged  to  ""never,  ever,  ever""  attack  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  over  his  Jewish  beliefs.  |||    The  prime  minister  told  the  Jewish  Chronicle:  ""If  you  look  at  what  I  do,  I  attack  Michael  Howard  politically.""  Mr  Blair  also  distanced  himself  from  recent  Labour  campaign  posters  featuring  Mr  Howard,  which  critics  claimed  were  ""anti-Semitic"".  These  were  ""not  intended  to  cause  any  offence  to  anyone  on  the  Jewish  community,""  Mr  Blair  insisted.  |||    One  poster  depicted  Mr  Howard  and  his  shadow  chancellor  Oliver  Letwin,  who  is  also  Jewish,  as  flying  pigs.  Another  pictured  the  Tory  leader  swinging  a  pocket  watch  on  a  chain,  which  critics  said  echoed  the  Jewish  money  lender  Shylock  in  Shakespeare's  Merchant  of  Venice.  |||    Others  compared  the  image  to  the  character  Fagin  in  Charles  Dickens'  Oliver  Twist.  Labour  has  since  taken  the  designs  of  its  website,  saying  members  had  preferred  other  designs.  During  his  interview  with  the  Jewish  Chronicle,  Mr  Blair  said:  ""I've  been  a  very  strong  supporter  of  the  Jewish  community  and  Israel,  and  will  always  be  so.""  Pressed  on  whether  he  would  draw  attention  to  Mr  Howard's  Jewish  beliefs  in  an  attempt  to  attract  Muslim  support,  he  replied:  ""The  idea  that  I  would  allow  anybody  to  make  such  a  charge  is  outrageous.  It's  untrue.  ""If  you  look  what  I  do,  I  attack  Michael  Howard  politically.  I  would  never,  ever,  ever  attack  him  on  that  basis.""  |||    Mr  Blair  also  defended  his  party's  attitude  towards  the  Jewish  community,  pointing  out  that  it  was  his  government  that  had  introduced  the  Holocaust  Memorial  Day.  He  added  that  Labour  also  aggressively  fought  all  forms  of  racism.  |||    Neither  the  Conservatives  nor  the  Liberal  Democrats  wished  to  comment  on  Mr  Blair's  words.  The  prime  minister  was  speaking  as  London's  Labour  mayor  Ken  Livingstone  remains  embroiled  in  a  row  over  comments  he  made  to  a  Jewish  reporter  from  the  city's  Evening  Standard  newspaper.  Mr  Blair  repeated  calls  for  the  mayor  to  apologise  for  likening  the  reporter,  Oliver  Finegold,  to  a  concentration  camp  guard.  Mr  Livingstone  ""should  have  withdrawn  the  comment  immediately""  once  he  realised  the  journalist  was  Jewish,  said  Mr  Blair.  ""I'm  sure  that  is  what  in  truth  he  wants  to  do.  Well,  he  should  do  it.""  Mr  Livingstone  has  said  he  could  not  sincerely  say  sorry  for  the  comments  he  made,  and  claims  he  has  been  targeted  by  the  newspaper.  He  conceded  his  comments  may  have  been  offensive  but  were  not  racist,  and  said  earlier  this  week  he  would  not  apologise  even  if  Mr  Blair  asked."

The  Caribbean  island's  government  said  Disney  planned  to  film  in  Dominica.  The  Caribs  have  long  denied  their  ancestors  practised  cannibalism.  Disney  was  unavailable  for  comment.  ""Our  ancestors  stood  up  against  early  European  conquerors  and  because  they  stood  up...we  were  labelled  savages  and  cannibals  up  to  today,""  said  Mr  Williams.  |||    ""This  cannot  be  perpetuated  in  movies.""  Shooting  on  the  sequel  is  expected  to  begin  in  April,  with  hundreds  of  Dominicans  applying  to  be  extras  in  the  movie.  |||    About  3,000  Caribs  live  on  the  island  of  Dominica,  which  has  a  population  of  70,000.  Many  Caribs  were  killed  by  disease  and  war  during  colonisation  up  to  the  1600s.  Mr  Williams  said  he  had  received  support  from  indigenous  groups  around  the  world  in  his  efforts  to  have  cannibalism  references  removed  from  the  film.  But  he  admitted  there  were  some  members  of  the  Carib  council  who  did  not  support  the  campaign.  He  said  some  did  not  ""understand  our  history,  they  are  weak  and  are  not  committed  to  the  cause  of  the  Carib  people"".  The  first  Pirates  of  the  Caribbean  film  took  $305m  (£162m)  at  the  box  office  in  the  US  alone.  The  cast  and  crew  are  to  work  on  two  sequels  back-to-back,  with  the  first  to  be  released  in  2006." 

0	"India  seeks  to  boost  construction  |||    India  has  cleared  a  proposal  allowing  up  to  100%  foreign  direct  investment  in  its  construction  sector.  |||    Kamal  Nath,  Commerce  and  Industry  Minister,  announced  the  decision  in  Delhi  on  Thursday  following  a  cabinet  meeting.  Analysts  say  improving  India's  infrastructure  will  boost  foreign  investment  in  other  sectors  too.  The  Indian  government's  decision  has  spread  good  cheer  in  the  construction  sector,  according  to  some  Indian  firms.  |||    A  spokesman  for  DLF  Builders,  Dr  Vancheshwar,  told  the  BBC  this  will  mean  ""better  offerings""  for  consumers  as  well  as  builders.  He  said  the  firm  will  benefit  from  world  class  ""strategic  partnerships,  design  expertise  and  technology,  while  consumers  will  have  better  choice.""  |||    The  government  proposal  states  that  foreign  investment  of  up  to  100%  will  be  allowed  on  the  'automatic  route'  in  the  construction  sector,  on  projects  including  housing,  hotels,  resorts,  hospitals  and  educational  establishments.  The  automatic  route  means  that  construction  companies  need  only  get  one  set  of  official  approvals  and  do  not  need  to  gain  clearance  from  the  Foreign  Investment  Promotion  Board,  which  can  be  bureaucratic.  The  government  hopes  its  new  policy  will  create  employment  for  construction  workers,  and  benefit  steel  and  brick-making  industries.  |||    Mr  Nath  also  announced  plans  to  allow  foreign  investors  to  develop  a  smaller  area  of  any  land  they  acquired.  ""Foreign  investors  can  enter  any  construction  development  area,  be  it  to  build  resorts,  townships  or  commercial  premises  but  they  will  have  to  construct  at  least  50,000  square  meters  (538,000  square  feet)  within  a  specific  timeframe,""  said  Mr  Nath,  without  specifying  the  timeframe.  Previously  foreign  investors  had  to  develop  a  much  larger  area,  discouraging  some  from  entering  the  Indian  market.  This  measure  is  designed  to  discourage  foreign  investors  from  buying  and  selling  land  speculatively,  without  developing  it.  Anshuman  Magazine,  managing  director,  of  CB  Richard  Ellis  -  an  international  real  estate  company  -  told  the  BBC  this  was  ""a  big  positive  step.""  |||    However,  Chittabrata  Majumdar,  general  secretary  of  the  Centre  of  Indian  Trade  Unions  (CITU),  said  allowing  FDI  in  the  country  is  compromising  India's  own  ""self  reliance"".  He  said,  ""No  country  can  develop  on  the  basis  of  foreign  investment  alone.""  Mr  Majumdar  also  said  an  assessment  should  be  made  as  to  whether  foreign  investment  is  indeed  beneficial  to  the  country  -  in  terms  of  employment  and  money  generated  -  or  just  another  way  of  international  companies  filling  their  deep  pockets."

The  ""pre-masters""  include  a  take  of  Jailhouse  Rock,  religious  songs,  material  for  his  first  Christmas  album,  and  banter  between  Presley,  members  of  his  band  and  engineer  Thorne  Nogar.  |||    ""We've  had  them  for  a  lot  of  years,  and  I  think  the  people  should  enjoy  them,""  Nogar's  son  Stephen,  57,  said.  ""And  frankly,  we  could  use  the  money.""  Nogar,  who  died  in  1994  aged  72,  always  used  to  make  two  tapes  of  sessions  as  a  back-up  in  case  RCA  producers  wanted  to  make  late  changes  to  songs.  ""He  called  them  his  ass-saver  tapes,""  his  son  said.  The  quality  is  said  to  be  noticeably  crisper  than  that  of  a  new  vinyl  record.  Because  the  family  does  not  own  the  copyright  to  the  music,  the  tapes  can  only  be  sold  for  ""personal  enjoyment""  and  they  cannot  be  copied  for  commercial  gain."

It  took  $19.1m  (£9.9m)  on  Christmas  Day  alone,  the  highest  takings  on  that  day  in  box  office  history.  The  sequel  to  the  Ben  Stiller  comedy  Meet  The  Parents  stars  Robert  De  Niro,  Dustin  Hoffman  and  Barbra  Streisand.  The  success  of  Meet  the  Fockers  could  help  produce  record  box  office  revenue  for  2004,  said  Paul  Dergarabedian,  president  of  the  industry's  tracker  Exhibitor  Relations.  ""We've  had  a  much  stronger  than  anticipated  final  week  of  the  year  that  helped  the  industry  end  on  a  high  note,""  said  Mr  Dergarabedian.  |||    Meet  the  Fockers  also  broke  the  box  office  records  for  the  most  money  taken  on  New  Year's  Eve,  when  it  made  $12.2m  (£6.2m),  and  New  Year's  Day,  when  it  took  $18m  (£9.4m).  The  previous  New  Year's  Eve  record  was  set  in  2000  by  Cast  Away  with  $8.5m  (£4.5m).  The  Lord  of  the  Rings:  The  Return  of  the  King  had  held  the  New  Year's  Day  title  with  $12.8m  (£6.7m).  However,  Christmas  takings  were  down  26.5%  on  2003's  figures  -  which  was  blamed  on  Christmas  falling  over  a  weekend  this  year.  This  weekend's  top  12  films  took  an  estimated  $125.4m  (£65.8m),  a  4.3%  increase  on  the  same  weekend  last  year.  But  there  were  no  major  releases  last  week  to  provide  competition  to  Meet  the  Fockers  or  Lemony  Snicket's  A  Series  of  Unfortunate  Events,  which  finished  in  second  place  with  $14.7m  (£7.7m).  The  Aviator,  starring  Leonardo  DiCaprio  as  Howard  Hughes,  ended  up  in  third  position  after  taking  $11.2m  (£5.9m).  Comedy  Fat  Albert  -  co-written  by  Bill  Cosby  -  moved  down  the  chart  to  fourth  place  after  taking  $10.7m  (£5.6m)." 

0	"Oil  rebounds  from  weather  effect  |||    Oil  prices  recovered  in  Asian  trade  on  Tuesday,  after  falling  in  New  York  on  milder  winter  weather  across  the  US.  |||    With  winter  temperatures  staying  relatively  high  in  the  northern  US,  a  barrel  of  light  crude  ended  Monday  down  $1.33  to  $42.12.  However  crude  prices  have  rebounded  in  Asia,  rising  to  $42.30  a  barrel  for  February  delivery.  In  London,  trading  of  Brent  crude  was  suspended  for  a  public  holiday,  but  the  price  fell  to  $39.20  in  the  Far  East.  |||    With  milder  temperatures  expected  to  continue  in  the  northern  parts  of  the  US  over  the  next  few  days  at  least,  analysts  have  said  the  price  of  oil  may  fall  further  -  even  if  the  decline  was  only  temporary.  ""Weather  has  been  the  Achilles'  heel  of  this  market,""  said  ABN  AMRO  analyst  John  Brady.  ""But  it  is  winter  in  the  northeast.  Eventually  we'll  get  another  cold  blast.""  Despite  a  fall  of  more  than  $12  a  barrel  from  the  record  highs  reached  in  late  October,  the  price  of  crude  oil  remains  almost  30%  higher  than  year-ago  levels.  Prices  rose  last  week  after  militant  attacks  in  Riyadh,  the  capital  of  Saudi  Arabia,  briefly  renewed  fears  that  the  supply  chain  might  be  broken  in  the  world's  leading  crude  exporter.  ""The  market  was  panicked  but  fears  essentially  evaporated...  since  there  was  no  follow-up,""  said  Deborah  White,  senior  economist  for  energy  at  SG  Securities  in  Paris." 

2	"Brown  names  16  March  for  Budget  |||    Chancellor  Gordon  Brown  will  deliver  his  Budget  to  the  House  of  Commons  on  16  March,  the  Treasury  has  announced.  |||    The  Budget,  likely  to  be  the  last  before  the  General  Election,  will  be  at  about  1230  GMT  on  that  Wednesday,  just  after  Prime  Minister's  question  time.  The  annual  event  is  when  the  chancellor  outlines  the  government's  taxation  and  broader  economic  predictions.  The  Tories  say  it  is  likely  the  Budget  will  contain  measures  to  attract  votes.  The  election  is  expected  on  5  May.  |||    Next  month's  Budget  will  be  Mr  Brown's  ninth  since  Labour  came  to  power  in  1997.  If  a  May  election  is  called,  there  could  be  as  little  as  18  days  between  the  Budget  and  the  announcement  of  a  date  for  the  election.  A  shortened  Finance  Bill  would  have  to  be  rushed  through  Parliament  with  all-party  support  to  allow  the  Government  to  continue  collecting  revenue.  |||    The  full  Finance  Bill,  with  the  Budget  measures  in  it,  would  then  be  returned  to  the  Commons  after  the  election,  if  Labour  secures  another  term  in  office.  Tory  shadow  chancellor  Oliver  Letwin  said:  ""We  can  be  sure  of  two  things:  the  Budget  will  contain  measures  to  attract  votes,  and  it  will  not  contain  the  £8  billion  of  tax  rises  which  independent  experts  say  are  inevitable  if  Labour  wins  the  election.""  As  Mr  Brown  announced  the  Budget  date  in  a  short  ministerial  statement,  accountancy  firm  Ernst  &  Young  urged  him  to  put  politics  aside  and  focus  on  the  long-term  requirements  of  the  economy.  ""In  the  Budgets  that  were  given  immediately  before  the  last  six  elections,  taxes  were  cut  by  the  incumbent  chancellor  and,  in  many  cases,  taxes  were  increased  soon  after  the  election  result,""  said  Aidan  O'Carroll,  E&Y's  UK  head  of  tax." 

0	"Indian  oil  firm  eyes  Yukos  assets  |||    India's  biggest  oil  exploration  firm,  Oil  &  Natural  Gas  Corp  (ONGC),  says  it  is  in  talks  to  buy  the  former  assets  of  troubled  Russian  crude  producer  Yukos.  |||    ""We  are  in  touch  with  the  concerned  Russian  entities  about  the  Yukos  assets  and  other  opportunities  in  Russia,""  said  ONGC  chairman  Subir  Raha.  Local  press  had  reported  that  ONGC  was  looking  to  buy  15%  of  Yukos'  former  key  oil  production  unit  for  $2bn  (£1bn).  Yukos  is  being  broken  up  by  Russian  authorities  to  pay  a  massive  tax  bill.  |||    It  was  forced  to  sell  its  key  production  unit  Yuganskneftegas  (Yugansk)  last  month  after  being  hit  with  a  bill  of  $27bn  in  unpaid  taxes  and  fines.  |||    State-owned  Rosneft  now  owns  Yugansk  and  Russia  has  said  it  will  turn  the  oil  producer  into  a  stand-alone  firm.  Indian  oil  minister  Mani  Shankar  Aiyar  discussed  ONGC's  plans  during  a  trip  to  Moscow  last  year,  and  the  topic  came  up  again  during  Russian  president  Vladimir  Putin's  recent  visit  to  New  Delhi.  ""It  would  make  great  sense  for  us  to  build  on  that,""  said  Mr  Aiyar.  India's  oil  production  has  stagnated  over  recent  years,  and  it  is  having  to  look  abroad  to  secure  future  supplies.  India  imports  about  70%  of  its  total  oil  consumption.  At  the  same  time,  India's  economy  is  booming  and  the  country's  thirst  for  oil  is  so  strong  that  it  has  helped  pushed  up  the  price  of  crude  worldwide.  |||    India  produces  about  793,000  barrels  of  oil  per  day  (bpd),  little  changed  since  the  start  of  the  1990s,  according  to  oil  industry  analysts  Douglas-Westwood.  Consumption,  meanwhile,  has  jumped  to  2.4  million  bpd,  compared  with  474,000  bpd  in  1973.  |||    ""For  countries  to  develop,  they  have  to  have  access  to  energy,""  said  John  Westwood,  managing  director  of  oil  industry  analysts  Douglas-Westwood.  India  is  a  ""dramatically  growing  economy  that  must  have  access  to  oil"".  By  buying  into  Yugansk,  ONGC  would  be  able  to  reduce  its  dependence  on  Gulf  states  for  oil  imports,  Mr  Westwood  explained,  especially  as  the  chances  of  finding  and  exploiting  resources  within  India  are  slim.  ""We  forecast  that  Indian  production  will  go  into  significant  decline,""  Mr  Westwood  said.  ""By  2020,  production  may  only  be  at  half  of  today's  levels.""  ONGC,  which  is  majority-owned  by  the  Indian  state,  already  has  bought  petroleum  assets  in  countries  including  Vietnam,  Sudan  and  Russia.  The  company  is  a  partner  with  Rosneft  in  the  Sakhalin-1  oil  field  off  Russia's  Siberian  coast.  |||    ONGC  is,  however,  not  the  only  firm  interested  in  Yugansk.  |||    Chinese  crude  company  China  National  Petroleum  has  also  been  mentioned  as  a  possible  investor,  while  on  Thursday,  Italy  refused  to  rule  out  an  interest.  ONGC's  interest  is  the  latest  twist  in  a  saga  that  has  seen  one  of  the  world's  biggest  oil  producers  brought  to  its  knees.  The  dispute  is  partly  driven  by  President  Putin's  clampdown  on  the  political  ambitions  of  ex-Yukos  boss  Mikhail  Khodorkovsky,  who  is  currently  in  jail  on  charges  of  fraud  and  tax  evasion.  Yukos  has  been  battling  the  Russian  authorities  for  more  than  a  year  and  has  filed  for  bankruptcy  protection  in  the  US.  Analysts  have  questioned  how  long  it  can  continue  to  survive  without  Yugansk.  On  Thursday,  a  US  court  said  it  will  hear  arguments  for  Yukos'  bankruptcy  claim  to  be  thrown  out  on  16  February.  Should  that  happen,  Yukos  will  have  little  chance  of  clawing  back  its  assets,  analysts  said." 

2	"Lib  Dems  predict  'best  ever  poll'  |||    The  Lib  Dems  are  set  for  their  best  results  in  both  the  general  election  and  the  local  council  polls,  one  of  their  frontbenchers  has  predicted.  |||    Local  government  spokesman  Ed  Davey  was  speaking  as  the  party  launched  its  campaign  for  the  local  elections  being  held  in  37  English  council  areas.  The  flagship  pledge  is  to  replace  council  tax  with  a  local  income  tax.  The  Tories  say  the  Lib  Dems  would  make  people  pay  more  tax  and  Labour  says  the  party's  sums  do  not  add  up.  Looking  to  the  coming  elections,  which  are  all  expected  to  be  held  on  5  May,  Mr  Davey  said:  ""We  are  going  to  be  winning  more  votes  and  winning  more  seats.  ""I  think  we  are  going  to  have  the  best  general  election  results  and  local  election  results  we  have  ever  had  under  [party  leader]  Charles  Kennedy.  ""I  couldn't  think  of  a  stronger  endorsement  of  a  leader.""" 

2	"Blair's  hope  for  Blunkett  return  |||    The  events  leading  to  David  Blunkett's  resignation  must  not  ""swept  under  the  carpet"",  the  Tories  have  warned.  |||    On  Wednesday  Tony  Blair  said  he  hoped  the  former  home  secretary  would  serve  again  in  government  in  the  future.  Mr  Blunkett  quit  in  December  after  a  probe  linked  him  to  the  visa  application  of  his  ex-lover's  nanny.  Mr  Blair  said  he  left  ""without  a  stain  on  his  character""  but  Tory  Dominic  Grieve  branded  the  way  Mr  Blunkett's  office  operated  as  ""scandalous"".  Mr  Blair  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme:  ""I  know  David  very  well  and  I  believe  him  to  be  a  man  of  real  integrity  and  real  ability  and  I  was  very  sad  for  him  as  to  what  happened.""  |||    He  said  Mr  Blunkett  still  had  an  immense  amount  to  offer  the  country  but  he  was  not  making  any  ""guarantees  or  definitive  statements""  about  future  jobs.  But  shadow  attorney  general  Mr  Grieve  said:  ""While  I  don't  rule  out  the  possibility  that  Mr  Blunkett  may  return  as  a  minister,  I  don't  think  it's  something  that  can  simply  be  brushed  under  the  carpet.""  Senior  Labour  backbencher  Martin  O'Neill,  who  chairs  the  Commons  trade  committee,  said  he  believed  the  prime  minister  would  want  one  of  his  ""praetorian  guard""  -  a  reference  to  the  elite  body  guard  of  Roman  emperors  -  back  alongside  him.  But  colleague  Ian  Gibson,  who  chairs  the  science  and  technology  committee,  said  there  was  a  ""question  mark""  as  to  whether  Mr  Blunkett  could  serve  at  cabinet  level  again." 

2	"UK  troops  on  Ivory  Coast  standby  |||    Downing  Street  has  confirmed  British  troops  are  on  standby  in  case  they  need  to  help  evacuate  several  hundred  UK  citizens  from  Ivory  Coast.  |||    The  news  came  as  it  emerged  France  had  begun  evacuating  its  hostages  after  days  of  anti-French  demonstrations.  Trouble  flared  after  nine  French  peacekeepers  were  killed  and  President  Jacques  Chirac  ordered  the  destruction  of  the  Ivory  Coast's  air  force.  A  company  of  100-120  UK  troops  is  understood  to  have  been  put  on  standby.  They  are  ready  to  fly  out  and  secure  the  route  from  the  embassy  to  the  airport  if  called  upon.  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair's  official  spokesman  said:  ""There  are  British  nationals  in  Ivory  Coast  and  as  you  can  imagine  we  are  making  the  usual  contingency  plans  in  case  the  situation  deteriorates  further,  but  that's  all  I  can  say  at  this  stage.""  |||    He  added  the  situation  would  be  monitored  carefully  in  case  evacuation  became  necessary.  France  has  played  a  lead  role  in  international  peacekeeping  in  Ivory  Coast  -  a  former  colony  -  after  President  Laurent  Gbagbo  broke  an  18-month  ceasefire  with  rebels  bombing  their  positions  and  killing  the  nine  French  soldiers.  The  decision  to  destroy  the  African  nation's  small  air  force  prompted  riots  against  French  and  other  foreign  nationals.  The  Spanish  have  already  put  their  forces  on  standby  to  evacuate  their  nationals  if  necessary." 

0	"Argentina,  Venezuela  in  oil  deal  |||    Argentina  and  Venezuela  have  extended  a  food-for-oil  deal,  which  helped  the  former  to  overcome  a  severe  energy  crisis  last  year.  |||    Argentine  President  Nestor  Kirchner  and  Venezuelan  President  Hugo  Chavez  signed  the  deal  in  Buenos  Aires  on  Tuesday.  Last  April,  Argentina  signed  a  $240m  agreement  to  import  Venezuelan  fuel  in  exchange  for  agricultural  goods  and  this  deal  has  now  been  extended.  Venezuela  will  now  import  cattle,  medicines  and  medical  equipment.  Last  year,  Argentina's  severe  energy  crisis  forced  President  Kirchner  to  suspend  gas  exports  to  Chile.  Argentina  fears  that  rising  demand  could  spark  another  crisis  and  wants  to  prevent  it  by  signing  this  deal.  The  two  countries  also  formalised  a  co-operation  deal  between  Venezuelan  energy  firm  PDVSA  and  Argentina's  Enarsa.  Under  this  deal,  the  Argentine  market  will  be  opened  to  Venezuelan  investment.  President  Chavez  added  that  Brazil's  Petrobras  could  join  soon  the  co-operation  deal.  President  Chavez  is  an  ardent  promoter  of  the  concept  of  a  South  American  oil  company,  which  could  include  the  state-owned  companies  of  Venezuela,  Argentina,  Brazil  and  Bolivia.  The  two  presidents  also  agreed  to  create  'Television  Sur',  a  Latin  American  network  of  state-owned  television  channels." 

0	"US  prepares  for  hybrid  onslaught  |||    Sales  of  hybrid  cars  in  the  US  are  set  to  double  in  2005,  research  suggests.  |||    Research  group  JD  Power  estimates  sales  will  hit  200,000  in  2005,  despite  higher  prices  and  customer  scepticism.  Carmakers  are  starting  to  build  hybrid  sports  utility  vehicles  (SUVs),  the  four-wheel-drive  vehicles  which  now  dominate  the  US  car  market.  Hybrids  cut  both  petrol  consumption  and  emissions  by  combining  a  petrol  engine  with  an  electric  motor  constantly  kept  charged  by  extra  engine  power.  Several  jurisdictions,  notably  the  state  of  California,  mandate  low  emissions  for  new  cars.  Equally,  the  rise  in  oil  prices  over  the  past  year  has  sparked  hopes  that  consumers  may  be  tempted  by  potential  savings  of  a  few  hundred  dollars  a  year  on  fuel.  |||    At  the  Detroit  Motor  Show,  a  range  of  manufacturers  are  prominently  displaying  their  hybrid  credentials.  Toyota  has  led  the  market  to  date  with  the  Prius,  popularised  by  a  number  of  celebrities  keen  to  burnish  their  ""green""  credentials.  In  April  it  will  launch  a  hybrid  version  of  its  Highlander  SUV,  with  an  SUV  from  its  luxury  Lexus  marque  due  later  in  the  year.  |||    Honda  has  three  hybrids  on  the  market,  and  between  them  the  two  Japanese  carmakers  sold  more  than  80,000  units  last  year.  Ford,  which  has  sold  4,000  of  its  first  hybrid  since  its  launch  in  August,  is  bringing  a  hybrid  SUV  -  the  Mariner  -  to  market  a  year  ahead  of  schedule,  with  plans  for  three  more  models  by  2008.  GM  has  a  hybrid  pickup  on  the  market  and  is  showing  two  concept  SUVs  in  Detroit.  Even  sports  car  maker  Porsche  may  join  the  race,  although  it  insists  it  is  still  considering  whether  to  hybridise  its  Cayenne  SUV.  |||    Others  remain  more  sceptical.  Nissan  has  bought  Toyota's  hybrid  technology,  but  plans  to  bring  out  its  first  model  only  in  2006.  ""We  want  to  make  sure  we  are  not  concentrating  on  one  technology,""  Nissan  chief  executive  Carlos  Ghosn  said.  ""We  will  not  be  surprised  by  any  acceleration  or  deceleration  in  the  hybrid  market.""  Volkswagen,  meanwhile,  says  it  will  focus  on  clean-burning  diesel  engines  instead.  And  some  watchers  point  out  that  the  price  tag  on  a  hybrid  -  upwards  of  $3,000  above  that  of  an  equivalent  normal-engined  car,  and  suspicion  of  the  technology  -  may  still  cool  its  attraction.  ""The  average  consumers  aren't  willing  to  pay  that  premium  for  a  car  they  won't  drive  more  than  six  years,""  said  Anthony  Pratt  from  JD  Power." 

2	"Blair  defends  terror  law  changes  |||    The  prime  minister  has  defended  measures  to  allow  house  arrest  without  trial,  saying  ""several  hundred""  people  in  the  UK  are  plotting  terror  attacks.  |||    The  government  is  facing  opposition  from  Tory  and  Lib  Dem  MPs  and  its  own  backbenchers  as  it  prepares  for  the  final  Commons  debate  on  the  changes.  But  Tony  Blair  said  there  could  be  no  concession  on  the  ""basic  principle"".  Mr  Blair  told  the  BBC  the  ""control  orders""  would  only  be  used  in  the  most  limited  circumstances.  Critics  in  the  opposition  and  civil  rights  activists  are  worried  that  the  home  secretary  will  have  the  power  to  issue  the  detention  orders.  But  the  government  has  so  far  resisted  pressure  for  judges  to  be  responsible  for  making  the  orders,  instead  saying  judges  will  be  able  to  quash  them.  |||    An  explanation  is  being  sent  by  Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  to  all  MPs  and  peers  ahead  of  the  final  debate  in  the  House  of  Commons.  On  Sunday,  Conservative  shadow  home  secretary  David  Davis  claimed  judges  would  get  the  powers  to  issue  detention  orders.  And  Liberal  Democrat  leader  Charles  Kennedy  said  some  concessions  had  already  been  offered  by  the  government  during  last-minute  negotiations.  Some  32  Labour  MPs  voted  against  the  legislation  last  week.  Barbara  Follett,  whose  first  husband  was  killed  while  under  house  arrest  in  South  Africa  during  the  apartheid  era,  confirmed  she  would  vote  against  the  government.  |||    But  the  government  is  continuing  to  insist  that  ""control  orders""  must  be  issued  by  the  home  secretary.  Mr  Blair  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Woman's  Hour:  ""We  are  being  advised  by  the  police  and  the  security  services...  ""What  they  say  is  you  have  got  to  give  us  powers  in  between  mere  surveillance  of  these  people  -  there  are  several  hundred  of  them  in  this  country  who  we  believe  are  engaged  in  plotting  or  trying  to  commit  terrorist  acts  -  you  have  got  to  give  us  power  in  between  just  surveying  them  and  being  able,  being  sure  enough  of  the  proof,  to  prosecute  them  beyond  reasonable  doubt.  ""And  these  will  be  restrictions  on  their  liberty  that  we  will  use  only  in  the  most  limited  circumstances.""  |||    A  YouGov  poll  in  the  Daily  Telegraph  suggested  75%  of  respondents  thought  action  was  sometimes  necessary  against  people  who  had  not  committed  an  offence  but  who  had  been  found  by  intelligence  services  to  be  planning  a  terrorist  attack.  But  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  told  BBC  News  that  the  government  was  again  making  a  mistake  in  ""rushing""  anti-terrorism  legislation.  ""I  very  much  hope  it  would  be  possible  to  reach  a  compromise  on  this.""  He  said  after  meeting  Tony  Blair  he  had  been  left  with  the  impression  that  ""he  really  wasn't  interested  in  any  of  the  various  proposals  we  have  put  forward"".  Mr  Clarke  wants  house  arrest  and  other  powers  to  replace  indefinite  jail  for  terror  suspects  -  something  the  law  lords  have  ruled  against  on  the  basis  that  it  breaches  human  rights.  BBC  political  correspondent  Vicky  Young  said  some  form  of  concession  on  the  measures  was  likely  to  be  needed  to  get  the  legislation  through  the  House  of  Lords,  where  Labour  does  not  have  a  majority  and  would  require  support  from  other  parties.  Shami  Chakrabarti,  director  of  civil  liberties  pressure  group  Liberty,  said  who  was  able  to  issue  the  control  orders  was  not  the  main  issue.  She  said  the  legislation  was  ""a  travesty  and  a  perversion  of  justice""  and  would  remain  ""unpalatable""  even  if  a  judge  was  involved  early  in  the  process." 

3	"O'Driscoll  saves  Irish  blushes  |||    Two  moments  of  magic  from  Brian  O'Driscoll  guided  Ireland  to  a  workmanlike  victory  against  Italy.  |||    A  pair  of  classic  outside  breaks  from  the  Ireland  captain  set  up  tries  for  Geordan  Murphy  and  Peter  Stringer.  Italy  led  9-8  early  in  the  second  half  but  Stringer's  try  gave  Ireland  a  lead  they  never  lost.  The  hosts  cut  the  gap  to  18-12  with  10  minutes  left  and  nearly  scored  through  Ludovico  Nitoglia,  but  Denis  Hickie's  try  ensured  an  Irish  victory.  Italy  came  flying  out  of  the  blocks  and  took  the  lead  through  a  Luciano  Orquera  penalty  after  seven  minutes.  |||    It  could  have  been  better  for  the  hosts  but  the  fly-half  missed  two  kickable  penalties  and  Ireland  drew  level  with  a  Ronan  O'Gara  penalty  midway  through  the  first  half.  The  Italians  were  driving  at  the  heart  of  the  Irish  defence  and,  for  the  first  quarter,  the  Irish  pack  struggled  to  secure  any  ball  for  their  talented  backs.  |||    When  they  finally  did,  just  before  the  half-hour  mark,  O'Driscoll  promptly  created  a  sparkling  try  for  Murphy.  The  Ireland  captain  ran  a  dummy  scissors  and  made  a  magical  outside  break  before  drawing  the  full-back  and  putting  the  diving  Murphy  in  at  the  corner.  O'Gara  missed  the  twice-taken  conversion  and  the  visitors  found  themselves  trailing  once  again.  Roland  de  Marigny  took  over  the  kicking  duties  for  Italy  from  the  hapless  Orquera,  and  he  landed  a  penalty  either  side  of  the  break  to  edge  Italy  into  a  9-8  lead.  |||    The  only  Ireland  player  offering  a  real  threat  was  O'Driscoll,  and  it  was  his  break  that  set  up  the  second  try  for  the  visitors.  Shane  Horgan  threw  an  overhead  pass  as  he  was  about  to  be  forced  into  touch  and  Stringer  scooted  over,  with  O'Gara  landing  the  tricky  conversion.  A  penalty  apiece  saw  Ireland  leading  18-12  as  the  game  entered  the  final  quarter,  but  they  were  lucky  to  survive  when  Italy  launched  a  series  of  attacks.  Winger  Nitoglia  dropped  the  ball  as  he  reached  for  the  line  and  Italy  nearly  rumbled  over  from  a  driving  maul.  |||    An  O'Gara  penalty  put  Ireland  more  than  a  converted  try  ahead  and  they  made  the  game  safe  when  Hickie  latched  onto  an  inside  pass  from  Murphy  and  crossed  for  a  converted  try.  O'Driscoll  limped  off  late  on,  joining  centre  partner  Gordon  D'Arcy  on  the  sidelines,  and  the  final  word  went  to  Italy.  Prop  Martin  Castrogiovanni  powered  over  for  a  try  which  was  fitting  reward  for  an  Italian  pack  which  had  kept  the  Irish  under  pressure  throughout.  |||    De  Marigny;  Mi  Bergamasco,  Canale,  Masi,  Nitoglia;  Orquera,  Troncon;  Lo  Cicero,  Ongaro,  Castrogiovanni;  Dellape,  Bortolami;  Persico,  Ma  Bergamasco,  Parisse.  |||    Perugini,  Intoppa,  Del  Fava,  Dal  Maso,  Griffen,  Pozzebon,  Robertson.  |||    Murphy,  Horgan,  O'Driscoll,  D'Arcy,  Hickie,  O'Gara,  Stringer,  Corrigan,  Byrne,  Hayes,  O'Kelly,  O'Connell,  S  Easterby,  Leamy,  Foley.  |||    Sheahan,  Horan,  O'Callaghan,  Miller,  G  Easterby,  Humphreys,  Dempsey.  |||    P  O'Brien  (New  Zealand)" 

1	"Court  halts  Mark  Morrison  album  |||    Premiership  footballer  and  record  company  boss  Kevin  Campbell  has  gained  a  court  injunction  stopping  R&B  singer  Mark  Morrison  from  releasing  an  album.  |||    The  Everton  striker  signed  Morrison  to  his  fledging  2  Wikid  Records  label  and  claims  he  spent  thousands  of  pounds  producing  his  album  Innocent  Man.  Now  he  is  attempting  to  prevent  Morrison  releasing  the  album  on  Monday  through  another  label.  But  Morrison  vowed  to  ignore  the  order,  saying  ""no  judge  is  gonna  stop  me"".  |||    Morrison,  who  is  now  as  well  known  for  his  brushes  with  the  law  than  his  music  career,  rose  to  fame  with  the  1996  single  Return  of  the  Mack.  |||    But  the  Leicester  singer  has  struggled  to  repeat  its  success  following  two  spells  in  jail.  One  was  for  hiring  a  stand-in  to  complete  his  community  service  for  possession  of  a  stun  gun  and  three-months  following  a  nightclub  fracas.  He  signed  to  Mr  Campbell's  label  a  year  ago  and  has  released  one  single,  with  the  label  saying  the  album  was  due  for  release  on  24  January.  But  Mr  Campbell  said  he  learned  that  Morrison  planned  to  release  the  album  through  Jet  Star,  which  is  advertising  it  on  its  website.  Mr  Campbell  said:  ""I'm  glad  we  were  granted  the  injunction  but  I'm  completely  gutted  that  we  have  had  to  go  that  far.  ""Mark  Morrison  was  given  everything  he  asked  for  by  2  Wikid  but  it  seems  that  he  couldn't  help  but  return  to  his  old  ways.  |||    ""I've  worked  hard  to  realise  my  ambition  in  football  but  had  hoped  that  my  future  career  would  be  in  the  music  business.  ""I  have  always  dreamt  of  starting  a  record  label  but  now  Mark  Morrison  has  spoilt  that  dream  for  me.  There  is  no  loyalty  in  this  business  -  just  greed.""  |||    But  Morrison  is  determined  the  album  will  be  released  on  Monday.  He  said:  ""The  injunction  is  ludicrous.  ""I  signed  a  new  deal  with  a  new  record  company  because  I  was  not  getting  the  support  I  needed  from  2  Wikid.  ""I  was  with  that  label  for  a  year  and  in  that  time  released  just  one  record,  which  was  not  properly  promoted.  He  added:  ""The  whole  world  is  waiting  for  this  album  and  it  will  come  out  on  December  27.  No  injunction  or  judge  will  stop  it.  The  Mack  will  return.""  The  case  is  set  to  be  heard  in  the  High  Court  on  20  December." 

0	"SEC  to  rethink  post-Enron  rules  |||    The  US  stock  market  watchdog's  chairman  has  said  he  is  willing  to  soften  tough  new  US  corporate  governance  rules  to  ease  the  burden  on  foreign  firms.  |||    In  a  speech  at  the  London  School  of  Economics,  William  Donaldson  promised  ""several  initiatives"".  European  firms  have  protested  that  US  laws  introduced  after  the  Enron  scandal  make  Wall  Street  listings  too  costly.  The  US  regulator  said  foreign  firms  may  get  extra  time  to  comply  with  a  key  clause  in  the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act.  |||    The  Act  comes  into  force  in  mid-2005.  It  obliges  all  firms  with  US  stock  market  listings  to  make  declarations,  which,  critics  say,  will  add  substantially  to  the  cost  of  preparing  their  annual  accounts.  |||    Firms  that  break  the  new  law  could  face  huge  fines,  while  senior  executives  risk  jail  terms  of  up  to  20  years.  Mr  Donaldson  said  that  although  the  Act  does  not  provide  exemptions  for  foreign  firms,  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  would  ""continue  to  be  sensitive  to  the  need  to  accomodate  foreign  structures  and  requirements"".  There  are  few,  if  any,  who  disagree  with  the  intentions  of  the  Act,  which  obliges  chief  executives  to  sign  a  statement  taking  responsibility  for  the  accuracy  of  the  accounts.  But  European  firms  with  secondary  listings  in  New  York  have  objected  -  arguing  that  the  compliance  costs  outweigh  the  benefits  of  a  dual  listing.  The  Act  also  applies  to  firms  with  more  than  300  US  shareholders,  a  situation  many  firms  without  US  listings  could  find  themselves  in.  |||    The  300-shareholder  threshold  has  drawn  anger  as  it  effectively  blocks  the  most  obvious  remedy,  a  delisting.  Mr  Donaldson  said  the  SEC  would  ""consider  whether  there  should  be  a  new  approach  to  the  deregistration  process""  for  foreign  firms  unwilling  to  meet  US  requirements.  |||    ""We  should  seek  a  solution  that  will  preserve  investor  protections""  without  turning  the  US  market  into  ""one  with  no  exit"",  he  said.  He  revealed  that  his  staff  were  already  weighing  up  the  merits  of  delaying  the  implementation  of  the  Act's  least  popular  measure  -  Section  404  -  for  foreign  firms.  Seen  as  particularly  costly  to  implement,  Section  404  obliges  chief  executives  to  take  responsibility  for  the  firm's  internal  controls  by  signing  a  compliance  statement  in  the  annual  accounts.  The  SEC  has  already  delayed  implementation  of  this  clause  for  smaller  firms  -  including  US  ones  -  with  market  capitalisations  below  $700m  (£374m).  |||    A  delegation  of  European  firms  visited  the  SEC  in  December  to  press  for  change,  the  Financial  Times  reported.  |||    It  was  led  by  Digby  Jones,  director  general  of  the  UK's  Confederation  of  British  Industry  (CBI)  and  included  representatives  of  BASF,  Siemens  and  Cadbury  Schweppes.  Compliance  costs  are  already  believed  to  be  making  firms  wary  of  US  listings.  Air  China  picked  the  London  Stock  Exchange  for  its  secondary  listing  in  its  $1.07bn  (£558m)  stock  market  debut  last  month.  There  are  also  rumours  that  two  Chinese  state-run  banks  -  China  Construction  Bank  and  Bank  of  China  -  have  abandoned  plans  for  multi-billion  dollar  listings  in  New  York  later  this  year.  Instead,  the  cost  of  Sarbanes-Oxley  has  persuaded  them  to  stick  to  a  single  listing  in  Hong  Kong,  according  to  press  reports  in  China." 

2	"Blair  sees  greater  Bush  consensus  |||    George  W  Bush  will  display  a  more  consensual  approach  to  world  politics  as  he  begins  his  second  term  as  US  President,  Tony  Blair  has  said.  |||    The  prime  minister  said  Mr  Bush  had  learned  military  force  was  not  the  only  way  to  fight  terrorism.  He  understood  that  ""the  best  prospect  of  peaceful  co-existence  lies  in  the  spread  of  democracy  and  human  rights"",  Mr  Blair  told  the  Guardian  newspaper.  Mr  Bush  was  sworn  in  at  a  ceremony  in  Washington  DC  on  Thursday.  |||    Echoing  the  new  US  Secretary  of  State  Condoleezza  Rice,  the  prime  minister  said  there  has  been  a  clear  evolution  of  US  policy  since  the  war  in  Afghanistan  in  2001.  Mr  Blair  had  personally  seen  the  change  over  time  in  conversations  with  Mr  Bush.  The  president  understood  that  while  military  and  security  measures  were  important,  there  also  needed  to  be  a  multilateral  approach  to  solving  the  world's  problems.  |||    Turning  to  critics'  fears  that  the  US  was  poised  for  further  military  action,  Mr  Blair  refused  to  give  succour  to  suggestions  it  was  preparing  for  strikes  against  Iran.  The  prime  minister  conceded  that  the  US  had  ""what  appears  to  be  a  harder  position""  towards  the  state  than  Europe.  But  the  prime  minister  pointed  out  that  until  now  the  US  had  allowed  Britain,  France  and  Germany  to  take  the  lead  in  trying  to  halt  the  Iranian  nuclear  programme.  Following  claims  that  US  forces  had  worked  inside  Iran  to  identify  potential  targets,  Mr  Blair  was  asked  if  the  SAS  had  also  been  in  the  country.  ""We  never  answer  questions  about  special  forces,  but  do  not  take  that  as  indicating  an  affirmative,""  said  Mr  Blair.  |||    Mr  Blair  said  he  believed  the  president  was  keen  to  work  with  other  countries  while  trying  to  spread  democracy  and  human  rights.  ""It  is  significant,  in  my  view,  that  he  is  coming  to  Europe  as  his  first  foreign  visit,""  said  Mr  Blair.  Following  his  inauguration,  Mr  Bush  is  due  in  Europe  at  the  end  of  January."

1	"'Christmas  song  formula'  unveiled  |||    A  formula  for  the  ultimate  Christmas  single  has  been  revealed  by  chart  bible  British  Hit  Singles  and  Albums.  |||    The  recipe  includes  a  reference  to  Father  Christmas,  sleigh  bells,  a  children's  choir  and  a  charity  element.  The  song  should  also  include  Christmas  in  the  title,  wishes  for  peace  on  earth  and  lots  of  airplay  at  office  parties.

Nonethless,  the  figures  represent  less  than  1%  of  India's  overall  exports.  But  business  is  expected  to  be  boosted  further  from  2006  when  the  South  Asian  Free  Trade  Area  Agreement  starts.  Both  countries  eased  travel  and  other  restrictions  as  part  of  the  peace  process  aimed  at  ending  nearly  six  decades  of  hostilities.  |||    Sugar,  plastics,  pharmaceutical  products  and  tea  are  among  the  major  exports  from  India  to  its  neighbour,  while  firms  in  Pakistani  have  been  selling  fabrics,  fruit  and  spices.  ""If  the  positive  trend  continues,  two-way  trade  could  well  cross  half  a  billion  dollars  this  fiscal  year,""  India's  federal  commerce  Minister  Kamal  Nath  said.  According  to  official  data,  the  value  of  India's  overall  exports  in  the  current  fiscal  year  is  expected  to  reach  more  than  $60bn,  while  in  Pakistan's  case  it  is  set  to  hit  more  than  $12bn.  Meanwhile,  the  Indian  Government  said  the  prospects  for  the  country's  booming  economy  remained  ""very  bright""  despite  a  ""temporary  aberration""  this  year.  Its  mid-year  economic  review  forecasts  growth  of  6-6.5%  in  2004,  compared  with  8.2%  in  2003.  Higher  oil  prices,  the  level  of  tax  collections,  and  an  unfavourable  monsoon  season  affecting  the  farm  sector  had  hurt  the  economy  in  April-September,  it  said."

Airlines  and  aviation  bodies  have  reacted  strongly  against  the  plans,  saying  they  would  hurt  companies  at  a  time  when  earnings  are  under  pressure.  The  EU  said  a  tax  would  only  be  passed  after  full  consultation  with  airlines.  It  was  keen  to  point  out  earlier  this  week  that  any  new  tax  on  jet  fuel  should  not  hurt  the  ""competitiveness  of  the  airlines"".  Ministers  will  also  be  discussing  reforms  to  regulations  governing  European  public  spending.  |||    Global  leaders  have  focused  attention  on  poverty  reduction  and  development  at  recent  meetings  of  the  G7  Group  and  World  Economic  Forum.  The  world's  richest  countries  have  said  they  want  to  boost  the  amount  of  aid  they  give  to  0.7%  of  their  annual  gross  national  income  by  2015.  Many  EU  ministers  are  thought  to  support  the  plan  to  tax  jet  fuel  -  tabled  by  France  and  Germany  following  the  recent  G7  meeting.  At  present,  the  fuel  used  by  airlines  enjoys  either  a  very  low  tax  rate  or  is  untaxed  in  EU  member  states." 

2	"Blair  backs  'pre-election  budget'  |||    Tony  Blair  has  backed  Chancellor  Gordon  Brown's  pre-Budget  report  amid  opposition  claims  he  was  too  bullish  about  the  state  of  the  UK  economy.  |||    In  a  speech  in  Edinburgh,  the  prime  minister  said  Thursday's  report  reinforced  stability  and  opportunity.  And  that  would  be  central  to  Labour's  next  election  campaign,  planning  for  which  was  already  well  advanced.  Mr  Brown  earlier  denied  his  economic  forecasts  were  too  optimistic  -  but  refused  to  rule  out  future  tax  rises.  |||    He  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme:  ""No  politician  should  make  the  mistake  that  John  Major  and  his  colleagues  made  in  1992  of  saying  no  matter  what  the  circumstances  are,  they  can  make  all  sorts  of  guarantees  on  every  individual  thing.  |||    ""That  is  not  what  politicians  should  do,  it  would  not  be  responsible  to  do.""  Mr  Brown  insisted  his  spending  plans  were  ""affordable""  and  he  could  afford  to  be  optimistic  because  Britain  was  now  a  stable,  low-inflation  economy  and  house  prices  were  now  stabilising.  Mr  Blair  praised  his  chancellor  for  his  role  in  creating  economic  stability,  which  he  said  was  the  ""cornerstone""  of  Labour's  programme.  |||    In  a  speech  at  Edinburgh's  Napier  University,  he  said  Labour  would  publish  over  the  next  few  months  ""a  rich  agenda  for  future  policy  in  any  possible  third  term"".  |||    ""In  every  area  of  work  there  is  a  detailed  plan  for  the  future,  much  clearer  than  those  in  1997  or  2001.  All  of  it  fits  together  around  common  themes  of  opportunity,  security  and  stability  for  all,""  Mr  Blair  said.  In  his  pre-Budget  report,  Mr  Brown  surprised  some  City  experts  by  forecasting  UK  growth  at  between  3%  and  3.5%  for  next  year.  Many  believe  the  figure  is  more  likely  to  be  under  3%  -  and  fear  tax  rises  or  spending  cuts,  saying  tax  receipts  have  been  overestimated.  Carl  Emmerson,  from  the  Institute  for  Fiscal  Studies,  told  BBC  News:  ""He  thinks  everything  will  come  out  in  the  wash  and  it  will,  in  fact,  be  OK.  We're  not  so  sure.""  David  Page,  of  Investec  Securities,  said:  ""His  forecast  that  he  will  meet  the  golden  rule  with  a  margin  of  £8bn  is  way  too  optimistic.  ""It's  going  to  take  a  significant  turnaround  in  the  economy  to  meet  these  targets.""  |||    Conservative  Shadow  chancellor  Oliver  Letwin  said:  ""I  can't  find  a  single  economic  forecaster  from  the  IMF  to  the  Institute  of  Fiscal  Studies  who  believes  anything  other  than  the  chancellor  has  got  a  black  hole  in  his  finances.  ""In  order  to  deal  with  that  he  will  have  to  raise  taxes  after  the  next  general  election.""  Mr  Letwin  accused  the  chancellor  of  using  ""fancy  statistics""  to  hide  public  service  failures.  Vincent  Cable,  for  the  Liberal  Democrats,  called  on  Mr  Brown  to  open  up  the  government's  books  to  the  National  Audit  Office,  to  see  if  he  had  met  his  ""golden  rule"".  ""It  is  very  clear  that  there  are  some  serious  loose  ends  in  government  public  spending,""  Mr  Cable  told  MPs."

He  told  delegates  that  Labour  had  abused  the  public's  trust  and  that  the  Tories  had  failed  to  oppose  them.  In  response,  the  Conservatives  insisted  that  theirs  was  the  party  that  understood  the  ""forgotten  majority"".  |||    Speaking  in  Harrogate  Mr  Kennedy  said:  ""People  want  a  credible,  principled  political  party  which  offers  a  different  vision  of  what  Britain  can  be.""  |||    Only  the  Liberal  Democrats  stood  against  the  Iraq  war,  he  said,  and  they  had  also  provided  strong  opposition  to  the  government's  plans  on  ID  cards,  anti-terror  measures  and  taxation.  He  said:  ""If  you  voted  Conservative  in  2001  ...  what  good  did  it  do  you?  Your  vote  was  wasted.  ""What  people  needed  was  ...  a  party  which  was  listening  to  their  concerns;  a  party  which  was  prepared  to  stand  up  and  say  so;  a  party  which  said  no  to  the  prime  minister.""  Responding  to  the  claims  Tory  Party  co-chairman  Liam  Fox  said:  ""Like  Labour,  the  Lib  Dems  are  soft  on  crime,  support  higher  taxes,  oppose  controlled  immigration  and  support  giving  Europe  more  control  over  our  lives.""  |||    Mr  Kennedy  also  outlined  his  party's  plan  to  impose  a  50%  income  tax  rate  on  earnings  over  £100,000  a  year.  The  money  would  be  used  to  help  pay  for  key  policies  such  as  abolishing  university  tuition  fees,  scrapping  council  tax  in  favour  of  local  income  tax,  and  providing  free  care  for  the  elderly,  he  said.  Labour  and  the  Tories  claim  the  sums  do  not  add  up,  and  that  working  families  would  be  hardest  hit.  Mr  Kennedy  said:  ""Britain  is  the  fourth-largest  economy  in  the  world.  We  have  world  class  businesses  and  a  world  class  workforce.  |||    ""So  why  are  two  million  of  our  pensioners  living  below  the  poverty  line?""  All  the  parties  are  campaigning  hard  for  an  expected  election  in  May,  although  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  has  not  confirmed  any  timing.  Earlier,  Mr  Kennedy  told  Radio  4's  Today  programme  there  was  no  possibility  of  forming  a  coalition  with  Labour  in  the  event  of  a  hung  Parliament.  ""We  go  into  the  election  as  an  independent  party  and  we  come  out  as  an  independent  party,""  he  said.  Mr  Kennedy  has  been  under  fire  in  recent  days  for  missing  Monday's  Commons  vote  on  the  government's  controversial  anti-terrorism  laws,  along  with  16  other  Lib  Dem  MPs.  On  Saturday,  the  Lib  Dem  chief  executive  said  it  was  ""just  a  cock-up""  that  Mr  Kennedy  and  his  colleagues  missed  the  vote,  which  the  government  won  by  a  majority  of  only  14.  ""Nobody  had  any  idea  that  was  going  to  happen,""  Lord  Rennard  told  reporters  at  the  party  conference.  He  said  he  was  certain  MPs  would  get  another  chance  to  vote  against  the  plans."

Open  Water,  Napoleon  Dynamite,  Garden  State  and  Super-Size  Me  were  all  snapped  up  at  last  year's  festival.  But  stars  like  Keanu  Reeves  and  Pierce  Brosnan  also  have  films  showing  there.  The  festival  is  being  opened  by  a  screening  of  quirky  comedy  Happy  Endings,  starring  former  Friends  actress  Lisa  Kudrow  and  Maggie  Gyllenhaal,  on  Thursday.  |||    Kudrow's  Friends  co-star,  David  Schwimmer,  plays  a  divorced  drunkard  in  Duane  Hopwood,  while  Brosnan  stars  as  a  hit  man  in  comedy  The  Matador.  Keanu  Reeves  appears  in  coming-of-age  tale  Thumbsucker  while  Kevin  Costner  and  Michael  Keaton  are  among  the  other  big  names  whose  films  are  involved.  Robert  Redford  founded  Sundance  in  1981  and  it  has  gone  on  to  showcase  future  successes  such  as  Reservoir  Dogs,  The  Blair  Witch  Project  and  The  Full  Monty.  But  it  has  received  criticism  that  it  has  become  more  commercial  and  mainstream  over  the  years.  ""As  much  as  the  press  argues  that  Sundance  has  completely  changed,  it  hasn't  changed  that  much,""  festival  director  Geoffrey  Gilmore  said.  ""It's  still  a  place  for  discovery.  It's  a  place  for  common  ground  among  film-makers  and  audiences  more  than  it  is  the  celebrity  stuff.""  Other  films  generating  interest  before  this  year's  festival  include  Hustle  &  Flow,  about  an  aspiring  rapper,  The  Squid  and  the  Whale,  an  autobiographical  film  by  writer-director  Noah  Baumbach,  and  comedy/drama  Pretty  Persuasion.  It  also  has  two  new  international  cinema  competitions."

But  Rover  told  BBC  News  that  reports  of  job  cuts  were  ""speculation"".  A  tie-up,  seen  as  Rover's  last  chance  to  save  its  Longbridge  plant,  has  been  pushed  by  UK  Chancellor  Gordon  Brown.  Rover  confirmed  the  tie-up  would  take  place  ""not  very  far  away  from  this  time"".  |||    Rover  bosses  have  said  they  are  ""confident""  the  £1bn  ($1.9bn)  investment  deal  would  be  signed  in  March  or  early  April.  |||    Transport  &  General  Worker's  Union  general  secretary  Tony  Woodley  repeated  his  view  on  Friday  that  all  mergers  led  to  some  job  cuts.  He  said  investment  in  new  models  was  needed  to  ensure  the  future  of  the  Birmingham  plant.  ""This  is  a  very  crucial  and  delicate  time  and  our  efforts  are  targeted  to  securing  new  models  for  the  company  which  will  mean  jobs  for  our  people,""  he  said.  SAIC  says  none  of  its  money  will  be  paid  to  the  four  owners  of  Rover,  who  have  been  accused  by  unions  of  awarding  themselves  exorbitant  salaries,  the  FT  reports.  ""SAIC  is  extremely  concerned  to  ensure  that  its  money  is  used  to  invest  in  the  business  rather  than  be  distributed  to  the  shareholders,""  the  newspaper  quotes  a  source  close  to  the  Chinese  firm.  Meanwhile,  according  to  Chinese  state  press  reports,  small  state-owned  carmaker  Nanjing  Auto  is  in  negotiations  with  Rover  and  SAIC  to  take  a  20%  stake  in  the  joint  venture.  SAIC  was  unavailable  for  comment  on  the  job  cuts  when  contacted  by  BBC  News.  Rover  and  SAIC  signed  a  technology-sharing  agreement  in  August."

The  Bank  of  England  is  expected  to  keep  rates  on  hold  this  week  -  but  they  could  go  up  later  in  the  year.  Rates  are  likely  to  rise  after  the  anticipated  general  election  in  May.  The  BDO  optimism  index  -  a  leading  indicator  of  GDP  growth  two  quarters  ahead  edged  up  in  January  to  102.5,  from  102.2  in  October.  The  rise  is  due,  in  part,  to  an  increase  in  public  spending  and  increased  merger  and  acquisition  activity.  |||    The  only  thing  blighting  business  optimism  this  year  will  be  uncertainties  associated  with  the  general  election,  BDO  said.  Its  BDO's  output  index  -  which  predicts  GDP  movements  a  quarter  in  advance  -  remained  at  100.8  for  January,  implying  GDP  growth  at  2.9%  in  the  second  quarter  of  2005.  However,  the  output  index  is  being  held  back  by  recent  interest  rate  rises,  sterling's  strength  against  the  dollar  and  high  oil  prices,  the  group  noted.  Its  inflation  index,  which  has  risen  continuously  over  the  last  8  months,  climbed  to  110.0  in  January  from  108.0  in  October  last  year.  ""The  UK  is  looking  strong  going  into  the  general  election,  but  businesses  need  to  prepare  themselves  for  a  jolt  ahead  as  the  Bank  of  England  reacts  to  growth  and  inflationary  pressures,""  said  Peter  Hemington,  partner  at  BDO  Stoy  Hayward.  ""Growth  will  probably  slow  by  the  end  of  2005  and  it  is  likely  that  we  will  see  higher  interest  rates  or  a  sharp  drop  in  demand  for  products  and  services.""" 

0	"Wall  Street  cheers  Bush  victory  |||    The  US  stock  market  has  closed  higher  in  response  to  George  W  Bush's  victory  in  the  presidential  elections.  |||    The  benchmark  Dow  Jones  share  index  closed  more  than  1%  higher  at  10,137,  while  the  Nasdaq  rose  0.9%  to  2,004.  Many  investors  believe  that  Mr  Bush's  policies  are  more  business-friendly  than  those  of  his  Democrat  challenger,  John  Kerry.  The  higher  share  prices  also  reflect  relief  that  a  clear  winner  has  emerged  from  what  proved  to  be  a  tight  poll.  |||    Investors  had  worried  that  the  outcome  of  the  poll  would  be  inconclusive,  paving  the  way  for  a  repeat  of  the  legal  wrangling  that  marred  the  2000  election.  |||    The  Dow  lost  5%  of  its  value  in  the  three  weeks  immediately  after  that  election,  when  it  was  unclear  who  would  occupy  the  White  House.  Mr  Kerry  conceded  defeat  on  Wednesday,  abandoning  last-ditch  hopes  of  carrying  the  vote  in  the  swing  state  of  Ohio.  ""The  relief  for  the  markets  may  be  that  we  have  a  decision  and  can  move  forward,""  said  Tim  Ghriskey,  chief  investment  officer  of  Solaris  Asset  Management.  Some  analysts  predicted  that  the  jump  in  share  prices  would  be  short-lived,  saying  investors  would  quickly  focus  once  again  on  the  health  of  the  US  economy.  ""I  would  look  at  the  stock  market  rally  for  Bush  as  kind  of  a  one-day  event,""  said  Ken  Mayland  at  Clearview  Economics.  The  US'  recent  economic  performance  has  been  mixed,  with  solid  growth  offset  by  disappointingly  low  job  creation  figures,  and  mounting  worries  over  a  record  budget  deficit.  Elsewhere  in  the  financial  markets  on  Wednesday,  the  dollar  dipped  slightly  against  the  euro  and  climbed  against  the  yen,  while  US  oil  prices  closed  up  $1.26  at  $50.88  a  barrel  in  New  York.  The  rise  in  oil  prices  partly  reflects  the  view  that  President  Bush  is  less  likely  than  Mr  Kerry  to  release  supplies  from  the  US'  strategic  oil  reserve.  Share  prices  in  London,  Frankfurt  and  Paris  also  closed  higher.  |||    Successive  polls  in  the  run-up  to  Tuesday's  election  had  shown  the  two  candidates  running  neck  and  neck.  |||    Economic  issues,  as  well  as  the  war  in  Iraq,  were  the  forefront  of  the  campaign.  In  key  swing  states  such  as  Ohio,  which  has  suffered  substantial  job  losses  in  the  past  four  years,  President  Bush's  handling  of  the  economy  became  a  crucial  election  issue.  Senator  Kerry  attacked  President  Bush's  economic  record  during  his  campaign,  hammering  home  the  fact  that  a  net  800,000  jobs  were  lost  during  his  term  in  office.  President  Bush  focused  on  the  fact  that  two  million  jobs  have  been  created  in  the  past  year,  claiming  that  it  has  vindicated  his  tax-cutting  agenda.  As  for  future  policies,  both  candidates  pledged  to  bring  America's  $422bn  federal  budget  deficit  under  control.  Senator  Kerry  planned  to  increase  taxes  on  those  earning  more  than  $200,000  a  year.  President  Bush  has  placed  reform  of  the  pensions  system  at  the  heart  of  his  economic  agenda  for  a  second  term.  However,  economists  have  said  both  candidates'  economic  programmes  rested  on  questionable  assumptions  about  future  growth." 

2	"CSA  chief  who  'quit'  still  in  job  |||    The  head  of  the  ""failing""  Child  Support  Agency  widely  reported  to  have  resigned  three  months  ago  is  still  at  the  helm  of  the  troubled  organisation.  |||    Doug  Smith's  departure  was  announced  by  Work  Secretary  Alan  Johnson  on  17  November  as  MPs  grilled  him  over  the  agency's  poor  performance.  His  ""resignation""  was  referred  to  by  both  Tory  and  Lib  Dem  leaders  during  that  day's  prime  ministers  questions.  Officials  now  say  he  did  not  resign  but  will  move  on  under  civil  service  rules.  |||    Mr  Smith's  departure  was  reported  widely  at  the  time  as  his  shouldering  the  blame  for  the  failings  of  the  Child  Support  Agency.  In  January  the  MPs  who  make  up  the  Commons  Work  and  Pensions  Committee  published  a  highly  critical  report  into  the  ""failing""  agency  noting  the  chief  executive  ""has  now  left""  and  hoping  ""the  new  leadership  will  bring  a  fresh  approach  to  what  is  a  failing  organisation"".  |||    On  that  day's  Today  programme  Mr  Johnson  was  asked  why  Mr  Smith  had  been  allowed  to  resign  rather  than  be  sacked.  He  replied:  ""The  chief  executive  decided  it  was  time  to  move  on,  there  is  a  new  chief  executive  coming  in.""  It  now  emerges  that  the  widespread  belief  Mr  Smith,  made  Commander  of  the  Order  of  the  Bath  in  the  New  Year  honours,  had  left,  was  wrong.  A  Department  for  Work  and  Pensions  spokeswoman  confirmed  Mr  Smith  was  still  in  post  and  that  he  would  continue  in  the  job  until  a  replacement  was  found.  ""No  date  was  ever  given  for  Doug  Smith's  departure,""  she  said  adding  that  the  post  had  been  advertised.  |||    Tory  work  and  pensions  spokesman  David  Willetts  said  families  affected  by  CSA  failings  would  wonder  why  Mr  Smith  was  still  in  his  job  three  months  after  his  departure  was  announced.  The  CSA  has  been  surrounded  by  controversy  since  its  introduction  in  1993  to  assess  and  enforce  child  support  payments  by  absent  parents.  |||    The  work  and  pensions  committee  launched  their  inquiry  into  the  CSA's  performance  after  it  became  clear  that,  despite  the  introduction  of  a  simpler  system  of  calculating  maintenance  payments  for  new  cases  in  2003,  a  backlog  of  claims  was  still  building  up.  It  is  currently  chasing  outstanding  payments  of  more  than  £720m,  while  a  further  £947m  has  been  designated  as  ""unrecoverable"".  The  MPs  found  American  IT  giant  EDS'  £456m  system  was  ""nowhere  near  being  fully  functional  and  the  number  of  dissatisfied,  disenchanted  and  angry  customers  continues  to  escalate"".  |||    In  November,  when  he  surprised  MPs  and  the  watching  media  by  announcing  Mr  Smith's  departure,  Mr  Johnson  said:  ""I  should  tell  you  that  Doug  has  decided  that  now  is  the  time  to  stand  aside  and  to  allow  a  new  chief  executive  to  tackle  the  challenges  ahead.  ""Doug  has  exceeded  the  four  years  that  senior  civil  servants  are  now  expected  to  remain  in  a  particular  post.  ""So  Doug  believes  that  we  have  reached  the  natural  breakpoint  at  which  he  can  hand  over  the  reins.""  Lib  Dem  Sir  Archy  Kirkwood,  who  chairs  the  Commons  work  and  pensions  committee,  said  that  when  Mr  Johnson  had  announced  Mr  Smith  was  going  he  got  the  ""clear  impression""  the  CSA  chief  was  retiring  though  it  had  since  emerged  that  was  not  the  case,  and  he  may  be  seeking  new  employment  opportunities.  |||    He  added  his  committee  was  ""duty  bound""  to  allow  the  work  and  pensions  secretary  to  get  new  management  into  place  in  the  CSA  and  it  would  be  ""premature""  to  say  anything  further  on  the  issue  at  the  moment.  But  committee  member  and  Tory  MP  Nigel  Waterson  said  he  was  ""amazed""  Mr  Smith  was  still  in  his  job.  ""When  Mr  Smith  and  the  secretary  of  state  came  to  give  evidence,  we  were  led  to  believe  he  was  going  shortly,""  he  said.  ""Even  if  he  was  working  out  three  months  notice,  he  should  have  been  clearing  his  desk  by  now.""  Asked  on  Thursday  about  Mr  Smith's  position  Mr  Johnson  told  BBC  Radio  4's  World  at  One  he  thought  it  was  a  ""non-story"".  He  added  that  he  had  been  absolutely  open  when  he  announced  Mr  Smith's  departure  to  the  select  committee  and  how  people  chose  to  interpret  it  was  a  ""different  thing"".  ""The  major  issue  is  have  we  got  a  new  chief  executive  coming  into  this  very  important  agency  as  quickly  as  possible  and  have  we  gone  through  the  right  selection  process  to  make  sure  we've  got  the  right  people,""  he  added." 

3	"Cole  faces  lengthy  injury  lay-off  |||    Aston  Villa's  Carlton  Cole  could  be  out  for  six  weeks  with  a  knee  injury.  |||    The  striker,  who  is  on  a  season-long  loan  from  Chelsea,  picked  up  the  knock  in  an  England  Under-21  match  against  Holland  earlier  this  month.  ""Carlton  will  be  out  of  action  for  four  to  six  weeks  after  a  bad  challenge,""  said  Villa  boss  David  O'Leary.  ""I  won't  be  able  to  tell  you  whether  he  will  need  an  operation  until  maybe  next  week.  Whether  he  has  an  operation  has  got  to  be  left  to  Chelsea.""  Cole,  who  also  struggled  with  an  ankle  problem  earlier  in  the  season,  was  unable  to  rest  because  O'Leary  had  a  shortage  of  strikers.  The  return  to  fitness  of  Darius  Vassell  after  four  months  out  with  a  broken  ankle  and  the  emergence  of  Luke  Moore  has  alleviated  some  of  the  Villa's  manager's  problems  in  that  department." 

2	"Labour's  core  support  takes  stock  |||    Tony  Blair  has  told  Labour  supporters  he's  ""back""  and  still  hungry  for  the  job  of  prime  minister  -  but  does  that  sum  up  the  mood  at  the  party's  spring  conference  in  Gateshead?  |||    ""The  electorate  are  keener  on  the  government  than  some  Labour  Party  members,""  is  the  dry  assessment  of  Graham  Lane,  leader  of  the  Labour  group  on  Newham  Council.  The  problem,  according  to  Mr  Lane,  is  not  continuing  divisions  over  Iraq,  foundation  hospitals  or  tuition  fees,  or  even  voter  apathy,  but  Mr  Blair  himself.  ""I  have  a  new  slogan.  Vote  Blair,  Get  Brown.  That's  what  I  am  telling  people  on  the  doorstep.  Don't  worry,  he  will  be  gone  soon.""  His  friend,  Saxon  Spence,  leader  of  Devon  county  Labour  group,  lays  the  blame  for  any  lack  of  campaigning  zeal  on  one  issue  above  all  others.  ""You  cannot  underestimate  the  impact  of  the  war  in  Iraq.  We  lost  people  from  our  local  party  who  had  some  key  roles.""  |||    But  the  two  friends  were  fired  up  by  Gordon  Brown's  speech  on  Saturday,  with  its  appeal  to  core  Labour  values  on  social  justice,  health  and  education.  |||    ""There  was  real  passion.  I  think  we  have  all  felt  a  little  jaded,  but  it  reminded  us  why  we  joined  the  party  in  the  first  place,""  said  Mrs  Spence.  ""If  he  hadn't  have  walked  off  the  stage,  they  would  still  be  clapping,""  added  Mr  Lane.  But  for  every  Brownite  at  the  spring  conference  there  was  an  equally  ardent  fan  of  Mr  Blair.  Stephen  Douglas,  26,  from  Wales,  said  after  the  PM's  speech  on  Sunday:  ""I  think  it  was  a  bit  of  a  turning  point,  given  the  roasting  he  has  had  on  some  issues.  The  guy  still  has  it.""  |||    Tony  Martin,  of  Burnley,  said:  ""He  is  the  first  leader  who  has  won  us  two  terms.  This  bloke  has  delivered  for  us.""  Malcolm  Shipley,  of  Shipley,  said  it  was  ""as  if  he  is  coming  round  to  the  right  approach  again"".  Katrina  Bull,  a  prospective  parliamentary  candidate  said  Mr  Blair  had  shown  he  could  rouse  the  party's  grassroots:  ""I  think  if  every  voter  was  able  to  spend  time  in  a  room  with  Tony,  the  way  we  have  today,  we  will  have  no  problem  with  turnout.""  She  had  just  emerged  from  a  Q&A  session,  in  which  Mr  Blair  -  tieless  and  supremely  at  ease  -  answered  questions  posed  via  the  party's  website.  |||    A  party  of  councillors  from  Nottingham  agreed  that  there  was  nothing  wrong  with  Mr  Blair's  leadership  -  and  they  were  adamant  that  the  campaigning  strength  of  the  party  in  their  city  was  as  strong  as  ever.  Iraq,  they  insisted,  would  not  be  a  factor  for  most  voters.  ""The  biggest  problem  we  have  got  at  the  moment  is  that  we  keep  getting  all  these  polls  saying  we  are  going  to  run  away  with  the  election.  ""It  might  sound  great,  but  it  does  create  this  sense  of  complacency  among  our  own  voters  and  I  think  that  is  the  greater  problem  than  Iraq,""  said  Nottingham  City  Councillor  Brian  Parbutt.  And  even  Mr  Blair's  most  vocal  critics  seemed  to  agree  on  one  thing  -  he  is  a  master  of  the  sort  of  glossy,  high-profile  campaigning  that  has  become  Labour's  hallmark,  epitomised  by  Friday's  whistle-stop  tour  of  marginal  seats.  A  group  of  shop  stewards  from  the  Swan  Hunter  shipyard,  who  said  they  were  facing  redundancy,  could  barely  suppress  their  anger  at  Mr  Blair's  failure  to,  as  they  saw  it,  shake  off  his  Tory  leanings  and  stand  up  for  manufacturing  in  the  North  East.  |||    They  were  also  scathing  about  the  alleged  benefits  of  showpiece  projects  such  as  conference  venue  Sage  Centre,  heralded  by  John  Prescott  and  others  this  weekend  as  a  symbol  of  Labour's  success  in  urban  regeneration.  |||    ""It  is  no  good  having  the  Sage  or  Baltic  if  you  haven't  got  the  money  for  the  entrance  fee,""  said  Terry  Telford.  But  when  asked  about  Mr  Blair's  bravura  performance  on  Friday,  the  men  agreed  he  was  ""brilliant"".  And  they  would  all  be  out  on  the  doorstep  pushing  the  Labour  message  come  election  time.  ""If  you  are  not  fired  up  about  the  election,  then  what's  the  point?  There  is  no  complacency  as  far  as  I  can  see  in  the  Labour  Party.  We  are  fired  up.  We  are  up  for  this  election,""  said  Richie  Porterhouse.  Mr  Telford  agreed,  but  added  it  was  becoming  increasingly  difficult  to  think  of  an  answer  when  people  asked  ""What  has  Labour  done  for  the  North  East?""  ""I  have  had  doors  slammed  in  my  face,""  he  said.  |||    Every  activist  I  spoke  to  said  they  were  proud  of  what  they  believed  Labour  had  achieved  in  their  local  communities  -  the  new  hospitals  and  schools,  the  better  life  chances  for  young  people.  The  problem  they  faced,  they  said,  was  converting  this  local  feelgood  factor  into  votes.  But  they  could  at  least  rely  on  one  ""secret  weapon"",  as  one  activist  put  it  -  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard." 

2	"Straw  praises  Kashmir  moves  |||    The  UK  has  welcomed  the  decision  by  India  and  Pakistan  to  open  a  bus  link  across  the  ceasefire  line  dividing  the  disputed  region  of  Kashmir.  |||    Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw,  touring  South  East  Asian  countries,  praised  the  ""spirit  of  cooperation""  in  achieving  the  breakthrough.  Media  reports  in  both  countries  describe  the  deal  as  a  major  step  in  the  ongoing  peace  process.  Mr  Straw  said  he  hoped  the  agreement  would  make  a  difference  to  Kashmiris.  The  bus  service  was  one  of  several  announcements  made  after  a  meeting  of  foreign  ministers  of  both  countries  in  Islamabad  on  Wednesday.  Kashmiri  politicians  on  both  sides  of  the  Line  of  Control  which  divides  the  region  welcomed  the  move.  |||    In  a  statement,  Mr  Straw  said  the  bus  service  between  Srinagar  and  Muzaffarabad  ""will  be  able  to  reunite  families  that  have  been  divided  for  decades"".  ""This  will  make  a  real  difference  to  the  lives  of  Kashmiris  on  both  sides  of  the  Line  of  Control,""  he  said.  ""I  warmly  applaud  the  efforts  of  both  India  and  Pakistan  to  make  this  happen.  ""This  spirit  of  cooperation  will,  I  hope,  lead  to  many  more  measures  that  will  benefit  all  in  the  region.""  |||    On  Thursday  Mr  Straw  was  in  India  visiting  Sikhism's  holiest  shrine,  the  Golden  Temple  in  Amritsar  where  he  tried  his  hand  at  making  Indian  bread  or  roti.  He  is  due  to  take  part  in  talks  with  the  Indian  government  on  Friday.  A  second  bus  service  linking  the  Pakistani  city  of  Lahore  with  Amritsar  in  India  was  also  announced  as  well  as  a  rail  link  between  Rajasthan  state  and  Pakistan's  Sindh  province.  Both  sides  agreed  to  begin  talks  on  reducing  the  risk  of  nuclear  accidents  and  also  said  they  planned  to  reopen  their  respective  consulates  in  Karachi  and  Mumbai  (Bombay).  The  mountainous  region  of  Kashmir  has  been  a  flashpoint  between  the  two  nuclear  powers  for  more  than  50  years."

Total  sales  were  30.1bn  rupees,  up  27%  from  the  same  2004  period.  Maruti  accounts  for  half  of  India's  domestic  car  sales,  luring  consumers  with  cheap,  fuel-efficient  vehicles.  |||    Demand  in  India  also  has  been  driven  by  the  poor  state  of  public  transport  and  the  very  low  level  of  car  ownership,  analysts  said.  |||    Figures  show  that  only  eight  people  per  thousand  are  car  owners.  Maruti  beat  market  expectations  despite  an  increase  in  raw  materials  costs.  The  company,  majority-owned  by  Japan's  Suzuki,  said  an  increase  in  steel  and  other  raw  material  prices  was  partially  offset  by  cost  cutting.  Sales  in  the  fiscal  third  quarter,  including  vans  and  utility  vehicles,  rose  by  17.8%  to  136.069  units.  Maruti  is  not  the  only  company  benefiting  as  Indian's  economic  growth  gives  consumer  greater  spending  power.  Utility  vehicle  and  tractor  maker  Mahindra  has  reported  a  52%  rise  in  net  profit  during  the  last  three  months  of  2004.  Profit  was  1.33bn  rupees  compared  with  874.2m  rupees  a  year  earlier."

Ocean's  Twelve  took  sixth  place  in  the  US  chart  with  $5.4m  (£2.8m),  but  it  led  the  non-US  chart  at  the  weekend,  according  to  Hollywood  Reporter,  with  an  estimated  $17.7m  (£9.4m)  and  total  takings  of  $137m  (£73m).  The  Incredibles  took  $300m  (£160m)  outside  the  US,  while  Meet  the  Fockers  topped  box  office  charts  in  Australia  and  Mexico  with  non-US  takings  of  $19.35m  (£10.2m)."

But  World  Indoor  800m  record  holder  Ceplak  said:  ""There  is  never  an  easy  race  when  she  is  in  the  field.  There  is  only  excitement  at  what  might  happen.  ""It  is  good  for  the  sport.  She  always  fetches  the  best  out  of  everyone.""  Ceplak  has  been  a  great  rival  of  Holmes'  during  the  Briton's  career  and  the  pair  fell  out  when  Holmes  questioned  the  manner  of  the  Slovenian's  runaway  800m  victory  at  the  2002  European  Championships.  But  the  controversy  has  since  been  forgotten,  with  Ceplak  acting  as  pacemaker  for  Holmes'  failed  attempt  on  the  British  Indoor  1500m  record  at  the  Norwich  Union  Grand  Prix  in  Birmingham  in  2003.  |||    Ceplak  added:  ""I  like  running  against  her  -  you  know  the  race  is  always  going  to  be  fast.  ""That  is  the  sort  of  competition  that  I  like.  She  is  special  to  me.  She  was  like  my  idol  from  the  beginning  of  my  career.""  Meanwhile,  Ceplak  will  be  looking  to  follow  up  last  Saturday's  win  in  Boston  with  a  fast  time  and  victory  in  Friday's  Night  of  Athletics  in  Erfurt,  Germany.  Britain's  Jason  Gardener  had  been  expected  to  defend  his  60m  title  in  Erfurt  but  instead  he  will  save  himself  for  a  competition  in  Leipzig  on  Sunday.  Gardener's  decision  means  Scotland's  400m  man  Ian  Mackie  will  carry  British  hopes  in  what  looks  sure  to  be  a  tough  preparation  for  next  weekend's  Norwich  Union  European  trials  in  Sheffield."

1	"McCririck  out  of  Big  Brother  show  |||    Racing  pundit  John  McCririck  has  become  the  latest  contestant  to  be  evicted  from  Celebrity  Big  Brother.  |||    He  was  nominated  to  leave  the  Channel  4  show  by  fellow  housemates,  alongside  Happy  Mondays  dancer  Bez.  At  one  time  Bez  was  among  the  most  popular  contestants  but  he  has  since  become  withdrawn  and  argumentative.  McCririck  was  ordered  to  leave  the  house  on  Monday,  following  Jackie  Stallone,  the  actor  Sylvester's  mother,  who  was  first  to  be  evicted.  Bez  reacted  badly  to  the  news  that  he  had  been  nominated  by  five  of  his  fellow  housemates,  whilst  John  received  four  votes  against  him.  Sylvester  Stallone's  ex-wife  Brigitte  Nielsen  nominated  both  John  and  Bez.  She  said:  ""Bez  is  a  difficult  human  being.  There's  something  wrong  with  him.  Even  though  he's  making  an  effort,  he's  not  very  happy  in  here.""

3	"Record  fails  to  lift  lacklustre  meet  |||    Yelena  Isinbayeva  may  have  produced  another  world  pole  vault  record,  but  her  achievement  could  not  hide  the  fact  it  was  not  the  best  meet  we  have  ever  seen  in  Birmingham.  |||    And  hey,  there  are  not  many  meets  that  go  by  without  the  Russian  breaking  a  world  record.  |||    Apparently,  Isinbayeva  has  cleared  five  metres  in  training  and  I  would  just  love  her  to  put  us  out  of  our  misery  and  have  a  go  at  it  rather  than  extending  the  indoor  record  by  one  centimetre  at  a  time.  Athletics  to  me  is  all  about  pushing  the  barriers  and  being  the  best  you  can,  and  I  would  like  to  see  her  have  a  go  at  5m  in  competition.  Mind  you,  every  time  she  breaks  the  record  she  gets  $30,000  so  she  can  afford  to  be  deliberate  about  it.  World  records  aside,  I  thought  it  was  a  very  encouraging  evening's  work  for  Kelly  Holmes.  She  looked  good  and  was  very  positive.  Agnes  Samaria,  who  came  second,  is  in  very  good  shape  and  is  in  the  world's  top  three  800m  runners  this  season.  Yes,  Samaria  let  Kelly  get  away,  but  there  was  no  coming  back  over  the  last  200m  as  Kelly  dominated  the  race,  so  beating  Samaria  is  a  bit  of  a  benchmark  for  Kelly.  My  gut  feeling  is  that  Kelly  would  like  to  run  in  the  European  Indoor  Championships,  but  she  just  hasn't  convinced  herself  she  is  fit  enough  to  do  so.  On  the  other  hand,  I  think  Jason  Gardener  is  struggling  to  come  near  what  is  going  to  be  required  to  win  the  men's  60m  in  Madrid.  He  started  well  in  the  final  but  still  could  not  stay  with  the  front-runners.  Jason  has  a  lot  of  experience  indoors  but  for  some  reason  he  is  struggling  to  maintain  his  pace  through  to  the  finish.  |||    It  would  have  been  nice  to  see  what  Mark  Lewis-Francis  could  have  done  in  the  final,  if  only  he  hadn't  got  himself  disqualified.  He  was  blatantly  playing  the  false-start  game  to  his  advantage,  but  it  tripped  him  up  and  made  him  look  a  bit  silly.  My  view  is  you're  meant  to  go  when  the  gun  goes  and  not  before.  And  if  you  try  to  unsettle  your  rivals  by  employing  the  false-start  tactic  you  have  to  remember  not  to  false  start  yourself  again.  Having  said  that,  Mark  is  looking  in  much  better  shape.  But  I  haven't  seen  anything  from  Mark  or  Jason  yet  which  suggests  France's  Ronald  Pognon  -  who  has  run  6.45  seconds  -  will  be  under  threat  at  the  Europeans.  From  a  British  point  of  view,  Sarah  Claxton's  victory  in  the  60m  hurdles  was  the  best  thing  to  come  out  of  the  meet.  |||    Something  else  that  probably  went  unnoticed  was  Melanie  Purkiss  winning  the  women's  national  400m  race  in  a  new  personal  best  of  52.98  seconds.  AAAs  champion  Kim  Wall  came  second  in  another  lifetime  best  so  we  have  a  very  strong  4x400m  squad  going  to  the  European  Championships.  Scotland's  Lee  McConnell  is  probably  going  to  run  too,  so  we  have  a  real  prospect  of  a  medal.  From  an  international  perspective,  I  thought  Meseret  Defar  was  disappointing  in  the  3,000m,  but  I  don't  think  the  pace-making  was  great.  Canadian  Heather  Hennigar  set  a  fast  early  pace  but  could  not  maintain  it  and  if  Jo  Pavey  had  been  in  last  year's  shape  she  would  have  given  Defar  a  real  run  for  her  money.  She  had  a  go  but  just  could  not  hang  in  there.  We  were  also  expecting  a  bit  more  from  Bernard  Lagat  in  the  men's  1500m.  But  he  has  only  just  come  over  from  the  USA,  so  he  may  not  be  that  sharp  and  I  still  think  he  is  in  great  shape.  As  for  Kenenisa  Bekele,  he  was  well  beaten  by  Markos  Geneti.  But  we  only  had  half  expectations  for  Bekele  as  he  has  been  struggling  this  season.  It  was  very  hot  in  the  National  Indoor  Arena  and  I  felt  uncomfortable  in  the  commentary  box.  I  think  those  conditions  affected  the  distance  runners  and  in  fact  Defar  complained  to  her  coach  after  the  race  that  she  could  not  get  her  breath  properly."

A  report  from  investment  firm  Grant  Samuel  in  WMC  defence  documents  values  WMC  shares  at  A$7.17  to  A$8.24,  against  Xstrata's  bid  of  A$6.35  a  share.  Analysts  said  the  defence  documents  provided  more  details  on  WMC,  and  may  trigger  a  possible  rival  bid.  ""If  a  bid  is  going  to  emerge  it  is  probably  likely  in  the  next  one  to  two  weeks,""  said  Daiwa  Securities  analyst  Mark  Pervan.  He  said  the  valuation  would  put  increased  pressure  on  Xstrata  to  look  at  ""sweetening""  its  offer.  Marc  Gonsalves,  an  executive  at  Xstrata,  said:  ""We  will  review  the  information  contained  in  the  target's  statement  over  the  next  week  or  so.""  He  added:  ""While  we  will  review  the  assumptions  made  by  Grant  Samuel  in  detail,  we  are  extremely  sceptical  of  their  conclusion,  and  suggest  that  WMC  shareholders  take  extreme  care  in  presuming  that  these  optimistic  assumptions  are  capable  of  being  realised.""  |||    Last  month  Australia's  competition  watchdog  said  it  would  not  oppose  the  purchase  of  WMC  by  Zurich  and  London-based  Xstrata.  On  Tuesday,  WMC  chairman  Tommie  Bergman  said  in  a  statement  the  directors  believed  it  was  in  shareholders'  best  interest  to  reject  the  offer.  He  said  WMC  would  pursue  ""value-creating  options""  provided  by  a  portfolio  of  ""world  class  assets"".  And  WMC  chief  executive  Andrew  Michelmore  claimed  the  Xstrata  offer  was  aimed  at  creating  value  for  Xstrata's  shareholders,  and  was  not  being  made  for  the  benefit  of  WMC's  shareholders.  Grant  Samuel  said  its  valuation  of  WMC  was  based  on  lower  average  prices  for  nickel,  copper  and  uranium  than  current  market  levels.  ""Any  longer  term  commodity  price  improvements  would  only  improve  our  outlook,""  Mr  Michelmore  said.  |||    In  2003  Xstrata  acquired  Australia's  largest  copper  miner  -  MIM  Holdings.

""Yes,  we  have  effectively  more  than  five  million  people  unemployed,""  a  government  minister  said  earlier  on  ZDF  public  television.  Unemployment  has  not  been  this  high  in  Germany  since  the  1930s.  |||    Changes  to  the  way  the  statistics  are  compiled  partly  explain  the  jump  of  572,900  in  the  numbers.

It  said  there  are  a  further  1.5  million-2  million  people  on  subsidised  employment  schemes  who  are,  in  fact,  looking  for  real  jobs.  It  added  that  government  reforms,  including  unpopular  benefit  cuts,  do  not  go  far  enough.  Under  the  government's  controversial  ""Hartz  IV""  reforms,  which  came  into  effect  at  the  beginning  of  the  year,  both  those  on  unemployment  benefits  and  welfare  support  and  those  who  are  long-term  unemployed  are  officially  classified  as  looking  for  work.  The  bad  winter  weather  also  took  its  toll,  as  key  sectors  such  as  the  construction  sector  laid  off  workers.  Adjusted  for  the  seasonal  factors,  the  German  jobless  total  rose  by  227,000  in  January  from  December."

Privately-held  Falic  Group  bought  two  cosmetics  brands,  Hard  Candy  and  Urban  Decay,  from  LVMH  in  early  2003.  The  Florida  company  also  own  a  chain  of  90  duty  free  stores  in  the  US.  LVMH  refused  to  comment  on  the  reports.  But  one  of  the  three  brothers  behind  the  Falic  Group  said  the  firm  had  also  held  talks  with  the  designer  Christian  Lacroix,  and  wished  to  retain  him.  ""We  are  buying  his  name,""  Simon  Falic  told  the  Reuters  news  agency.  ""We  have  plans  to  increase  the  exposure  of  the  brand  and  increase  the  volume  of  business.""" 

1	"Roundabout  continues  nostalgia  trip  |||    The  new  big-screen  version  of  The  Magic  Roundabout,  released  in  the  UK  on  Friday,  is  the  latest  attempt  to  turn  children's  television  into  box-office  gold.  |||    Recent  years  have  seen  a  less-than-successful  adaptation  of  the  1960s  puppet  show  Thunderbirds  and  a  moderately  successful  version  of  E  Nesbit's  Five  Children  and  It,  previously  filmed  by  the  BBC  in  1991.  He-Man  and  Transformers,  which  were  cartoon  favourites  in  the  1980s,  will  soon  receive  their  own  costly  makeovers.  With  screen  versions  of  The  A-Team,  The  Dukes  of  Hazzard  and  even  Blake's  Seven  on  the  cards,  nostalgia  is  clearly  big  business.  But  some  critics  complain  that  these  expensive  takes  on  iconic  series  of  yesteryear  do  not  match  up  to  our  fond  memories  of  the  originals.  The  new  version  of  The  Magic  Roundabout,  which  will  be  released  as  Sprung!  in  the  US,  replaces  the  stop-motion  models  of  the  1960s  TV  show  with  polished,  computer-generated  animation.  |||    In  a  similar  fashion,  the  2004  Thunderbirds  used  human  actors  and  special  effects  in  place  of  the  original's  puppets  and  models.  The  films  are  squarely  pitched  at  younger  audiences.  Pop  stars  Robbie  Williams  and  Kylie  Minogue  provide  voices  in  The  Magic  Roundabout,  while  the  now-defunct  boy  band  Busted  performed  the  Thunderbirds  theme  song.  But  while  some  reviewers  have  been  won  over,  there  has  nonetheless  been  a  significant  backlash.  ""This  CG-animated  adventure  airbrushes  the  sly  charm  and  trippy  otherworldliness  which  made  the  60s  stop-motion  Roundabout  a  cult  hit,""  writes  Stella  Papamichael  on  the  BBC  Movies  site.  |||    And  the  recent  puppet  comedy  Team  America:  World  Police  was  in  part  provoked  by  its  directors'  outrage  that  Gerry  Anderson's  Thunderbirds  was  remade  without  its  signature  mannequins.  Dan  Jolin,  reviews  editor  of  Empire  magazine,  says  classic  children's  TV  shows  have  a  built-in  audience  that  make  them  ideal  for  reinvention.  |||    ""I  can  understand  why  people  are  taking  these  intellectual  properties  and  repackaging  them  for  the  kids  of  today.  ""But  I  think  it's  backfiring.  What's  next  -  The  Clangers  on  some  distant  planet,  with  some  giant  CGI  Soup  Dragons  chasing  after  them?""  Despite  Thunderbirds'  disappointing  global  box-office  performance  -  the  film  cost  $42m  (£22m)  but  only  recouped  $21m  (£11m)  -  the  nostalgia  craze  shows  no  signs  of  abating.  It  can  therefore  be  only  a  matter  of  time  before  some  other  TV  favourites  receive  the  Hollywood  treatment.  |||    After  the  success  of  Garfield:  The  Movie,  Britain's  shabby  tabby  |||    surely  deserves  his  own  film  vehicle.  With  only  13  episodes  made  of  the  1974  series,  there  is  plenty  of  room  to  explore  the  lives  of  the  pink  cat,  Professor  Yaffle  and  the  Mice  of  the  Marvellous  Mechanical  Mouse  Organ.  |||    Furry  recyclers  |||    have  already  had  one  big-screen  outing  -  1977's  Wombling  Free.  But  with  environmental  issues  still  occupying  our  thoughts  it  is  high  time  they  made  a  comeback.  Advances  in  special  effects  technology  could  do  wonders  for  the  BBC's  supernatural  comedy  |||    .  And  the  success  of  Pirates  of  the  Caribbean  must  surely  herald  a  comeback  for  TV's  most  popular  cartoon  buccaneer,  |||    .  It  might  also  remind  viewers  the  lewd  character  names  often  associated  with  the  show  never  actually  existed.  |||    The  Magic  Roundabout  is  out  in  the  UK  on  11  February.  |||      |||    How  about  bringing  Catweazle  to  the  big  screen?  He  could  give  Gandalf  a  run  for  his  money!  |||    Thundercats!!  I  loved  it.  Should  be  fun  to  see  on  the  big  screen,  if  some  effort  is  put  in!  it  will  bring  my  youth  back!  |||    Get  your  hands  off  the  Clangers!  Is  nothing  sacred?  |||    Make  a  movie  version  of  the  Banana  splits!  |||    What  about  Keanu  Reeves  and  Richard  Gere  in  a  remake  of  The  Wooden  Tops?  Or  perhaps  Robbie  Williams  could  get  his  much  mooted  acting  career  off  the  ground  by  taking  on  the  role  of  Andy  Pandy.  |||    You  forgot  to  mention  the  grearest  of  them  all,  Danger  Mouse!  But  then  again,  it  couldn't  be  better  than  the  original  series,  could  it?  |||    It's  always  nice  to  see  these  old  toons  re-released,  but  after  the  abysmal  Thunderbirds  movie  (and  the  song!)  I  think  I've  been  completely  put  off.  Just  leave  these  classics  alone  as  good  memories.  |||    I  think  remakes  are  a  good  idea.  As  the  world  moves  on  people  tend  to  look  more  and  more  into  the  past  to  things  that  make  them  feel  safe.  I  believe  this  is  the  whole  reason  ""retro""  has  become  so  popular.  As  long  as  a  remake  does  justice  to  the  original  then  all  it  can  do  is  create  a  wider  audience  and  possibly  entice  a  new  generation  of  persons  to  enjoy  and  revive  and  old  series.  Personally  i'd  like  to  see  cartoons  such  as  Transformers,  Thundercats  and  M.A.S.K.  get  full  Hollywood  remakes.  |||    Leave  them  alone,  why  ruin  something  that  we  all  have  very  fond  memories  of  in  the  first  place?  The  thunderbirds  film  was  apalling,  not  a  patch  on  the  puppet  series  I  grew  up  with  and  the  Magic  Roundabout  will  never  be  the  same  without  the  voice  of  Eric  Thompson.  |||    Love  to  see  Transformers  with  real  actors  and  CGI.  And  make  it  at  least  a  15  rating.  |||    Part  of  the  reason  for  the  success  of  such  classics  as  the  Magic  Roundabout  was  that  the  characters  were  not  the  sweet  and  cuddly  creatures  that  you  would  expect.  They  were  moody,  sarcastic,  and  rather  human.  Just  looking  at  the  pictures  of  the  animations  for  the  new  film  show  that  these  characteristics  have  not  been  preserved.  Dougal  never  smiled  like  that!  Films  of  this  sort  have  an  unfortunate  habit  of  Disneyfying  everthing,  and  they  just  lose  the  real  magic  that  made  the  show  special  in  the  first  place.  |||    I  have  fond  memories  of  Bod  (not  least  of  which  because  I  look  like  him)  and  would  like  to  see  someone  attempt  to  make  it  into  a  film.  It's  got  all  the  right  material  for  an  american  blockbuster  -  no  plot  and  no  story.  Bod  would  likely  be  played  by  Tom  Cruise  and  would  undoubtedly  have  a  girlfriend  or  two.  |||    It's  all  very  well  and  good  remaking  these  classic  TV  shows  and  films  with  all  the  latest  technology  for  a  'new'  audience,  but  for  me  a  lot  of  the  original  charm  is  lost  when  they  do  this,  and  seems  more  like  a  money  making  exercise  to  cash  in  on  the  original  success  of  the  programme  than  reinventing  or  improving  it.  It  maybe  that  to  an  audience  who  have  never  seen  the  originals  they  can  watch  them  without  prejudice,  but  to  people  who  have  grown  up  with  all  these  shows  such  as  Thunderbirds  and  Magic  Roundabout  which  are  part  of  our  childhood,  they  are  never  going  to  live  up  to  expectation.  It  does  pose  the  question  though  that  with  all  the  long  line  of  remakes  being  made,  are  film-makers  running  out  of  original  ideas?  |||    All  I  can  say  is  bring  back  Danger  Mouse,  probably  the  greatest  kids'  show  ever.  I  recently  re-watched  some  episodes  and  realised  that  there  was  a  level  of  humour  shown  in  Danger  Mouse  that  was  completely  lost  on  me  when  I  was  a  child.  |||    There  WAS  a  new  Captain  Pugwash  cartoon  made  a  couple  of  years  back.  Again,  like  so  many  of  these  nostalgia  programmes,  the  animation  -  this  time  computer  created  flat-cell  like  animation  -  failed  to  match  the  original's  cut  out  paper  technique  for  inventiveness,  and  was  woefully  inadequate.  We  live  in  a  sampling  world  -  the  music  industry  has  been  pludering  past  decades  for  inspiration,  clipping  sounds  from  20  years  ago  is  much  cheaper  and  easier  that  doing  something  new.  Seems  that  the  film  and  TV  is  doing  the  same  now  -  it's  just  cheaper  to  take  ideas  from  the  past  and  rework  them,  rather  than  being  daring  and  trying  something  new.  |||    It  got  to  be  Mr.Benn.  The  story  line  about  a  man  who  changes  in  a  fancy  dress  shop,  steps  into  a  door  way  and  appears  in  another  time  and  place  would  be  amazing!  If  they  got  a  decent  producer  and  writer  the  story  line  could  be  great.  And  who  to  play  the  lead  role?  Well  if  it  was  a  comedy  then  it  would  have  to  be  someone  like  Steve  Martin.  If  its  going  to  be  an  adventure  then  Johnny  Depp  playing  a  role  similar  to  the  Pirates  Of  The  Caribbean  Character.  |||    Muffin  the  Mule  perhaps  ?  After  all,  grannies  and  grandpas  go  to  the  cinema  as  well  you  know!  |||    Why  can't  the  British  film  industry  try  making  Gerry  Anderson's  UFO  or  Captain  Scarlet,  or  Saphire  and  Steel,  or  The  Tomorrow  People.  |||    In  today's  media,  it  seems  the  past  is  the  future.  TV  shows  such  as  Battlestar  Galactica  have  new  remakes,  DJ's  are  sampling  or  re-working  70's  and  80's  music.  Even  computer  games  from  10-15  years  ago  are  getting  modern  re-workings.  Personally,  I  think  it  shows  that  no  one  has  any  originality  any  more!  Why  not  just  leave  our  misty-eyed  nostalgia  alone.  |||    Mary,  Mungo  and  Midge.  But  of  course  for  most  of  the  episodes  the  lift  would  be  out  of  order  and  they  would  have  to  use  the  stairs.  Plus  would  Mary  be  more  of  a  Vicky  Pollard  character  as  she  lives  in  a  high  rise  council  block?  Yeah  but  no  but  I  wasn't  even  there!  |||    I'd  like  to  see  Mr.  Benn,  with  Brad  Pitt  in  the  title  role.  Sean  Connery  could  play  the  mysterious  costume  shop  owner.  |||    It  demonstrates  a  profound  lack  of  imagination  in  today's  film-makers  that  they  continually  try  to  remake  and  remodel  the  past  in  an  effort  to  cash  in  on  nostalgia.  There  are  plany  of  modern  children's  book  that  would  make  excellent  films  or  TV  programmes,  why  not  use  them  instead  of  rehashing  the  past?  |||    Mr.  Benn  with  Rowan  Atkinson  as  the  lead.  |||    Would  have  loved  to  see  Dungeons  &  Dragons  made,  but  unfortunately  the  film  that  it  was  made  into  didn't  come  up  to  scratch.  The  only  one  that  isn't  to  be  remade  as  yet  is  Thundercats,  which  I'd  like  to  see.  |||    I'm  an  expat  living  in  Norway,  and  I  recently  went  through  a  period  of  buying  the  DVDs  of  many  of  my  favourite  children's  programs  for  my  2  daughters.  My  dearest  wish,  however,  is  to  see  a  feature  length  version  of  Noggin  the  Nog  appear  on  The  Big  Screen!!  Very  Scandinavian...  |||    Rainbow!  |||    I  believe  that  Childrens  classics  should  be  left  well  alone,  and  I  will  not  be  surprised  if  the  Magic  Roundabout  does  not  do  well  at  the  Box  Office,  especially  since  it  will  be  going  up  against  The  Spongebob  Squarepants  movie,  popular  among  children  because  it's  original,  witty,  and  modern.  The  Magic  Roundabout  will  never  appeal  to  the  children  of  today  as  it  did  all  those  many  years  ago.  |||    How  about  classics  like  Chorlton  and  the  Wheelies,  Rentaghost,  Terrahawks,  Bod.....oh  the  list  could  go  on  and  on!!!  |||    If  a  Transformers  movie  is  indeed  on  the  cards  then  I'll  be  the  first  one  on  Amazon  buying  a  copy,  eagerly  waiting  at  the  front  door  with  a  frothy  mouth  and  a  nervous  twitch.  Repackage  my  childhood  and  sell  it  to  me  at  an  extortionate  price!  I  don't  care!  Till  then  I'll  have  to  make  do  with  the  Citreon  C4  advert.  |||    I'd  luv  to  see  Willow  the  Wisp  on  the  big  screen  but  sadly  without  the  late  Kenneth  Williams  doing  the  voices  it  wouldnt  be  the  same.  And  who  remembers  Trap  Door  voiced  by  the  late  Willie  Rushden,  superb  children's  programme.  Could  Morph  hold  his  own  in  a  big  screen  movie???  Or  even  Jamie  and  the  Magic  Torch....hmmmmm,  I  could  go  on  and  on.  Danger  Mouse?  At  34  I'm  showing  my  age.  :-)  |||    Noggin  the  Nog  was  one  of  the  best  children's  programs.  The  problem  with  bringing  it  to  the  big  screen  is  that  no-one  could  approach  Oliver  Postgate's  wonderful  voices.  So  in  general  leave  well  alone.  The  originals  are  good  because  they  are  of  their  time  and  the  methods  used  are  an  integral  part  of  the  story.  |||    Just  imagine  what  could  be  achieved  by  using  CGI  in  a  remake  of  Fingerbobs...  the  already  disturbing  hand  antics  of  the  bearded  hippy,  Yoffi  could  take  on  a  whole  new  level  with  a  more  life-like  Fingermouse  |||    Bob  the  Builder,  Postman  Pat  and  Fireman  Sam  together  in  an  epic  adventure  of  fire,  post  and  bricks.  In  the  ultimate  struggle  to  save  the  women  they  love  from  the  evil  clowns,  Krusty  and  Gobo.  Will  they  triumph  or  will  they  fail  miserably?  Find  out  this  Fall.  |||    One  puppet  show  that  I  personally  would  love  to  see  made  into  a  live  action  movie  is  Joe  90.  It  would  be  worth  the  price  of  admission  alone  to  see  the  large  screen  version  of  Joe's  car.  Of  course,  Gerry  Anderson's  Supermarionation  is  a  rich  seam  of  material  worthy  of  big-screen,  big-budget  action.  It  was  only  that  Thunderbirds  The  Movie  was  targetted  as  a  children't  movie  that  really  let  it  down.  After  all,  the  children  that  remember  those  shows  with  such  affection  are  now  the  parents  of  children  themselves.  |||    It's  only  because  the  people  who  were  children  when  these  programmes  were  first  shown  have  grown  up  and  are  plundering  their  childhoods,  isn't  it?  I'd  hate  to  see  Bagpuss  with  perfect  animation  -  I  love  that  'done  in  a  shed'  clunkiness  and  you  couldn't  recreate  the  magic.  Perhaps  if  the  remakes  were  done  in  a  'Look  Around  You'  mock-authentic  style  I  might  be  interested  ...  |||    Chorton  And  The  Wheelies  or  Jamie  And  His  Magic  Torch;  that  would  be  mega!  |||    This  re-gurgitation  of  old  films  and  TV  shows  makes  me  angry  -  it  is  corporate  laziness  resting  on  the  safety  of  other  people's  ideas,  because  it  guarantees  to  bring  in  the  $$$.  The  same  can  be  said  of  modern  day  pop  bands  who  release  other  peoples  material,  Will  Young  etc.  The  sad  fact  is  nostalgia  sells  big  bucks  in  the  short-term.  The  fact  that  they  will  be  forgotten  in  6  months  time  is  irrelevant  (e.g.  Starsky  &  Hutch)  Hence,  the  market  is  saturated  with  this  mindless  drivel,  but  it  can  only  be  stopped  if  people  stop  buying  it!  |||    I  pray  they  never  do  a  remake  of  Chorlton  And  The  Wheelies.  I'm  only  27  and  don't  remember  the  series  from  when  it  was  on  TV,  but  have  the  set  on  DVD  and  it's  a  classic.  The  fact  it's  so  great  comes  from  the  fact  that  there  were  very  few  special  effects  involved  and  compared  to  today's  stuff  it  looks  amateurish.  Thats  the  appeal  though,  it's  so  innocent  (like  Chorlton  himself)  and  it  would  be  a  real  shame  if  they  did  remake  it."

But  the  single  is  now  on  sale  for  79p  -  the  usual  cost  of  a  song  from  iTunes  -  with  Apple  donating  a  further  70p  to  the  charity  for  each  song  downloaded.  A  copy  of  the  original  1984  song  is  also  available  for  download  at  79p  -  with  all  proceeds  going  to  the  charity.  |||    More  than  72,000  copies  of  the  new  Band  Aid  single  were  sold  on  its  first  day  of  release  on  Monday,  according  to  sales  figures.  The  track  has  become  the  fastest-selling  single  of  the  year  so  far,  shifting  more  copies  than  the  rest  of  the  top  30  combined,  HMV  claimed.  Dido,  Robbie  Williams  and  Chris  Martin  are  among  those  featured  on  the  new  version  of  Do  They  Know  It's  Christmas?,  which  is  raising  money  to  fight  hunger  in  Africa.  If  the  track  sold  500,000  copies,  more  than  £1m  would  be  raised  for  charity.  The  CD  is  being  sold  for  £3.99,  with  HMV,  Virgin  and  Woolworths  all  donating  their  profits." 

2	"Campaign  'cold  calls'  questioned  |||    Labour  and  the  Conservatives  are  still  telephoning  the  millions  of  people  who  have  signed  up  to  make  sure  they  do  not  get  marketing  ""cold  calls"".  |||    The  parties  say  they  can  stick  to  the  rules  by  ensuring  that  their  calls  are  not  marketing  -  for  instance  by  asking  about  people's  voting  intentions.  The  Lib  Dems  are  asking  the  watchdog  overseeing  the  rules  to  stop  the  calls.  The  information  commissioner's  office  says  surveys  are  allowed  but  there  is  a  ""grey""  area  if  personal  data  is  kept.  Telephone  call  centres  are  expected  to  be  used  as  never  before  by  all  the  three  major  parties  in  the  run-up  to  the  general  election.  |||    But  seven  million  telephone  numbers  are  on  the  Telephone  Preference  Service  (TPS)  lists,  which  ban  unsolicited  sales  and  marketing  calls.  Both  schemes  are  run  by  the  Direct  Marketing  Association  and  backed  by  EU  directives  on  privacy  and  electronic  communications.  |||    The  rules  on  marketing  calls  apply  as  much  to  politicians  as  to  private  sector  companies.  But  that  does  not  mean  Labour  and  the  Tories  are  not  calling  people  signed  up  to  the  TPS.  A  Labour  Party  spokesman  told  the  BBC  News  website  the  party  avoided  those  on  TPS  lists  when  telephoning  people  about  membership  or  fundraising.  But  that  did  not  happen  for  ""voter  identification""  calls.  ""When  we  ask  which  party  they  will  vote  for,  that  is  not  marketing  and  we  have  very  clear  legal  advice  that  it  is  not,""  he  said.  ""So  it  is  not  covered  by  the  Telephone  Preference  Service.""  |||    He  said  the  party  always  asked  people  if  they  would  be  happy  to  be  contacted  again  and  if  they  said  no,  they  were  not  rung  again.  A  Conservative  spokeswoman  said  the  party  stuck  to  the  rules  when  it  rang  TPS  subscribers.  She  said:  ""We  do  apply  TPS  but  in  line  with  the  law.  We  would  not  do  things  that  are  not  allowed  in  the  law.""  A  spokesman  for  the  Information  Commissioner's  Office  said  it  would  be  classed  as  marketing  if  political  parties  telephoned  people  to  encourage  them  to  vote  for  them.  But  the  rules  did  allow  polling  organisations  to  telephone  people  about  their  voting  intentions  if  they  recorded  them  only  as  part  of  a  bigger  set  of  statistics,  not  person  by  person.  ""If  a  political  party  was  doing  that  than  it  may  be  that  also  would  not  be  marketing,""  he  said.  |||    The  spokesman  said  it  might  be  considered  unsolicited  marketing  if  a  party  recorded  voting  preferences  with  a  view  to  marketing  information  in  the  future.  The  spokesman  said  there  was  ""no  yes  or  no""  answer  and  the  area  was  ""pretty  grey"".  He  added:  ""If  someone  complained,  then  we  would  investigate  that.  Political  parties  are  aware  of  the  regulations.  At  the  last  by-elections,  we  reminded  them.""  Lib  Dem  chairman  Matthew  Taylor  has  now  written  to  the  watchdog  saying:  ""The  advice  we  have  received  on  several  previous  occasions  is  that  such  phone  calls  are  illegal.""  He  says  evidence  from  local  Lib  Dem  parties  around  the  country  suggests  there  are  ""significant""  numbers  of  such  calls.  ""I  hope  you  can  therefore  take  swift  and  efficient  action  to  ensure  that  this  ceases,""  he  tells  the  commissioner.  Mr  Taylor  argues  there  should  be  new  guidelines  so  all  parties  can  act  in  the  same  way  if  the  watchdog  believes  the  rules  allow  parties  to  ring  TPS  numbers  about  voting  intentions  and  later  urge  those  people  to  vote  for  them."

The  merger  was  announced  in  a  statement  on  Standard  Trust's  website  on  Tuesday,  but  no  financial  details  were  revealed.  United  Bank  is  the  third  biggest  in  Nigeria  in  terms  of  number  of  branches.  Standard  Trust  is  smaller  but  more  profitable.  ""The  boards  of  United  Bank  and  Standard  Trust,  at  separate  meetings  yesterday,  approved  arrangements  to  merge  both  institutions,""  Standard  Trust  said.  Standard  Trust  is  100%  Nigerian-owned,  but  United  Bank  has  some  foreign  investors,  including  New  York-based  Global  Depository  Receipts  (32.8%),  and  Banca  Nazionale  del  Lavoro  and  Monte  del  Paschi  di  Siena,  both  from  Italy,  who  each  have  a  2.4%  stake." 

2	"Kennedy  looks  to  election  gains  |||    They  may  not  know  quite  how  to  describe  their  position  in  British  politics  -  the  real  opposition,  the  valid  opposition,  the  effective  opposition  or  the  authentic  opposition.  |||    But  the  Liberal  Democrats  are  entering  the  expected  2005  election  campaign  determined  to  prove  it  is  they,  not  the  Tories,  who  are  now  the  real  threat  to  Labour.  As  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  kicked  off  his  election  campaign,  the  Lib  Dem  leader  Charles  Kennedy  dismissed  the  Conservatives  as  a  ""fading""  force.  And  he  insisted  there  was  ""no  limit""  to  his  party's  ambitions  in  the  coming  poll.  And  he  can  produce  some  pretty  impressive  recent  election  results  to  back  up  his  optimism  for  an  election  which  he  believes  might  just  see  his  party  doing  big  things.  Sensible  third  party  leaders  are  usually  cautious  about  making  any  predictions  about  how  they  will  do  come  the  big  test.  |||    And  Mr  Kennedy  was  not  falling  into  that  trap  when  he  fired  up  his  campaign  from  the  party's  Westminster  HQ.  He  would  make  no  predictions  other  than  that  he  expected  the  Lib  Dems  to  increase  both  their  votes  and  their  Commons  seats  at  the  election.  |||    The  gap  between  Labour  and  the  Tories  was  now  so  narrow  -  as  proved,  he  claimed,  by  the  defection  to  Labour  of  Robert  Jackson  -  that  only  his  party  offered  a  genuine  alternative.  On  the  war  on  Iraq,  identity  cards,  student  fees  and  the  council  tax,  there  was  nothing  to  chose  between  the  two  big  parties  whereas  the  Liberal  Democrats  offered  costed,  sensible  alternatives.  He  was  also  happy  to  break  the  two  party  consensus  on  taxation  by  promising  to  increase  income  tax  on  those  earning  more  than  £100,000  a  year  to  pay  for  the  scrapping  of  student  fees,  the  introduction  of  free  personal  care  for  the  elderly  and  replacing  the  council  tax  with  a  local  income  tax.  He  was  also  happy  to  offer  a  pledge  that  he  would  be  doing  no  deals  to  ""prop  up""  either  of  the  other  big  parties  after  the  election.  |||    There  was  a  time  when  such  optimistic  sounds  coming  from  the  third  party  could  be  dismissed  as  self-delusion.  That  is  no  longer  the  case  with  the  Liberal  Democrats.  The  other  parties  will  still  insist  that  the  Lib  Dems  are  no  hopers  whose  greatest  effect  on  the  poll  will  be  to  boost  the  hopes  of  their  opponents  by  denying  them  otherwise  winnable  seats.  |||    Labour,  in  particular,  fears  that  disillusioned  supporters  may  switch  to  the  Lib  Dems  allowing  the  Tories  to  win  some  seats.  But  Mr  Kennedy  is  clearly  hoping  for  a  more  significant  outcome  than  that.  He  will  not  talk  about  the  big  breakthrough,  although  there  are  those  who  believe  this  could  well  be  the  election  that  sees  his  party  crossing  some  sort  of  symbolic  threshold.  They  would  argue  that,  by  the  time  of  the  election  after  next,  the  Liberal  Democrats  may  genuinely  have  replaced  the  Tories  as  the  party  challenging  Labour  for  power.  The  Lib  Dems  will  hope  to  have  made  advances  because  of  their  consistent  stand  against  the  war  on  Iraq.  But  Mr  Kennedy  believes  his  new  manifesto  will  also  offer  sensible,  costed  and  achievable  policies  on  things  like  the  council  tax,  crime  and  asylum  that  will  underpin  his  claim  that  his  party  really  is  the  only  opposition  worth  the  name." 

2	"Blair  'up  for  it'  ahead  of  poll  |||    Tony  Blair  says  his  personal  standing  in  the  eyes  of  voters  will  be  ""an  issue""  in  the  general  election.  |||    The  prime  minister  said  he  was  ""up  for  it""  as  the  country  waits  to  go  to  the  polls,  possibly  in  a  matter  of  weeks.  He  told  The  Observer  government  life  was  a  ""constant  barrage  of  attack""  but  said  he  would  not  stay  in  charge  if  he  felt  unable  to  contribute.  Mr  Blair  also  spoke  of  meeting  many  people  across  the  country  with  concerns  about  the  compensation  culture.  |||    He  said  Britain  was  in  danger  of  needless  panic  over  public  safety  issues.  |||    Speaking  amid  a  flurry  of  pre-election  campaigning,  the  prime  minister  said:  ""I  am  an  issue,  I  always  will  be.  Whoever  is  the  prime  minister  will  be.""  He  added:  ""If  you  are  afraid  to  take  criticism,  you  should  go  and  do  another  job.""  Asked  if  he  would  quit  as  leader  if  he  felt  like  a  liability  to  Labour,  he  said:  ""It's  important  always  not  to  do  the  job  unless  you  feel  you  have  something  to  contribute.""  Whether  he  still  had  something  to  offer,  he  said,  was  a  judgement  for  people  to  make.  Mr  Blair's  assessment  is  likely  to  be  seen  as  a  signal  that  replacing  him  would  not  bring  an  upsurge  in  fortunes  for  the  Labour  administration.  |||    His  comments  come  as  the  co-chairman  of  the  Conservative  Party,  Liam  Fox,  on  Saturday  called  him  ""a  disappointment  of  historic  proportions""  as  a  prime  minister.  Mr  Blair  said  he  had  learned  from  a  series  of  at  times  tough  encounters  with  members  of  the  public,  during  question  and  answer  sessions  across  the  country  in  recent  weeks.  He  pledged  to  clamp  down  on  Britain's  growing  compensation  culture,  which  has  brought  concerns  that  doctors,  teachers  and  other  professionals  are  being  hampered  in  their  work  by  the  fear  of  frivolous  lawsuits.  |||    ""I  was  quite  shocked  to  be  told  by  people  who  were  running  a  nursery  that  they  were  worried  about  letting  the  kids  out  into  the  playground  when  it  was  wet  in  case  one  of  them  slipped  and  fell  and  they  ended  up  having  a  legal  case  [against  them],""  he  said.  |||    ""We  have  got  to  look  at  a  way  of  getting  people  protection  on  that.""  Mr  Blair  said  the  government  was  also  looking  at  ""how  to  make  sure  that  legal  aid  is  not  abused  with  actions  against  doctors  and  others"",  as  part  of  a  review  being  carried  out  by  the  Lord  Chancellor's  Department.  And  there  should  be  ""real  debate""  about  the  risk  posed  by  public  safety  threats,  he  said.  ""We  are  in  danger  of  -  depending  on  whatever  is  the  media  campaign  of  the  day  -  ending  up  spending  literally  hundreds,  sometimes  millions  of  pounds  meeting  quite  a  small  risk.""  |||    His  comments  come  after  the  government  announced  it  is  to  spend  £200m  on  drugs  to  treat  a  possible  outbreak  of  bird  flu,  and  the  Sudan  1  food  scare.  Meanwhile,  Commons  leader  Peter  Hain  has  warned  that  on  the  campaign  trail  he  has  seen  ""dangerous  complacency""  being  displayed  by  Labour  voters  convinced  of  a  general  election  victory.  If  Labour  voters  ""stayed  at  home""  in  marginal  seats  they  could  see  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  ""coming  in  the  back  door  to  Number  10  with  the  tradesman's  key  to  Number  10,  getting  into  power"",  he  added." 

1	"Elvis  'set  for  chart  hat-trick'  |||    The  late  US  legend  Elvis  Presley  is  likely  to  score  his  third  UK  number  one  single  in  three  weeks  on  Sunday,  according  to  early  sales  figures.  |||    The  king  of  rock  'n'  roll  has  already  had  consecutive  chart-toppers  with  Jailhouse  Rock  and  One  Night.  A  Fool  Such  As  I,  the  next  in  a  series  of  18  reissues,  is  on  course  to  beat  the  Chemical  Brothers  to  the  top.  But  his  next  single,  It's  Now  Or  Never,  will  face  a  challenge  from  tsunami  charity  single  Grief  Never  Grows  Old.  Sir  Cliff  Richard,  Russell  Watson,  Boy  George,  Bill  Wyman  and  members  of  the  Bee  Gees,  the  Beach  Boys,  America  and  the  Eagles  are  expected  to  feature  on  the  charity  song.  |||    Bookmakers  have  offered  odds  of  10/1  for  all  Presley's  18  hits  to  go  back  to  number  one.  A  Fool  Such  As  I  would  become  the  1,001st  number  one  single  in  UK  chart  history  after  One  Night  took  the  1,000th  place  on  Sunday.  The  latest  release  is  currently  outselling  the  Chemical  Brothers'  comeback  single  Galvanize  plus  other  new  releases  from  Athlete,  Ciara  and  Feeder.  Presley's  18  original  number  ones  are  being  reissued  as  limited  release  singles,  with  fans  eager  to  buy  the  set  to  fill  a  collector's  box  that  went  on  sale  in  the  first  week.  Record  company  Sony  BMG  is  now  manufacturing  5,000  more  copies  of  each  single  than  originally  planned  to  meet  demand,  taking  the  total  number  of  copies  of  each  song  on  sale  to  about  28,000." 

0	"Economy  'strong'  in  election  year  |||    UK  businesses  are  set  to  prosper  during  the  next  few  months  -  but  this  could  trigger  more  interest  rate  rises,  according  to  a  report.  |||    Optimism  is  at  its  highest  since  1997  and  business  will  reap  the  benefits  of  a  continuing  rise  in  public  spending,  say  researchers  at  BDO  Stoy  Hayward.  The  Bank  of  England  is  expected  to  keep  rates  on  hold  this  week  -  but  they  could  go  up  later  in  the  year.  Rates  are  likely  to  rise  after  the  anticipated  general  election  in  May.  The  BDO  optimism  index  -  a  leading  indicator  of  GDP  growth  two  quarters  ahead  edged  up  in  January  to  102.5,  from  102.2  in  October.  The  rise  is  due,  in  part,  to  an  increase  in  public  spending  and  increased  merger  and  acquisition  activity.  |||    The  only  thing  blighting  business  optimism  this  year  will  be  uncertainties  associated  with  the  general  election,  BDO  said.  Its  BDO's  output  index  -  which  predicts  GDP  movements  a  quarter  in  advance  -  remained  at  100.8  for  January,  implying  GDP  growth  at  2.9%  in  the  second  quarter  of  2005.  However,  the  output  index  is  being  held  back  by  recent  interest  rate  rises,  sterling's  strength  against  the  dollar  and  high  oil  prices,  the  group  noted.  Its  inflation  index,  which  has  risen  continuously  over  the  last  8  months,  climbed  to  110.0  in  January  from  108.0  in  October  last  year.  ""The  UK  is  looking  strong  going  into  the  general  election,  but  businesses  need  to  prepare  themselves  for  a  jolt  ahead  as  the  Bank  of  England  reacts  to  growth  and  inflationary  pressures,""  said  Peter  Hemington,  partner  at  BDO  Stoy  Hayward.  ""Growth  will  probably  slow  by  the  end  of  2005  and  it  is  likely  that  we  will  see  higher  interest  rates  or  a  sharp  drop  in  demand  for  products  and  services.""" 

0	"Dutch  bank  to  lay  off  2,850  staff  |||    ABN  Amro,  the  Netherlands'  largest  bank,  is  to  cut  2,850  jobs  as  a  result  of  falling  profits.  |||    The  cuts  -  amounting  to  3%  of  the  bank's  workforce  -  will  result  in  a  one-off  charge  of  790m  euros  ($1.1bn).  About  1,100  jobs  will  go  in  investment  banking  while  1,200  and  550  will  go  in  IT  and  human  resources  respectively.  ABN  Amro  is  the  third  large  European  bank  to  announce  cutbacks  in  the  past  month  following  Deutsche  Bank  and  Credit  Suisse  Group.  |||    Its  profitability  has  been  hit  by  a  fall  in  mortgage  lending  in  the  United  States  -  the  bank's  largest  single  market  -  following  recent  interest  rate  rises.  ABN  Amro's  operations  in  the  Netherlands  and  the  United  Kingdom  will  be  hardest  hit.  Jobs  will  also  be  lost  in  the  US  -  which  accounted  for  46%  of  profit  in  the  first  half  of  2004  -  and  across  its  operations  in  the  Americas  and  Asia-Pacific  regions.  |||    The  restructuring  is  designed  to  improve  efficiency  by  reducing  administrative  costs  and  increasing  focus  on  client  service.  The  bank  said  it  was  on  course  for  a  10%  rise  in  net  income  this  year  but  operating  profits  are  set  to  fall  because  of  a  fall  in  US  revenues.  ABN  Amro  currently  has  more  than  100,000  staff.  ""To  get  any  profit  growth  in  the  coming  years,  they  will  have  to  lower  costs,  so  shedding  jobs  makes  total  sense,""  Ivo  Geijsen,  an  analyst  with  Bank  Oyens  &  Van  Eeghen,  told  Bloomberg.  Europe's  leading  banks  seem  set  for  a  period  of  retrenchment.  Deutsche  Bank  said  earlier  this  month  it  would  reduce  its  German  workforce  by  1,920  while  as  many  as  300  jobs  will  be  lost  at  Credit  Suisse  First  Boston."

A  switch  to  new  models  hit  luxury  marque  Mercedes-Benz,  with  sales  down  3.1%  at  1.06  million.  Chrysler  avoided  the  fate  of  US  rivals  Ford  and  General  Motors,  both  of  whom  lost  ground  to  Japanese  firms.  Its  sales  rose  3.5%  to  2.7  million  units.  |||    Similarly  on  the  up  was  the  Smart  brand  of  compact  cars,  with  the  division's  sales  jumping  by  21.1%  during  2004  to  136,000.  The  future  of  the  brand  -  which  is  controlled  by  the  Mercedes  group  within  DaimlerChrysler  -  remains  in  question,  however.  Smart  has  consistently  lost  money  since  it  started  trading  in  1998,  and  new  model  launches  are  now  ""on  hold"",  said  Mercedes  chief  executive  Eckhard  Cordes.  In  Europe,  the  Smart  will  now  go  on  sale  through  regular  Mercedes  dealerships  as  well  as  its  own  dealer  network,  Mr  Cordes  said." 

2	"Hunt  demo  at  Labour  meeting  |||    Pro-hunt  supporters  are  set  to  protest  at  Labour's  spring  conference.  |||    The  Countryside  Alliance  says  it  expects  up  to  4,000  supporters  to  demonstrate  against  the  hunting  ban.  They  have  agreed  to  keep  to  a  demonstration  site  on  the  other  side  of  the  River  Tyne  from  the  conference  venue  in  Gateshead.  A  bid  to  overturn  the  law  banning  hunting  with  dogs  in  England  and  Wales  has  begun  in  the  Court  of  Appeal.  The  ban  comes  into  force  on  18  February.  The  Court  of  Appeal  is  expected  to  rule  early  next  week  on  whether  the  alliance's  challenge  has  succeeded.  Richard  Dodd,  regional  director  of  the  Countryside  Alliance,  said  he  expected  between  2,000  and  4,000  supporters  in  Tyneside  to  make  their  protest,  with  hunt  horns  and  placards.  |||    Campaigners  have  been  asked  not  to  bring  any  animals  or  alcohol.  |||    Mr  Dodd  said  he  did  not  believe  there  would  be  any  repeat  of  the  trouble  which  marred  the  pro-hunt  demonstration  outside  Parliament  in  September.  ""We  are  holding  a  static  demonstration,  just  to  remind  Labour  that  we  are  not  going  away,""  he  said.  Northumbria  Police  said  the  pedestrian  Millennium  Bridge,  by  the  demonstration  site,  will  be  shut  if  necessary.  But  Assistant  Chief  Constable  David  Warcup  has  liaised  with  several  protest  groups  and  said  all  negotiations  had  gone  well.  Fathers  4  Justice,  pensioners'  rights  activists  and  Stop  the  War  campaigners  were  also  expected  to  demonstrate  during  the  three-day  conference  which  starts  on  Friday.  Pro-hunt  campaigners  claims  the  1949  Parliament  Act  -  which  extends  the  right  of  the  House  of  Commons  to  overrule  the  House  of  Lords  -  was  itself  invalid  because  it  was  never  passed  by  peers.  The  High  Court  last  month  ruled  the  act  was  valid  and  the  proposed  hunting  ban  was  lawful.  Pro-hunt  supporters  formally  launched  their  second  legal  challenge  to  the  ban  in  London's  High  Court  on  Thursday.  The  Countryside  Alliance  has  lodged  papers  seeking  a  judicial  review  on  human  rights  grounds.  Animal  welfare  groups  have  welcomed  the  ban,  many  of  whom  have  campaigned  for  a  ban  for  decades  saying  hunting  is  cruel  and  unnecessary." 

1	"Hard  act  to  follow  for  OutKast  |||    US  rap  duo  OutKast's  trio  of  trophies  at  the  MTV  Europe  Awards  crowns  a  year  of  huge  success  for  the  band.  |||    The  latest  triumph  adds  to  the  three  Grammys  and  four  American  MTV  gongs  won  earlier  in  this  year.  Andre  3000  and  Big  Boi's  album  Speakerboxxx/The  Love  Below  has  been  critically  acclaimed  since  its  release  and  sold  in  large  quantities  around  the  world.  The  double  album  -  which  saw  the  pair  produce  one  disc  each  -  topped  the  charts  in  the  US  at  the  same  time  as  single  Hey  Ya!  It  took  another  track  from  the  exponents  of  southern  hip-hop  -  The  Way  You  Move  -  to  displace  it  from  the  top  spot.  The  Georgia  pair's  year  of  critical  and  commercial  triumph  leaves  them  with  a  tough  act  to  follow  -  what  can  be  next  for  a  musical  act  that  has  done  it  all?  |||    G  Money,  a  presenter  on  the  BBC's  urban  music  station  1Xtra,  thinks  a  hiatus  is  inevitable  after  such  a  sustained  period  of  exposure  -  giving  the  band  time  to  think  about  other  interests.  ""They  might  be  more  appearances  outside  the  band,  such  as  producing  for  other  artists,  while  they  have  a  number  of  fringe  music  projects.  ""Andre  3000  would  like  to  go  into  acting,  so  we  might  see  him  a  film,  while  Big  Boi  already  has  a  dog-breeding  business,""  says  the  DJ.  |||    ""But  in  a  couple  of  years  they  will  be  back  with  another  album  which  will  be  a  collaboration  unlike  their  double  CD.  ""Their  greatness  has  become  clear  with  Speakerboxxx/The  Love  Below.  We  haven't  seen  the  last  of  them,""  he  adds.  OutKast's  musical  career  spans  10  years  and  they  have  enjoyed  commercial  and  critical  success  in  the  past,  with  their  debut  Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik  going  platinum.  But  it  took  until  2001  for  the  pair  to  score  their  first  hit  in  the  UK  with  Ms  Jackson,  while  their  album  Stakonia  saw  their  fame  spread  beyond  the  US.  |||    1Xtra's  G  Money  says  it  took  the  latest  album,  released  in  2003,  for  him  to  be  ""assured  of  their  genius"".  ""They  have  always  been  experimental,  some  of  it  has  worked  and  some  hasn't,""  he  adds.  But  G  Money  acknowledges  that  making  the  next  move  for  a  band  that  has  reached  a  pinnacle  can  be  tough.  ""What  can  you  do  next  when  you've  done  it  all?""  he  says.  With  ten  years  of  success  behind  them  and  worldwide  fame,  it  seems  that  OutKast  is  not  a  name  that  is  likely  to  be  forgotten  in  a  hurry." 

2	"Schools  to  take  part  in  mock  poll  |||    Record  numbers  of  schools  across  the  UK  are  to  take  part  in  a  mock  general  election  backed  by  the  government.  |||    Some  600  schools  have  already  signed  up  for  the  Y  Vote  Mock  Elections  2005  run  by  the  Hansard  Society  and  aimed  at  boosting  interest  in  politics.  Pupils  in  the  schools  taking  part  will  learn  the  skills  of  speech  writers,  canvassers  and  political  candidates.  Schools  Minister  Stephen  Twigg  said  engaging  young  people's  interest  was  ""essential""  to  the  future  of  democracy.  |||    He  added:  said  ""Young  people  who  are  engaged  and  motivated  by  the  political  process  are  essential  to  the  future  health  of  our  democracy.  ""The  mock  elections  initiative  provides  an  opportunity  for  pupils  to  develop  their  own  understanding  of  how  the  democratic  process  works  and  why  it  matters.  ""By  experiencing  the  election  process  first  hand  -  from  running  a  campaign  to  the  declaration  of  the  final  result  -  we  hope  that  young  people  will  develop  the  enthusiasm  to  take  part  in  the  future.""  The  Hansard  Society,  the  Electoral  Commission  and  the  Department  for  Education  and  Skills  are  running  the  programme.  Pupils  will  stand  as  party  candidates,  speech  writers  and  canvassers.  Michael  Raftery,  project  manager  at  the  Hansard  Society,  said:  ""The  Y  Vote  Mock  Elections  for  schools  mirror  the  excitement  and  buzz  of  a  real  election,  raising  awareness  of  citizenship,  and  the  benefits  of  active  democracy.""  The  mock  votes  will  take  place  around  5  May,  widely  expected  to  be  the  date  of  the  general  election.  Information  packs,  including  ballot  papers  and  manifesto  guides,  with  elections  happening  in  early  May  were  sent  out  to  the  3,000  schools  invited  to  take  part." 

0	"US  regulator  to  rule  on  pain  drug  |||    US  food  and  drug  regulators  will  decide  on  Friday  whether  to  recommend  the  sale  of  painkillers  that  have  been  linked  to  a  high  risk  of  heart  attack  and  stroke.  |||    The  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  advisory  panel  will  give  its  verdict  after  hearing  evidence  for  three  days.  The  painkillers  -  called  COX-2  inhibitors  -  are  sold  under  brand  names  such  as  Celebrex  and  Vioxx.  Vioxx  was  withdrawn  from  shops  last  year  but  Merck  said  it  would  consider  selling  it  if  it  gets  FDA  approval.  The  FDA  has  been  asked  to  decide  if  the  benefits  to  patients  justify  the  increased  risks.  |||    Putting  Vioxx  back  on  the  shelves  is  likely  to  boost  profits  at  Merck  and  make  easier  any  legal  battles  with  people  who  claim  to  have  been  injured  by  the  drug,  analysts  said.  |||    Merck  voluntarily  stopped  sales  of  Vioxx  on  30  September,  a  move  which  caused  the  firm's  fourth-quarter  earnings  to  slide  to  $1.1bn  (£581m),  from  $1.4bn  a  year  earlier.  Merck's  shares  tumbled  more  than  10%  on  the  news  and  the  company  has  had  to  set  aside  millions  of  dollars  to  cover  the  cost  of  Vioxx-related  litigation.  Alarm  bells  were  rung  by  a  research  note  called  Approve  which  showed  that  the  risk  of  heart  attack  and  stroke  doubled  in  patients  who  had  been  taking  the  drug  for  at  least  18  months.  The  Cox-2  inhibitors  were  developed  by  drug  companies,  including  Merck  and  Pfizer,  because  they  cause  users  fewer  stomach  problems  than  other  painkillers.  |||    Pfizer  is  still  selling  its  Celebrex  and  Bextra  products,  though  investigations  have  suggested  that  they  may  also  be  harmful  to  the  heart.  Merck's  announcement  of  a  possible  reintroduction  of  Vioxx  caught  analysts  by  surprise.  Merck's  head  of  research  Peter  Kim  said  that  it  withdrew  Vioxx  ""based  on  the  information  that  was  available  to  us  at  the  time,  knowing  there  were  alternative  therapies"".  He  went  on  to  say  that  things  have  since  changed  in  the  light  of  new  reports.  ""Given  this  new  information,  its  is  not  clear  that  the  cardiovascular  risk  observed  in  Approve  makes  Vioxx  unique  in  the  class  of  similar  drugs  marketed  in  the  US,""  Mr  Kim  explained.  |||    On  Thursday,  David  Graham  from  the  FDA's  Office  of  Drug  Safety  told  the  advisory  panel  that  ""there  really  doesn't  appear  to  be  a  need  for  Cox-2""  inhibitors.  According  to  calculations  presented  to  the  US  Senate  by  Dr  Graham  in  November,  Vioxx  may  be  linked  to  as  many  as  to  56,000  American  deaths.  Facing  stem  criticism  for  its  handling  of  the  Vioxx  case,  the  FDA  said  on  Tuesday  that  it  will  create  an  independent  body  to  oversee  the  safety  of  drugs  already  in  the  market  place.  European  regulators,  meanwhile,  ruled  on  Thursday  that  patients  who  have  had  heart  disease  or  a  stroke  should  not  take  Cox-2  inhibitors.  The  European  Medicines  Agency  also  said  doctors  should  be  ""cautious""  about  giving  the  drugs  to  patients  who  have  risk  factors  for  heart  disease." 

1	"Fockers  fuel  festive  film  chart  |||    Comedy  Meet  The  Fockers  topped  the  festive  box  office  in  North  America,  setting  a  new  record  for  Christmas  Day.  |||    The  sequel  took  $44.7m  (£23.2m)  between  24  and  26  December,  according  to  studio  estimates.  It  took  $19.1m  (£9.9m)  on  Christmas  Day  alone,  the  highest  takings  on  that  day  in  box  office  history.  Meet  The  Fockers  is  the  sequel  to  Ben  Stiller  comedy  Meet  The  Parents,  also  starring  Robert  De  Niro,  Blythe  Danner,  Dustin  Hoffman  and  Barbra  Streisand.  Despite  the  success  of  Meet  The  Fockers,  takings  were  down  26.5%  on  2003's  figures  -  which  was  blamed  on  Christmas  falling  over  a  weekend  this  year.  |||    ""When  Christmas  falls  on  a  weekend,  it's  bad  for  business,""  said  Paul  Dergarabedian,  president  of  Exhibitor  Relations,  which  compiles  box  office  statistics.  The  weekend's  top  12  films  took  an  estimated  $121.9m  (£63.3m),  compared  with  $165.8m  (£86.1m)  last  year,  when  the  third  Lord  of  the  Rings  film  dominated  the  box  office.  Meet  The  Fockers  knocked  last  week's  top  film,  Lemony  Snicket's  A  Series  of  Unfortunate  Events,  down  to  third  place,  with  $12.5m  (£6.5m).  Comedy  Fat  Albert  -  co-written  by  Bill  Cosby  -  entered  the  chart  in  second  place  after  opening  on  Christmas  Day,  taking  $12.7m  (£6.6m).  The  Aviator,  starring  Leonardo  DiCaprio  as  Howard  Hughes,  took  $9.4m  after  expanding  from  40  to  1,796  cinemas  on  Christmas  Day." 

2	"Parties  warned  over  'grey  vote'  |||    Political  parties  cannot  afford  to  take  older  UK  voters  for  granted  in  the  coming  election,  says  Age  Concern.  |||    A  survey  for  the  charity  suggests  69%  of  over-55s  say  they  always  vote  in  a  general  election  compared  with  just  17%  of  18  to  24  year  olds.  Charity  boss  Gordon  Lishman  said  if  a  ""decisive  blow""  was  struck  at  the  election  it  would  be  by  older  voters  who  could  be  relied  on  to  turn  out.  A  total  of  3,028  adults  aged  18  or  over  were  interviewed  for  the  study.  Mr  Lishman  urged  the  next  government  to  boost  state  pension.  |||    He  also  called  for  measures  to  combat  ageism  and  build  effective  public  services  to  ""support  us  all  in  an  ageing  society"".  ""Older  people  want  to  see  manifesto  commitments  that  will  make  a  difference  to  their  lives,""  Mr  Lishman  said.  ""Political  parties  must  wake  up  to  the  fact  that  unless  they  address  the  demands  and  concerns  of  older  people  they  will  not  keep  or  attract  their  vote.""  In  the  survey  carried  out  by  ICM  Research,  14%  of  people  aged  between  18  and  34  said  they  never  voted  in  general  elections.  Among  the  over-65s,  70%  said  they  would  be  certain  to  vote  in  an  immediate  election,  compared  with  39%  of  people  under  55.  Age  Concern  says  the  over-55s  are  ""united  around""  key  areas  of  policy  they  want  the  government  to  focus  on.  For  57%,  pensions  and  the  NHS  were  key  issues,  while  the  economy  was  important  for  a  third,  and  tax  was  a  crucial  area  for  25%." 

2	"MPs'  murder  sentence  concern  |||    Murder  sentences  should  not  be  reduced  automatically  simply  because  of  a  guilty  plea,  says  a  new  MPs'  report.  |||    The  influential  Commons  home  affairs  committee  was  responding  to  sentencing  guidelines  issued  this  summer.  The  MPs  also  call  for  tougher  sentences  for  crimes  committed  under  the  influence  of  drink  or  drugs.  They  say  the  influence  of  drugs  and  alcohol  should  be  introduced  as  an  aggravating  factor  when  judges  and  magistrates  sentence  offenders.  Committee  chairman  John  Denham  said  drugs  of  alcohol  were  sometimes  used  as  an  excuse.  |||    ""The  committee  believes  that  these  arguments  should  be  rejected  by  sentencers  and  that  being  under  their  influence  should  instead  be  an  aggravating  factor.""  At  present  judges,  when  sentencing  murderers  to  the  mandatory  life  sentence,  can  reduce  the  tariff  -  the  minimum  term  they  must  serve  -  if  the  defendant  pleads  guilty.  But  although  they  are  spared  the  ordeal  of  a  trial  many  murder  victims'  relatives  are  unhappy.  In  July  this  year  Amanda  Champion's  killer,  James  Ford,  pleaded  guilty  to  her  murder  and  was  jailed  for  at  least  15  years  -  it  would  have  been  longer  had  he  denied  the  charge.  |||    Amanda's  uncle,  Lewis  Champion,  told  the  BBC  News  website  Ford  did  not  deserve  any  credit  for  his  plea,  saying:  ""Nothing  at  all  is  worth  taking  five  years  off  a  murder  sentence.""  MPs  criticised  Home  Secretary  David  Blunkett  last  year  for  introducing  last-minute  rules  allowing  reduced  sentences  for  murderers  who  pleaded  guilty.  |||    The  measures  passed  into  law  virtually  unnoticed  after  Mr  Blunkett  introduced  them  at  a  late  stage  of  the  Criminal  Justice  Bill.  |||    As  a  result,  says  the  committee,  the  government  may  need  to  re-legislate  to  ""remove  ambiguity""  over  how  murderers  should  be  sentenced.  It  is  also  calling  on  the  senior  judge  in  England  and  Wales,  Lord  Woolf,  to  abandon  draft  guidelines  he  proposed  in  September  to  reduce  sentences  of  murderers  who  plead  guilty.  The  committee  said  the  plans  had  not  reflected  the  ""public  disquiet""  expressed  over  the  possibility  of  significantly  reduced  prison  terms  for  murderers.  Lord  Woolf's  Sentencing  Guidelines  Council  (SGC)  caused  further  controversy  by  suggesting  a  one  third  discount  off  sentences  for  early  guilty  pleas  in  all  types  of  crime.  As  a  result  murderers  who  face  a  15-year  tariff  could  get  five  years  knocked  off  if  they  give  themselves  up  to  the  police.  |||    Mr  Denham  believes  the  SGC  should  reconsider  its  proposals  to  reflect  Parliament's  wish  that  murder  should  be  treated  as  a  separate  and  especially  grave  category  of  offence.  He  said:  ""We  want  to  see  sentencers  advised  that  in  the  case  of  murder,  reduction  in  sentence  for  a  guilty  plea  should  not  normally  be  granted  in  addition  to  reductions  for  other  mitigating  circumstances.""  But  a  spokesman  for  the  Home  Office  defended  the  proposals.  He  said:  ""By  making  express  provision  for  murder  tariffs  in  the  Criminal  Justice  Act,  Parliament  sent  a  clear  signal  that  it  expects  murder  to  be  treated  differently  to  other  offences.  ""We  stand  by  the  provisions  in  the  Act  that  cover  guilty  plea  discounts,  which  have  potential  benefits  for  victims  and  witnesses  of  avoiding  the  trauma  of  a  trial.""  |||    Shadow  home  secretary  David  Davis  echoed  criticisms  of  the  way  Mr  Blunkett  introduced  the  murder  tariff  rules.  ""There  is  genuine  concern  about  potential  reductions  in  murder  sentences  -  such  action  sends  out  the  wrong  signals  to  violent  criminals  and  completely  undermines  the  government's  claim  to  be  tough  on  crime,""  he  said.  But  Liberal  Democrat  spokesman  Mark  Oaten  warned  the  MPs'  committee  that  binding  judges  too  much  might  look  like  political  interference.  ""The  danger  of  having  a  prescriptive  approach  is  that  whilst  every  murder  is  awful,  it  is  also  different,""  he  told  BBC  News."

Yukos'  US  lawyers  will  attempt  to  have  Baikal  assets  frozen  after  the  Russian  government  ignored  a  US  court  order  last  week  blocking  the  sale.  Baikal's  background  and  its  motives  for  buying  the  unit  are  still  unclear.  |||    Russian  newspapers  have  claimed  that  Baikal  -  which  bought  the  Yuganskneftegas  production  unit  for  $9.4bn  (261bn  roubles,  £4.8bn)  on  Sunday  at  a  state  provoked  auction  -  has  strong  links  with  Surgutneftegas,  Russia's  fourth-biggest  oil  producer.  Many  observers  believe  that  the  unit,  which  produces  60%  of  Yukos'  oil  output,  could  ultimately  fall  into  the  hands  of  Surgutneftegas  or  even  Gazprom,  the  state  gas  firm  which  opted  out  of  the  auction.  |||    The  Russian  government  forced  the  sale  of  Yukos'  most  lucrative  asset  as  part  of  its  action  to  enforce  a  $27bn  back  tax  bill  it  says  the  company  owes.  Yukos'  US  lawyers  claim  the  auction  was  illegal  because  the  firm  had  filed  for  bankruptcy  and  therefore  its  assets  were  now  under  the  protection  of  US  bankruptcy  law  which  has  worldwide  jurisdiction.  On  Wednesday,  Yukos  will  also  seek  further  legal  remedies  to  prevent  the  break-up  of  the  group.  ""We  believe  the  auction  was  illegal  and  we  intend  to  pursue  all  legal  recourses  available  to  us,""  Yukos  spokesman  Mike  Lake  told  Agence  France  Press.  ""If  it  exports  that  oil,  it  will  be  marketing  a  stolen  product,""  he  added.  The  future  ownership  of  Yuganksneftegas  remains  unclear  amid  widespread  suggestions  that  Baikal  was  established  as  a  front  for  other  interests.  |||    Speaking  on  Tuesday,  President  Putin  said  Baikal  was  owned  by  individual  investors  who  planned  to  build  relationships  with  other  Russian  energy  firms  interested  in  the  development  of  Yuganskneftegas.  President  Putin  also  suggested  that  China's  National  Petroleum  Corporation  could  play  a  role  in  the  unit's  future  after  signing  a  commercial  agreement  with  Gazprom  to  work  on  joint  energy  projects.  Yukos  has  claimed  that  the  sale  of  its  main  asset  will  lead  to  the  collapse  of  the  company.  Commentators  and  Yukos  itself  claim  the  firm  is  the  target  of  a  government  campaign  to  destroy  it  because  of  the  political  ambitions  of  its  founder,  Mikhail  Khodorkovsky."

Allowing  for  changes  in  calculating  statistics,  the  average  number  of  people  out  of  work  was  the  highest  since  1990  -  or  a  rate  of  10.8%.  Bad  weather  and  a  sluggish  economy  were  blamed  for  the  rise.  The  increase  ""was  due  primarily  to  the  onstart  of  winter"",  labour  office  chief  Frank-Juergen  Weise  said.  |||    Unadjusted,  the  figures  showed  unemployment  rose  206,900  to  4.64  million  -  with  many  sectors  such  as  construction  laying  off  workers  amid  bad  weather.  ""The  three  years  of  stagnation  in  the  German  economy  came  to  an  end  in  2004.  But  the  upturn  is  still  not  strong  enough""  to  boost  the  labour  market,  Mr  Weise  added.  News  of  the  rise  came  as  government  welfare  reforms  came  into  force,  a  move  that  is  expected  to  see  unemployment  swell  still  further  in  coming  months.  Under  the  Hartz  IV  changes,  the  previous  two  tier  system  of  benefits  and  support  for  the  long  term  unemployed  has  been  replaced  with  one  flat-rate  payout.  In  turn,  that  means  more  people  will  be  classified  as  looking  for  work,  driving  official  figures  higher.  |||    ""Be  prepared  for  a  nasty  figure  for  January  2005,  about  five  million  unemployed  on  a  non-seasonally  adjusted  basis,""  warned  HVB  Group  economist  Andreas  Rees.  But  he  did  add  that  the  numbers  should  ""subside""  throughout  the  year,  to  remain  near  2004's  level  of  4.4  million  jobless.  ""I  don't  expect  a  strong  and  lasting  turnaround  until  2006,""  German  Economy  minister  Wolfgang  Clement  said.  By  2010,  however,  the  Hartz  IV  reforms  should  help  cut  the  average  jobless  rate  to  between  3%  and  5%,  he  added.  Europe's  biggest  economy  has  been  too  weak  to  create  work  as  it  struggles  to  shake  off  three  years  of  economic  stagnation.  In  recent  months  companies  such  as  Adam  Opel  -  the  German  arm  of  US  carmaker  General  Motors  -  and  retailer  KarstadtQuelle  have  slashed  jobs." 

1	"DVD  review:  I,  Robot  |||    Only  one  man  recognises  that  robots  are  a  threat  to  humanity  -  but  that's  fine  because  it  only  takes  one  man  to  save  the  day  in  the  thriller  I,  Robot.  |||    Will  Smith  co-stars  alongside  more  CGI  robots  than  you  can  count  and  as  a  thrill-a-minute  kind  of  action  film,  it's  perfectly  adequate.  You'll  have  forgotten  it  all  tomorrow  but  you'll  have  a  fun  night  with  the  film  and  all  the  extras.  There  is  a  one-disc  version  that  has  commentaries  and  a  Making  Of  but  the  two-disc  adds  more.  Unusually  for  this  kind  of  film,  the  extras  don't  solely  concentrate  on  the  special  effects.  They're  covered  but  there's  also  a  general  Production  Diary  and  a  Post-Production  feature.  |||    Remember  the  National  Lottery's  draw  machines  Arthur  and  Guinevere?  They  were  more  accurate  than  this  glossy  Hollywood  version  of  the  tale.  |||    But  as  long  as  you're  not  expecting  a  documentary,  live  with  it:  King  Arthur  is  a  fun,  exciting,  totally  shallow  experience  and  looks  excellent.  Clive  Owen  is  the  brooding  king,  Keira  Knightly  rises  above  her  costume  and  Ray  Winstone  gives  it  all  some  grit.  It's  at  its  best  in  its  battle  scenes  which  are  well  done  and  are  also  the  best  part  of  the  Making  Of  extra.  |||    Less  flashy  than  a  David  Attenborough  show  and  less  detailed  than  a  Simon  Schama  one,  the  BBC  series  British  Isles  nevertheless  turned  out  to  be  quite  engrossing.  Admit  it,  the  fact  that  this  is  one  of  the  shows  Alan  Titchmarsh  left  Ground  Force  to  present  did  mean  that  you  expected  something  equally  frothy.  But  Titchmarsh  turns  out  to  know  his  subject  and  the  sight  of  our  present-day  landscape  being  peeled  back  to  reveal  the  past  was  fascinating.  He's  now  written  an  accompanying  book,  too."

The  world's  richest  countries  have  said  they  want  to  increase  the  amount  of  aid  they  give  to  0.7%  of  their  annual  gross  national  income  by  2015.  Airlines  have  reacted  strongly  against  the  proposed  fuel  levy.  |||    Profits  have  been  under  pressure  in  the  airline  industry,  with  low-cost  firms  driving  down  prices  and  demand  dipping  after  the  11  September  terrorist  attacks  and  the  outbreak  of  the  killer  SARS  virus.  |||    Things  have  picked  up,  but  some  European  and  US  companies  are  teetering  on  the  brink  of  bankruptcy.  At  present,  the  fuel  used  by  airlines  enjoys  either  a  very  low  tax  rate  or  is  untaxed  in  EU  member  states.  ""Of  course  we  applaud  humanitarian  initiatives,  but  why  target  the  airlines?""  said  Ulrich  Schulte-Strathaus,  secretary  general  of  the  Association  of  European  Airlines.  ""Our  industry  is  in  the  midst  of  a  fundamental  crisis...only  to  be  once  again  confronted  with  a  measure  designed  to  increase  our  costs,""  he  continued.  |||    The  EU  sought  to  allay  the  airlines'  fears,  stressing  that  Thursday's  meeting  was  only  a  first  step  and  that  other  proposals  were  also  under  consideration.  It  added  that  any  plan  to  levy  taxes  on  jet  fuel  ""should  not  hinder  the  competitiveness  of  the  airlines  and  that  they  themselves  will  not  be  solely  funding  development"".  Any  tax  would  only  be  implemented  after  full  consultation  with  the  airlines,  the  EU  said.  There  is  thought  to  be  widespread  support  for  the  plan  -  tabled  by  France  and  Germany  following  the  recent  G7  meeting  of  the  world's  richest  nations  -  from  EU  ministers.  The  issue  of  poverty  in  Africa  and  South  Asia  has  forced  itself  to  the  top  of  the  politicial  agenda,  with  politicians  and  campaigners  calling  for  more  to  be  done.  At  their  meeting  in  London,  G7  finance  ministers  backed  plans  to  write  off  up  to  100%  of  the  debts  of  some  of  the  world's  poorest  countries." 

0	"Sluggish  economy  hits  German  jobs  |||    The  number  of  people  out  of  work  in  Europe's  largest  economy  has  risen  for  the  tenth  straight  month  as  growth  remains  stubbornly  slow.  |||    German  unemployment  rose  7,000  in  November  to  4.464  million  people,  or  10.8%  of  the  workforce.  The  seasonally  adjusted  rise  showed  a  smaller  rise  than  expected,  as  government  measures  to  encourage  job  creation  began  to  take  effect.  But  officials  said  stagnant  growth  was  still  stifling  the  job  market.  ""There  are  clear  signs  of  a  revival  in  domestic  demand,""  said  Frank-Juergen  Weise,  head  of  the  Federal  Labour  Agency,  in  a  statement.  ""But  growth  of  0.1%...  in  the  third  quarter  is  still  insufficient  to  deliver  positive  momentum  to  the  labour  market.""  High  oil  prices  and  the  soaring  euro  -  which  damages  the  competitiveness  of  exporters  -  were  also  having  a  negative  effect,  he  said.  The  brunt  of  the  unemployment  is  still  being  felt  in  the  eastern  part  of  Germany,  where  the  rate  is  18.8%.  |||    With  unemployment  stuck  above  4  million  for  years,  the  government  of  Chancellor  Gerhard  Schroeder  has  put  job  creation  at  the  top  of  the  agenda.  A  controversial  package  of  measures  to  shake  up  incentives  to  get  back  to  work,  paid  for  by  cutting  some  cherished  benefits,  has  sparked  anger  among  some  German  workers.  Strikes  in  a  number  of  industries,  notably  among  the  country's  iconic  carmakers,  have  demonstrated  the  displeasure  -  as  well  as  fears  about  further  job  losses  as  outsourcing  takes  hold.  Among  the  new  initiatives  are  the  so-called  ""one-euro  jobs""  which  top  up  unemployment  benefit.  The  scheme's  formal  launch  is  January,  but  hirings  for  these  positions  are  already  taking  place  and  affecting  the  unemployment  statistics,  economists  said.  ""The  deterioration  of  the  labour  market  does  not  come  as  a  surprise,""  said  Isabelle  Kronawitter  at  Hypovereinsbank.  ""Job  creation  measures  probably  prevented  a  stronger  increase  in  the  seasonally  adjusted  numbers."""

British  actress  Imelda  Staunton  has  again  been  recognised  for  her  role  in  Vera  Drake,  winning  best  actress,  while  Liam  Neeson  won  best  actor  for  Kinsey.  The  awards  will  be  handed  out  on  13  January  at  a  ceremony  in  Las  Vegas.  |||    Sideways  tells  the  story  of  two  men  who  take  a  road  trip  through  California's  wine  regions  and  also  stars  Paul  Giamatti.  Virginia  Madsen  was  also  named  best  supporting  actress  for  her  performance  in  the  film.  House  of  Flying  Daggers,  directed  by  Yimou  Zhang,  was  named  best  foreign  language  film,  while  the  animation  award  went  to  The  Incredibles.  Unusually,  the  runners-up  in  categories  were  also  named  with  Clint  Eastwood's  Million  Dollar  Baby  just  missing  out  on  the  best  film  award.

The  combined  firm  will  operate  about  1,000  stores  across  the  US,  with  combined  annual  sales  of  $30bn.  The  two  companies,  facing  competition  from  the  likes  of  Wal-Mart,  tried  to  merge  two  years  ago  but  talks  failed.  Sources  familiar  with  the  deal  said  that  negotiations  between  the  two  companies  sped  up  after  May's  chairman  and  chief  executive  Gene  Kahn  resigned  in  January.  As  part  of  the  deal,  Federated  -  owner  of  Macy's  and  Bloomingdale's  -  will  assume  $6bn  of  May's  debt,  bringing  the  deal's  total  value  to  $17bn.  Directors  at  both  companies  have  approved  the  deal  and  it  is  expected  to  conclude  by  the  third  quarter  of  this  year.  |||    May  has  struggled  to  compete  against  larger  department  store  groups  such  as  Federated  and  other  retailers  such  as  Wal-Mart.  Federated  expects  the  merger  to  boost  earnings  from  2007  but  the  deal  will  cost  it  $1bn  in  one-off  charges.  |||    ""We  have  taken  the  first  step  toward  combining  two  of  the  best  department  store  companies  in  America,  creating  a  new  retail  company  with  truly  national  scope  and  presence,""  said  Terry  Lundgren,  Federated's  chairman.  Some  analysts  see  the  merger  as  a  rescue  deal  for  May.  ""Without  this  deal  May  would  have  been,  to  put  it  bluntly,  washed  up,""  said  Kurt  Barnard,  president  of  Barnard's  Retail  Consulting  Group.  Federated  has  annual  sales  of  $15.6bn,  while  May's  yearly  sales  are  $14.4bn." 

0	"US  adds  more  jobs  than  expected  |||    The  US  economy  added  337,000  jobs  in  October  -  a  seven-month  high  and  far  more  than  Wall  Street  expectations.  |||    In  a  welcome  economic  boost  for  newly  re-elected  President  George  W  Bush,  the  Labor  Department  figures  come  after  a  slow  summer  of  weak  jobs  gains.  Jobs  were  created  in  every  sector  of  the  US  economy  except  manufacturing.  While  the  separate  unemployment  rate  went  up  to  5.5%  from  5.4%  in  September,  this  was  because  more  people  were  now  actively  seeking  work.  |||    The  337,000  new  jobs  added  to  US  payrolls  in  October  was  twice  the  169,000  figure  that  Wall  Street  economists  had  forecast.  In  addition,  the  Labor  Department  revised  up  the  number  of  jobs  created  in  the  two  previous  months  -  to  139,000  in  September  instead  of  96,000,  and  to  198,000  in  August  instead  of  128,000.  The  better  than  expected  jobs  data  had  an  immediate  upward  effect  on  stocks  in  New  York,  with  the  main  Dow  Jones  index  gaining  45.4  points  to  10,360  by  late  morning  trading.  ""It  looks  like  the  job  situation  is  improving  and  that  this  will  support  consumer  spending  going  into  the  holidays,  and  offset  some  of  the  drag  caused  by  high  oil  prices  this  year,""  said  economist  Gary  Thayer  of  AG  Edwards  &  Sons.  |||    Other  analysts  said  the  upbeat  jobs  data  made  it  more  likely  that  the  US  Federal  Reserve  would  increase  interest  rates  by  a  quarter  of  a  percentage  point  to  2%  when  it  meets  next  week.  ""It  should  empower  the  Fed  to  clearly  do  something,""  said  Robert  MacIntosh,  chief  economist  with  Eaton  Vance  Management  in  Boston.  Kathleen  Utgoff,  commissioner  of  the  Bureau  of  Labor,  said  many  of  the  71,000  new  construction  jobs  added  in  October  were  involved  in  rebuilding  and  clean-up  work  in  Florida,  and  neighbouring  Deep  South  states,  following  four  hurricanes  in  August  and  September.  The  dollar  rose  temporarily  on  the  job  creation  news  before  falling  back  to  a  new  record  low  against  the  euro,  as  investors  returned  their  attention  to  other  economic  factors,  such  as  the  US's  record  trade  deficit.  There  is  also  speculation  that  President  Bush  will  deliberately  try  to  keep  the  dollar  low  in  order  to  assist  a  growth  in  exports." 

2	"Brown  and  Blair  face  new  rift  claims  |||    For  the  umpteenth  time,  Tony  Blair  and  Gordon  Brown  are  said  to  have  declared  all  out  war  on  each  other.  |||    This  time  the  alleged  rift  is  over  who  should  take  the  credit  for  the  government's  global  aid  and  debt  initiatives,  particularly  in  the  wake  of  the  tsunami  disaster  -  an  issue  many  hoped  and  believed  was  above  such  things.  It  dominated  the  prime  minister's  monthly  news  conference,  which  saw  Mr  Blair  start  in  full  irritation  mode  as  he  was  forced  to  bat  away  question  after  question  about  his  relationship  with  his  neighbour.  As  he  told  journalists:  ""I  am  not  interested  in  what  goes  in  and  out  of  newspapers.  There  is  a  complete  unity  of  purpose.""  And  he  again  heaped  praise  on  Mr  Brown  saying  he  was  doing  a  great  job,  and  would  continue  doing  it  -  although  he  would  not  commit  to  any  job  for  Mr  Brown  after  the  election.  |||    So  why  did  he  arrange  his  press  conference  at  the  last  moment  so  it  coincided  with  Mr  Brown's  long-arranged  keynote  speech  on  aid  and  debt,  he  was  asked?  By  now  Mr  Blair  had  moved  from  irritation  mode  to  his  barely  disguised  fury  setting.  He  snapped  back  that  the  hacks  knew  very  well  what  the  operational  reasons  were  for  the  timing  of  his  press  conference.  Well,  not  really,  as  it  happens.  |||    And  he  repeated  what  a  great  man  Gordon  was  and  how  united  they  were,  before  again  sneering  that  he  took  absolutely  no  notice  of  what  went  in  and  out  of  the  newspapers,  preferring  to  get  on  with  the  job  of  doing  the  best  for  the  country  and  the  world.  Although  in  the  next  breath  he  declared:  ""I  get  increasingly  alarmed  by  what  I  read  in  the  newspapers""  before  catching  himself  on  and  quickly  adding:  ""In  so  far  as  I  read  them  of  course.""  He  probably  had  good  reason  to  be  alarmed  because  the  newspapers  had  been  full  of  stories  about  the  claimed  open  warfare  between  the  two  men.  |||    As  far  as  the  timing  of  the  prime  minister's  press  conference  is  concerned,  there  are  two  options.  The  first  is  that  it  was  a  calculated  attempt  to  upstage  the  chancellor  and  seize  back  the  initiative  on  the  big  issue  of  the  moment.  If  that  is  the  case  it  suggests  that  even  the  fear  of  seriously  negative  newspaper  headlines  is  not  enough  to  stop  the  squabbling.  The  second  option  is  that  it  was  an  unavoidable  coincidence,  which  would  suggest  the  government  has  lost  its  once-famed  ability  to  strictly  co-ordinate  announcements  -  through  the  infamous  Downing  Street  grid  -  to  avert  just  such  allegations.  |||    Either  way,  the  effect  was  the  same  -  to  overshadow  the  big  announcements  of  government  policy  on  a  hugely  pertinent  issue.  And  there  had  been  previous  suggestions  that  the  new  year  had  started  with  a  fresh  outbreak  of  the  warfare  between  the  two  men.  Firstly,  the  prime  minister  insisted  on  Wednesday  that  he  had  been  intimately  involved  in  the  development  of  the  proposals  to  get  G8  countries  to  freeze  debt  repayments  from  the  tsunami-hit  countries.  It  was  claimed  he  had  been  embarrassed  by  the  fact  that  Gordon  Brown  appeared  to  have  taken  the  initiative  over  the  government's  response  to  the  disaster  while  Mr  Blair  was  still  on  holiday  in  Egypt.  |||    Then,  as  if  to  pour  fuel  on  the  flames,  both  men  separately  spoke  about  working  on  tsunami  or  wider  aid  and  development  policy  with  their  cabinet  colleagues  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw,  Aid  minister  Hilary  Benn  and  Deputy  Prime  Minister  John  Prescott  -  without  mentioning  the  other.  All  this  came  amid  fresh  claims  that  Mr  Brown  was  still  seething  that  he  had  been  excluded  from  a  prominent  role  in  general  election  planning  and  had,  as  a  result,  started  to  set  out  his  own  platform.  The  fact  that  he  used  an  article  in  the  Guardian  newspaper  to  set  out  what  he  believed  ""should""  be  in  the  manifesto,  has  embarked  on  a  mini  tour  of  Britain  to  set  out  his  aid  plans  and  will  next  week  visit  Africa  on  the  same  mission  -  often  seen  as  the  prime  minister's  ""turf""  -  has  only  added  to  the  impression  of  rival  camps  operating  entirely  independently  of  each  other.  The  prime  minister  denied  all  that  as  well,  repeating  his  insistence  that  it  was  inconceivable  the  economy  and  the  chancellor  would  not  be  at  the  centre  of  the  election  campaign.  But  the  big  fear  with  many  on  the  Labour  benches  now  is  that,  unless  a  lid  can  be  put  on  the  speculation  over  the  rivalry,  it  may  even  threaten  to  undermine  the  election  campaign  itself." 

0	"'Post-Christmas  lull'  in  lending  |||    UK  mortgage  lending  showed  a  ""post-Christmas  lull""  in  January,  indicating  a  slowing  housing  market,  lenders  have  said.  |||    Both  the  Council  of  Mortgage  Lenders  (CML)  and  Building  Society  Association  (BSA)  said  lending  was  down  sharply.  The  CML  said  gross  mortgage  lending  stood  at  £17.9bn,  compared  with  £21.8bn  in  January  last  year.  The  BSA  said  mortgage  approvals  -  loans  approved  but  not  yet  made  -  were  £2bn,  down  from  £2.6bn  in  January  2004.  |||    At  the  same  time,  the  British  Bankers'  Association  (BBA)  said  lending  was  ""weaker"".  Overall,  the  BBA  said  mortgage  lending  rose  by  £4bn  in  January,  a  far  smaller  increase  than  the  £5.1bn  seen  in  December.  This  was  a  return  to  the  ""weaker  pattern""  of  lending  seen  in  the  last  months  of  2004,  the  BBA  added.  However,  it  is  the  year-on-year  lending  comparisons  which  are  the  most  striking.  The  CML  said  lending  for  house  purchases  and  gross  mortgage  lending  were  29%  and  18%  lower  year-on-year  respectively.  ""These  figures  show  beyond  doubt  the  recent  slowdown  in  the  housing  market,""  Peter  Williams,  CML  deputy  director,  said." 

0	"Giving  financial  gifts  to  children  |||    Your  child  or  grandchild  may  want  the  latest  toy  this  Christmas,  but  how  about  giving  them  a  present  that  will  help  their  financial  future?  |||    Gifts  of  the  financial  variety  might  have  a  longer  lasting  impact.  It  may  encourage  children  to  save  or  start  a  fund  which  could  count  towards  university  costs,  for  example.  |||    The  government  is  trying  to  encourage  saving  at  an  early  age,  through  its  new  Child  Trust  Fund.  The  first  vouchers,  worth  £250  or  £500  for  low-income  families,  will  be  distributed  from  January.  All  children  born  after  1st  September  2002  will  be  eligible.  Parents  will  need  to  decide  which  financial  institution  will  manage  this  gift  in  time  for  the  start  of  the  scheme  in  April  2005.  |||    Parents  and  relatives  will  be  able  to  top  up  the  fund  with  up  to  £1,200  a  year,  which  will  grow  free  of  income  and  capital  gains  tax.  As  the  Child  Trust  Fund  will  not  be  in  force  in  time  for  Christmas,  relatives  could  invest  their  gifts  in  a  higher  rate  children's  deposit  account,  and  use  this  as  a  feeder  fund.  |||    There  are  accounts  designed  to  start  children  off  in  the  savings  habit  and  they  often  pay  a  higher  rate  of  interest.  Some  of  the  best  instant-access  accounts  currently  available  include  the  Ladybird  account  from  the  Saffron  Walden  Building  Society,  paying  5.35%  for  a  minimum  balance  of  £1  and  the  Alliance  &  Leicester  FirstSaver  which  pays  5.25%,  also  starting  at  £1.  |||    Interest  earned  by  children  is  subject  to  income  tax.  However,  children,  like  adults,  have  a  personal  income  tax  allowance  (£4,745  for  the  current  tax  year).  |||    If  the  account  holds  money  gifted  by  friends  and  relatives  -  but  not  parents  -  any  interest  earned  from  the  savings  account  may  be  set  against  the  allowance.  As  long  as  the  total  amount  of  interest  falls  within  the  allowance,  then  no  tax  will  be  payable.  When  the  account  is  opened  a  form  ""R85"",  available  from  the  bank  or  building  society,  should  be  completed.  This  confirms  that  the  account  holder  is  a  non-taxpayer  and  allows  interest  to  be  received  without  the  deduction  of  income  tax.  |||    The  tax  rules  are  different  for  parents  who  save  on  behalf  of  a  child.  Only  £100  of  interest  (per  parent)  can  be  tax-free.  Where  interest  exceeds  this  level,  the  whole  of  the  interest  will  be  taxed  on  the  parent.  This  is  to  prevent  parents  from  holding  their  own  cash  savings  in  their  children's  names  and  taking  advantage  of  the  tax  allowances.  Where  both  parents  and  other  relatives  are  saving  on  behalf  of  a  child,  consideration  should  be  given  to  opening  separate  accounts  -  one  for  parents'  gifts  and  one  for  gifts  from  other  relatives.  Therefore,  it  may  be  preferable  for  parents  to  contribute  to  the  Child  Trust  Fund  which  is  tax  free,  with  any  gifts  from  relatives  that  take  the  total  above  the  annual  £1,200  limit  being  directed  to  a  deposit  account.  |||    Another  favourite  solution  is  Premium  Bonds.  With  the  promise  of  riches  far  greater  than  a  mere  deposit  account,  they  make  great  presents.  The  parent  or  guardian  will  be  responsible  for  the  Bonds  and  will  receive  notification  of  the  purchase.  Any  prizes  will  be  sent  to  the  parent  or  child's  guardian.  The  minimum  for  each  purchase  is  £100  and  Bonds  are  sold  in  multiples  of  £10.  |||    There  are  gift  opportunities  beyond  cash  accounts  and  these  should  not  be  ignored.  |||    Over  the  longer  term,  stock  market  funds  have  outperformed  other  types  of  investment,  although  in  the  shorter  term  they  can  be  volatile.  One  of  the  benefits  of  investing  for  children  is  that  investment  is  generally  for  the  longer  term  -  more  than  ten  years  -  which  helps  to  reduce  the  risks  associated  with  investing  in  shares.  One  way  to  spread  the  risk  is  to  invest  in  the  stock  market  through  a  unit  or  investment  trust.  These  are  pooled  investment  funds  which  give  access  to  a  wide  range  of  shares.  These  funds  may  be  actively  managed,  where  a  fund  manager  picks  individual  stocks  based  on  a  view  of  their  future  potential,  or  passive,  where  a  manager  invests  in  all  the  shares  that  comprise  a  stock  market  index,  for  example,  the  FTSE  100.  Exchange  Traded  Funds  offer  an  alternative  way  to  track  a  stock  market.  These  are  single  shares  that  give  the  return  of  an  underlying  index  (so  are  really  another  form  of  tracker).  The  difference  is  that  the  charges  are  quite  low.  The  only  drawback  with  all  financial  gifts  is  that  the  children  gain  an  absolute  right  to  the  money  at  age  18,  and  parents  will  have  no  control  over  how  it  is  spent.  For  larger  gifts  it  may  be  worthwhile  taking  professional  advice  on  the  establishment  of  a  suitable  trust  that  will  allow  ongoing  control  over  the  capital  and  income."

Paris-based  Euronext,  owner  of  Liffe  in  London,  has  also  said  it  is  interested  in  bidding  for  LSE.  Euronext  is  due  to  hold  talks  with  LSE  this  week  and  it  is  reported  to  be  ready  to  raise  £1.4bn  to  fund  a  bid.  Euronext  chief  Jean-Francois  Theodore  is  scheduled  to  meet  his  LSE  counterpart  Clara  Furse  on  Friday.  Deutsche  Boerse  chief  Werner  Seifert  is  meeting  Ms  Furse  on  Thursday,  in  the  third  meeting  between  the  two  exchanges  since  the  bid  approach  in  December.  |||    The  LSE  rejected  Deutsche  Boerse's  proposed  £1.3bn  offer  in  December,  saying  it  undervalued  the  business.  |||    But  it  agreed  to  leave  the  door  open  for  talks  to  find  out  whether  a  ""significantly-improved  proposal""  would  be  in  the  interests  of  LSE's  shareholders  and  customers.  In  the  meantime,  Euronext,  which  combines  the  Paris,  Amsterdam  and  Lisbon  stock  exchanges,  also  began  talks  with  the  LSE.  In  a  statement  on  Thursday,  Euronext  said  any  offer  was  likely  to  be  solely  in  cash,  but  added  that:  ""There  can  be  no  assurances  at  this  stage  that  any  offer  will  be  made.""  A  deal  with  either  bidder  would  create  the  biggest  stock  market  operator  in  Europe  and  the  second  biggest  in  the  world  after  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange.  |||    According  to  the  FT,  in  its  latest  meeting  Deutsche  Boerse  will  adopt  a  charm  offensive  to  woo  the  London  exchange.  The  newspaper  said  the  German  suitor  will  offer  to  manage  a  combined  cash  and  equities  market  out  of  London  and  let  Ms  Furse  take  the  helm.  Other  reports  this  week  said  the  Deutsche  Boerse  might  even  consider  selling  its  Luxembourg-based  Clearstream  unit  -  the  clearing  house  that  processes  securities  transactions.  Its  ownership  of  Clearstream  was  seen  as  the  main  stumbling  block  to  a  London-Frankfurt  merger.  LSE  shareholders  feared  a  Deutsche  Boerse  takeover  would  force  them  to  use  Clearstream,  making  it  difficult  for  them  to  negotiate  for  lower  transaction  fees." 

2	"Lords  wrong  on  detainees  -  Straw  |||    Jack  Straw  has  attacked  the  decision  by  Britain's  highest  court  that  detaining  foreign  terrorist  suspects  without  trial  breaks  human  rights  laws.  |||    The  foreign  secretary  said  the  right  to  life  was  the  ""most  important  liberty""  and  the  government  had  a  duty  to  protect  people  from  terrorism.  Law  lords  were  ""simply  wrong""  to  imply  the  men  were  being  held  arbitrarily.  New  Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  vowed  the  nine  men  would  remain  in  prison  while  the  law  was  being  reviewed.  |||    The  House  of  Lords  ruled  by  an  eight  to  one  majority  in  favour  of  appeals  by  the  men  -  dealing  a  major  blow  to  the  government's  anti-terror  policy.  |||    But  Mr  Straw  denied  it  amounted  to  a  ""constitutional  crisis"".  He  said  those  held  had  a  right  of  appeal  to  the  special  immigration  appeal  tribunal  and  the  decision  to  hold  the  suspects  was  upheld  by  that  court.  ""The  law  lords  are  simply  wrong  to  imply  that  this  is  a  decision  to  detain  these  people  on  the  whim  or  the  certificate  of  the  home  secretary,""  he  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme.  The  foreign  secretary  insisted  it  was  for  Parliament,  and  not  judges,  to  decide  how  best  Britain  could  be  defended  against  the  threat  of  terrorism.  But  Liberal  Democrat  peer  Lord  Carlile,  the  government's  independent  reviewer  of  anti-terrorism  laws,  said  it  was  possible  some  of  the  detainees  could  now  be  released.  He  said  the  Law  Lords'  ruling  was  an  ""embarrassment""  for  the  government  and  major  changes  were  needed  to  the  law.  |||    The  ruling  came  on  Charles  Clarke's  first  day  as  home  secretary  following  David  Blunkett's  resignation.  In  a  statement  to  MPs,  Mr  Clarke  said:  ""I  will  be  asking  Parliament  to  renew  this  legislation  in  the  New  Year.  |||    ""In  the  meantime,  we  will  be  studying  the  judgment  carefully  to  see  whether  it  is  possible  to  modify  our  legislation  to  address  the  concerns  raised  by  the  House  of  Lords.""  The  detainees  took  their  case  to  the  House  of  Lords  after  the  Court  of  Appeal  backed  the  Home  Office's  powers  to  hold  them  without  limit  or  charge.  The  government  opted  out  of  part  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  concerning  the  right  to  a  fair  trial  in  order  to  bring  in  anti-terrorism  legislation  in  response  to  the  11  September  attacks  in  the  US.  Any  foreign  national  suspected  of  links  with  terrorism  can  be  detained  or  can  opt  to  be  deported.  But  those  detained  cannot  be  deported  if  this  would  mean  persecution  in  their  homeland.  On  Thursday,  Lord  Bingham  -  a  senior  law  lord  -  said  the  rules  were  incompatible  with  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  as  they  allowed  detentions  ""in  a  way  that  discriminates  on  the  ground  of  nationality  or  immigration  status""  by  justifying  detention  without  trial  for  foreign  suspects,  but  not  Britons.  Lord  Nicholls  of  Birkenhead,  in  his  ruling,  said:  ""Indefinite  imprisonment  without  charge  or  trial  is  anathema  in  any  country  which  observes  the  rule  of  law.  |||    In  a  statement,  detainee  'A'  in  Woodhill  Prison  said:  ""I  hope  now  that  the  government  will  act  upon  this  decision,  scrap  this  illegal  'law'  and  release  me  and  the  other  internees  to  return  to  our  families  and  loved  ones.""  The  case  was  heard  by  a  panel  of  nine  law  lords  rather  than  the  usual  five  because  of  the  constitutional  importance  of  the  case.  Solicitor  Gareth  Pierce,  who  represents  eight  of  the  detainees,  claimed  the  detention  had  driven  four  of  the  detainees  to  ""madness"",  saying  two  were  being  held  in  Broadmoor  hospital." 

2	"Vouchers  'to  cut  winter  deaths'  |||    Pensioners  are  being  promised  energy  savings  by  the  Liberal  Democrats,  as  snow  and  cold  temperatures  continue.  |||    The  party  says  the  plans  could  save  the  average  pensioner  £100  every  year  and  cut  winter  deaths.  The  government  gives  £200  for  winter  fuel  to  households  with  people  over  60,  or  £300  where  people  are  over  80.  The  Tories  promise  to  keep  the  payments.  The  Lib  Dems  would  allow  people  to  swap  these  winter  fuel  payments  for  discounts  on  home  insulation.  Shadow  local  government  secretary  Ed  Davey  said:  ""The  current  scheme  has  helped  some  older  people,  but  this  new  Liberal  Democrat  approach  will  go  much  further  to  end  the  scandal  of  tens  of  thousands  of  old  people  dying  from  the  winter  cold  every  year.""  The  vouchers  are  designed  to  let  pensioners  choose  from  a  list  of  approved  energy  supplies  who  would  compete  for  business  by  offering  discounts  on  home  insulation  schemes.  The  plan  would  boost  energy  conservation,  says  the  party  -  and  insulation  could  save  £100  every  year  for  pensioner  households,  so  using  the  money  more  ""intelligently""  than  at  present." 

1	"Arnold  congratulated  on  Oscar  win  |||    Oscar-winner  Andrea  Arnold  has  been  congratulated  by  the  UK  Film  Council,  the  organisation  which  partly  funded  her  project.  |||    Arnold's  film  Wasp  won  the  best  live  action  short  film  award  on  Sunday.  ""The  UK  Film  Council  spends  millions  of  pounds  of  lottery  investment  on  short  filmmaking  in  Britain  every  year,""  said  chief  executive  officer  John  Woodward.  ""It  certainly  pays  off  when  you  see  new  film-makers  winning  such  prestigious  awards,""  he  added.  |||    Wasp,  which  was  commissioned  by  the  Film  Council  and  Channel  4,  beat  films  by  fellow  UK  nominees  Gary  McKendry  and  Ashvin  Kumar  to  the  prize.  It  stars  actress  Nathalie  Press,  who  appeared  in  the  Bafta-winning  drama  My  Summer  Of  Love,  as  a  single  mother  who  is  forced  to  take  drastic  action  when  she  is  invited  on  a  date  and  is  unable  to  find  a  babysitter  to  look  after  her  four  daughters.  The  film  has  already  won  over  30  other  international  awards  including  the  Sundance  Short  Film  Prize.  Arnold,  from  Dartford  in  Kent,  described  her  victory  as  ""truly  overwhelming.  I'm  really  not  used  to  this  kind  of  thing,""  she  said,  after  receiving  her  Oscar  from  actor  Jeremy  Irons.  ""Thanks  to  everyone  who  worked  on  this  -  the  beers  are  on  me  when  we  get  home.""  The  director  was  one  of  only  two  British  winners  on  the  night,  the  other  being  Sandy  Powell,  who  won  the  costume  design  Oscar  for  her  work  on  The  Aviator." 

2	"Blunkett  row  should  end  -  Blair  |||    Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  said  it  was  time  to  draw  a  line  under  the  controversy  surrounding  David  Blunkett.  |||    The  Tories  and  the  Lib  Dems  have  called  for  a  second  inquiry  into  the  fast-tracking  of  a  visa  application  for  Mr  Blunkett's  ex-lover's  nanny.  Sir  Alan  Budd  found  a  ""chain  of  events""  linked  Mr  Blunkett  to  Leoncia  Casalme's  indefinite  leave  to  remain  application.  At  the  end  of  his  Middle  East  trip,  Mr  Blair  said  he  still  admired  Mr  Blunkett  and  thought  his  integrity  was  intact.  |||    On  Tuesday  Sir  Alan  said  the  application  for  leave  to  remain  in  the  UK  made  by  Kimberly  Quinn's  nanny  was  processed  in  52  days,  120  days  faster  than  the  average.  But  he  could  not  find  evidence  to  show  whether  Mr  Blunkett's  intervention  was  intended  to  give  special  help  for  his  then  lover's  nanny  -  or  if  he  was  raising  the  case  as  an  example  of  poor  departmental  performance.  In  his  first  comments  since  Sir  Alan's  announcement,  Mr  Blair  told  BBC  News  he  had  not  yet  read  the  report  in  detail.  But  told  BBC  News:  ""As  far  as  I'm  concerned,  we  have  drawn  a  line  under  that.""  |||    Asked  if  Mr  Blunkett  could  return  to  frontline  politics  at  some  point,  he  replied:  ""I  have  made  my  admiration  for  David  very  clear  and  it  remains.  ""He's  been  a  tremendous  colleague,  he's  done  a  great  job  for  us,  first  as  home  secretary  then  as  education  secretary.  The  future  is  something  we  will  have  to  approach  in  the  future.""  The  prime  minister  shrugged  off  claims  from  Conservative  leader  Michael  Howard  that  he  led  a  ""grubby  government"".  He  said  Mr  Blunkett's  integrity  remained  intact:  ""He  was  the  person  first  of  all  who  asked  for  this  inquiry  to  be  set  up.  He  accepted  that  what  he  originally  thought  had  happened  had  not  happened,  he  said.  ""But  I  think  Sir  Alan  Budd  also  accepted  there  wasn't  some  conspiracy  or  cover-up  and  I  just  think  a  line  should  be  drawn  under  now  and  we  should  move  on.""  |||    Earlier,  Mr  Howard  said:  ""There  does  need  to  be  another  inquiry,  a  judge-led  inquiry.  There  were  so  many  questions  that  weren't  answered.""  There  was  ""deceit  at  the  heart  of  government""  which  was  not  limited  to  the  visa  affair,  he  argued.  Lib  Dem  home  affairs  spokesman  Mark  Oaten  also  said  there  was  ""a  strong  case  for  a  judge-led  judicial  review"".  |||    He  said:  ""Next  time  it  happens  it  may  not  be  about  a  nanny  and  their  visa.  It  may  be  about  something  even  more  important  than  that.""  Mr  Blunkett  quit  as  home  secretary  last  week  after  being  told  in  advance  of  Sir  Alan's  findings.  In  a  statement,  the  ex-home  secretary  said  he  accepted  the  inquiry's  findings.  He  said  he  had  told  the  truth  throughout  and  had  raised  the  nanny  case  as  an  example  of  unacceptable  backlogs  in  the  system." 

3	"Spain  coach  faces  racism  inquiry  |||    Spain's  Football  Federation  has  initiated  disciplinary  action  against  national  coach  Luis  Aragones  over  racist  comments  about  Thierry  Henry.  |||    If  found  guilty  Aragones  could  lose  his  job  or  face  a  fine  of  about  £22,000.  The  federation  had  initially  declined  to  take  action  against  Aragones  after  comments  he  made  during  a  national  team  training  session  in  October.  But  its  president  Angel  Maria  Villar  changed  his  mind  after  a  request  by  Spain's  anti-violence  commission.  Aragones  insisted  the  comments,  made  to  Henry's  Arsenal  club-mate  Jose  Antonio  Reyes,  were  meant  to  motivate  the  player,  and  were  not  intended  to  be  offensive.  |||    ""I  never  intended  to  offend  anyone,  and  for  that  reason  I  have  a  very  easy  conscience,""  he  said  at  the  time.  ""I'm  obliged  to  motivate  my  players  to  get  the  best  results.  ""As  part  of  that  job,  I  use  colloquial  language,  with  which  we  can  all  understand  each  other  within  the  framework  of  the  football  world.  ""  England's  players  made  a  point  of  wearing  anti-racism  t-shirts  when  training  before  their  friendly  against  Spain  in  Madrid  last  month.  |||    But  the  storm  increased  following  racist  chanting  by  Spanish  fans  at  England's  black  players  during  the  game,  which  Spain  won  1-0.  Spain's  minister  of  sport  Jaime  Lissavetzky  was  quick  to  give  his  backing  to  the  Federation's  decision.  ""Everyone  who  has  a  public  function  has  to  consider  their  declarations,  and  make  sure  they  do  not  give  a  negative  image,""  he  said.  ""We  are  going  to  have  zero  tolerance  in  questions  of  racism."""

Advisors  Goldman  Sachs  are  understood  to  have  valued  its  demerged  Deluxe  Film  unit  at  £300m,  the  report  added.  Speculation  of  a  possible  shake-up  has  mounted  since  Rank  announced  a  study  into  a  possible  demerger  in  September.  Since  Mike  Smith's  appointment  as  chief  executive  in  1999,  the  group  has  focused  on  fewer  businesses  and  embarked  on  a  major  cost-cutting  programme  which  has  seen  it  dispose  of  a  number  of  businesses,  including  the  Odeon  cinema  chain  and  the  Pinewood  studios.  The  move  left  the  group  with  three  core  divisions:  gaming,  Hard  Rock  and  Deluxe  Films,  which  provides  technical  services  to  Hollywood  studios.  |||    Rank  now  aims  to  concentrate  on  its  gaming,  bars  and  hotels  business,  including  extending  its  Hard  Rock  brand  to  its  casinos  -  trials  of  which  have  been  a  success.  It  also  owns  Deluxe  Media,  which  makes  and  distributes  DVDs  and  videos.  However,  that  business  is  seen  as  less  successful.  Last  year  it  made  profits  of  £21.5m  on  a  turnover  of  £392.1m  and  experts  suggest  its  success  in  moving  to  DVDs  from  VHS  video  could  make  it  an  attractive  target  for  a  private  equity  buyer.  A  spokesman  for  the  firm  refused  to  comment  on  the  reports,  but  said  any  results  from  the  demerger  study  were  likely  to  be  set  out  when  it  unveiled  its  results  on  Friday.  Analysts  predict  the  firm  is  likely  to  report  a  slight  drop  in  annual  pre-tax  profits  to  £170m  from  £194m  last  year.  Formed  in  the  1940s  the  firm  was  a  leading  UK  film  producer  and  cinema  owner  for  many  years.  It  has  now  diversified  into  a  range  of  other  leisure  activities  -  mainly  in  the  UK  -  including  hotels,  roadside  service  areas  and  holiday  centres.  It  now  owns  34  Grosvenor  casinos,  the  Mecca  Bingo  chain  and  more  than  100  Hard  Rock  Cafes  in  38  countries." 

1	"Director  Nair's  Vanity  project  |||    Indian  film  director  Mira  Nair  has  said  she  was  thrilled  to  be  given  the  chance  to  make  William  Makepeace  Thackeray's  novel  Vanity  Fair  -  as  the  book  has  been  a  favourite  through  her  life.  |||    The  book  is  one  of  the  classics  of  English  literature  -  the  story  of  scheming  19th  Century  social  climber  Becky  Sharp,  played  in  the  film  by  Reese  Witherspoon.  Nair  said  that  she  jumped  at  the  chance  to  work  on  the  film,  which  she  has  -  controversially  -  made  in  a  Bollywood  style,  including  two  song-and-dance  routines  in  the  film's  second  half.  ""It  was  serendipity  really  -  I  was  offered  Vanity  Fair  by  the  studio  Focus  Features,  who  had  distributed  Monsoon  Wedding,""  Nair  told  BBC  World  Service's  Masterpiece  programme.  ""They  offered  me  their  next-best  thing,  not  realising  that  Vanity  Fair  had  actually  been  one  of  my  favourite  novels  since  I  was  16  years  old  in  an  Irish  Catholic  boarding  school  in  India.""  |||    Since  her  1988  debut  feature  Salaam  Bombay!  -  nominated  for  the  Best  Foreign  Language  Oscar  and  winner  of  Best  First  Feature  at  Cannes  -  Nair  has  become  one  of  India's  most  famous  and  respected  directors.  She  is  not  restricted  to  Bollywood,  however  -  she  followed  Salaam  Bombay!  with  Mississippi  Masala,  starring  Denzel  Washington,  and  The  Perez  Family,  her  first  Hollywood  film.  |||    Her  career  peaked  with  Monsoon  Wedding  in  2001,  which  won  the  Golden  Lion  award  at  Venice.  Nair's  Indian-style  adaptation  of  Vanity  Fair,  however,  has  been  attacked  by  critics  in  the  US  -  where  it  only  reached  number  eight  at  the  box  office  in  its  opening  week  -  who  described  the  Bollywood  elements  as  ""jarring.""  The  film  has  a  new  ending,  with  Becky  Sharp  running  off  for  a  new  life  in  India.  But  Nair  said  that  her  film  had  picked  up  on  the  way  Thackeray  -  who  was  born  in  India  but  moved  to  England  as  a  young  man  -  had  seen  the  world.  ""First,  when  I  was  16,  it  was  Becky  Sharp,  who  is  a  completely  memorable  character,  because  I  recognised  myself  in  her  -  I  recognised  all  the  ladies  who  did  not  want  to  be  ladies,  who  wanted  to  buck  the  system  that  they  were  in,""  she  said.  ""But  it  was  the  sort  of  novel  I  somehow  kept  at  the  side  of  my  bed  for  many  years,  and  I  would  dip  into  every  now  and  then  and  suddenly  get  completely  mesmerised  again.  ""As  I  got  older  and  read  it,  I  think  it  was  Thackeray's  clarity  -  his  clear-sightedness  about  his  own  society,  the  fact  that  he  was  born  in  India  but  came  to  England  as  a  young  man  -  that  gave  him  the  eyes  of  an  outsider,  and  yet  he  was  an  insider.  ""That  perspective  was  something  I  really  loved.""  |||    Nair  also  defended  her  decision  to  cast  an  American  actress  -  Reese  Witherspoon  -  as  Becky  Sharp,  despite  the  fact  that  all  the  rest  of  the  cast  are  British  or  Irish.  ""I  cast  intuitively  -  in  my  films  I  cast  as  many  non-actors  as  I  cast  actors,""  she  said.  ""For  me,  it  is  intuition  -  I  have  to  fall  in  love  with  an  actor.  It  is  a  visceral  response.  |||    ""Thackeray  describes  Becky  Sharp  as  a  minx.  Also  she's  described  as  someone  who's  tiny,  red-headed  and  thin.  Reese  had  that  completely  minx-like  irresistibility  about  her.""  Having  won  the  role  because  she  seemed  physically  perfectly  suited  to  the  part,  however,  Witherspoon  then  became  pregnant.  But  Nair  said  that,  though  this  had  created  the  need  for  some  filming  tricks,  it  had  in  fact  also  helped  the  film.  ""It  was  a  self-fulfilling  prophesy  -  when  I  first  met  her  husband  [actor  Ryan  Philippe],  I  said  'knock  her  up,  won't  you,  I  need  some  flesh  on  the  girl',""  she  joked.  ""I'm  not  a  fan  of  the  underfed  Los  Angeles  actor  at  all.  This  was,  for  me,  about  Becky  Sharp  being,  eventually,  a  full-blown  woman  through  the  course  of  the  film.  ""I  love  the  luminosity  that  pregnancy  brings,  I  love  the  fleshiness,  I  love  the  ample  bosom  -  it  gave  me  much  more  to  play  with.""  Nair  explained  how  camera  tricks  had  been  used  to  disguise  Witherspoon's  ""bump""  in  various  scenes  -  including  hiring  a  number  of  young  boys  in  costumes  to  stand  in  front  of  her.  ""She  runs,  she  gets  off  coal  carts,  she  jumps  off  horses  -  she  does  everything,""  Nair  said.  ""But  there's  also  a  certain  carriage  with  horses  that  is  going  to  wipe  the  screen  at  a  certain  moment,  because  of  the  bump.""" 

2	"Labour  targets  'hardcore  truants'  |||    A  fresh  crackdown  on  persistent  truants  in  England  has  been  launched  by  Education  Secretary  Ruth  Kelly.  |||    Serial  truants  make  up  one  in  13  pupils.  Previous  initiatives  brought  40,000  pupils  back  to  school  since  1997,  according  to  official  statistics.  Parenting  contracts,  penalty  notices  and  ""fast  track""  prosecution  systems  have  been  used  to  tackle  what  has  been  a  stubborn  problem.  It  is  thought  that  nearly  half  a  million  children  skip  school  each  day.  Tories  say  Labour's  previous  success  regarding  the  issue  came  because  it  tackled  the  easy  part  of  the  problem  by  reducing  authorised  absence,  where  parents  are  permitted  to  take  children  out  of  school.  Such  absences  are  often  due  to  family  holidays.  |||    However,  serial  truants  avoid  the  classroom  despite  government  schemes  costing  £885m.  Those  missing  classes  are  more  likely  to  become  involved  in  crime  as  well  as  failing  academically.  Measures  such  as  parenting  contracts  and  penalty  notices  were  adopted  by  most  local  education  authorities  last  term  and  come  into  force  in  the  remainder  this  term.  In  one  local  education  authority  alone  800  parents  were  warned  they  would  receive  a  penalty  notice  unless  their  child's  attendance  improved.  The  tough  stance  paid  off  with  just  24  issued,  while  attendance  improved  in  776  cases.  Truancy  has  been  reduced  by  5%  at  the  128  worst  hit  schools  through  the  government's  Behaviour  Improvement  Programme.  This  is  the  equivalent  of  200  pupils  back  in  classes  since  September.  |||    The  new  measures  come  on  top  of  national  truancy  sweeps  -  the  sixth  of  which  will  take  place  on  Monday.  Police  and  education  welfare  officers  patrol  problem  hotspots  picking  up  truants  and  returning  them  to  school.  Held  twice  each  year,  in  addition  to  routine  local  patrols,  previous  country-wide  sweeps  have  apprehended  31,000  pupils  dodging  school.  In  almost  14,000  of  those  cases,  the  youngsters  were  accompanied  by  their  parents.  A  Department  for  Education  and  Skills  source  said:  ""Every  day  in  school  counts.  ""It  is  clear  form  these  figures  that  schools  and  local  education  authorities  are  now  seizing  the  tools  we  have  given  them  to  improve  school  attendance  and  crack  down  hard  on  the  very  small  numbers  of  pupils  which  account  for  almost  half  of  the  nation's  truancy.""" 

2	"Council  tax  rise  'reasonable'  |||    Welsh  councils  should  set  their  taxes  at  ""reasonable  levels""  after  being  given  an  average  funding  increase  of  6%,  says  the  assembly  government.  |||    Finance  Minister  Sue  Essex  said  it  was  a  ""good  deal""  for  local  government.  The  £3.2bn  settlement  includes  the  ""full""  £7.4m  from  the  UK  Treasury  announced  by  Chancellor  Gordon  Brown.  But  opposition  parties  said  rebanding  of  council  taxes  would  mean  steep  rises.  In  addition,  £13.4m  will  come  from  the  business  support  grant  -  a  scheme  which  enables  local  authorities  to  keep  part  of  business  rates.  She  said  where  spending  rises  were  kept  to  around  5%  she  was  ""confident  that  councils  will  be  able  to  set  council  taxes  at  reasonable  levels.""  The  Welsh  Local  Government  Association  (WLGA)  had  said  on  the  eve  of  the  announcement  said  that  ""significant""  cuts  to  services  may  still  be  unavoidable.  After  the  announcement  WLGA  finance  spokesman  Bob  Wellington,  of  Torfaen,  said  it  was  vital  that  rises  were  minimsed.  ""A  limited  amount  of  money  has  come  available  but  this  is  not  the  answer  to  our  problems,""  said  Mr  Wellington.  ""It  is  vital  that  we  start  now  to  plan  for  future  years  and  accept  that  resources  will  continue  to  reduce  while  pressures  on  services  increase.""  On  Monday,  a  delegation  of  north  Wales  councils  visited  Ms  Essex  to  lobby  for  increased  funds.  Ms  Essex  said:  ""I  have  listened  to  the  views  of  local  government  and  council  tax  payers  and  recognise  the  funding  pressures  and  the  concerns  they  have  about  council  tax  rises.  ""I  have  met  a  large  number  of  local  authorities  in  recent  weeks  and  I  am  aware  of  the  pressures  on  them  to  provide  local  services  and  keep  down  the  level  of  council  tax,  particularly  for  those  people  to  are  moving  up  a  band  due  to  the  revaluation  of  domestic  properties.""  She  said  council  taxes  could  be  kept  at  reasonable  levels,  ""even  for  those  people  who  have  moved  up  a  band"".  |||    The  settlement  includes  a  rise  in  the  grant  to  help  councils  with  the  most  deprived  communities  and  a  16.4%  rise  in  capital  expenditure  support.  Ms  Essex  said:  ""This  is  a  good  deal  for  local  government,  which  will  allow  the  well-managed  councils  of  Wales  to  develop  their  services  and  charge  reasonable  levels  of  council  tax.  It  is  now  a  matter  for  council  leaders  to  manage  their  budgets  at  a  local  level.""  Plaid  Cymru's  local  government  spokesman  Dai  Lloyd  called  the  announcement  ""hugely  disappointing"".  He  said:  ""Wales  and  its  local  authorities  have  been  short  changed  yet  again.  This  is  not  whinging  as  the  Labour  Assembly  Government  so  often  claims  -  it  is  anger.""  ""This  will  mean  either  a  massive  hike  in  council  tax,  massive  cuts  in  services  provided  by  councils,  or  both.""  Mike  German,  leader  of  the  Liberal  Democrats  in  the  assembly,  claimed  that  one  in  three  homes  were  still  likely  to  face  council  tax  rises  due  to  rebanding.  Mr  German  said:  ""I  know  from  my  discussions  with  Welsh  Liberal  Democrat  council  leaders  that  they  are  doing  their  utmost  to  keep  council  tax  to  a  minimum.  But  the  random  redistribution  effect  of  rebanding...will  create  a  great  deal  of  difficulty.""  Conservative  local  government  spokesman  Glyn  Davies  said  that  for  the  minister  to  claim  that  the  majority  of  council  tax  payers  in  Wales  should  see  very  little  change  ""is  taking  spin  to  the  very  verge  of  deception"".  He  added:  ""Around  a  third  of  Welsh  households  have  been  re-valued  upwards  by  at  least  one  band  and  inevitably  face  increases  into  double  figures.""" 

2	"Tories  urge  'change  at  the  top'  |||    Tory  delegates  are  gathering  for  what  is  expected  to  be  their  last  conference  before  the  general  election,  declaring  Britain  needs  ""a  change  at  the  top"".  |||    The  party  goes  into  its  spring  forum  trying  to  highlight  what  it  sees  as  a  clear  choice  between  it  and  Labour.  Tory  co-chairman  Liam  Fox  has  opened  proceedings  with  a  speech  criticising  Tony  Blair's  record  in  government.  Labour's  rule  has  been  characterised  by  ""lost  trust  and  failure  to  deliver"",  he  told  the  Brighton  conference.  He  also  attacked  the  government's  ""failure""  to  control  immigration  and  asylum  and  criticised  its  record  on  the  NHS,  telling  delegates  Labour  cannot  be  trusted  on  education  or  crime.  A  Tory  government  would  sort  out  the  ""shambles""  of  immigration,  put  patients  before  statistics  and  bring  discipline  to  schools,  he  said.  Dr  Fox  also  underlined  Tory  promises  to  cut  tax  by  £4bn.  |||    BBC  political  correspondent  Shaun  Ley  says  opinion  polls  suggest  the  Tories  still  lag  some  way  behind  Labour  on  the  issues  of  health,  education  and  the  economy.  Conservative  leader  Michael  Howard,  who  had  been  due  to  welcome  delegates  to  the  conference  on  Friday,  will  address  them  in  a  lunchtime  speech.  His  welcome  address  had  to  be  postponed  after  he  stayed  in  London  to  lead  the  party's  opposition  to  the  Prevention  of  Terrorism  Bill  in  its  lengthy  progress  through  Parliament.  The  bill  was  finally  passed  on  Friday  evening,  after  more  than  30  hours  of  debate.  Mr  Howard  is  likely  to  defend  his  party's  handling  of  the  bill,  which  was  only  passed  after  the  Conservatives  accepted  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair's  promise  that  MPs  would  be  able  to  review  it  within  a  year." 

2	"Probe  launched  on  Ken  Nazi  jibe  |||    An  investigation  by  the  Standards  Board  is  under  way  following  allegations  that  Ken  Livingstone  has  brought  his  office  into  disrepute.  |||    The  probe  follows  the  London  mayor's  comments  to  a  Jewish  journalist  comparing  him  to  a  concentration  camp  guard,  after  a  party  about  a  week  ago.  The  local  government  watchdog  also  said  the  allegation  related  to  a  failure  to  respect  others.  It  has  the  power  to  suspend  or  bar  Labour's  Mr  Livingstone  from  office.  A  complaint  was  made  to  the  body  by  the  Board  of  Deputies  of  British  Jews  and  the  Commission  for  Racial  Equality.  |||    Speaking  after  the  investigation  was  announced  Bob  Neill,  leader  of  the  London  Assembly  Conservatives,  said:  ""He  has  behaved  in  a  manner  unbecoming  of  his  office  and  in  so  doing,  has  shown  extraordinarily  poor  civic  leadership.  ""His  administration  is  now  in  crisis.""  On  Sunday,  Deputy  Mayor  Nicky  Gavron  told  the  BBC's  Politics  Show  she  believed  the  Mayor  of  London  would  say  sorry  on  Tuesday  for  offending  the  wider  Jewish  community.  The  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  is  among  those  who  have  called  for  an  apology  but  so  far  the  mayor  has  refused.  |||    The  mayor  accused  Oliver  Finegold,  of  the  Evening  Standard  newspaper,  of  ""doorstepping""  him  at  a  ""predominately  gay  event""  held  for  MP  Chris  Smith.  Ms  Gavron  said  she  thought  Mr  Livingstone's  comments  were  ""inappropriate""  but  she  did  not  believe  the  mayor  was  anti-Semitic.  She  said:  ""I  work  very  closely  with  Ken  so  I  can  speak  of  what  he's  like  in  his  guarded  and  unguarded  moments  and...  he  is  in  no  way  anti-Jewish,  I  wouldn't  for  a  moment  work  with  him  if  he  were.  ""On  the  other  hand,  I  think  his  remarks  were  inappropriate  and  I  believe  it  is  important,  and  I  believe  he  will,  come  to  the  point  where  he  says,  'I  regret  that  I  have  caused  offence  to  the  wider  Jewish  community'.  ""I  hope  he  will  do  it  soon  and  it  is  mooted  that  he  is  going  to  make  some  sort  of  statement  on  Tuesday.""" 

0	"India  and  Russia  in  energy  talks  |||    India  and  Russia  are  to  work  together  in  a  series  of  energy  deals,  part  of  a  pact  which  could  see  India  invest  up  to  $20bn  in  oil  and  gas  projects.  |||    On  the  agenda  are  oil  and  gas  extraction  as  well  as  transportation  deals,  to  be  led  by  Russian  energy  giant  Gazprom  and  India's  ONGC.  The  Indian  firm  is  also  expected  to  hold  talks  on  Tuesday  about  buying  a  stake  in  assets  once  owned  by  Yukos.  It  is  reported  to  be  keen  on  buying  a  15%  stake  in  oil  unit  Yuganskneftegas.  The  former  Yukos  subsidiary  was  controversially  sold  off  last  year  and  eventually  acquired  by  state-owned  energy  giant  Rosneft.  |||    Russian  media  reported  that  India  and  Russia  signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding  on  energy  co-operation  on  Tuesday  during  a  meeting  between  Oil  and  Natural  Gas  Corporation  chairman  Subir  Raha,  Gazprom  chairman  Aleksey  Miller  and  India's  petroleum  minister  Mani  Shankar  Aiyar.  |||    The  agreement  is  likely  to  see  the  two  companies  develop  refining  facilities  in  Russia,  India  and  elsewhere  and  organise  delivery  of  oil,  gas  and  petrochemicals  from  Russia  to  India  and  other  countries  across  Asia.  ONGC  could  invest  in  gas  and  oil  fields  in  Sakhalin,  in  the  far  east  of  Russia,  and  may  also  take  part  in  joint  tender  bids  for  projects  in  eastern  Siberia  and  the  Caspian  Sea.  |||    India  is  urgently  searching  for  fresh  energy  supplies  -  particularly  liquefied  natural  gas  -  as  domestic  demand  is  growing  at  more  than  5%  a  year.  |||    ONGC's  Mr  Raha  said  the  two  could  work  together  on  joint  bids  from  next  year.  ""At  current  oil  and  gas  prices,  our  cash  flow  situation  is  good,""  he  told  Reuters.  ""What  we  are  saying  is  -  Gazprom  has  a  huge  amount  of  gas  and  we  have  the  money.  ""The  investment  may  go  up  to  $20bn  or  more  for  a  period  of  five  years  or  so.""  |||    Russian  news  agencies  reported  that  India's  petroleum  minister  Mr  Aiyar  and  Russian  energy  minister  Viktor  Khristenko  would  discuss  the  future  of  Yugansk  at  a  meeting  on  Tuesday.  ONGC's  Mr  Raha  declined  to  be  drawn  on  his  firm's  reported  interest  in  the  company.  However,  he  stressed  that  ONGC  was  not  interested  in  a  'loan-for-oil  deal'  in  connection  to  Yugansk,  similar  to  that  concluded  recently  between  Rosneft  and  China's  National  Petroleum  Corporation.  ""China's  problem  is  it  has  immediate  demand  and  they  needed  the  oil  for  their  coastal  refineries.  We  do  not.  We  would  like  long-term  security  through  equity  participation.""  It  is  thought  that  any  decision  over  Yugansk  will  be  delayed  until  a  US  court  has  decided  whether  to  grant  Yukos  bankruptcy  protection.  Yukos  is  suing  a  host  of  companies  involved  in  the  sale  of  Yugansk,  auctioned  off  to  pay  a  huge  back-tax  bill.  It  has  also  threatened  legal  action  against  any  business  which  has  future  commercial  dealings  with  its  former  subsidiary."

0	"Newest  EU  members  underpin  growth  |||    The  European  Union's  newest  members  will  bolster  Europe's  economic  growth  in  2005,  according  to  a  new  report.  |||    The  eight  central  European  states  which  joined  the  EU  last  year  will  see  4.6%  growth,  the  United  Nations  Economic  Commission  for  Europe  (UNECE)  said.  In  contrast,  the  12  Euro  zone  countries  will  put  in  a  ""lacklustre""  performance,  generating  growth  of  only  1.8%.  The  global  economy  will  slow  in  2005,  the  UNECE  forecasts,  due  to  widespread  weakness  in  consumer  demand.  |||    It  warned  that  growth  could  also  be  threatened  by  attempts  to  reduce  the  United  States'  huge  current  account  deficit  which,  in  turn,  might  lead  to  significant  volatility  in  exchange  rates.  |||    UNECE  is  forecasting  average  economic  growth  of  2.2%  across  the  European  Union  in  2005.  However,  total  output  across  the  Euro  zone  is  forecast  to  fall  in  2004  from  1.9%  to  1.8%.  This  is  due  largely  to  the  faltering  German  economy,  which  shrank  0.2%  in  the  last  quarter  of  2004.  On  Monday,  Germany's  BdB  private  banks  association  said  the  German  economy  would  struggle  to  meet  its  1.4%  growth  target  in  2005.  |||    Separately,  the  Bundesbank  warned  that  Germany's  efforts  to  reduce  its  budget  deficit  below  3%  of  GDP  presented  ""huge  risks""  given  that  headline  economic  growth  was  set  to  fall  below  1%  this  year.  Publishing  its  2005  economic  survey,  the  UNECE  said  central  European  countries  such  as  the  Czech  Republic  and  Slovenia  would  provide  the  backbone  of  the  continent's  growth.  Smaller  nations  such  as  Cyprus,  Ireland  and  Malta  would  also  be  among  the  continent's  best  performing  economies  this  year,  it  said.  The  UK  economy,  on  the  other  hand,  is  expected  to  slow  in  2005,  with  growth  falling  from  3.2%  last  year  to  2.5%.  |||    Consumer  demand  will  remain  fragile  in  many  of  Europe's  largest  countries  and  economies  will  be  mostly  driven  by  growth  in  exports.  ""In  view  of  the  fragility  of  factors  of  domestic  growth  and  the  dampening  effects  of  the  stronger  euro  on  domestic  economic  activity  and  inflation,  monetary  policy  in  the  euro  area  is  likely  to  continue  to  'wait  and  see',  the  organisation  said  in  its  report.  Global  economic  growth  is  expected  to  fall  from  5%  in  2004  to  4.25%  despite  the  continued  strength  of  the  Chinese  and  US  economies.  The  UNECE  warned  that  attempts  to  bring  about  a  controlled  reduction  in  the  US  current  account  deficit  could  cause  difficulties.  ""The  orderly  reversal  of  the  deficit  is  a  major  challenge  for  policy  makers  in  both  the  United  States  and  other  economies,""  it  noted." 

2	"Donor  attacks  Blair-Brown  'feud'  |||    The  reported  feud  between  Tony  Blair  and  Gordon  Brown  has  prompted  a  Labour  donor  to  say  he  will  almost  certainly  refuse  to  give  more  funds.  |||    Duncan  Bannatyne  also  attacked  the  government  over  Iraq  and  its  ""poor""  response  to  the  Asian  tsunami  crisis.  His  broadside  came  as  ex-Foreign  Secretary  Robin  Cook  said  he  hoped  Mr  Brown  would  be  premier  at  some  point.  Mr  Bannatyne  has  previously  given  Labour  £50,000.  He  made  his  fortune  from  care  homes  and  health  clubs.  |||    The  52-year-old  on  Tuesday  said  was  he  was  reviewing  his  donations  because  of  Cabinet  disunity  and  international  issues.  His  spokesman  said  it  was  highly  unlikely  he  would  give  Labour  more  money,  although  he  would  remain  a  supporter  and  not  fund  the  Conservatives.  |||    Robert  Peston's  new  book  has  prompted  more  speculation  about  the  Blair-Brown  rift  with  its  claims  that  the  prime  minister  broke  a  promise  made  in  2003  to  stand  down.  Mr  Bannatyne  said:  ""Disunity  in  the  Cabinet  has  a  corrosive  effect  on  the  country.  ""Gordon  Brown  is  a  great  chancellor  who  has  delivered  a  stable  economy,  but  business  wants  that  to  continue  and  not  be  blown  off  course  by  petty  squabbles  based  on  personal  ambition.""  The  businessman,  whose  latest  venture  is  a  casino  in  Newcastle,  also  voiced  concern  about  the  ongoing  violence  in  Iraq.  |||    And  he  branded  the  UK  government's  response  to  the  tsunami  as  ""piecemeal  and  poor"".  ""The  people  there  need  practical  help  not  just  pledges  of  money,""  he  said.  ""The  US  has  forces  helping  on  the  ground  -  we  can  do  more.""  British  Navy  ships  have  helped  the  relief  effort  and  the  prime  minister  has  said  the  government  could  ultimately  give  hundreds  of  millions  of  pounds  in  aid.  Mr  Bannatyne  is  due  to  host  a  new  television  programme  and  is  also  appearing  on  BBC2  business  start-up  programme  Dragon's  Den.  But  his  spokesman  insisted  his  attack  on  Labour  was  not  a  publicity  stunt.  |||    In  a  separate  development,  Robin  Cook  gave  his  support  to  Mr  Brown's  prime  ministerial  ambitions  but  told  a  lunch  for  political  journalists  winning  the  election  had  to  be  Labour's  election.  But  he  insisted  the  recent  squabbles  between  Mr  Blair  and  Mr  Brown  were  not  ""perceived  as  a  problem  by  the  voters,""  adding  there  was  no  impression  of  governmental  incompetence.  Mr  Cook  argued  that  more  prominence  was  given  to  these  matters  because  there  was  ""not  an  alternative  source  of  opposition  to  the  government"".  He  warned  the  ""Abstentions  Party""  was  the  real  challenge  to  Labour  -  and  they  would  not  be  motivated  by  Mr  Blair's  promise  to  produce  an  ""unremittingly  New  Labour""  election  manifesto.  His  comments  come  after  Dave  Prentis,  the  leader  of  Britain's  biggest  union  Unison,  told  the  Daily  Record  newspaper  he  wants  a  date  to  be  set  for  Mr  Blair  to  be  replaced  as  Labour  leader." 

1	"Church  anger  over  Bollywood  film  |||    Roman  Catholic  organisations  in  India  have  demanded  the  withdrawal  of  a  film  that  depicts  a  priest  having  an  affair  with  a  girl  half  his  age.  |||    Indian  television  channels  are  now  refusing  to  run  the  promotional  material  for  the  film,  Sins,  ahead  of  its  release  on  Friday.  The  director  of  the  film,  Vinod  Pande,  says  the  movie  is  not  offensive  and  has  refused  to  withdraw  it.  Catholics  are  planning  a  protest  in  Mumbai  (Bombay)  on  Wednesday.  The  president  of  one  of  Mumbai's  main  Catholic  organisations,  Dolphy  D'Souza,  says  the  portrayal  of  an  ordained  priest  as  a  man  of  loose  moral  character  has  hurt  the  religious  sentiments  of  India's  Catholic  community.  |||    He  called  the  film  ""pornographic  and  sensational"".  Mr  D'Souza,  who  is  also  the  vice-president  of  the  Catholics'  national  body,  has  accused  the  director  of  the  film  of  portraying  a  priest  in  bad  light  for  commercial  gains.  Catholics  have  urged  Mr  Pande  to  withdraw  the  film  to  show  respect  to  the  Christian  community's  hurt  sentiments.  ""Religion  needs  to  be  a  personal  affair  and  should  not  be  a  subject  for  entertainment  or  for  commercial  use,""  Joseph  Dias,  general  secretary  of  the  Catholic  Secular  Forum,  said  in  a  statement.  |||    But  Mr  Pande  said  that  if  the  critics  were  to  see  the  film  they  would  not  protest  against  it  and  would  not  insist  on  its  withdrawal.  He  says  he  has  no  plans  to  cancel  the  film  ahead  of  its  scheduled  screening  on  Friday.  |||    ""It's  about  forbidden  love.  There  was  no  agenda  whatsoever  to  hurt  anyone,""  he  said.  The  BBC's  Zubair  Ahmed  in  Mumbai  says  that  the  controversial  film  shows  a  priest  in  steamy  scenes  with  a  girl  half  his  age.  She  apparently  goes  to  him  for  help  but  he  falls  in  love  with  her.  It  takes  place  in  the  picturesque  southern  Indian  state  of  Kerala.  The  film  has  already  been  cleared  by  the  Censor  Board  with  an  'A'  (adults  only)  certificate.  Mr  D'Souza  says  he  is  shocked  at  the  Censor  Board's  decision  to  clear  the  film.  Our  correspondent  says  that  India's  TV  channels  have  so  far  refused  to  be  dragged  into  the  controversy  and  have  not  screened  the  film's  promotional  material.  Most  of  the  Catholic  community's  anger  has  come  after  watching  newspaper  advertisements  and  hoardings  of  the  film.  Christians  make  up  about  two  per  cent  of  India's  population  of  more  than  a  billion  people."

Twenty  of  his  films  are  screening  in  a  special  retrospective  during  the  festival,  which  runs  until  20  February.  The  veteran  film-maker,  68,  won  the  best  director  prize  at  the  Cannes  Film  Festival  in  2002  for  Chihwaseon.  ""Although  his  films  vary  in  style,  they  all  bear  his  unmistakable  stamp:  they  are  forceful  and  charged  cinematographically,  as  well  as  reticent,  stylised  and  musical,""  organisers  said  in  a  statement.  Meanwhile,  a  film  version  of  Bizet's  opera  Carmen  -  translated  into  the  South  African  language  Xhosa  -  has  received  a  warm  reception  at  the  festival.  U-Carmen  eKhayelitsha  (Carmen  in  Khayelitsha),  which  is  one  of  21  films  up  for  Berlin's  top  prize,  the  Golden  Bear,  is  British  director  Mark  Dornford-May's  first  feature  film.  ""It's  the  first  time  any  opera  has  been  translated  into  a  black  South  African  language.  Xhosa  works  brilliantly,  it's  such  a  musical  language,""  said  music  director  Charles  Hazlewood."

It  aims  to  transport  750,000  daily  barrels  of  oil.  The  pipeline  will  be  built  by  the  US-registered  Albanian  Macedonian  Bulgarian  Oil  Corporation  (AMBO).  The  912km  pipeline  will  run  from  the  Bulgarian  port  of  Burgas,  over  the  Black  Sea  to  the  Albanian  city  of  Vlore  on  the  Adriatic  coast,  crossing  Macedonia.  |||    The  project  was  conceived  in  1994  but  it  was  delayed  because  of  the  lack  of  political  support.  By  signing  the  agreement  on  Tuesday,  the  prime  ministers  of  Bulgaria,  Albania  and  Macedonia  have  overcome  the  problem.  ""This  is  one  of  the  most  important  infrastructure  projects  for  regional,  EU,  and  Euro-Atlantic  integration  for  the  western  Balkans,""  said  Albanian  Prime  Minister  Fatos  Nano.  According  to  Pat  Ferguson,  President  of  AMBO,  work  on  the  pipeline  will  begin  in  2005  and  it  is  expected  to  be  ready  in  three  or  four  years.  He  added  that  the  company  had  already  raised  about  $900m  from  the  Overseas  Private  Investment  Corporation  (OPIC)  -  a  US  development  agency  -  the  Eximbank  and  Credit  Suisse  First  Boston,  among  others.  The  project  has  also  the  support  of  the  European  Union.  Analysts  have  said  that  oil  companies  like  ChevronTexaco,  Exxon  Mobil  and  British  Petroleum  would  be  happy  to  find  alternative  routes  to  the  Bosphorus  and  Dardanelles  Straits."

But  the  director  award  went  to  Clint  Eastwood  for  Million  Dollar  Baby.  The  Southeastern  Film  Critics  also  awarded  Sideways  its  best  film  of  the  year  accolade.  Director  Alexander  Payne  was  named  best  director,  and  he  also  won  best  screenplay  shared  with  Jim  Taylor.  The  CFCA  awarded  Thomas  Haden  Church  the  best  supporting  actor  prize  and  Virginia  Madsen  the  best  supporting  actress  award  for  their  roles  in  the  film.  |||    Sideways  has  already  been  voted  best  film  by  critics  associations  in  New  York  and  Los  Angeles  and  has  been  nominated  for  a  Golden  Globe.  British  actress  Imelda  Staunton  won  the  CFCA  best  actress  for  the  gritty  abortion  drama  Vera  Drake,  adding  to  a  growing  list  of  awards  she  has  won  for  her  performance  in  the  Mike  Leigh  film.  Scrubs  star  Zach  Braff  was  named  best  new  director  for  his  debut  Garden  State.  Michael  Moore's  controversial  documentary  Fahrenheit  9/11  won  the  best  documentary,  while  A  Very  Long  Engagement  won  best  foreign  film.  The  Chicago  critics  have  yet  to  name  a  date  for  when  their  awards  ceremony  will  be  held." 

2	"Hague  'given  up'  his  PM  ambition  |||    Former  Conservative  leader  William  Hague  says  he  will  not  stand  for  the  leadership  again,  having  given  up  his  ambition  to  be  prime  minister.  |||    Mr  Hague,  43,  told  the  Daily  Telegraph  he  would  now  find  a  life  dominated  by  politics  too  ""boring""  and  unfulfilling.  Mr  Hague,  who  stepped  down  after  his  party's  2001  election  defeat,  does  not  rule  out  a  return  to  the  front  bench.  He  also  told  the  paper  he  hopes  to  remain  MP  for  Richmond,  North  Yorks,  and  start  a  family  with  wife  Ffion.  Mr  Hague,  who  recently  had  published  the  biography  of  William  Pitt  the  Younger,  also  said  he  wanted  to  continue  writing  books  and  speech-writing.  |||    He  told  the  newspaper:  ""I  don't  know  whether  I  will  ever  go  back  on  to  the  front,  but  don't  rush  me.""  Asked  if  he  would  stand  for  the  leadership  again,  Mr  Hague  replied:  ""No.  Definitely  not.""  His  determination  to  stay  away  from  a  central  role  will  disappoint  some  senior  Conservative  members,  who  say  the  party  needs  him.  Tim  Collins,  the  shadow  education  secretary,  said  last  week  it  would  be  a  ""huge  boost""  to  the  party  if  Mr  Hague  returned  to  the  front  bench.  Mr  Hague  became  an  MP  at  27  and  Leader  of  the  Opposition  at  36.  He  said:  ""I  feel  fortunate  that,  by  the  age  of  40,  I  had  crammed  in  an  entire  political  career.  ""I  had  been  in  the  Cabinet  and  been  leader  of  the  party,  so  now  I  can  branch  out  into  other  things...it  is  a  very  liberating  feeling.""  Mr  Hague  added  that  he  may  have  misjudged  his  own  ambition  to  be  prime  minister.  ""Maybe  I  wasn't  as  driven  by  politics  as  I  thought  I  was,""  he  said." 

0	"Japan's  ageing  workforce:  built  to  last  |||    In  his  twenties  he  battled  tuberculosis  for  eight  years,  then  went  on  to  run  his  own  clothing  business  before  marrying  in  his  late  thirties.  And  the  101-year-old  Torao  Toshitsune  has  eaten  raw  fish  pretty  much  every  day  throughout  his  life.  |||    Mr  Toshitsune  is  one  of  Japan's  23,000  centenarians  -  a  club  that  is  growing  by  13%  annually,  and  where  the  oldest  member  is  114.  At  his  neat  Osaka  detached  house,  where  he  lives  with  one  of  his  sexagenarian  daughters,  Mr  Toshitsune  keeps  a  regular  routine  of  copying  out  Buddhist  sutras  and  preparing  the  traditional  Japanese  tea  ceremony.  Between  tasks,  this  remarkably  active  senior  citizen  reveals  what  his  next  goal  is:  ""Well,  what's  most  important  for  me  is  to  be  Japan's  number  one.""  Mr  Toshitsune  wants  to  outlive  everyone.  And  when  it  comes  to  longevity,  Japan,  as  a  country,  appears  to  be  doing  just  that.  Women  can  expect  to  live  until  85,  men  until  78,  four  years  longer  than  Americans  and  Europeans.  |||    On  the  outskirts  of  Kyoto,  83-year-old  Yuji  Shimizu  contemplates  this  phenomenon  during  a  round  of  golf  with  his  younger  friends,  who  are  in  their  seventies.  |||    ""I  think  this  is  because  the  food  industry  and  the  environment  have  improved,""  he  remarks.  ""On  average,  we  can  live  longer.""  Whether  it's  the  diet,  or  the  traditional  family  structure  where  roles  were  clearly  defined,  or  just  something  in  the  genes,  Japan's  elderly  are  remarkable.  But  while  life  may  be  a  game  of  golf  for  Mr  Shimizu,  his  grandchildren  have  huge  problems  ahead.  Japan  is  the  world's  least  fertile  nation  with  childbirth  rates  of  just  two  thirds  of  that  in  the  US.  |||    By  2007,  Japan's  population  is  expected  to  peak  at  127  million,  then  shrink  to  under  100  million  by  the  middle  of  the  century.  This  means  30  million  fewer  workers  at  a  time  when  the  number  of  elderly  will  have  almost  doubled.  |||    ""In  the  year  2050,  if  the  birth  rate  remains  the  same  people  over  60  will  make  up  over  30%  of  the  population,""  explains  Shigeo  Morioka  of  the  International  Longevity  Centre  in  Tokyo.  So  how  will  Japan's  finances  stay  on  track?  After  a  decade  of  economic  stagnation  and  huge  deficit  spending,  the  public  sector  debt  is  already  about  140%  of  the  country's  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  the  highest  rate  among  industrialised  countries.  The  International  Monetary  Fund  predicts  that  as  the  falling  birth  rate  takes  grip  from  2010,  the  cost  of  running  Japan's  welfare  state  will  double  to  more  than  5%  of  GDP,  while  current  account  balances  will  deteriorate  by  over  2%.  But  unfortunately,  Japan  appears  poorly  prepared  both  financially  and  politically.  Glen  Wood,  Vice  President  of  Deutsche  Securities  Japan,  asks;  ""Who's  going  to  fund  the  pension  fund  for  the  next  generation  and  indeed  who  are  going  to  be  the  new  Japanese  worker?  ""Who  is  going  to  build  the  economy,  who  are  going  to  be  the  leaders?  Who  are  going  to  be  the  producers  of  the  GDP  going  forward?""  One  option  is  further  welfare  reform.  Another  is  immigration,  possibly  from  the  Philippines  and  Indonesia.  But  so  far,  any  emerging  policy  appears  restricted  to  a  limited  number  of  nursing  staff.  |||    Standing  next  to  Tokyo  harbour  is  a  version  of  New  York's  Statue  of  Liberty.  But,  as  yet,  Japan  is  not  ready  for  an  Ellis  Island.  |||    ""Japan  has  never  really  liked  that  option  in  its  history  and  I  think  it's  an  option  that's  becoming  more  and  more  plausible  and  necessary,""  insists  Mr  Wood.  In  Japan,  as  in  Europe  which  also  faces  a  workforce  decline,  immigration  is  a  very  sensitive  subject.  But  for  the  Japanese  economy,  facing  8%  fewer  consumers  by  2050  means  slumping  domestic  sales  of  cars,  hi-tech  kit  and  home  appliances,  perhaps  even  another  property  crash.  |||    Of  course  the  Japanese  could  always  have  more  children.  The  government  is  currently  considering  financial  rewards  for  procreative  couples  similar  to  those  in  operation  in  Australia.  But  there  would  be  no  pay  back  until  2030,  when  today's  babies  are  taxpayers,  and  the  demographic  crisis,  like  in  Europe,  starts  to  unfold  in  2010.  In  contrast  to  Japan  -  and  of  course  the  European  Union  -  the  US  population  is  expected  to  increase  by  46%  to  420  million  by  the  middle  of  the  century.  Although  President  Bush  must  re-devise  Social  Security  to  take  account  of  a  130%  rise  in  America's  over  65s,  the  IMF  foresees  a  positive  contribution  to  the  US  current  account  balance  from  the  combined  forces  of  fertility  and  immigration.  |||    Some  voices  in  Japanese  industry  are  calling  for  radical  changes  to  the  nature  of  the  Japanese  labour  market.  They  want  a  shift  towards  financial  services,  though  doubts  persist  over  the  country's  ability,  let  alone  willingness,  to  move  away  from  manufacturing.  ""Japan  still  has  problems  getting  a  viable  banking  system,  let  alone  shifting  their  auto  business  or  their  semi-conductor  business  or  the  broad  based  tech  manufacturing  business  overseas,""  says  Mr  Wood.  Japan  can  either  drive  some  radical  reforms  or  else  run  the  risk  of  a  vicious  ageing  recession.  Falling  demand  and  a  lower  tax  take  could  result  in  soaring  budget  pressures  and  a  basket  case  currency.  Come  2020,  Japan  could  be  more  dependent  on  a  shrinking  workforce  than  any  other  industrialised  power.  There  are  fears  that  the  world's  number  two  economy  is  doomed  to  a  permanent  recession.  But  none  of  this  is  Mr  Toshitsune's  concern  anymore.  At  101,  he  chuckles  that,  he  feels  fine."

She  said:  ""I  very  much  wanted  to  be  in  London  but  unfortunately  I'm  not  well.  At  the  advice  of  my  doctors  I'm  unable  to  travel.""  Co-star  Richard  Gere  attended  the  event  held  in  aid  of  the  tsunami  appeal.  Thousands  braved  the  cold  weather  to  see  the  stars  in  London's  Leicester  Square.  The  red  carpet  boasted  waltzing  dancers  in  honour  of  the  film's  ballroom  dancing  theme.  The  film's  director  Peter  Chelsom  said  he  was  disappointed  that  Lopez  did  not  attend.  |||    ""It's  a  shame.  I  know  it's  true  that  she's  not  well  because  she  has  also  cancelled  her  promotional  tour.  I've  heard  she  has  swollen  glands.""

1	"No  charges  against  TV's  Cosby  |||    US  comedian  Bill  Cosby  will  not  face  charges  stemming  from  an  allegation  of  sexual  misconduct.  |||    Authorities  in  Philadelphia  said  they  found  insufficient  evidence  to  support  the  woman's  allegations  regarding  an  alleged  incident  in  January  2004.  The  woman  reported  the  allegations  to  Canadian  authorities  last  month.  Cosby's  lawyer,  Walter  M  Phillips  Jr,  said  the  comedian  was  pleased  with  the  decision.  ""He  looks  forward  to  moving  on  with  his  life,""  he  said.  District  Attorney  Bruce  L  Castor  Jr,  who  was  in  charge  of  the  case,  said  that  detectives  could  find  no  instance  ""where  anyone  complained  to  law  enforcement  of  conduct  which  would  constitute  a  criminal  offence.  |||    He  also  said  that  the  fact  the  woman  waited  a  year  before  coming  forward,  and  she  had  had  further  contact  with  Cosby  during  that  time,  were  also  factors  in  his  decision.  The  unidentified  woman's  lawyer,  Dolores  M  Troiani,  said  her  client  was  likely  to  sue  the  comedian.  ""I  think  that's  the  only  avenue  open  to  her.  She  felt,  as  we  did,  that  it's  a  very  strong  case  and  she  was  telling  the  truth.""  She  also  said  that  the  woman  supplied  further  evidence  to  prosecutors  that  she  believed  strengthened  her  allegations.  Cosby  emerged  as  one  of  the  first  black  comics  to  have  mainstream  success  in  the  US.  He  was  a  successful  stand-up  before  hosting  the  children's  show  Fat  Albert  and  the  Cosby  Kids,  and  starring  in  The  Cosby  Show,  one  of  the  biggest  sitcoms  of  the  1980s." 

0	"Putin  backs  state  grab  for  Yukos  |||    Russia's  president  has  defended  the  purchase  of  Yukos'  key  production  unit  by  state-owned  oil  firm  Rosneft,  saying  it  followed  free  market  principles.  |||    Vladimir  Putin  said  it  was  quite  within  the  rights  of  a  state-owned  company  to  ensure  its  interests  were  met.  Rosneft  bought  100%  of  Baikal  Finance  Group,  in  a  move  that  amounts  to  the  renationalisation  of  a  major  chunk  of  Russia's  booming  oil  industry.  Rosneft  will  now  control  about  16%  of  Russia's  total  crude  oil  output.  Yukos  share  jumped  in  Moscow,  climbing  as  much  as  50%  before  being  suspended.  |||    Rosneft  is  already  in  the  process  of  merging  with  Gazprom,  the  world's  biggest  gas  company,  a  move  that  will  see  Gazprom  return  to  majority  state-ownership.  |||    Baikal  was  the  surprise  buyer  of  oil  and  gas  giant  Yukos's  main  production  division  at  a  forced  auction  on  Sunday.  ""Everything  was  done  by  market  methods,""  Mr  Putin  said  at  his  year-end  press  conference  in  Moscow.  Shedding  some  light  on  the  Kremlin's  motivation,  Mr  Putin  referred  to  a  period  of  so-called  ""cowboy  capitalism""  that  followed  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union.  |||    He  said  privatisations  carried  out  in  the  early  1990s  had  involved  trickery,  including  law  breaking,  by  people  seeking  to  acquire  valuable  state  property.  ""Now  the  state,  using  market  methods,  is  safeguarding  its  interests.  I  think  this  is  quite  normal,""  the  Russian  president  said.  A  Rosneft  spokesman  has  said  the  acquisition  is  part  of  its  plan  to  build  a  ""balanced,  national  energy  corporation.""  |||    The  latest  announcement  comes  after  more  than  a  year  of  wrangling  that  has  pushed  Yukos,  one  of  Russia's  biggest  companies  to  the  brink  of  collapse.  The  Russian  government  put  Yukos's  Yuganskneftegas  subsidiary  up  for  sale  last  week  after  hitting  the  company  with  a  $27bn  (£14bn)  bill  for  back  taxes  and  fines.  |||    Analysts  say  that  Yukos's  legal  attempts  to  block  the  auction  by  filing  for  bankruptcy  protection  in  the  US  are  probably  what  caused  this  week's  cloak-and-dagger  dealings.  Gazprom,  the  company  originally  tipped  to  buy  Yuganskneftegas,  was  banned  from  taking  part  in  the  auction  by  a  US  court  injunction.  By  selling  the  Yukos  unit  to  little-known  Baikal  and  then  to  Rosneft,  Russia  is  able  to  circumvent  a  host  of  tricky  legal  landmines,  analysts  said.  ""You  cannot  sue  the  Russian  government,""  said  Eric  Kraus,  a  strategist  at  Moscow's  Sovlink  Securities.  ""The  Russian  government  has  sovereign  immunity.""  ""The  government  is  renationalising  Yuganskneftegas.""  |||    Even  so,  analysts  reckon  that  the  saga  still  has  a  long  way  to  go.  The  Rosneft  announcement  came  just  hours  after  Yukos  accused  Gazprom  of  illegally  taking  part  in  Sunday's  auction.  It  has  said  it  will  be  seeking  damages  of  $20bn.  The  claim  was  made  at  the  latest  hearing  in  the  US  bankruptcy  court  in  Houston,  Texas,  where  Yukos,  had  filed  for  Chapter  11  bankruptcy  protection.  If  found  in  contempt  of  the  US  court  order  blocking  the  auction,  Gazprom  could  face  having  foreign  assets  seized.  Yukos'  lawyers  had  also  been  expected  to  try  to  have  Baikal's  assets  frozen.  Lawyers  claimed  the  auction  was  illegal  because  Yukos  -  with  an  office  in  Houston  -  had  filed  for  bankruptcy  and  therefore  its  assets  were  under  the  protection  of  US  law  which  has  worldwide  jurisdiction.

The  private  member's  bill  would  also  abolish  the  ban  on  heirs  to  the  throne  marrying  Roman  Catholics.  The  Fabian  Society's  Sundar  Katwala  said  the  change  was  ""long  overdue""  and  that  he  expected  a  ""warm  response"".  The  political  reform  group's  general  secretary  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  Programme  there  were  some  ""very  out-dated  features""  at  the  heart  of  Britain's  constitution.  |||    ""In  1998  the  government  said  in  principle  it  supported  the  idea  of  ending  gender  discrimination  and  that  it  would  consult  on  how  to  come  forward  with  its  own  measures.  ""We  hope  they  are  warm  towards  it  and  don't  say  this  is  the  wrong  time.""  He  pointed  out  that  it  was  30  years  since  the  sex  discrimination  act  and  urged  politicians  on  all  sides  to  back  the  bill.  Mr  Katwala  added:  ""This  is  long  overdue.  Parliament  will  have  to  do  it  eventually,  the  government,  and  I  hope  all  of  the  political  parties,  might  think  this  is  a  very  simple  thing  to  have  in  their  manifestos.""  |||    But  he  acknowledged  that  even  if  the  bill  did  win  support,  it  was  unlikely  to  become  law  because  the  legislative  programme  is  likely  to  be  squeezed  by  the  coming  general  election.  He  said  he  hoped  the  bill  would  be  a  ""gentle  nudge""  to  the  government  and  suggested  it  would  ""demand  a  response"".  The  bill,  which  is  in  the  Lords  for  its  second  reading,  has  been  adopted  by  former  chief  whip  Ann  Taylor  in  the  Commons.  The  rule  of  succession  is  regulated  not  only  through  descent  and  tradition  but  also  by  the  Act  of  Settlement  which  confirmed  in  1701  that  it  was  for  Parliament  to  determine  the  title  to  the  throne."

Star  number  eight  Simon  Taylor  will  miss  at  least  the  first  two  games  after  damaging  an  ankle  during  his  comeback.  Scott  MacLeod  (ankle  ligaments)  and  Jon  Petrie  (cartilage)  are  also  doubtful  for  the  opener  in  Paris  on  5  February.  Gray,  26,  who  won  his  first  cap  against  Australia  at  Murrayfield  last  year,  was  hurt  in  club  action  at  the  weekend.  Scotland  doctor  James  Robson  said:  ""A  scan  has  shown  damage  to  the  medial  ligaments  of  Scott's  right  knee  ruling  him  out  of  the  first  part  of  the  Championship.  ""We  will  seek  further  specialist  advice  in  due  course  to  determine  just  how  long  Scott  may  be  out  for.""  Another  potential  option,  Glasgow  flanker  Andrew  Wilson,  has  been  ruled  out  for  a  month  after  damaging  ligaments  in  both  knees  against  Northampton  recently.  |||    Flanker  Jason  White  and  prop  Tom  Smith  have  also  been  suffering  from  flu  and  missed  this  week's  training  sessions.  ""We  have  got  plenty  of  good,  young  players  coming  through  and  we  have  got  to  look  at  the  opportunities  it  represents  for  them,  rather  than  the  negatives,""  Williams  added.  Williams  could  now  turn  to  Edinburgh  pair  Alasdair  Strokosch  and  Simon  Cross.  Leeds  Tykes  flanker  Jon  Dunbar  also  trained  with  the  squad  but  is  still  awaiting  verification  of  his  eligibility  to  qualify  for  Scotland."

But  Air  Deccan's  managing  director  Gorur  Gopinath  has  said  the  price  agreed  was  less  than  the  catalogue  price  of  $17.6m  (£9.49m)  per  plane.  Recently,  India's  first  low-cost  airline  ordered  30  Airbus  A320  planes  for  $1.8bn.  |||    Under  the  agreement,  Air  Deccan  will  buy  15  new  ATR  72-500  and  lease  another  15.  ATR  will  also  provide  six  second  hand  airplanes.  In  a  statement,  ATR  has  said  deliveries  of  the  aircraft  will  begin  in  2005  and  will  continue  over  a  five-year  period.  |||    Mr  Gopinath  said  the  planes  will  connect  regional  Indian  cities.  ""After  an  evaluation  of  both  ATR  and  Bombardier  aircraft,  we  have  chosen  the  ATR  aircraft  as  we  find  it  most  suitable  for  our  operations  and  for  the  Indian  market  for  short  haul  routes.""  Filippo  Bagnato,  ATR's  chief  executive,  has  said  that  his  firm  will  also  work  with  Air  Deccan  to  create  a  training  centre  in  Bangalore.  |||    The  potential  of  the  Indian  budget  market  has  attracted  attention  from  businesses  at  home  and  abroad.  Air  Deccan  has  said  it  will  base  its  business  model  on  European  firms  such  as  Ireland's  Ryanair.  Beer  magnate  Vijay  Mallya  recently  set  up  Kingfisher  Airlines,  while  UK  entrepreneur  Richard  Branson  has  said  he  is  keen  to  start  a  local  operation.

President  Viktor  Yushchenko,  elected  in  December,  is  planning  to  revisit  many  of  Ukraine's  recent  privatisations.  Krivorizhstal  is  one  of  dozens  of  firms  which  he  says  were  sold  cheaply  to  friends  of  the  previous  administration.  |||    On  Wednesday,  Prime  Minister  Yulia  Tymoshenko  said  as  many  as  3,000  firms  could  be  included  on  the  list  of  firms  whose  sale  was  being  reviewed.  |||    Mr  Yushchenko  had  previously  said  the  list  would  be  limited  to  30-40  enterprises.  More  than  90,000  businesses  in  all,  from  massive  corporations  to  tiny  shopfronts,  have  been  sold  off  since  1992,  as  the  command  economy  built  up  when  Ukraine  was  part  of  the  Soviet  Union  was  dismantled.  Analysts  have  suggested  that  the  government  needs  to  avoid  the  impression  of  an  open-ended  list,  so  as  to  preserve  investor  confidence.  |||    Thursday's  ruling  by  a  district  court  in  Perchesk  overturned  a  previous  decision  in  a  lower  court  permitting  the  sale.  The  consortium  which  won  the  auction  for  the  mill  was  created  by  Viktor  Pinchuk,  son-in-law  of  former-President  Leonid  Kuchma,  and  Rinat  Akhmetov,  the  country's  richest  man.  The  next  step  is  for  the  supreme  court  to  annul  the  sale  altogether,  opening  the  way  for  Krivorizhstal  to  be  resold.  Mr  Yushchenko  has  suggested  a  fair  valuation  could  be  as  much  as  $3bn.  One  of  the  foreign  bidders  who  lost  out,  steel  giant  LNM,  told  BBC  News  that  it  would  be  interested  in  any  renewed  sale." 

2	"Ministers  lose  slopping  out  case  |||    The  Scottish  Executive  has  lost  an  appeal  against  an  inmate's  compensation  for  being  forced  to  slop  out  in  prison.  |||    Armed  robber  Robert  Napier,  25,  won  £2,450  after  he  claimed  he  suffered  an  outbreak  of  the  skin  complaint,  eczema,  when  slopping  out  at  Barlinnie  Prison.  Napier  said  that  the  practice,  where  prisoners  use  buckets  in  their  cells  as  toilets,  breached  his  human  rights.  On  Thursday,  the  Court  of  Session  threw  out  a  move  by  the  executive  to  apply  a  more  rigorous  standard  of  proof.  |||    The  executive  faces  more  than  1,000  similar  claims  for  damages  from  prisoners  and  former  inmates.  More  than  310  actions  have  already  been  raised  in  the  Court  of  Session  and  sheriff  courts  in  Scotland.  An  executive  spokesman  said:  ""We  will  study  this  judgement  in  detail.  Much  has  changed  to  address  the  issues  raised  in  the  Napier  case,  for  example,  slopping  out  has  ended  at  Barlinnie  and  work  in  other  prisons  is  being  accelerated.  ""Today's  judgement  does  not  affect  the  outcome  of  other  cases.""  Napier,  a  remand  prisoner  at  the  time,  raised  a  legal  challenge  in  2001  under  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights,  in  which  he  sought  £5,000.  He  was  awarded  compensation  last  April  after  winning  his  case.  |||    Executive  ministers  raised  an  appeal  arguing  that  the  standard  of  proof  to  be  applied  in  cases  alleging  a  breach  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  through  degrading  and  inhumane  treatment  should  ""be  beyond  reasonable  doubt"".  This  is  the  standard  normally  applied  in  criminal  trials  in  Scotland.  However,  civil  litigation  is  settled  on  the  test  of  ""a  balance  of  probabilities"".  Judge  Lord  Cullen,  sitting  with  Lord  Osborne  and  Lord  Hamilton,  ruled  that  alleged  human  rights  breaches  involving  degrading  treatment  should  be  dealt  with  on  the  normal  civil  standard.  Napier's  lawyer  Tony  Kelly  believes  the  action  will  soon  be  followed  by  others.  Mr  Kelly  said:  ""There  are  hundreds  of  people  still  undergoing  slopping  out,  overcrowding  and  poor  regime  and  those  people  will  certainly  be  heartened  by  today's  judgement.""  Scottish  National  Party  Justice  Minister  Kenny  MacAskill  said  that  the  slopping  out  case  had  been  ""a  fiasco  from  start  to  finish"".  He  said:  ""Ministers  were  fully  aware  of  the  state  of  Scotland's  jails.  Funds  were  available  but  they  chose  to  ignore  the  problem  and  after  this  ruling  I  suspect  we  will  be  faced  with  even  more  claims  and  no  doubt  more  payouts.  ""A  short  term  executive  saving  has  resulted  in  a  long  term  public  cost.""" 

0	"Tsunami  'to  hit  Sri  Lanka  banks'  |||    Sri  Lanka's  banks  face  hard  times  following  December's  tsunami  disaster,  officials  have  warned.  |||    The  Sri  Lanka  Banks  Association  said  the  waves  which  killed  more  than  30,000  people  also  washed  away  huge  amounts  of  property  which  was  securing  loans.  According  to  its  estimate,  as  much  as  13.6%  of  the  loans  made  by  private  banks  to  clients  in  the  disaster  zone  has  been  written  off  or  damaged.  State-owned  lenders  may  be  even  worse  hit,  it  said.  |||    The  association  estimates  that  the  private  banking  sector  has  25bn  rupees  ($250m;  £135m)  of  loans  outstanding  in  the  disaster  zone.  On  one  hand,  banks  are  dealing  with  the  death  of  their  customers,  along  with  damaged  or  destroyed  collateral.  On  the  other,  most  are  extending  cheap  loans  for  rebuilding  and  recovery,  as  well  as  giving  their  clients  more  time  to  repay  existing  borrowing.  The  combination  means  a  revenue  shortfall  during  2005,  SLBA  chairman  -  and  Commercial  Bank  managing  director  -  AL  Gooneratne  told  a  news  conference.  ""Most  banks  have  given  moratoriums  and  will  not  be  collecting  interest,  at  least  in  this  quarter,""  he  said.  In  the  public  sector,  more  than  one  in  ten  of  the  state-owned  People's  Bank's  customers  in  the  south  of  Sri  Lanka  were  affected,  a  bank  spokesman  told  Reuters.  He  estimated  the  bank's  loss  at  3bn  rupees." 

2	"Tories  attack  burglar  'U-turns'  |||    Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  has  accused  Tony  Blair  of  performing  U-turns  over  rules  on  using  force  against  burglars.  |||    The  government  has  ruled  out  amending  the  present  law,  which  allows  ""reasonable  force""  in  self  defence.  Mr  Howard  branded  the  decision  unacceptable,  saying:  ""It  is  not  householders  who  should  be  frightened,  it's  the  burglars.""  Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  said  ministers  had  kept  to  their  pledge  to  review  the  law.  |||    Metropolitan  Police  Commissioner  Sir  John  Stevens  last  month  backed  a  Tory  attempt  to  change  the  law  so  only  householders  using  ""grossly  disproportionate""  force  could  be  prosecuted.  The  pressure  prompted  the  prime  minister  to  say  the  police  and  Crown  Prosecution  Service  would  be  consulted  as  part  of  a  review  of  the  law.  He  told  MPs:  ""If  we  get  the  right  response  from  those  people,  we  will,  of  course,  support  a  change  in  the  law.""  Instead,  the  government  has  decided  no  change  is  needed  but  there  will  be  a  publicity  campaign  so  people  are  clear  they  are  entitled  to  defend  themselves.  On  Thursday,  Mr  Howard  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme  Mr  Blair  had  initially  refused  the  law  change,  then  had  come  round  to  the  idea  and  was  now  backtracking  again.  He  said:  ""We've  had  three  policy  positions  in  three  months  and  two  U-turns.  ""It's  not  surprising  Gordon  Brown  told  him:  'There's  nothing  you  could  say  to  me  now  that  I  could  ever  believe.'""  |||    Mr  Howard  said  the  ""grossly  disproportionate""  test  matched  the  hurdle  ministers  had  introduced  for  civil  cases  where  burglars  where  claimed  compensation  from  householders.  The  issue  entered  the  public  spotlight  when  Norfolk  farmer  Tony  Martin  was  jailed  for  shooting  dead  a  16-year-old  burglar  in  1999  as  he  ran  away  from  the  farm.  But  the  home  secretary  said  Mr  Howard  was  wrong  to  say  the  law  was  biased  in  favour  of  burglars.  The  barrister  who  had  represented  Mr  Martin  had  said  the  rules  were  ""weighted  overwhelmingly""  in  favour  of  the  householder,  said  Mr  Clarke.  He  said:  ""The  problem  is  there  has  not  been  enough  understanding  of  it  -  that  was  the  point  Sir  John  Stevens  was  making  and  the  prime  minister  was  making.""  The  new  guidance  would  help  ensure  clarity  on  the  issue,  added  Mr  Clarke.  The  director  of  public  prosecutions,  Ken  Macdonald,  says  only  11  householders  or  occupiers  of  business  premises  have  been  prosecuted  in  the  last  15  years.  Those  cases  included  a  warehouse  manager  who  had  waited  for  a  burglar,  tied  him  up,  beat  him  and  set  him  alight,  he  said.  Tory  MP  Patrick  Mercer's  private  member's  bill  to  change  the  law  received  a  first  reading  in  Parliament  on  Wednesday  and  goes  to  a  full  debate  next  month."

The  firm  said  strong  demand  outside  western  Europe  and  the  good  performance  of  its  Megane  range  lifted  its  results.  Chairman  Louis  Schweitzer  said  2004  had  been  a  ""great  year""  for  the  firm.  |||    Renault  sold  more  than  2.4  million  vehicles  in  2004,  an  increase  of  4%  on  the  previous  year.  Growth  came  mainly  from  outside  western  Europe,  with  particularly  strong  sales  in  Turkey,  Russia  and  North  Africa.  |||    In  total,  sales  outside  western  Europe  -  Renault's  core  market  -  rose  16.5%.  Japanese  carmaker  Nissan  -  in  which  Renault  owns  a  44%  stake  -  contributed  1.7bn  euros  in  net  income  over  the  year.  Nissan  chairman  Carlos  Ghosn  is  to  succeed  Mr  Schweitzer  at  the  head  of  Renault  later  this  year.  |||    Renault  said  the  outlook  for  the  industry  in  Europe  this  year  was  ""stable"",  with  small  growth  forecast  in  other  regions.  The  firm  will  benefit  from  the  launch  of  a  new  Clio  model  in  the  coming  year  and  the  roll-out  of  the  Logan  in  many  markets.  However,  the  firm  said  it  expected  operating  margins  to  be  lower  in  2005,  at  4%  of  sales  as  opposed  to  5%.  ""In  a  sluggish  market  and  an  environment  impacted  by  the  rise  in  raw  material  prices,  Renault  intends  to  continue  to  grow  its  global  sales,""  the  company  said  in  a  statement."

The  distressed  actress  told  media  she  was  being  driven  straight  to  the  airport  after  a  routine  appointment  at  the  Bombay  immigration  office.  Immigration  officials  said  she  had  been  warned  about  her  visa  last  year.  |||    Khan  told  an  Indian  news  channel  on  her  mobile  phone:  ""They  are  not  even  letting  me  go  home  to  get  my  bags.

One  of  Khan's  biggest  successes  was  the  steamy  Hindi  song  Chadti  Jawani  (Rising  Youth).

Airbus  head  Noel  Forgeard  is  now  set  to  replace  Mr  Camus,  bringing  the  company's  power  struggle  to  an  end.  Fighting  between  Mr  Camus  and  Mr  Forgeard  has  hit  the  headlines  in  France  and  analysts  feared  that  this  fighting  could  destabilise  the  defence  and  aerospace  group.  French  finance  minister  Herve  Gaymard  is  on  record  as  saying  that  he  ""deplored""  the  infighting  at  the  company.  The  company  should  now  be  able  put  this  dispute  behind  it,  with  the  departure  of  Mr  Camus  and  with  the  clear  support  given  to  Mr  Forgeard  by  the  Lagardere  group,  the  main  French  shareholder  of  EADS.  The  other  main  shareholders  of  EADS  are  the  French  government  (15%)  ,  who  also  support  Mr  Forgeard,  and  Germany's  DaimlerChrysler  (30%).  Rainer  Hertrich,  the  German  co-head  of  EADS  will  also  step  down  when  his  contract  expires  next  year.  |||    Mr  Camus  recently  came  under  pressure  as  it  became  clear  that  the  A380  superjumbo  was  running  over  budget.  EADS  -  Airbus'  majority  owner  -  admitted  earlier  this  week  that  the  project  was  running  1.45bn  euros  (£1bn;  $1.9bn)  over  budget.  But  Mr  Forgeard  has  denied  this,  telling  French  media  that  there  is  no  current  overrun  in  the  budget.  ""But  for  the  sake  of  transparency,  we  told  our  shareholders  last  week  that  if  we  look  at  the  forecast  for  total  costs  of  the  project  up  to  2010,  there  is  a  risk  that  we  will  go  over  by  around  10%,  which  is  about  1bn  euros  (£686m;  $1.32bn),""  he  told  France's  LCI  Television.

The  average  price  of  a  house  in  the  UK  now  stands  at  £162,086,  Halifax  said.  The  survey  seems  to  fly  in  the  face  of  recent  evidence  that  the  UK  housing  market  has  been  slowing  substantially  in  response  to  interest  rate  rises.  |||    Last  week,  the  Nationwide  said  that  house  prices  fell  0.2%  in  December,  with  annual  inflation  running  at  a  three  year  low.  |||    On  Tuesday,  figures  from  the  Bank  of  England  showed  that  the  number  of  mortgages  approved  in  the  UK  has  fallen  to  the  lowest  level  for  nearly  a  decade.  New  loans  in  November  fell  to  77,000,  from  85,000  in  October,  the  lowest  rate  since  September  1995,  the  Bank  of  England  said.  Growth  in  unsecured  lending,  such  as  personal  loans  and  credit  cards,  also  slowed  last  month.  Capital  Economics,  which  has  in  the  past  predicted  a  sharp  fall  in  UK  house  prices,  branded  Halifax's  findings  a  ""temporary  surprise,""  which  would  be  reversed  over  the  coming  months.  ""The  month  by  month  volatility  of  the  Halifax  house  price  data  should  not  distract  from  the  fact  that  there  is  a  clear  downward  trend  in  house  prices,""  a  Capital  Economics  statement  said.  |||    Experts  believe  five  interest  rate  rises  since  November  2003  are  cutting  borrowers'  appetite  for  debt.  |||    Despite  recording  a  price  rise  in  December,  the  Halifax  survey  concluded  that  there  was  ""continuing  signs  of  a  genuine  slowdown  in  the  housing  market.""  Martin  Ellis,  Halifax  chief  economist,  said  that  there  was  no  need  to  revise  the  bank's  prediction,  made  last  month,  that  prices  would  fall  by  2%  in  2005.  ""Sound  housing  market  fundamentals  will  continue  to  underpin  the  market  in  2005,  ensuring  that  the  market  remains  healthy  and  that  house  prices  fall  only  slightly,""  Mr  Ellis  said.  If  the  bank's  prediction  of  a  2%  price  drop  comes  true,  it  will  be  the  first  annual  fall  in  nine  years.  |||    The  bank  said  that  the  recent  pattern  of  house  prices  rising  the  fastest  in  the  north  of  England  continued  in  December.  In  the  North  West  and  Yorkshire  and  the  Humber,  Halifax  said  prices  rose  by  3%  and  1.2%  in  the  two  regions  respectively  during  the  month.  At  the  other  send  of  the  scale,  prices  in  the  South  East  and  London  fell  by  1.6%  and  0.5%  respectively.  The  biggest  decline  was  seen  in  Wales  where  prices  fell  by  6.2%,  an  area  that  had  experienced  strong  house  price  growth  during  most  of  2004.  Overall,  Halifax  said  prices  in  the  final  quarter  of  2004  were  0.1%  higher  than  in  the  previous  quarter.  This  was  the  smallest  quarterly  rise  since  the  second  quarter  of  2000,  the  bank  said.  As  a  result,  annual  house  price  inflation  dipped  below  20%  during  the  final  few  months  of  2004."

Card  use  fell  sharply  last  year,  but  is  now  picking  up  again  with  a  rise  in  spending  of  14.8%  year-on-year.  ""The  economy  is  now  heading  upward  rather  than  downward,""  said  central  bank  governor  Park  Seung.  ""The  worst  seems  to  have  passed.""  Mr  Park's  statement  came  as  the  bank  decided  to  keep  interest  rates  at  an  all-time  low  of  3.25%.  It  had  cut  rates  in  November  to  help  revive  the  economy,  but  rising  inflation  -  reaching  0.7%  month-on-month  in  January  -  has  stopped  it  from  cutting  further.  Economic  growth  in  2004  was  about  4.7%,  with  the  central  bank  predicting  4%  growth  this  year.  Other  indicators  are  also  suggesting  that  the  country  is  inching  back  towards  economic  health.  Exports  -  traditionally  the  driver  for  expansion  in  Asian  economies  -  grew  slower  in  January  than  at  any  time  in  17  months.  But  domestic  demand  seems  to  be  taking  up  the  slack.  Consumer  confidence  has  bounced  back  from  a  four-year  low  in  January,  and  retail  sales  were  up  2.1%  in  December.  Credit  card  debt  is  falling,  with  only  one  in  13  of  the  48  million  cards  now  in  default  -  down  from  one  in  eight  at  the  end  of  2003.  One  of  its  biggest  card  issuers,  LG  Card,  was  rescued  from  collapse  in  December,  having  almost  imploded  under  the  weight  of  its  customers'  bad  debts.  The  government  last  year  tightened  the  rules  for  card  lending  to  keep  the  card  glut  under  control."

At  the  time,  Ofcom  offered  BT  the  choice  of  change  or  splitting  into  two.  Ofcom  is  carrying  out  a  strategic  review  aimed  at  promoting  greater  competition  in  the  UK  telecom  sector.  BT's  competitors  have  frequently  accused  it  of  misusing  its  status  as  the  former  telecoms  monopoly  and  controller  of  access  to  many  customers  to  favour  its  own  retail  arm.  |||    This  latest  submission  was  delivered  to  the  watchdog  ahead  of  a  deadline  for  the  second  phase  of  its  review.  |||    ""Central  to  the  proposals  are  plans  by  BT  to  offer  operators  lower  wholesale  prices,  faster  broadband  services  and  transparent,  highly-regulated  access  to  BT's  local  network,""  the  former  monopoly  said  in  a  statement.  ""The  United  Kingdom  has  the  opportunity  to  create  the  most  exciting  and  innovative  telecoms  market  in  the  world,""  BT  chief  executive  Ben  Verwaayen  said.  ""BT  has  a  critical  role  to  play,  and  today  we  are  making  a  set  of  far-reaching  proposals  towards  that  framework,""  he  said.  BT  wants  lighter  regulation  in  exchange  for  the  changes,  as  well  as  the  removal  of  the  break-up  threat.  |||    The  group  is  to  set  up  a  new  Access  Services  division  -  with  a  separate  board  which  would  include  independent  members  -  to  ensure  equal  access  for  rivals  to  the  ""local  loop"",  the  copper  wires  that  run  between  telephone  exchanges  and  households.  The  company  also  unveiled  plans  to  cut  the  wholesale  prices  of  its  most  popular  broadband  product  by  about  8%  from  April  in  areas  of  high  customer  demand.  |||    It  added  that  it  plans  to  invest  £10bn  in  the  next  five  years  to  create  a  ""21st  Century  network"".  To  meet  the  growing  demand  for  greater  bandwidth,  BT  said  it  would  begin  trials  in  April  with  a  view  to  launching  higher-speed  services  nationally  from  the  autumn.  |||    Telecom  analysts  Ovum  welcomed  the  move,  saying  BT  had  ""given  a  lot  of  ground"".  |||    ""The  big  question  now  is  whether  the  industry,  and  particularly  Ofcom  feels  BT's  proposals  go  far  enough  ...Now  the  real  negotiation  begins,""  director  of  telecoms  research  Tony  Lavender  said.  Internet  service  provider  (ISP)  Plus.net  also  backed  the  proposals  saying  ""we  will  be  entirely  happy  if  Ofcom  accepts  them"".  ""BT  has  been  challenged  to  play  fair  and  its  plans  will  introduce  a  level  playing  field.  The  scenario  now  is  how  well  people  execute  their  business  plans  as  a  service  provider,""  chief  executive  Lee  Strafford  said.  Chris  Panayis,  managing  director  of  ISP  Freedom2surf  said  that  it  would  make  the  situation  clearer  for  business.  ""I  think  it's  the  first  productive  thing  we've  had  from  BT,""  he  said.  |||    AOL  backed  the  price  cuts  but  said  regulation  was  still  needed  to  ensure  a  level  playing  field.  ""This  is  a  reminder  to  Ofcom  that  as  long  as  BT  can  change  the  dynamics  of  the  whole  broadband  market  at  will,  the  process  of  opening  up  the  UK's  local  telephone  network  to  infrastructure  investment  and  competition  remains  fragile,""  a  spokesman  said.  ""Ofcom  needs  to  return  to  regulation  of  the  wholesale  broadband  service  [IPStream]  and  provide  more  robust  rules  for  local  loop  unbundling  if  consumers  are  to  see  the  benefits  of  increased  competition  and  infrastructure  investment.""  More  than  100  telecom  firms,  consumer  groups  and  other  interested  parties  are  expected  to  make  submissions  to  the  regulator  during  this  consultation  phase.  Ofcom  is  expected  to  spend  the  next  few  weeks  examining  the  proposals  before  making  an  announcement  within  the  next  few  months."

Def  Jam's  parent  company,  Universal,  made  the  appointment  after  buying  Jay-Z's  Roc-A-Fella  label.  Def  Jam's  artists  include  LL  Cool  J,  DMX,  Ludacris,  Ja  Rule  and  Ashanti.  Jay-Z  will  continue  to  run  Roc-A-Fella,  which  he  founded  with  Damon  Dash  in  1995  and  has  Kanye  West  and  Beanie  Sigel  on  its  roster.

At  the  St  Enoch's  Shopping  Centre  in  Glasgow,  more  than  140,000  shoppers  -  an  all-time  record  -  were  expected  to  have  passed  through  the  doors  by  its  closing  time  of  1900  GMT.  Senior  business  manager  Jon  Walton  said:  ""It  has  been  phenomenal  -  absolutely  mobbed.  ""Every  week  footfall  has  been  showing  strong  growth  and  at  the  weekends  it  has  been  going  mad.""  Regent  Street  Association  director  Annie  Walker  said  on  Saturday:  ""The  stores  were  heaving  today  and  a  lot  of  people  are  going  to  be  doing  last  minute  shopping  as  many  people  finished  work  on  Friday  and  can  go  in  the  week.""  |||    She  said  reports  of  a  slump  in  pre-Christmas  sales  were  related  to  the  growing  popularity  of  internet  sales.  ""I  do  think  this  has  had  a  lot  to  do  with  reports  of  lower  sales  figures,""  she  said.  ""Internet  shopping  has  gone  up  enormously  and  not  all  stores  have  websites."""

However,  rival  suitor  Euronext  also  upped  the  ante  in  the  bid  battle.  Ahead  of  talks  with  the  LSE  on  Friday,  the  pan-European  bourse  said  it  may  be  prepared  to  make  its  offer  in  cash.  The  Paris-based  exchange,  owner  of  Liffe  in  London,  is  reported  to  be  ready  to  raise  £1.4bn  to  fund  a  bid.  |||    The  news  came  as  Deutsche  Boerse  held  its  third  meeting  with  the  LSE  since  its  bid  approach  in  December  which  was  turned  down  by  the  London  exchange  for  undervaluing  the  business.  However,  the  LSE  did  agree  to  leave  the  door  open  for  talks  to  find  out  whether  a  ""significantly-improved  proposal""  would  be  in  the  interests  of  LSE's  shareholders  and  customers.  In  the  meantime,  Euronext,  which  combines  the  Paris,  Amsterdam  and  Lisbon  stock  exchanges,  also  began  talks  with  the  LSE.  In  a  statement  on  Thursday,  Euronext  said  any  offer  was  likely  to  be  solely  in  cash,  but  added  that:  ""There  can  be  no  assurances  at  this  stage  that  any  offer  will  be  made.""  A  deal  with  either  bidder  would  create  the  biggest  stock  market  operator  in  Europe  and  the  second  biggest  in  the  world  after  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange.  However,  neither  side  has  made  a  formal  offer  for  the  LSE,  with  sources  claiming  such  a  step  may  still  be  weeks  away.  |||    Deutsche  Boerse  could  also  face  mounting  opposition  to  a  bid  at  home.  Among  sweeteners  reported  to  have  been  discussed  by  Mr  Seifert  with  Ms  Furse  were  plans  to  move  the  management  of  its  cash  and  Eurex  derivatives  market  to  London,  as  well  as  two  members  of  its  executive  board.  But,  Hans  Reckers,  a  board  member  of  Germany's  central  bank,  the  Bundesbank,  said  that  cash  trading  should  also  remain  in  Frankfurt,  something  Deutsche  Boerse  could  move  to  the  UK.  ""It  is  not  just  the  headquarters  of  the  Boerse  but  also  important  market  segments  that  must  stay  permanently  in  Frankfurt.  This  has  special  importance  for  the  business  activities  of  the  banks  and  the  consultants,""  he  said.  Local  government  officials  in  Frankfurt's  state  of  Hessen  have  also  spoken  out  against  the  move.  ""It  is  our  wish  that  the  headquarters  stay  here  to  maintain  Frankfurt's  standing  as  the  number  one  financial  centre  in  continental  Europe,""  Alois  Rhiel,  its  minister  for  economic  affairs  added." 

2	"Labour  MP  praises  Tory  campaign  |||    The  Conservatives  have  been  ""a  lot  smarter""  in  the  way  they  have  conducted  the  general  election  campaign,  a  Labour  backbencher  has  said.  |||    Derek  Wyatt  said  having  a  five  month  campaign  ""turned  off  voters""  and  suggested  people  were  already  ""rather  bored  of  the  thing"".  He  wants  a  greater  campaigning  role  for  Chancellor  Gordon  Brown.  Labour  said  the  economy  was  at  the  heart  of  the  campaign  and  Mr  Brown  therefore  had  a  prominent  role.  But  Mr  Wyatt  argued:  ""By  some  way,  he  is  currently  the  figure  in  all  of  the  polls  that  people  trust  and  see  that  has  delivered  over  eight  years  an  economy  unmatched  anywhere  in  the  world.  ""So,  it  would  be  a  tad  foolish  of  the  Labour  Party  if  we  did  not  use  him  as  we  have  done  over  the  past  three  elections.""  |||    Labour's  election  chief  Alan  Milburn  denied  there  was  an  attempt  to  sideline  Mr  Brown  after  facing  criticism  for  letting  the  Tories  set  the  agenda.  However,  Mr  Wyatt  predicted  the  campaign  would  get  under  way  properly  once  the  chancellor  delivered  his  budget.  The  MP  for  Sittingbourne  and  Sheppey  said  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  had  been  ""trying  very  hard""  to  improve  his  own  standing  with  the  electorate  through  a  ""sort  of  campaign  of  trust"".  But  Mr  Blair  had  been  ""hurt""  by  the  Iraq  controversy,  he  added.  A  Labour  party  spokesman  played  down  differences  with  Mr  Wyatt  and  said  Mr  Brown  already  had  a  prominent  campaign  role.  ""This  election  is  a  choice  between  Labour  taking  Britain  forward  and  the  Conservatives  taking  us  back."""

0	"China  suspends  26  power  projects  |||    China  has  ordered  a  halt  to  construction  work  on  26  big  power  stations,  including  two  at  the  Three  Gorges  Dam,  on  environmental  grounds.  |||    The  move  is  a  surprising  one  because  China  is  struggling  to  increase  energy  supplies  for  its  booming  economy.  Last  year  24  provinces  suffered  black  outs.  The  State  Environmental  Protection  Agency  said  the  26  projects  had  failed  to  do  proper  environmental  assessments.  Topping  the  list  was  a  controversial  dam  on  the  scenic  upper  Yangtze  River.  ""Construction  of  these  projects  has  started  without  approval  of  the  assessment  of  their  environmental  impact...  they  are  typical  illegal  projects  of  construction  first,  approval  next,""  said  SEPA  vice-director  Pan  Yue,  in  a  statement  on  the  agency's  website.  |||    Some  of  the  projects  may  be  allowed  to  start  work  again  with  the  proper  permits,  but  others  would  be  cancelled,  he  said.  Altogether,  the  agency  ordered  30  projects  halted.  Other  projects  included  a  petrochemicals  plant  and  a  port  in  Fujian.  The  bulk  of  the  list  was  made  up  of  new  power  plants,  with  some  extensions  to  existing  ones.  The  stoppages  would  appear  to  be  another  step  in  the  central  government's  battle  to  control  projects  licensed  by  local  officials.  However,  previous  crackdowns  have  tended  to  focus  on  projects  for  which  the  government  argued  there  was  overcapacity,  such  as  steel  and  cement.  The  government  has  encouraged  construction  of  new  electricity  generating  capacity  to  solve  chronic  energy  shortages  which  forced  many  factories  onto  part-time  working  last  year.  In  2004,  China  increased  its  generating  capacity  by  12.6%,  or  440,700  megawatts  (MW).  The  biggest  single  project  to  be  halted  was  the  Xiluodi  Dam  project,  designed  to  produce  12,600  MW  of  electricity.  It  is  being  built  on  the  Jinshajiang  -  or  'river  of  golden  sand'  as  the  upper  reaches  of  the  Yangtze  are  known.  Second  and  third  on  the  agency's  list  were  two  power  stations  being  built  at  the  $22bn  Three  Gorges  Dam  project  on  the  central  Yangtze  -  an  underground  4,200  MW  power  plant  and  a  100  MW  plant.  |||    The  Three  Gorges  Dam  has  proved  controversial  in  China  -  where  more  than  half  a  million  people  have  been  relocated  to  make  way  for  it  -  and  abroad.  It  has  drawn  criticism  from  environmental  groups  and  overseas  human  rights  activists.  The  damming  of  the  Upper  Yangtze  has  also  begun  to  attract  criticism  from  environmentalists  in  China.  In  April  2004,  central  government  officials  ordered  a  halt  to  work  on  the  nearby  Nu  River,  which  is  part  of  a  United  Nations  world  heritage  site,  the  Three  Parallel  Rivers  site  which  covers  the  Yangtze,  Mekong  and  Nu  (also  known  as  the  Salween),  according  to  the  UK-published  China  Review.  That  move  reportedly  followed  a  protest  from  the  Thai  government  about  the  downstream  impact  of  the  dams,  and  a  critical  documentary  made  by  Chinese  journalists.  China's  energy  shortage  influenced  global  prices  for  oil,  coal  and  shipping  last  year." 

0	"Worldcom  ex-boss  launches  defence  |||    Lawyers  defending  former  WorldCom  chief  Bernie  Ebbers  against  a  battery  of  fraud  charges  have  called  a  company  whistleblower  as  their  first  witness.  |||    Cynthia  Cooper,  WorldCom's  ex-head  of  internal  accounting,  alerted  directors  to  irregular  accounting  practices  at  the  US  telecoms  giant  in  2002.  Her  warnings  led  to  the  collapse  of  the  firm  following  the  discovery  of  an  $11bn  (£5.7bn)  accounting  fraud.  Mr  Ebbers  has  pleaded  not  guilty  to  charges  of  fraud  and  conspiracy.  |||    Prosecution  lawyers  have  argued  that  Mr  Ebbers  orchestrated  a  series  of  accounting  tricks  at  WorldCom,  ordering  employees  to  hide  expenses  and  inflate  revenues  to  meet  Wall  Street  earnings  estimates.  But  Ms  Cooper,  who  now  runs  her  own  consulting  business,  told  a  jury  in  New  York  on  Wednesday  that  external  auditors  Arthur  Andersen  had  approved  WorldCom's  accounting  in  early  2001  and  2002.  She  said  Andersen  had  given  a  ""green  light""  to  the  procedures  and  practices  used  by  WorldCom.  Mr  Ebber's  lawyers  have  said  he  was  unaware  of  the  fraud,  arguing  that  auditors  did  not  alert  him  to  any  problems.  |||    Ms  Cooper  also  said  that  during  shareholder  meetings  Mr  Ebbers  often  passed  over  technical  questions  to  the  company's  finance  chief,  giving  only  ""brief""  answers  himself.  The  prosecution's  star  witness,  former  WorldCom  financial  chief  Scott  Sullivan,  has  said  that  Mr  Ebbers  ordered  accounting  adjustments  at  the  firm,  telling  him  to  ""hit  our  books"".  However,  Ms  Cooper  said  Mr  Sullivan  had  not  mentioned  ""anything  uncomfortable""  about  WorldCom's  accounting  during  a  2001  audit  committee  meeting.  Mr  Ebbers  could  face  a  jail  sentence  of  85  years  if  convicted  of  all  the  charges  he  is  facing.  WorldCom  emerged  from  bankruptcy  protection  in  2004,  and  is  now  known  as  MCI.  Last  week,  MCI  agreed  to  a  buyout  by  Verizon  Communications  in  a  deal  valued  at  $6.75bn." 

0	"Fed  chief  warning  on  US  deficit  |||    Federal  Reserve  chairman  Alan  Greenspan  has  warned  that  allowing  huge  US  budget  deficits  to  continue  could  have  ""severe""  consequences.  |||    Speaking  to  the  House  Budget  Committee  he  urged  Congress  to  take  action  to  cut  the  deficit,  such  as  increasing  taxes.  While  the  US  economy  is  growing  at  a  ""reasonably  good  pace""  he  warned  that  budget  concerns  were  clouding  the  economic  outlook  for  the  US.  Pension  and  healthcare  costs  posed  the  greatest  risks  to  the  economy,  he  said.  |||    The  government  program  faces  severe  financial  strains  in  coming  decades  as  the  massive  baby-boom  generation  retires.  ""I  fear  that  we  may  have  already  committed  more  physical  resources  to  the  baby-boom  generation  in  its  retirement  years  than  our  economy  has  the  capacity  to  deliver.  If  existing  promises  need  to  be  changed,  those  changes  should  be  made  sooner  rather  than  later,""  Mr  Greenspan  said.  He  also  warned  that  unless  the  nation  sees  unprecedented  rises  in  productivity  ""retirement  and  health  programmes  would  need  ""significant""  changes.  He  called  on  Congress  to  cut  promised  benefits  for  retirees,  as  the  promised  benefits  for  the  soon-to-retire  baby  boom  generation  were  much  larger  than  the  government  could  afford.  |||    Meanwhile  any  move  to  narrow  the  deficit  gap  by  raising  taxes  could  pose  a  significant  risk  to  the  economy  by  dampening  growth  and  spending,  he  added.  He  also  urged  Congress  to  reinstate  lapsed  rules  that  require  tax  cuts  and  spending  to  be  offset  elsewhere  in  the  budget  in  an  effort  to  prevent  the  US  heading  further  into  the  red.  Despite  the  dire  warnings,  Mr  Greenspan  did  offer  some  good  news  for  the  short  term.  As  US  growth  gathers  steam  and  incomes  rise  that  should  lead  to  a  narrowing  of  the  deficit.  Recent  increases  in  defence  and  homeland  security  spending  were  also  not  expected  to  continue  indefinitely,  which  should  cut  some  costs.  Since  President  George  W  Bush  came  to  office  the  federal  budget  has  swung  from  a  record  surplus  to  a  record  deficit  of  $412bn  last  year." 

1	"Hollywood  ready  for  Oscars  night  |||    Hollywood  is  preparing  for  the  biggest  night  in  the  film  world's  calendar,  the  77th  Academy  Awards,  on  Sunday.  |||    A  host  of  stars  are  expected  to  grace  the  red  carpet  outside  Los  Angeles'  Kodak  Theatre,  including  Johnny  Depp,  Cate  Blanchett  and  Leonardo  DiCaprio.  British  actors  in  attendance  include  nominees  Clive  Owen,  Imelda  Staunton,  Kate  Winslet  and  director  Mike  Leigh.  The  Aviator  leads  the  shortlist,  but  critics  believe  the  night  may  belong  to  Clint  Eastwood's  Million  Dollar  Baby.  A  recent  poll  of  US  pundits  found  Eastwood's  boxing  drama  had  become  the  new  favourite  to  win  best  film  over  the  Howard  Hughes  biopic.  |||    If  the  74-year-old  does  win,  he  will  become  the  oldest  person  ever  to  be  named  best  director  at  the  ceremony.  UK  critics  still  favour  The  Aviator  for  best  film,  but  believe  the  best  director  title  will  generate  a  close  fought  battle  between  Eastwood  and  Martin  Scorsese.  |||    Scorsese  has  never  won  the  best  director  prize,  despite  four  previous  nominations  for  films  including  Raging  Bull,  Goodfellas  and  Gangs  of  New  York.  Eastwood  has  won  best  director  once  before,  for  Unforgiven  in  1993.  Most  experts  predict  the  twice-nominated  Jamie  Foxx  will  win  best  actor  for  his  portrayal  of  singer  Ray  Charles,  while  Vera  Drake  star  Imelda  Staunton  looks  likely  to  lose  out  in  the  best  actress  field  to  Hilary  Swank  in  Million  Dollar  Baby.  The  UK's  highest  hopes  remain  with  Clive  Owen,  who  has  scooped  both  the  Golden  Globe  and  the  Bafta  for  his  supporting  role  in  Closer.  Actor  and  comedian  Chris  Rock  will  host  the  event,  which  will  be  broadcast  with  a  seven-second  time  delay  to  allow  censors  to  cut  out  any  unsuitable  content.  |||    ""We  have  the  bleep  machine  ready,  but  bleeps  will  be  used  as  needed,""  producer  Gil  Cates  told  reporters.  However,  he  added  that  he  strongly  disapproved  of  the  growing  tendency  to  censor  live  broadcasts  on  US  TV.  |||    He  also  played  down  fears  that  Rock,  who  is  known  for  using  strong  language  in  his  stand-up  routines,  might  cause  controversy  on  the  night.  The  40-year-old  comic  has  already  promised  not  to  swear  live  on  air  during  the  show.  ""Chris  has  a  sense  of  humour  and  everything  he  says  is  really  said  humorously,""  Cates  said.  ""You  need  a  movie  star  and  someone  who  is  a  stand-up  comic  so  they  can  deal  with  the  vicissitudes  of  the  show.""  Security  will  also  be  tight,  with  police  employing  a  system  to  detect  sarin  nerve  gas.  ""We  are  pulling  out  all  the  stops,""  said  John  Miller,  chief  of  counterterrorism  at  the  Los  Angeles  Police  Department.  The  show  is  ""a  symbol  of  American  culture  and  has  the  potential  to  be  a  high-visibility  target,""  he  added.  Meanwhile,  organisers  have  erected  a  canopy  over  the  red  carpet  following  an  outbreak  of  torrential  rain  in  Los  Angeles  over  the  past  week.  Cates  said  the  covers  would  be  removed  if  the  threat  of  wet  weather  receded.  Details  have  also  emerged  of  the  contents  of  this  year's  gift  bags,  which  are  given  to  nominees  and  presenters  on  the  night.  This  year's  bags  will  include  a  gift  certificate  for  a  luxury  beach  resort,  a  pair  of  mink  eyelashes  and  a  kitchen  set  with  a  year's  supply  of  tea  and  coffee.  The  event  will  be  televised  by  the  ABC  network  from  1700  local  time  (0100  GMT),  and  on  Sky  Movies  in  the  UK  from  0130  GMT."

""Bobby  Darin  was  one  of  the  greatest  entertainers  the  world  has  ever  known,  and  yet,  because  he  died  young,  he's  been  kind  of  forgotten,""  said  Spacey  at  the  premiere.  ""Making  this  film  was  the  most  fun  I've  ever  had  in  my  entire  life.""  The  movie  also  stars  British  actors  Bob  Hoskins  and  Brenda  Blethyn,  as  Darin's  mother." 

2	"Thousands  join  strike  in  Wales  |||    Thousands  of  civil  servants  were  on  strike  across  Wales  on  Friday  in  protest  at  planned  job  cuts.  |||    A  range  of  services  in  Wales  were  affected  as  civil  servants  in  Wales  joined  the  UK-wide  strike.  The  strike,  called  by  the  Public  and  Commercial  Services  Union,  was  the  biggest  by  civil  servants  in  a  decade.  The  action  follows  Chancellor  Gordon  Brown's  announcement  in  July  that  104,000  jobs  would  be  cut,  with  around  6,000  of  those  expected  in  Wales.  The  worst-affected  area  in  Wales  will  be  the  Department  of  Work  and  Pensions  where  2,000  jobs  are  threatened.  Across  Wales,  pickets  were  held  by  striking  civil  servants  with  protests  in  towns  and  cities  including  Cardiff,  Bangor,  Aberystwyth  and  Wrexham.  Gordon  Brown  issued  a  defiant  statement  about  the  strike,  saying  the  action  would  not  affect  the  government's  ""determination""  to  make  savings  in  order  to  increase  investment  in  healthcare,  education,  transport  and  the  fight  against  crime.  ""Our  decisions  mean  more  police,  more  teachers,  more  doctors  and  more  nurses,""  he  said.  ""We  will  provide  help  with  information,  relocation  and  retraining  to  help  staff  move  into  frontline  work  within  the  public  sector,  but  we  will  not  be  diverted  from  these  necessary  changes  so  that  we  can  make  this  essential  investment.""  The  UK-wide  action  hit  Jobcentres,  benefit  agencies,  pensions  offices  and  driving  test  centres.  The  strike  also  affected  the  Welsh  assembly  building  in  Cardiff  Bay,  where  only  pass-holders  were  allowed  in.  |||    Pickets  were  in  place  across  Wales,  with  protests  around  the  country.  PCS  Union  spokesman  Jeff  Evans  said:  ""In  Wales  the  civil  service  is  major  employer,  there  are  more  civil  servants  employed  in  Wales  proportionately  than  in  any  other  part  of  the  country.  ""Our  protest  is  about  defending  jobs  and  also  local  services  across  the  country.  ""Parts  of  Objective  One  areas  and  Welsh-speaking  areas  will  be  particularly  affected  by  these  cuts.""  The  chancellor  has  said  that  the  cuts  will  allow  funding  for  more  teachers  and  police.  Piers  Freelove  is  senior  benefit  officer  on  the  picket  line  at  Companies  House,  in  Cardiff.  He  said:  ""The  majority  of  people  have  decided  not  to  come  in  because  of  the  threat  to  their  jobs.  ""I  joined  the  civil  service  to  provide  services  as  well  as  get  a  decent  pension,  as  we  thought,  and  pay,  and  it's  those  services  that  are  being  threatened  as  well  as  our  jobs.  ""People  like  pensioners  need  a  face-to-face  service  not  an  impersonal  service  on  the  phone  which  is  what  they  want  to  impose.""  PCSU  deputy  general  secretary  Hugh  Lanning,  who  was  on  the  same  picket  line,  said:  ""We're  asking  for  them  to  negotiate  not  just  to  make  announcements.  ""There's  a  sensible  way  to  do  things  and  at  the  moment  they're  not  even  talking  about  how  to  go  about  it  sensibly.""  ""The  ballot  was  for  one  day's  action.  No  further  action  is  anticipated  without  a  further  ballot  of  staff.""  The  Welsh  Assembly  Government  said:  ""This  is  a  strike  about  national  civil  service  issues.  It  is  not  about  specific  issues  local  to  Wales  or  the  assembly."

Tony  Blair  has  also  said  he  is  intending  to  get  out  and  talk  to  as  many  people  as  possible  during  the  election  campaign.  But  Labour  campaign  chiefs  say  there  are  no  plans  for  Mr  Blair  to  hold  a  daily  news  conference.  |||    Mr  Fox  responded  by  accusing  the  prime  minister  of  ""hiding  away  from  the  scrutiny  of  London's  media"".  The  Liberal  Democrats  also  say  they  are  planning  to  hold  daily  news  conferences  with  Charles  Kennedy.  On  Mrs  Howard's  role,  Mr  Fox  said:  ""Sandra  has  already  been  campaigning  with  Michael  on  a  number  of  visits  and  has  been  undertaking  short  visits  herself.  ""That  pattern  will  continue.  It's  worked  very  well  up  until  now.""  Mrs  Howard  made  her  debut  speech  at  the  Conservative  Party  Conference  in  Bournemouth  last  October.  She  used  her  speech  on  the  fringe  to  highlight  the  work  of  a  drugs  charity,  Addaction,  which  she  supports.  Mrs  Howard  has  also  appeared  along  side  her  husband  on  TV  chat  shows.

Borussia  Dortmund  has  posted  record  losses  and  missed  rent  payments  on  its  Westfallen  stadium.  Chief  executive  Gerd  Niebaum  stepped  down  last  week  and  creditors  are  now  pushing  for  greater  control.  Shares  in  Borussia  Dortmund,  Germany's  only  stock-market  listed  football  club,  dropped  by  almost  23%  to  2.05  euros  during  early  afternoon  trading.  |||    Fund  manager  Florian  Hamm  -  Borussia  Dortmund's  largest  investor  -  said  he  would  only  invest  more  money  in  the  company  if  he  got  a  greater  say  in  how  it  is  run.  ""I  demand  better  transparency,""  he  is  quoted  as  saying  by  Germany's  Manger  Magazin.  The  club  has  also  faced  calls  to  appoint  executives  from  outside  the  club.  |||    Borussia  Dortmund  posted  a  record  loss  of  68m  euros  ($89m;  £47m)  in  the  12  months  through  June.  It  made  a  loss  of  27.2m  euros  in  the  first  half  of  the  current  fiscal  year  and  said  that  total  debts  will  increase  to  134.7m  euros  by  the  middle  of  2006  unless  a  restructuring  plan  is  pushed  through.  ""This  is  the  bill  for  their  mismanagement  over  the  past  years,""  said  HVB  analyst  Peter-Thilo  Halser.  The  club  appointed  an  auditor,  who  has  recommended  a  number  of  steps,  including  deferring  the  rent  due  on  the  stadium  and  suspending  debt  repayments  until  at  least  the  2006-2007  fiscal  year.  Stephen  Schechter,  a  UK  investment  banker  who  has  held  talks  with  Borussia  Dortmund  over  a  possible  bond  sale,  said  the  club  needs  a  capital  injection  of  35m  euros.  ""They  need  strong  people  on  the  board  who  do  not  have  a  history  with  the  club,""  he  said."

2	"Clarke  to  unveil  immigration  plan  |||    New  controls  on  economic  migrants  and  tighter  border  patrols  will  be  part  of  government  plans  unveiled  on  Monday.  |||    Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  wants  to  introduce  a  points  system  for  economic  migrants  and  increase  deportations  of  failed  asylum  seekers.  Tony  Blair  has  said  people  are  right  to  be  concerned  about  abuses  of  the  system  but  there  is  no  ""magic  bullet"".  The  Tories  say  Labour  is  acting  too  late  while  the  Lib  Dems  say  the  plans  may  not  produce  an  efficient  system.  |||    The  government's  new  five-year  plan  is  designed  to  show  how  Labour  would  reform  immigration  and  asylum  controls  if  it  wins  the  election,  expected  to  be  held  in  May.  Ministers  deny  they  have  been  spurred  into  action  by  Tory  campaigning  or  because  the  prime  minister  is  worried  too  little  has  been  done.  |||    Instead,  they  say  the  plans  are  part  of  an  ""evolving""  process  aimed  at  winning  public  confidence.  Mr  Clarke  is  expected  to  announce  an  end  to  the  automatic  right  to  settle  for  immigrants'  families,  and  the  introduction  of  fingerprinting  for  all  visa  applicants.  The  prime  minister  on  Sunday  said  immigration  would  be  ""toughened  up""  to  ensure  only  those  immigrants  with  skills  the  UK  really  needs  will  be  granted  work  permits.  But  he  rejected  the  Tories'  call  for  a  quota  on  economic  migrants,  saying  no  ""arbitrary  figure""  could  reflect  the  UK's  needs.  |||    Mr  Blair  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Westminster  Hour:  ""We  should  cut  the  number  or  increase  it  depending  on  the  country's  needs...  ""The  public  are  worried  about  this,  they  are  worried  rightly,  because  there  are  abuses  of  the  immigration  and  asylum  system.""  But  he  defended  the  UK's  current  regime,  saying  all  systems  around  the  world  were  subject  to  abuse.  Tory  proposals  to  cap  the  number  of  asylum  seekers  and  process  all  claims  abroad  would  not  work,  argued  Mr  Blair.  |||    He  said:  ""We  will  not  be...  pretending  there  is  some  simple  easy  way  of  processing  Britain's  asylum  seekers  in  some  other  country,  because  no  such  other  country  exists.""  Conservative  shadow  home  secretary  David  Davis  said  the  government  had  failed  to  remove  250,000  failed  asylum  seekers  from  the  UK  and  limits  on  economic  migrants  had  been  a  ""shambles"".  ""What  we  are  seeing  today  is  a  rather  panicky  response  from  the  government  after  eight  years  of  failure,""  he  said.  Liberal  Democrat  home  affairs  spokesman  Mark  Oaten  said  Labour  was  right  to  reject  the  Tories'  idea  of  quotas  on  asylum.  But  he  said  it  was  yet  to  be  seen  if  Mr  Clarke  could  deliver  ""a  fair  and  efficient  asylum  system""." 

0	"US  interest  rates  increased  to  2%  |||    US  interest  rates  are  to  rise  for  the  fourth  time  in  five  months,  in  a  widely  anticipated  move.  |||    The  Federal  Reserve  has  raised  its  key  federal  funds  rate  by  a  quarter  percentage  point  to  2%  in  light  of  mounting  evidence  that  the  US  economy  is  regaining  steam.  US  companies  created  twice  as  many  jobs  as  expected  in  October  while  exports  hit  record  levels  in  September.  Analysts  said  a  clear-cut  victory  for  President  Bush  in  last  week's  election  paved  the  way  for  a  rise.  Another  rise  could  be  in  store  for  December,  some  economists  warned.  |||    The  Fed's  Open  Market  Committee  -  which  sets  interest  rate  policy  in  the  US  -  voted  unanimously  in  favour  of  a  quarter  point  rise.  The  Fed  has  been  gradually  easing  rates  up  since  the  summer,  with  quarter  percentage  point  rises  in  June,  August  and  September.  |||    The  Central  Bank  has  been  acting  to  restrain  inflationary  pressures  while  being  careful  not  to  obstruct  economic  growth.  The  Fed  did  not  rule  out  raising  rates  once  again  in  December  but  noted  that  any  future  increases  would  take  place  at  a  ""measured""  pace.  In  a  statement,  the  Fed  said  that  long-term  inflation  pressures  remained  ""well  contained""  while  the  US  economy  appeared  to  be  ""growing  at  a  moderate  pace  despite  the  rise  in  energy  prices"".  Financial  analysts  broadly  welcomed  the  Fed's  move  and  shares  traded  largely  flat.  The  Dow  Jones  Industrial  average  closed  down  0.89  points,  or  0.01%,  at  10,385.48.  |||    Recent  evidence  has  pointed  to  an  upturn  in  the  US  economy.  US  firms  created  337,000  jobs  last  month,  twice  the  amount  expected,  while  exports  reached  record  levels  in  September.  The  economy  grew  3.7%  in  the  third  quarter,  slower  than  forecast,  but  an  improvement  on  the  3.3%  growth  seen  in  the  second  quarter.  Analysts  claimed  the  Fed's  assessment  of  future  economic  growth  was  a  positive  one  but  stressed  that  the  jury  was  still  out  on  the  prospect  of  a  further  rise  in  December.  |||    ""Let's  wait  until  we  see  how  growth  and  employment  bear  up  under  the  fourth  quarter's  energy  price  drag  before  concluding  that  the  Fed  has  more  work  to  do  in  2005,""  said  Avery  Shenfeld,  senior  economist  at  CIBC  World  Markets.  |||    ""I  think  the  Federal  Reserve  does  not  want  to  rock  the  boat  and  is  using  a  gradual  approach  in  raising  the  interest  rate,""  said  Sung  Won  Sohn,  chief  US  economist  for  Wells  Fargo  Bank.  ""The  economy  is  doing  a  bit  better  right  now  but  there  are  still  some  concerns  about  geopolitics,  employment  and  the  price  of  oil,""  he  added.  The  further  rise  in  US  rates  is  unlikely  to  have  a  direct  bearing  on  UK  monetary  policy.  The  Bank  of  England  (BoE)  has  kept  interest  rates  on  hold  at  4.75%  for  the  past  three  months,  leading  some  commentators  to  argue  that  rates  may  have  peaked.  In  a  report  published  on  Wednesday,  the  Bank  said  that  with  rates  at  their  current  level,  inflation  would  rise  to  its  2%  target  within  two  years.  However,  BoE  governor  Mervyn  King  warned  only  last  month  that  the  era  of  consistently  low  inflation  and  low  unemployment  may  be  coming  to  an  end." 

0	"Germany  calls  for  EU  reform  |||    German  Chancellor  Gerhard  Schroeder  has  called  for  radical  reform  of  the  EU's  stability  pact  to  grant  countries  more  flexibility  over  their  budget  deficits.  |||    Mr  Schroeder  said  existing  fiscal  rules  should  be  loosened  to  allow  countries  to  run  deficits  above  the  current  3%  limit  if  they  met  certain  criteria.  Writing  in  the  Financial  Times,  Mr  Schroeder  also  said  heads  of  government  should  have  a  greater  say  in  reforms.  Changes  to  the  pact  are  due  to  be  agreed  at  an  economic  summit  in  March.  |||    The  current  EU  rules  limit  the  size  of  a  eurozone  country's  deficit  to  3%  of  GDP.  Countries  which  exceed  the  threshold  are  liable  to  heavy  fines  by  the  European  Commission,  although  several  countries,  including  Germany,  have  breached  the  rules  consistently  since  2002  without  facing  punishment.  The  European  Commission  acknowledged  last  month  that  it  would  not  impose  sanctions  on  countries  who  break  the  rules.  |||    Mr  Schroeder  -  a  staunch  supporter  of  the  pact  when  it  was  set  up  in  the  1990s  -  said  exemptions  were  now  needed  to  take  into  account  the  cost  of  domestic  reform  programmes  and  changing  economic  conditions.  ""The  stability  pact  will  work  better  if  intervention  by  European  institutions  in  the  budgetary  sovereignty  of  national  parliaments  is  only  permitted  under  very  limited  conditions,""  he  wrote.  ""Only  if  their  competences  are  respected  will  the  member  states  be  willing  to  align  their  policies  more  consistently  with  the  economic  goals  of  the  EU.""  |||    Deficits  should  be  allowed  to  rise  above  3%,  Mr  Schroeder  argued,  if  countries  meet  several  ""mandatory  criteria"".  These  include  governments  which  are  adopting  costly  structural  reforms,  countries  which  are  suffering  economic  stagnation  and  nations  which  are  shouldering  ""special  economic  burdens"".  The  proposed  changes  would  make  it  harder  for  the  European  Commission  to  launch  infringement  action  against  any  state  which  breaches  the  pact's  rules.  Mr  Schroeder's  intervention  comes  ahead  of  a  meeting  of  the  12  Eurozone  finance  ministers  on  Monday  to  discuss  the  pact.  The  issue  will  also  be  discussed  at  Tuesday's  Ecofin  meeting  of  the  finance  ministers  of  all  25  EU  members.  Mr  Schroeder  also  called  for  heads  of  government  to  play  a  larger  role  in  shaping  reforms  to  the  pact.  A  number  of  EU  finance  ministers  are  believed  to  favour  only  limited  changes  to  the  eurozone's  rules."

Delta  is  restructuring  in  a  bid  to  fight  off  insolvency.  This  latest  move  to  boost  business  has  prompted  speculation  other  firms  will  be  forced  to  match  their  fares,  hurting  revenues  in  the  sector.  Delta's  new  SimpliFares  were  trialled  from  August  last  year  on  tickets  from  Cincinnati,  its  second-largest  hub.  |||    The  airline  says  no  one-way  economy  fare  will  now  be  priced  higher  than  $499  (£264),  and  no  first-class  fare  will  be  priced  higher  than  $599.  It  is  also  eliminating  a  Saturday-night  stay  requirement  on  discount  fares  and  will  give  further  reductions  to  customers  opting  for  non-refundable  tickets,  booking  in  advance  and  online.  Delta,  which  lost  $646m  in  the  three  months  to  September,  was  forced  to  cut  6,900  jobs  worldwide  as  part  of  its  aim  to  slash  $5bn  from  its  costs.  In  October,  it  reached  a  crucial  agreement  with  pilots  on  pay  and  conditions  and  it  has  also  issued  new  shares  to  staff  in  return  for  wage  cuts.  Airline  shares  closed  lower  on  the  announcement,  with  Delta,  Continental  and  American  Airlines  all  falling  by  more  than  7%.  ""We  believe  the  whole  airline  industry  will  now  have  to  move  in  this  direction;  this  will  likely  hurt  revenue  in  the  short  run  but  could  be  beneficial  in  the  long  run,""  said  analyst  Ray  Neidl  at  Calyon  Securities."

It  will  not  be  sold  in  the  US,  said  GM  Europe  president  Carl-Peter  Forster.  As  part  of  its  efforts  to  make  the  US  marque  appeal  to  European  drivers,  the  car  will  be  the  first  Cadillac  with  a  diesel  engine.  |||    GM's  announcement  should  go  some  way  to  allay  fears  of  the  Saab  factory's  closure.  The  factory  in  Trollhaettan  has  been  at  the  centre  of  rumours  about  GM's  planned  severe  cutbacks  in  its  troubled  European  operations.  But  the  group's  new  commitment  to  the  Swedish  factory  may  not  be  welcomed  by  the  group's  Opel  workers  in  Ruesselsheim,  Germany.  They  may  now  have  to  face  a  larger  proportion  of  GM's  cuts.  |||    Neither  will  the  announcement  be  seen  as  unalloyed  good  news  in  Sweden,  since  it  reflects  Saab's  failure  to  make  significant  inroads  into  the  lucrative  European  luxury  car  market.  For  years,  Saab  has  consistently  said  it  is  competing  head-on  with  BMW,  Mercedes  and  Jaguar.  The  segment's  leaders  do  not  agree.  |||    GM's  plans  to  build  the  American  marque  in  Sweden  is  part  of  its  efforts  to  push  it  as  an  alternative  luxury  brand  for  European  drivers.  In  the  US,  it  has  long  been  established  as  an  upmarket  brand  -  even  the  presidential  limousine  carries  the  badge.  Yet  it  could  prove  tough  for  Cadillac  to  steal  market  share  from  the  majors  in  Europe.  Other  luxury  car  makers,  most  notably  the  Toyota  subsidiary  Lexus,  have  enjoyed  tremendous  success  in  the  US  without  managing  to  make  significant  inroads  in  Europe.  There,  German  marques  Mercedes  Benz  and  BMW  have  retained  their  stranglehold  on  the  luxury  market.  |||    Bringing  Cadillac  production  to  Sweden  should  help  introduce  desperately-needed  scale  to  the  Saab  factory,  which  currently  produces  fewer  than  130,000  cars  per  year.  That  is  about  half  of  what  major  car  makers  consider  sufficient  numbers  for  profitable  operations,  and  Saab  is  losing  money  fast  -  albeit  with  losses  halved  in  2004  to  $200m  (£104m;  151m  euros)  from  $500m  the  previous  year.  Beyond  the  12,000  job  cuts  announced  last  year  at  its  European  operations,  GM  is  reducing  expenditure  by  building  Saabs,  Opels  -  badged  as  Vauxhalls  in  the  UK  -  and  now  Cadillacs  on  the  same  framework,  and  by  allowing  the  different  brands  to  share  parts.  Another  way  to  further  reduce  Saab's  losses  could  be  to  shift  some  of  the  production  of  Saabs  to  the  US,  a  market  where  drivers  have  adopted  it  as  an  upmarket  European  car.  Doing  so  would  remove  the  exposure  to  the  weak  US  dollar,  which  is  making  Saabs  more  expensive  to  US  consumers.  But  not  everyone  in  the  industry  agree  that  it  would  be  the  best  way  forward.  ""We  know  that  in  five  years  the  US  dollar  will  be  stronger  than  it  is  today,""  the  chief  executive  of  a  leading  European  car  maker  told  BBC  News.  The  current  trend  towards  US  production  was  ""stupid"",  he  said.  |||    In  a  separate  announcement,  GM  unveiled  a  new  scheme  to  allow  European  consumers  the  chance  to  test  drive  its  Opel  and  Vauxhall  models.  It  is  to  deploy  a  fleet  of  35,000  test  cars  across  40  countries,  inviting  potential  buyers  to  try  out  a  vehicle  for  24-hours.  It  follows  a  similar  initiative  by  GM  in  the  US.  GM  said  it  wanted  to  change  ""customers'  perceptions""  about  Opel  and  Vauxhall  cars,  showing  them  that  the  quality  had  improved  in  recent  years." 

2	"Cabinet  anger  at  Brown  cash  raid  |||    Ministers  are  unhappy  about  plans  to  use  Whitehall  cash  to  keep  council  tax  bills  down,  local  government  minister  Nick  Raynsford  has  acknowledged.  |||    Gordon  Brown  reallocated  £512m  from  central  to  local  government  budgets  in  his  pre-Budget  report  on  Thursday.  Mr  Raynsford  said  he  had  held  some  ""pretty  frank  discussions""  with  fellow  ministers  over  the  plans.  But  he  said  local  governments  had  to  deliver  good  services  without  big  council  tax  rises.  |||    The  central  government  cash  is  part  of  a  £1bn  package  to  help  local  authorities  in  England  keep  next  year's  council  tax  rises  below  5%,  in  what  is  likely  to  be  a  general  election  year.  |||    Mr  Raynsford  said  nearly  all  central  government  departments  had  an  interest  in  well  run  local  authorities.  And  he  confirmed  rows  over  the  issue  with  ministerial  colleagues.  ""Obviously  we  had  some  pretty  frank  discussions  about  this,""  he  told  BBC  Radio  4's  The  World  at  One.  But  he  said  there  was  a  recognition  that  ""a  good  settlement  for  local  government""  was  important  to  health,  education  and  ""other  government  departments"".  Ministers  had  to  be  sure  local  government  could  deliver  without  ""unreasonable  council  tax  increases"",  he  added.  Mr  Raynsford  dismissed  a  suggestion  the  move  was  designed  to  keep  council  taxes  down  ahead  of  an  expected  general  election.  |||    ""This  is  a  response  to  the  concerns  that  have  been  voiced  by  local  government  about  the  pressures  they  face.""  Mr  Raynsford  also  plans  to  make  savings  of  £100m  by  making  changes  to  local  government  pensions  schemes.  These  would  raise  the  age  from  which  retiring  workers  could  claim  their  pensions  and  limit  how  much  they  received  if  they  retired  early.  He  insisted  the  changes  were  ""very  modest""  and  designed  to  tackle  the  problem  of  workers  retiring  ""very  early"".  But  general  secretary  of  the  public  services  union  Unison  Dave  Prentis  criticised  the  plans.  ""If  you  want  world  class  public  services  you  don't  get  that  by  hitting  people  as  they  approach  retirement."""

1	"Bollywood  draws  global  stars  |||    British  actress  Antonia  Bernath  is  making  her  debut  in  Kisna  -  the  Warrior  Poet,  marking  a  growing  trend  for  non-Indian  stars  to  appear  in  Bollywood  films.  |||    Directed  by  Bollywood  veteran  Subhash  Ghai,  the  film  is  set  in  the  British  Raj  and  Bernath  plays  an  army  general's  daughter  who  falls  in  love  with  a  rural  boy,  Kisna.  ""I  liked  the  fluid  nature  of  film-making.  We  improvised  quite  a  lot,""  says  Bernath.  ""At  times  it  felt  very  chaotic  but  Mr  Ghai  was  quite  clear  about  what  he  wanted.""  Picked  from  more  than  200  girls  in  an  audition  in  London,  Bernath  cut  short  her  education  at  Bristol's  Old  Vic  Theatre  School  to  take  up  the  opportunity.  It  is  not  often  that  somebody  gets  to  play  the  lead  role  straight  out  of  a  drama  school.  She  spent  three  weeks  learning  Hindi  and  taking  dance  lessons.  ""Initially,  I  was  a  bit  sceptical  about  how  people  would  respond  to  me,""  Bernath  says.  ""But  I  found  the  Hindi  film  industry  very  warm  and  encouraging.  I  even  had  a  few  offers  before  the  work  on  Kisna  was  completed.""  |||    Films  are  one  of  India's  biggest  exports  and  those  like  Lagaan  and  Monsoon  Wedding  have  broken  the  traditional  boundaries  of  colour  and  culture.  Spurred  by  this,  Bollywood  producers  are  trying  to  go  global  in  all  aspects  of  film-making,  be  it  technical  or  artistic.  |||    From  young  heart-throbs  like  Nick  Moran  of  Lock,  Stock  and  Two  Smoking  Barrels  to  model  Sophie  Dahl,  many  non-Indian  stars  want  to  make  the  most  of  this  opportunity.  ""Bollywood  has  truly  gone  global,""  says  Taran  Adarsh,  editor  of  Indian  film  journal  Trade  Guide.  ""Directors  are  now  attempting  to  woo  non-Asian  audience  to  increase  their  share  in  the  overseas  film  market.""  Kisna  has  been  shot  simultaneously  in  Hindi  and  English,  with  the  English  print  shortened  by  an  hour  to  accommodate  the  Western  audience.  The  film  even  has  a  song  composed  in  English  by  AR  Rahman,  the  director  of  the  popular  West  End  musical,  Bombay  Dreams.  ""Identification  is  a  popular  cinematic  device.  Use  of  European  or  American  actors  can  be  viewed  as  a  step  in  that  direction,""  says  Adarsh.  |||    The  cast  of  Kisna  also  includes  British  actors  Michael  Maloney,  Caroline  Langrishe  and  Polly  Adams.  |||    Another  actress,  Annabelle  Wallace,  plays  the  lead  role  in  a  bilingual  romantic  comedy  Dil  Jo  Bhi  Kahey  (Whatever  the  Heart  Says),  which  also  stars  Indian  screen  legend  Amitabh  Bachchan.  Actor  and  Producer  Aamir  Khan's  forthcoming  venture  The  Rising  is  set  against  the  backdrop  of  the  Indian  mutiny  of  1857,  with  British  actor  Toby  Stephens  in  a  key  role.  But  it  isn't  only  the  Western  actors  looking  eastwards.  Bollywood  sweetheart  Aishwarya  Rai,  recently  seen  in  Bride  and  Prejudice  alongside  New  Zealand  actor  Martin  Henderson,  is  building  her  international  career.  And,  many  other  Bollywood  stars  have  their  eyes  set  on  Hollywood.  ""Hollywood  or  Bollywood,  it's  the  box  office  that  determines  whether  something  is  a  passing  phase  or  a  trend,""  says  Adarsh.  |||    Kisna  -  the  Warrior  Poet  opens  in  the  UK  on  21  January." 

1	"Musicians  to  tackle  US  red  tape  |||    Musicians'  groups  are  to  tackle  US  visa  regulations  which  are  blamed  for  hindering  British  acts'  chances  of  succeeding  across  the  Atlantic.  |||    A  singer  hoping  to  perform  in  the  US  can  expect  to  pay  $1,300  (£680)  simply  for  obtaining  a  visa.  Groups  including  the  Musicians'  Union  are  calling  for  an  end  to  the  ""raw  deal""  faced  by  British  performers.  US  acts  are  not  faced  with  comparable  expense  and  bureaucracy  when  visiting  the  UK  for  promotional  purposes.  |||    Nigel  McCune  from  the  Musicians'  Union  said  British  musicians  are  ""disadvantaged""  compared  to  their  US  counterparts.  A  sponsor  has  to  make  a  petition  on  their  behalf,  which  is  a  form  amounting  to  nearly  30  pages,  while  musicians  face  tougher  regulations  than  athletes  and  journalists.  ""If  you  make  a  mistake  on  your  form,  you  risk  a  five-year  ban  and  thus  the  ability  to  further  your  career,""  says  Mr  McCune.  |||    ""The  US  is  the  world's  biggest  music  market,  which  means  something  has  to  be  done  about  the  creaky  bureaucracy,""  says  Mr  McCune.

The  MMF's  general  secretary  James  Seller  said:  ""Imagine  if  you  were  an  orchestra  from  the  Orkneys?  Every  member  would  have  to  travel  to  London  to  have  their  visas  processed.""  |||    ""The  US  market  is  seen  as  the  holy  grail  and  one  of  the  benchmarks  of  success,  and  we're  still  going  to  fight  to  get  in  there.

A  close  ally  of  the  ex-Yukos  boss,  Mr  Nevzlin  is  currently  based  in  Israel.  Mr  Khodorkovsky  handed  over  his  stake  after  the  forced  sale  of  Yukos'  core  oil  production  unit,  Yuganskneftegaz  to  pay  a  giant  tax  bill.  |||    Yuganskneftegaz  was  sold  off  at  auction  in  December  last  year,  eventually  falling  into  the  hands  of  state  oil  firm  Rosneft  in  a  deal  worth  $9.4bn  (£5bn).  ""Since  the  sale  of  Yuganskneftegaz,  I  have  been  delivered  of  (all)  responsibility  for  the  business  that  remains  and  the  group's  money  as  a  whole,""  Mr  Khodorkovsky  said.  ""It  is  all  over.  As  before,  I  see  my  future  in  public  activity  to  build  a  civil  society  in  Russia.""  Mr  Nevzlin  is  Yukos'  largest  shareholder  but  is  living  in  self-imposed  exile  in  Israel.  Yuganskneftegaz  pumps  around  1  million  barrels  of  oil  a  day.  It  was  sold  by  the  Russian  authorities  to  recover  government  tax  claims  against  Yukos  totalling  over  $27bn.  Previously  considered  to  be  Russia's  richest  man,  with  an  estimated  fortune  of  $15bn,  Mr  Khodorkovsky  is  currently  on  trial  for  fraud  and  tax  evasion  following  his  arrest  in  October  2003.  However,  the  charges  are  widely  seen  as  politically  motivated  and  part  of  a  drive  by  Russian  President  Vladimir  Putin  to  rein  in  the  country's  super-rich  business  leaders,  the  so-called  oligarchs.  It  is  also  believed  that  Mr  Khodorkovsky  was  particularly  targeted  because  he  had  started  to  bankroll  political  opponents  of  Mr  Putin." 

0	"Economy  'stronger  than  forecast'  |||    The  UK  economy  probably  grew  at  a  faster  rate  in  the  third  quarter  than  the  0.4%  reported,  according  to  Bank  of  England  deputy  governor  Rachel  Lomax.  |||    Private  sector  business  surveys  suggest  a  stronger  economy  than  official  estimates,  Ms  Lomax  said.  Other  surveys  collectively  show  a  rapid  slowdown  in  UK  house  price  growth,  she  pointed  out.  This  means  that  despite  a  strong  economic  growth,  base  rates  will  probably  stay  on  hold  at  4.75%.  Official  data  comes  from  the  Office  for  National  Statistics  (ONS).  Though  reliable,  ONS  data  takes  longer  to  publish,  so  now  the  BoE  is  calling  for  faster  delivery  of  data  so  it  can  make  more  effective  policy  decisions.  ""Recent  work  by  the  Bank  has  shown  that  private  sector  surveys  add  value,  even  when  preliminary  ONS  estimates  are  available,""  Ms  Lomax  said  in  a  speech  to  the  North  Wales  Business  Club.  |||    The  ONS  is  due  to  publish  its  second  estimate  of  third  quarter  growth  on  Friday.  ""The  MPC  judges  that  overall  growth  was  a  little  higher  in  the  third  quarter  than  the  official  data  currently  indicate,""  Ms  Lomax  said.  The  Bank  said  successful  monetary  policy  depends  on  having  good  information.  Rachel  Lomax  cited  the  late  1980s  as  an  example  of  a  time  when  weak  economic  figures  were  published,  but  substantially  revised  upwards  years  later.  |||    ""The  statistical  fog  surrounding  the  true  state  of  the  economy  has  proved  a  particularly  potent  breeding  ground  for  policy  errors  in  the  past,""  she  said.  Improving  the  quality  of  national  statistics  is  the  single  the  best  way  of  making  sure  the  Monetary  Policy  Committee  (MPC)  makes  the  right  decisions,  she  said.  The  Bank  of  England  is  working  in  tandem  with  the  ONS  to  improve  the  quality  and  speed  of  delivery  of  data.  Her  remarks  follow  criticism  from  the  House  of  Lords  Economic  Affairs  Committee,  which  said  the  MPC  had  held  interest  rates  too  high  given  that  inflation  was  way  below  the  2%  target.  |||    A  slowdown  in  the  housing  market  and  this  year's  surge  in  oil  prices  has  made  economic  forecasting  all  the  more  tricky,  leading  to  a  more  uncertain  outlook.  ""This  year  rising  oil  prices  and  a  significant  slowdown  in  the  housing  market  have  awoken  bad  memories  of  the  1970s  and  1980s,""  Ms  Lomax  said.  ""The  MPC  will  be  doing  well  if  it  can  achieve  the  same  stability  over  the  next  decade  as  we  have  enjoyed  over  the  past  10  years.""  Decisions  on  interest  rates  are  made  after  the  MPC  gathers  together  the  range  of  indicators  available  every  month.  The  clearest  signals  come  when  all  indicators  are  pointing  the  same  direction,  Ms  Lomax  intimated.  ""In  economic  assessment,  there  is  safety  in  numbers.""" 

3	"Chelsea  denied  by  James  heroics  |||    A  brave  defensive  display,  led  by  keeper  David  James,  helped  Manchester  City  hold  the  leaders  Chelsea.  |||    After  a  quiet  opening,  James  denied  Damien  Duff,  Jiri  Jarosik  and  Mateja  Kezman,  while  Paul  Bosvelt  cleared  William  Gallas'  header  off  the  line.  Robbie  Fowler  should  have  scored  for  the  visitors  but  sent  his  header  wide.  Chelsea  had  most  of  the  possession  in  the  second  half  but  James  kept  out  Frank  Lampard's  free-kick  and  superbly  tipped  the  same  player's  volley  wide.  City  went  into  the  game  with  the  proud  record  of  being  the  only  domestic  team  to  beat  Chelsea  this  season.  And  there  was  little  to  alarm  them  in  the  first  30  minutes  as  Chelsea  -  deprived  of  Arjen  Robben  and  Didier  Drogba  through  injury  -  struggled  to  pose  much  of  a  threat.  Indeed,  it  was  the  visitors  who  looked  likelier  to  enliven  a  drab  opening  played  at  a  lethargic  pace.  Shaun  Wright-Phillips  -  watched  by  England  boss  Sven-Goran  Eriksson  -  showed  his  customary  trickery  to  burst  into  the  right  of  the  area  and  deliver  a  dangerous  ball,  which  was  blocked  by  John  Terry.  But  Chelsea  suddenly  stepped  up  a  gear  and  created  a  flurry  of  chances.  First,  Duff  got  round  Ben  Thatcher  and  blasted  in  a  shot  that  James  parried  to  Kezman,  who  turned  the  ball  wide.  |||    Soon  afterwards,  Jarosik  found  space  in  the  area  to  powerfully  head  Lampard's  corner  goalwards  but  James  tipped  the  ball  over.  Chelsea  were  now  looking  more  like  Premiership  leaders  and  James  kept  out  Kezman's  fierce  drive  before  Bosvelt  and  James  combined  to  clear  Gallas'  header  from  Duff's  corner.  City  broke  swiftly  up  the  field  and  the  last  chance  of  a  frenetic  spell  should  have  resulted  in  Fowler  celebrating  his  150th  Premiership  goal.  Wright-Phillips  raced  down  the  left  and  crossed  to  Fowler  but  City's  lone  man  up  front,  left  free  by  Terry's  slip,  contrived  to  head  wide  when  it  seemed  a  breakthrough  was  certain.  The  second  half  started  as  quietly  as  the  first,  although  James  was  forced  to  divert  a  cross  from  the  lively  Duff  away  from  Eidur  Gudjohnsen's  path.  There  was  a  nasty  moment  for  Petr  Cech,  looking  for  a  ninth  straight  clean  sheet  in  the  league,  when  a  series  of  ricochets  saw  Fowler  chase  a  loose  ball  in  the  area  and  collide  accidently  with  the  Czech  Republic  stopper.  Another  quiet  spell  followed,  which  Duff  interrupted  with  a  surging  run  that  was  halted  illegally  on  the  edge  of  the  penalty  area  by  Bosvelt.  Lampard  stepped  up  to  blast  a  shot  through  the  wall  and  James  somehow  blocked  it  with  his  legs.  Another  timely  challenge,  this  time  from  Richard  Dunne  in  time  added  on,  prevented  Gudjohnsen  from  getting  in  a  shot.  There  was  still  time  for  James  to  produce  a  sensational  save  to  tip  Lampard's  volley  round  the  post.  |||    Cech,  Paulo  Ferreira,  Gallas,  Terry,  Bridge,  Jarosik  (Tiago  56),  Lampard,  Makelele,  Duff,  Gudjohnsen,  Kezman  (Cole  63).  |||    Subs  Not  Used:  Johnson,  Smertin,  Cudicini.  |||    Makelele,  Gudjohnsen.  |||    James,  Mills,  Distin,  Dunne,  Thatcher,  Shaun  Wright-Phillips,  Bosvelt,  Barton,  Sibierski  (McManaman  85),  Musampa,  Fowler.  |||    Subs  Not  Used:  Macken,  Weaver,  Onuoha,  Jordan.  |||    Bosvelt.  |||    42,093  |||    H  Webb  (S  Yorkshire)."

He  warned  the  BBC  that  attacking  Mr  Campbell  had  brought  it  trouble  before.  That  was  a  reference  to  the  Hutton  inquiry  following  a  BBC  story  claiming  Downing  Street  ""sexed  up""  Iraq's  weapons  of  mass  destruction  dossier.  |||    The  affair  prompted  the  resignation  of  BBC  chairman  Gavyn  Davies,  director-general  Greg  Dyke  and  reporter  Andrew  Gilligan.  Labour  has  attracted  media  criticism  for  using  new  freedom  of  information  laws  to  dig  up  information  about  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard's  past.  |||    Mr  Mandelson,  a  former  Labour  communications  director,  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme:  ""I  understand  why  the  Tories  will  be  gunning  for  Alastair  Campbell  because  they  fear  his  campaigning  skills.  ""What  I  understand  less  is  why  the  BBC  should  be  joining  with  the  Tories  in  driving  that  agenda.  ""In  my  experience  of  these  things,  parties  which  shout  about  dirty  tricks  and  the  like  tend  to  do  so  because  they  fear  a  direct  hit  in  some  vulnerable  part  of  their  political  anatomy.  ""I  suggest  the  BBC  concentrates  on  the  issues  and  helps  the  public  to  understand  the  policies  and  the  choices  that  are  at  stake  in  the  election  rather  than  engages  in  the  process  politics,  the  trivialisation  of  the  campaign.  ""I  think  the  BBC  would  be  much  better  advised  to  leave  all  this  stuff  well  alone,  concentrate  on  the  issues  as  I  say,  not  resume  their  demonisation  of  Alastair  Campbell  -  we  all  know  where  that  led  before.""  |||    Mr  Campbell  is  acting  as  an  adviser  for  Labour,  which  denies  engaging  in  personal  campaigning.  Conservative  co-chairman  Liam  Fox  said  Mr  Campbell's  return  and  Labour  poster  plans  attacking  Mr  Howard  -  recently  withdrawn  from  the  party's  website  -  were  a  sign  of  ""abusive  politics"".  ""The  government,  despite  the  fact  that  they  would  say  want  to  go  forward,  not  back,  seem  intent  on  talking  about  history  rather  than  their  own  record  or  even  more  importantly,  about  the  future,""  he  said  on  Sunday.  Labour  peer  Baroness  Kennedy,  who  is  chairing  the  Power  Inquiry  into  political  disengagement,  said  people  already  thought  politicians  engaged  in  dirty  tricks.  ""This  feeling  of  distrust  is  going  to  be  enlarged  if  this  campaigning  on  all  sides  is  conducted  in  the  way  that  it  looks  as  if  it  just  might,""  she  said." 

1	"Johnny  Cash  manager  Holiff  dies  |||    The  former  manager  of  Johnny  Cash,  Saul  Israel  Holiff,  has  died  at  the  age  of  79,  his  family  said.  |||    Mr  Holiff,  who  was  also  a  concert  promoter,  managed  Cash's  career  between  1960  and  1973,  quitting  when  he  thought  the  singer's  career  had  peaked.  ""I  was  guilty  for  underestimating  him  repeatedly,""  he  once  said.  The  Canadian  music  manager,  who  also  managed  Tommy  Hunter  and  the  Statler  Brothers,  had  been  in  declining  health,  according  to  his  family.  An  entrepreneur  from  an  early  age,  Mr  Holiff  served  as  a  rear  air  gunner  in  the  Royal  Canadian  Air  Force  during  World  War  II,  afterwards  setting  up  a  drive-in  restaurant.  He  briefly  dabbled  in  acting,  before  setting  up  offices  in  Nashville  and  Los  Angeles  for  his  concert  and  artist  promotion  business.  In  1970,  RPM  weekly  magazine  presented  Holiff  with  a  special  award  as  the  Canadian  music  industry's  man  of  the  year.  Mr  Holiff  retired  when  he  was  in  his  late  40s,  returning  to  education  as  a  mature  student  at  the  University  of  Victoria,  where  he  graduated  with  a  degree  in  history.  He  passed  away  on  17  March.  According  to  his  wishes,  there  will  be  no  funeral  service." 

2	"Guantanamo  man  'suing  government'  |||    A  British  terror  suspect  held  in  Guantanamo  Bay  for  33  months  plans  to  sue  the  government,  it  is  reported.  |||    Martin  Mubanga  claimed  in  the  Observer  that  an  MI6  officer  played  a  key  role  in  consigning  him  to  the  US  camp  in  Cuba,  following  his  arrest  in  Zambia.  Mr  Mubanga,  32,  from  Wembley,  London,  said  he  was  brutally  interrogated  and  daubed  with  urine  at  the  camp.  The  home  secretary  said  he  would  not  be  launching  an  investigation  and  that  the  media  reports  were  not  ""well  informed"".  Mr  Mubanga,  who  has  dual  British  and  Zambian  nationality,  was  one  of  four  Britons  who  were  released  from  the  US  camp  in  January.  |||    He  said  he  was  sent  there  after  being  interrogated  by  a  British  man  who  said  he  was  from  MI6,  shortly  after  his  arrest  in  Zambia  in  March  2002.  Mr  Mubanga  said  he  had  been  in  Afghanistan  and  Pakistan  to  study  Islam.  But  he  said  he  was  unable  to  return  to  the  UK  because  he  had  lost  his  British  passport,  and  was  travelling  on  his  Zambian  passport  instead.  Mr  Mubanga  said  the  ""MI6  agent""  told  him  the  passport  had  been  found  in  a  cave  in  Afghanistan  along  with  documents  listing  Jewish  groups  in  New  York  and  suggested  he  had  been  on  an  al-Qaeda  reconnaissance  mission.  Mr  Mubanga  said  the  man,  and  an  American  female  defence  official,  tried  to  recruit  him  as  an  agent,  but  he  refused  and  within  three  weeks  was  told  he  would  be  sent  to  Guantanamo  Bay.  |||    His  lawyer  Louise  Christian  said:  ""'We  are  hoping  to  issue  proceedings  for  the  misfeasance  of  officials  who  colluded  with  the  Americans  in  effectively  kidnapping  him  and  taking  him  to  Guantanamo.""  And  Menzies  Campbell,  the  Liberal  Democrats'  foreign  affairs  spokesman,  said  it  was  vital  to  establish  whether  ministers  approved  Mr  Mubanga's  transfer  to  Guantanamo.  But  a  Foreign  Office  spokesman  said  he  could  not  comment  on  the  activities  of  British  intelligence  or  security  agencies.  And  Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  told  BBC  One's  Breakfast  with  Frost:  ""I'm  not  organising  a  specific  investigation  into  it.""  Mr  Mubanga  is  the  first  of  the  four  detainees  freed  last  month  to  give  a  media  interview.  He  told  the  Observer  his  worst  moment  was  when  he  was  told  he  would  be  released  last  March,  only  to  be  confined  and  told  he  would  be  there  for  many  more  years.  |||    He  claimed  he  was  stripped  of  his  clothes  and  mattress  and  forced  to  remain  in  an  empty  metal  box,  naked  except  for  boxer  shorts.  And  he  said  an  interrogator  used  a  mop  to  daub  him  with  his  own  urine  while  he  was  chained  hand  and  foot.  Mr  Mubanga,  who  insists  he  does  not  feel  bitter,  said:  ""I've  lost  three  years  of  my  life,  because  I  was  a  Muslim.  He  added:  ""The  authorities  wanted  to  break  me  but  they  strengthened  me.  They've  made  me  what  I  am  -  even  if  I'm  not  quite  sure  yet  who  that  person  is.""  The  US  government  denied  the  claims,  saying  it  condemned  and  prohibited  torture.  In  a  statement,  it  said:  ""The  Department  of  Defense  has  no  doubt  that  Mr  Mubanga  was  properly  detained  as  an  enemy  combatant  under  the  laws  of  war.  ""He  was  detained  to  prevent  him  from  fighting  against  the  US  and  our  allies  in  the  war  on  terror.""  But  Fair  Trials  Abroad  director  Stephen  Jakobi  said  there  were  similarities  between  Mr  Mubanga's  account  and  those  of  other  Guantanamo  detainees.  He  said:  ""The  pattern  is  the  same.  The  real  problem  is  the  concentration  camp  conditions  in  Guantanamo.  ""Is  [Charles  Clarke]  really  pretending  this  is  all  made  up?""  Mr  Mubanga  and  the  three  other  freed  British  detainees  were  released  without  charge  by  UK  police  on  their  return  from  Cuba."

The  gain  in  non-farm  payrolls  was  below  market  expectations  of  190,000  new  jobs.  Nevertheless  it  was  enough  to  push  down  the  unemployment  rate  to  5.2%,  its  lowest  level  since  September  2001.  The  job  gains  mean  that  President  Bush  can  celebrate  -  albeit  by  a  very  fine  margin  -  a  net  growth  in  jobs  in  the  US  economy  in  his  first  term  in  office.  He  presided  over  a  net  fall  in  jobs  up  to  last  November's  Presidential  election  -  the  first  President  to  do  so  since  Herbert  Hoover.  As  a  result,  job  creation  became  a  key  issue  in  last  year's  election.  However,  when  adding  December  and  January's  figures,  the  administration's  first  term  jobs  record  ended  in  positive  territory.  |||    The  Labor  Department  also  said  it  had  revised  down  the  jobs  gains  in  December  2004,  from  157,000  to  133,000.  |||    Analysts  said  the  growth  in  new  jobs  was  not  as  strong  as  could  be  expected  given  the  favourable  economic  conditions.  ""It  suggests  that  employment  is  continuing  to  expand  at  a  moderate  pace,""  said  Rick  Egelton,  deputy  chief  economist  at  BMO  Financial  Group.  ""We  are  not  getting  the  boost  to  employment  that  we  would  have  got  given  the  low  value  of  the  dollar  and  the  still  relatively  low  interest  rate  environment.""  ""The  economy  is  producing  a  moderate  but  not  a  satisfying  amount  of  job  growth,""  said  Ken  Mayland,  president  of  ClearView  Economics.  ""That  means  there  are  a  limited  number  of  new  opportunities  for  workers."""

3	"Owen  delighted  with  Real  display  |||    Michael  Owen  revelled  in  his  return  to  the  to  the  Real  Madrid  starting  line-up  and  inspired  a  3-1  win  over  Real  Betis  on  Wednesday  by  scoring  the  first  goal.  |||    He  said:  ""I  am  happy  I  could  play  a  game  from  the  start  again.  ""I  felt  good  all  though  the  game  and  it  is  obvious  that  I  am  happy  to  have  scored  another  goal.  ""People  have  talked  a  lot  about  my  performances  and  I  think  I  have  had  some  months  that  were  not  so  good  and  others  that  were  very  good.""  Owen,  starting  his  third  successive  La  Liga  match,  converted  a  low  cross  from  Santiago  Solari.  Robert  Carlos  made  it  2-0  at  the  break,  smashing  home  an  indirect  free-kick.  Midfielder  Edu  reduced  the  deficit  after  half-time  but  Ivan  Helguera  headed  past  keeper  Antonio  Doblas  to  seal  victory  for  his  team.  Victory  took  Real  to  within  six  points  of  leaders  Barcelona  and  Owen  is  confident  Real  can  close  the  gap.  He  added:  ""We  had  several  chances  against  Betis  and  I  think  we  can  get  back  in  touch  with  Barcelona.  ""It  is  only  six  points  between  Barcelona  and  us  and  that  is  nothing.  If  we  can  beat  them  at  the  Bernabeu  (on  10  April),  then  it  will  be  just  three.""  Owen  has  scored  nine  league  goals,  one  behind  Real's  top  scorer  Ronaldo.  Real  had  lost  their  previous  two  league  games."

The  pair  claim  they  are  being  punished  by  the  authorities  for  the  political  ambitions  of  Mr  Khodorkovsky.  Mr  Lebedev  said  there  were  ""absurd  contradictions""  in  the  case.  Opening  his  defence,  he  said  he  could  not  see  the  legal  basis  of  the  charges  he  faced,  which  also  include  allegations  of  tax  evasion.  ""To  my  embarrassment,  I  could  not  understand  the  file  of  complaints  against  me,""  he  told  a  Moscow  court.  Mr  Lebedev  headed  the  Menatep  group,  the  parent  company  of  Yukos.  |||    Mr  Lebedev  and  Mr  Khodorkovsky,  who  each  face  a  possible  10  year  jail  sentence  if  convicted,  will  be  questioned  by  a  judge  over  the  next  few  days.  Mr  Khodorkovsky  began  his  testimony  last  week,  telling  the  court  that  he  objected  to  the  way  that  the  ""running  of  a  normal  business  has  been  presented  as  a  work  of  criminal  fiction"".  The  charges  are  seen  by  supporters  as  politically  motivated  and  part  of  a  drive  by  Russian  President  Vladimir  Putin  to  rein  in  the  country's  super-rich  business  leaders,  the  so-called  oligarchs.  Yukos  has  been  presented  with  a  $27.5bn  (£13bn)  tax  demand  by  the  Russian  authorities  and  its  key  Yugansk  division  was  auctioned  off  to  part  settle  the  bill.  The  company's  effort  to  gain  bankruptcy  protection  in  the  US  -  in  a  bid  to  win  damages  for  the  sale  -  were  dismissed  by  a  court  in  Texas." 

2	"Kinnock  to  urge  reform  in  Lords  |||    Neil  Kinnock  has  said  his  acceptance  of  a  seat  in  the  House  of  Lords  will  allow  him  to  help  ""achieve  further  progress  with  substantial  democratic  reform.""  |||    On  the  BBC's  Breakfast  with  Frost  it  was  put  to  Mr  Kinnock  that  he  had  once  referred  to  Lords  members  as  ""brigands,  muggers,  bribers  and  gangsters"".  But  the  outgoing  European  Commissioner  said  his  comments  -  made  some  26  years  ago  -  needed  to  be  put  in  context.  He  said  advocates  for  reform  needed  to  be  inside  the  Lords  to  vote  for  it.  ""It  was  pointed  out  to  me  that  if  the  additional  democratic  reform  is  going  to  take  place  it  is  going  to  require  advocates  in  the  Lords  and  people  there  willing  to  vote  for  it.""  |||    Mr  Kinnock  added  that  the  second  factor  behind  his  acceptance  of  the  peerage  was  his  appointment  as  chairman  of  the  British  Council.  ""History  demonstrates  that  it's  immensely  useful  for  the  British  Council  to  have  its  chairman  in  the  House  of  Lords  and  that  was  a  conclusive  factor.""  Mr  Kinnock  said  he  thought  about  the  decision  for  ""quite  a  long  time""  because  he  had  long  had  reservations  about  the  Lords.  But  he  added:  ""The  process  of  reform  has  developed  substantially  but  not  sufficiently,  and  consequently  I  did  take  all  these  factors  into  consideration  because  it's  not  a  decision  to  be  made  glibly.""  The  former  Labour  leader  said  he  would  probably  take  the  title  of  Lord  Kinnock  of  Bedwellty  -  his  first  constituency  for  which  he  was  selected  in  1969." 

0	"Fosters  buys  stake  in  winemaker  |||    Australian  brewer  Fosters  has  bought  a  large  stake  in  Australian  winemaker  Southcorp,  sparking  rumours  of  a  possible  takeover.  |||    Fosters  bought  18.8%  of  Southcorp,  the  global  winemaker  behind  the  Penfolds,  Lindemans  and  Rosemount  brands,  for  4.17  Australian  dollars  per  share.  A  bid  at  that  price  would  value  the  company  at  A$3.1bn  ($2.4bn;  £1.25bn  ).  Fosters  said  it  was  currently  in  discussions  ""which  may  lead  to  a  major  corporate  announcement"".  |||    In  a  separate  statement,  Southcorp  confirmed  the  brewer  had  asked  for  talks.  Both  firms  asked  the  Sydney  stock  market  to  suspend  trading  in  their  shares  until  Monday.  Southcorp's  shares  were  suspended  at  A$4.25.  |||    Fosters  bought  the  18.8%  stake  from  Reline  Investments,  the  family  investment  firm  for  the  Oatleys,  who  founded  the  Rosemount  Estates  label  and  sold  it  to  Southcorp  in  2001.  Robert  Oatley  and  his  son  Sandy  Oatley  have  both  resigned  from  Southcorp's  board  following  the  share  deal.  Southcorp  employs  2,700  people  and  is  the  largest  single  investor  in  rural  Australia,  according  to  its  website.  The  prospect  of  Fosters  launching  a  major  acquisition  startled  investors,  as  the  brewer  said  last  summer  that  it  was  not  looking  to  expand  through  a  big  buy  in  the  near  future.  It  has  cash  available,  after  getting  A$846m  from  selling  property  business  Lensworth,  but  it  has  been  widely  expected  to  return  cash  to  shareholders.  |||    ""People  will  scratching  their  heads  over  this  one.  Fosters  has  done  a  back-flip"",  said  Shawn  Burns,  a  fund  manger  at  Deutsche  Asset  Management.  Southcorp's  shares  have  risen  in  recent  months  on  speculation  that  it  could  become  a  takeover  target.  It  spent  two  years  in  the  red,  returning  to  profit  in  2004.  Consolidation  in  the  wine  industry  is  being  driven  by  Constellation,  the  world's  biggest  winemaker.  It  seized  the  top  spot  when  it  bought  Australian  firm  BRL  Hardy  for  just  over  $1bn  in  2003.  Since  then,  it  has  paid  $1bn  for  US  wine  maker  Robert  Mondavi,  bought  last  month.  Fosters'  main  wine  business  is  Beringer  Blass  Wine  Estate.  Its  best  known  brand  is  Fosters  lager,  though  it  makes  a  clutch  of  beer  brands,  and  spirits.  Analysts  were  divided  on  Thursday  about  whether  Fosters  was  more  likely  to  go  for  a  takeover  or  merely  wanted  to  take  a  big  enough  chunk  of  Southcorp  to  prevent  it  falling  to  a  rival.  ""Currently,  I  think  the  strategic  position  is  more  sensible  rather  than  an  outright  takeover,""  said  one  analyst  quoted  by  the  Agence  France  Presse  news  agency.  However,  Matt  Williams,  a  fund  manager  at  Perpetual  Trustees  said  taking  the  stake  ""is  definitely  a  precursor  to  a  takeover""." 

2	"Conservative  backing  for  ID  cards  |||    The  Tories  are  to  back  controversial  government  plans  to  introduce  ID  cards.  |||    The  shadow  cabinet  revealed  its  support  ahead  of  next  week's  Commons  vote  on  a  bill  to  introduce  compulsory  ID.  The  decision  follows  a  ""tough  meeting""  where  some  senior  Tories  argued  vociferously  against  the  move,  party  sources  told  the  BBC.  The  bill,  which  ministers  claim  will  tackle  crime,  terrorism  and  illegal  immigration,  is  expected  to  be  opposed  by  the  Liberal  Democrats.  |||    They  have  said  the  scheme  is  ""deeply  flawed""  and  a  waste  of  money.  Sources  within  the  Conservative  Party  told  the  BBC  Michael  Howard  has  always  been  in  favour  of  ID  cards,  and  tried  to  introduce  them  when  he  was  Home  Secretary.  The  party  has  been  ""agnostic""  on  the  issue  until  now  but  had  now  decided  to  come  off  the  fence,  the  Tory  source  said.  Despite  giving  their  backing  to  ID  cards,  the  Conservatives  insisted  they  would  hold  ministers  to  account  over  the  precise  purpose  of  the  scheme.  |||    They  said  they  would  also  press  Labour  over  whether  objectives  could  be  met  and  whether  the  Home  Office  would  deliver  them.  And  they  pledged  to  assess  the  cost  effectiveness  of  ID  cards  and  whether  people's  privacy  would  be  properly  protected.  ""It  is  important  to  remember  that  this  bill  will  take  a  decade  to  come  into  full  effect,""  a  spokesman  said.  ""It  will  do  nothing  to  solve  the  immediate  problems  of  rising  crime  and  uncontrolled  immigration.""  |||    Lib  Dem  home  affairs  spokesman  Mark  Oaten  said:  ""This  has  all  the  signs  of  Michael  Howard  overruling  colleagues'  concerns  over  ID  cards.  ""The  Tories  should  have  the  courage  to  try  and  change  public  opinion  not  follow  it.""  The  new  chairman  of  the  Bar  Council,  Guy  Mansfield  QC  warned  there  was  a  real  risk  that  people  on  the  ""margins  of  society""  would  be  driven  into  the  hands  of  extremists.  ""What  is  going  to  happen  to  young  Asian  men  when  there  has  been  a  bomb  gone  off  somewhere?  They  are  going  to  be  stopped.  If  they  haven't  [ID  cards]  they  are  going  to  be  detained."""

Franz  Ferdinand,  who  recently  picked  up  five  Brit  Award  nominations,  ended  up  in  15th  place,  while  the  Eurythmics  wound  up  at  a  lowly  38.  Other  Scottish  acts,  such  as  the  Mull  Historical  Society  who  also  featured  in  the  top  50,  performed  at  a  party  in  Glasgow  where  the  result  was  announced.  Scottish-based  band  Snow  Patrol,  who  finished  14th  in  the  vote  and  have  been  nominated  for  a  pair  of  Brit  Awards,  were  among  the  performers  who  covered  well-known  Scottish  pop  songs  at  the  party  on  Wednesday  night.  |||    Indie  stalwarts  Belle  &  Sebastian  have  enjoyed  a  chart  career  stretching  back  to  1997.

Scottish  bands  from  earlier  musical  eras  also  made  it  into  the  final  list,  including  1970s  tartan  boy  band  the  Bay  City  Rollers  and  goth  favourites  the  Jesus  and  Mary  Chain.  |||    Scottish  magazine  The  List  recently  compiled  a  list  of  the  top  50  Scottish  bands  of  all  time,  but  left  the  final  decision  to  the  public.  The  magazine's  music  editor  Mark  Robertson  said:  ""The  idea  behind  the  project  was  simple  -  to  rediscover  the  very  best  of  Scottish  music,  from  the  finest  musical  talent  spanning  from  the  age  of  70s  rock  through  to  80s  pop,  right  up  to  today's  international  stars.""  ""Everyone  has  strong  opinions  about  this  and  we  wanted  to  open  it  up  to  the  public  to  decide,""  he  added.  BBC  Radio  Scotland  presenter  Vic  Galloway,  who  has  been  involved  in  the  project,  said  it  had  been  ""great  fun""  to  look  back  at  Scotland's  musical  heritage  and  take  note  of  up-and-coming  Scottish  acts."

His  former  shadow  chancellor  Michael  Portillo  makes  up  to  £560,000  a  year  -  partly  because  of  speeches  and  TV  work.  Ex-health  secretary  Alan  Milburn  earned  up  to  £85,000  from  speeches,  articles  and  advice  while  not  in  the  Cabinet.  |||    Mr  Milburn  was  away  from  the  frontbench  for  just  more  than  a  year  between  stepping  down  as  health  secretary  and  becoming  Labour's  election  supremo.  His  declared  interests  include  £20,000  from  newspaper  articles  and  fees  of  up  to  £35,000  for  four  speeches.  He  also  commanded  a  salary  of  between  £25,000  and  £35,000  for  being  on  investment  company  Bridgepoint  Capital's  European  advisory  committee.  His  time  out  of  office  will,  however,  have  lost  him  his  £71,433  minister's  salary.  Mr  Hague's  work  outside  Parliament  included  two  one-man  shows,  which  with  other  speaking  fees  netted  him  up  to  £480,000.  He  also  earned  up  to  £195,000  for  a  weekly  column  in  the  News  of  the  World,  and  between  £5,000  and  £10,000  for  presenting  BBC'2's  Have  I  Got  News  for  You.  Mr  Hague  was  also  paid  an  undisclosed  amount  for  the  newspaper  serialisation  of  his  biography  of  William  Pitt  the  Younger  and  up  to  £135,00  for  work  as  an  adviser  to  various  companies.  |||    Former  Defence  Secretary  Michael  Portillo  makes  some  of  his  money  as  a  non-executive  director  of  BAE  Systems.  He  is  to  stand  down  as  an  MP  at  the  next  election.  And  former  Foreign  Secretary  Robin  Cook  was  paid  between  £45,001  and  £50,000  for  the  paperback  edition  of  his  book  about  his  resignation  from  government.  His  declared  income  of  up  to  £205,000  also  includes  payments  for  being  a  consultant  to  the  Tote  and  for  his  regular  column  in  the  Guardian  newspaper.  The  register  also  shows  former  Home  Office  Minister  Ann  Widdecombe  declaring  a  £100,000  advance  for  her  third  and  fourth  novels.  She  also  received  up  to  £30,000  for  acting  as  the  Guardian's  agony  aunt  and  between  £5,001  and  £10,000  for  appearing  on  ITV's  Celebrity  Fit  Club.  David  Blunkett  has  become  a  paid  adviser  to  Indepen  Consulting  Limited  now  he  is  not  home  secretary  -  he  helps  them  with  seminars  about  the  relationship  between  government  and  business.  He  earns  between  £5,001and  £10,000  for  the  work.  |||    Tony  Blair's  entry  confirms  that  King  Abdullah  of  Jordan  paid  for  him  to  fly  from  a  holiday  in  Egypt  to  official  discussions  -  and  for  a  sightseeing  tour  to  Wadi  Rum.  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard's  only  fresh  entry  is  a  Christmas  hamper  from  the  Sultan  of  Brunei.  He  also  declares  a  trip  to  Mexico  last  year  to  address  executives  of  News  International,  and  helicopter  and  private  jet  travel  paid  for  by  supporters.  Liberal  Democrat  leader  Charles  Kennedy  registered  donations  to  his  office  from  supporters,  a  free  ticket  to  last  year's  Bafta  awards  and  rent  from  a  single-bedroom  flat  in  London.  The  register  only  contains  new  information  for  December  2004  -  but  Monday  saw  the  publication  of  the  annual  review  of  the  register,  with  the  year's  details.  The  payments  are  shown  in  bands  of  up  £5,000,  making  it  difficult  to  calculate  the  exact  earnings."

That  took  2004's  total  to  2.2  million,  the  best  showing  in  five  years.  Job  creation  was  one  of  last  year's  main  concerns  for  the  US  economy.  While  worries  still  remain,  the  conditions  are  set  for  steady  growth  in  2005,  analysts  said.  The  unemployment  rate  stayed  at  5.4%  in  December,  and  about  200,000  jobs  will  need  to  be  created  each  month  if  that  figure  is  to  drop.  |||    ""It  was  a  respectable  report,""  said  Michael  Moran,  analyst  at  Daiwa  Securities.  |||    ""Payroll  growth  in  December  was  a  little  lighter  than  the  consensus  forecast,  but  we  had  upward  revisions  to  the  prior  two  months  and  an  increase  in  manufacturing  employment.""  ""Manufacturing  is  a  cyclical  area  of  the  economy  and  if  it's  showing  job  growth,  it's  a  good  indication  that  the  economy  is  on  a  solid  growth  track.""  That  means  that  the  Federal  Reserve  is  likely  to  continue  its  policy  of  raising  interest  rates.  The  Fed  lifted  borrowing  costs  five  times  last  year  to  2.25%,  citing  evidence  the  US  economic  recovery  was  becoming  more  robust.  |||    Job  creation  was  one  of  last  year's  main  concerns  for  the  US  economy,  and  proved  to  be  a  main  topic  of  debate  in  the  US  presidential  election.  While  demand  for  workers  is  far  from  booming,  the  conditions  are  set  for  steady  growth.  ""Overall,  compared  to  the  previous  year  it  looks  great,  it  just  keeps  going  stronger  and  stronger  and  I  expect  that  to  be  the  case""  in  2005,  said  Kurt  Karl,  economist  at  Swiss  Re  in  New  York.  Meanwhile,  economists  cautioned  against  reading  too  much  into  data  from  the  Federal  Reserve  showing  an  unexpected  $8.7bn  drop  in  consumer  debt  in  November.  A  fall  in  consumer  spending,  which  makes  up  about  two-thirds  of  all  US  economic  activity,  could  help  limit  the  extent  of  any  future  interest  rate  rises.  But  economists  said  there  could  be  a  number  of  reasons  for  a  fall  in  the  borrowing,  which  include  credit  cards  and  personal  loans,  while  noting  that  such  figures  can  vary  on  a  month-to-month  basis." 

3	"Wenger  steps  up  row  |||    Arsene  Wenger  has  stepped  up  his  feud  with  Sir  Alex  Ferguson  by  claiming  the  Manchester  United  manager  is  guilty  of  bringing  football  into  disrepute.  |||    The  pair's  long-running  row  was  put  back  in  the  headlines  on  Saturday  when  Ferguson  said  his  Arsenal  counterpart  was  ""a  disgrace"".  Wenger  initially  refused  to  bite  back,  saying  only:  ""I  will  never  answer  any  questions  any  more  about  this  man.""  But  now  he  claims  Ferguson  should  be  punished  by  the  Football  Association.  The  latest  twist  in  the  Ferguson-Wenger  saga  came  on  Saturday  when  the  United  boss,  in  an  interview  with  The  Independent  newspaper,  discussed  the  events  after  the  game  between  the  two  sides  in  October.  United  won  2-0  that  day,  at  Old  Trafford,  but  the  game  was  followed  by  a  now  notorious  food  fight  which  saw  Ferguson's  clothes  covered  in  soup  and  pizza.  The  sides  meet  again  at  Highbury  on  1  February.  ""In  the  tunnel  Wenger  was  criticising  my  players,  calling  them  cheats,  so  I  told  him  to  leave  them  alone  and  behave  himself,""  Ferguson  said  on  Saturday.  ""He  ran  at  me  with  hands  raised  saying  'what  do  you  want  to  do  about  it?'  ""To  not  apologise  for  the  behaviour  of  the  players  to  another  manager  is  unthinkable.  It's  a  disgrace,  but  I  don't  expect  Wenger  to  ever  apologise,  he's  that  type  of  person.""  |||    Those  allegations  were  put  to  Wenger  after  Saturday's  game  at  Bolton,  which  Arsenal  lost  to  slip  10  points  behind  Chelsea  in  the  title  race.  At  first  he  said  only:  ""I've  always  been  consistent  with  that  story  and  told  you  nothing  happened.  ""If  he  has  to  talk,  he  talks.  If  he  wants  to  make  a  newspaper  article,  he  makes  a  newspaper  article.  ""He  doesn't  interest  me  and  doesn't  matter  to  me  at  all.  I  will  never  answer  to  any  provocation  from  him  any  more.  ""He  does  what  he  likes  in  England  anyway.  He  can  go  abroad  one  day  and  see  how  it  is.""  But  later  on  Saturday,  according  to  The  Independent,  Wenger  spoke  to  a  smaller  group  of  reporters  and  expanded  on  his  reaction.  ""I  have  no  diplomatic  relations  with  him,""  the  Arsenal  boss  is  quoted  as  saying.  ""What  I  don't  understand  is  that  he  does  what  he  wants  and  you  (the  press)  are  all  at  his  feet.  |||    ""The  situation  (concerning  the  food  fight)  has  been  judged  and  there  is  a  game  going  on  in  a  month.  ""The  managers  have  a  responsibility  to  protect  the  game  before  the  game.  But  in  England  you  are  only  punished  for  what  you  say  after  the  game.  ""Now  the  whole  story  starts  again.  I  don't  go  into  that  game.  We  play  football.  I  am  a  football  manager  and  I  love  football  above  all  ...  no  matter  what  people  say.""  Reminded  that  Ferguson  called  him  ""a  disgrace"",  Wenger  added:  ""I  don't  respond  to  anything.  In  England  you  have  a  good  phrase.  It  is  'bringing  the  game  into  disrepute'.  ""But  that  is  not  only  after  a  game,  it  is  as  well  before  a  game.""  |||    Ferguson  had  also  claimed  that  United  chief  executive  David  Gill  and  Arsenal  vice-chairman  David  Dein  had  agreed  at  boardroom  level  not  to  discuss  the  incident  in  public.  But  Ferguson  added:  ""In  the  ensuing  weeks  all  you  got  was  a  diatribe  from  Arsenal  about  being  kicked  off  the  pitch  and  all  that  nonsense.  Gill  phoned  Dein  three  times  to  complain  but  nothing  was  done.  ""The  return  is  on  1  February  and  they  will  come  out  with  another  diatribe.  ""David  Gill  and  I  feel  we  should  set  the  record  straight  because  Arsenal  have  not  written  to  us  to  apologise  and  we  would  not  let  that  happen  here.""  Meanwhile,  the  League  Managers  Association  have  offered  to  act  as  peacemakers  in  the  hope  of  resolving  the  on-going  row.  During  that  stormy  game  in  October,  United  striker  Ruud  van  Nistelrooy  caught  Arsenal's  Ashley  Cole  with  one  particularly  strong  tackle.  Wenger  later  accused  Van  Nistelrooy  of  ""cheating""  and  was  fined  £15,000  and  ""severely  reprimanded""  by  the  Football  Association.  Ferguson  admitted  on  Saturday  that  Van  Nistelrooy's  tackle,  which  earned  the  Dutchman  a  ban,  ""could  have  given  (Cole)  a  serious  injury"",  but  he  believes  Arsenal  were  the  main  aggressors.  |||    ""Wenger  is  always  complaining  the  match  was  not  played  in  the  right  spirit,""  he  added.  ""They  are  the  worst  losers  of  all  time,  they  don't  know  how  to  lose.  Maybe  it  is  just  Manchester  United,  they  don't  lose  many  games  to  other  teams.  ""We  tend  to  forget  the  worst  disciplinary  record  of  all  time  was  Arsenal's  up  until  last  season.  In  fairness  it  has  improved  and  now  they  are  seen  as  paragons  of  virtue.  ""But  to  Wenger  it  never  happens,  it  is  all  some  dream  or  nightmare.""" 

2	"Blunkett  tells  of  love  and  pain  |||    David  Blunkett  has  spoken  of  his  love  for  married  publisher  Kimberly  Quinn  for  the  first  time.  |||    The  home  secretary  described  how  it  affected  his  friends  and  personal  life,  but  said  he  was  a  great  believer  in  personal  responsibility.  Mr  Blunkett  is  taking  legal  action  to  gain  access  to  Mrs  Quinn's  two-year-old  son.  She  denies  he  is  Mr  Blunkett's.  The  interview  with  BBC  Radio  Sheffield  was  made  before  allegations  he  fast-tracked  a  visa  for  Mrs  Quinn's  nanny.  The  allegations,  which  he  has  denied,  are  being  investigated  by  Sir  Alan  Budd.  Mr  Blunkett  talked  about  how  he  fell  in  love  -  but  that  she  resisted  his  desire  to  go  public.  |||    In  an  apparent  reference  to  his  court  action  to  gain  access  to  her  son,  he  says  he  was  a  great  believer  in  responsibility  and  consequences,  even  when  they  were  painful.  Mr  Blunkett  told  BBC  Radio  Sheffield:  ""I  fell  in  love  with  someone  and  they  wouldn't  go  public  and  things  started  to  go  very  badly  wrong  in  the  summer,  and  then  the  News  of  the  World  picked  up  the  story.  ""I  tried  for  three  years  to  make  something  work.  ""I  haven't  spoken  about  it  and  I  don't  intend  to.  Even  in  the  biography  that's  being  written  about  me  I've  ensured  that  there's  as  little  as  possible.""  BBC  political  correspondent  Carole  Walker  said  the  timing  of  the  broadcast  was  unlikely  to  help  his  efforts  to  show  that  he  is  concentrating  on  getting  on  with  the  job  of  home  secretary.  Shadow  home  secretary  David  Davis  says  Mr  Blunkett  should  quit  if  he  is  found  to  have  influenced  the  visa  process  even  indirectly.  |||    Reports  have  claimed  Mr  Blunkett  chaired  a  meeting  to  discuss  delays  in  the  visa  system  after  he  learned  of  nanny  Leoncia  Casalme's  wait.  The  Home  Office  has  said  it  would  be  up  to  Sir  Alan's  inquiry  to  decide  if  any  such  meeting  was  relevant.  Home  Office  minister  Fiona  Mactaggart  said  she  hoped  Mr  Blunkett  would  survive  in  his  job.  ""I  work  with  him  every  day  and  I  have  always  been  surprised  by  how  focused  he  is  on  the  job  in  hand,  on  working  to  deal  with  things,""  she  said.  She  told  BBC  One's  Breakfast  with  Frost  programme:  ""He  is  just  really  down  for  the  job  and  I  hope  he  does  (survive).""" 

3	"Robinson  answers  critics  |||    England  captain  Jason  Robinson  has  rubbished  suggestions  that  the  world  champions  are  a  team  in  decline.  |||    England  were  beaten  11-9  by  Wales  in  their  Six  Nations  opener  in  Cardiff  last  week  and  face  current  champions  France  at  Twickenham  on  Sunday.  Robinson  said:  ""We  are  certainly  not  on  the  decline.  You  lose  one  game  and  it  doesn't  make  you  a  bad  team.  ""I  have  no  doubt  in  the  players  we've  got.  We  have  still  got  the  team  to  go  out  and  beat  anyone  on  our  day.""  England  find  themselves  striving  to  avoid  a  third  successive  championship  defeat  for  the  first  time  since  1987.  But  full-back  Robinson  believes  the  new-look  England  team  can  stop  the  rot  against  France.  |||    ""Last  weekend  we  should  have  won  the  game,""  he  said.  ""But  if  we  can  under-perform  and  lose  by  only  two  points  then  I  am  sure  if  we  play  well  this  week  we  will  get  the  win  we  need.  ""We  proved  that  in  the  autumn  -  when  we  put  in  some  excellent  performances  -  and  we  just  need  to  build  on  that.  |||    ""It  was  a  disappointing  start  against  Wales  and  we  might  be  down  on  that.  ""But  we  are  certainly  not  out.  We  will  come  out  fighting  this  week.""  Robinson  also  had  words  of  comfort  for  18-year-old  Newcastle  centre  Mathew  Tait,  who  made  his  international  debut  against  Wales  but  has  been  demoted  from  the  squad  to  face  France.  |||    ""I  have  had  a  word  with  Mathew,""  said  Robinson.  ""I  still  believe  in  him.  He  is  an  outstanding  player  but  we  have  gone  for  Olly  (Barkley)  because  of  the  kicking.  ""Mathew  has  just  got  to  take  it  on  the  chin,  keep  working  hard  like  he  is  doing  and  I'm  sure  he  will  feature  in  some  of  the  games."""

World  number  one  Lindsay  Davenport  and  Anastasia  Myskina  also  progressed.  Davenport  defeated  China's  Jie  Zheng  6-2  7-5,  while  French  Open  champion  Myskina  sailed  through  after  her  opponent  Marion  Bartoli  retired  hurt.  American  Davenport  will  now  face  fellow  former  Wimbledon  champion,  Conchita  Martinez  of  Spain,  who  ousted  seventh-seeded  Nathalie  Dechy  of  France  6-1  6-2.  Myskina  will  face  eighth-seed  Patty  Schnyder  from  Switzerland,  who  defeated  China's  Li  Na  6-3  7-6  (10-8).  The  other  quarter  final  pits  wild  card  Sania  Mirza  of  India  against  Jelena  Jankovic  of  Serbia  and  Montenegro,  who  both  won  on  Tuesday.  |||    Before  her  meeting  with  Martinez,  Davenport  believes  there  is  some  room  for  improvement  in  her  game.  ""I  started  well  and  finished  well,  but  played  some  so-so  games  in  the  middle,""  she  said.  Williams  was  also  far  from  content.  ""I  don't  know  what  I  was  doing  there,""  she  said.  ""It  was  really  windy  and  I  hadn't  played  in  the  wind.  All  my  shots  were  going  out  of  here.""  But  Hantuchova  is  in  upbeat  mood  ahead  of  her  clash  with  the  younger  Williams  sister,  who  was  handed  a  first-round  bye.  ""I  feel  I  have  an  advantage  (over  Serena)  because  I  have  already  played  two  matches  on  these  courts,""  she  said.  ""It  is  a  difficult  court  to  play  on.  Very  fast  and  sometimes  you  feel  you  have  no  control  over  the  ball."""

Mr  Fuller  has  been  appointed  to  the  CFX  board  and  will  plan  and  implement  the  company's  creative  strategy.  The  19  firm  handles  a  roster  of  music  artists,  TV  shows  and  PR  strategies  for  stars  including  the  Beckhams.  The  deal  sees  Mr  Fuller  receive  £64.5m  in  cash  and  about  1.9  million  shares  in  Sports  Entertainment.  There  will  also  be  a  further  £19.2m  in  either  cash  or  stocks  by  the  end  of  the  financial  year  in  June.  Mr  Fuller  has  signed  a  long-term  agreement  with  the  company  which  will  see  him  continue  to  expand  and  develop  entertainment  brands.  He  said:  ""This  is  a  hugely  exciting  new  partnership  for  myself  and  19  Entertainment.  |||    ""CKX  will  provide  19  with  a  powerful  platform  for  global  growth  and  allow  us  to  fully  take  advantage  of  all  the  amazing  opportunities  that  lie  ahead.

The  company  was  set  up  15  years  ago  by  Mr  Fuller,  taking  the  name  from  his  first  successful  single  -  19  by  Paul  Hardcastle.  Fuller  was  the  driving  force  behind  the  Spice  Girls  phenomenon,  using  canny  marketing  and  catchy  pop  songs  to  secure  their  place  as  the  most  lucrative  girl  group  in  history.  He  then  put  together  S  Club  7,  who  had  their  own  TV  show  as  well  as  a  music  career.

The  band  have  had  eight  top  three  hits,  including  four  number  ones,  since  they  first  hit  the  charts  in  2002.  Their  singles  include  What  I  Go  To  School  For,  Year  3000,  Crashed  The  Wedding,  You  Said  No,  and  Who's  David?  |||    The  band,  which  also  includes  members  Matt  Jay  and  James  Bourne,  made  the  top  ten  with  their  self-titled  debut  album,  as  well  as  the  follow-up,  A  Present  For  Everyone,  in  2003.  They  won  best  pop  act  and  best  breakthrough  act  at  the  2004  Brit  Awards  and  were  nominated  for  best  British  group.  Most  recently  they  topped  the  charts  with  the  theme  from  the  live-action  film  version  of  Thunderbirds,  which  was  voted  Record  Of  The  Year  on  the  ITV1  show.  The  band  have  capitalised  on  a  craze  for  artists  playing  catchy  pop  music  with  rock  overtones.  The  trio  are  seen  as  an  alternative  to  more  manufactured  artists  who  are  not  considered  credible  musicians  because  they  do  not  write  their  own  songs  or  play  their  own  instruments.  However,  recent  rumours  have  suggested  that  Simpson  has  been  wanting  to  quit  the  band  to  focus  on  Fightstar.  He  now  plans  to  take  Fightstar  on  tour."

GM  said  higher  healthcare  costs  in  North  America,  and  lower  profits  at  its  financial  services  subsidiary  would  hurt  its  performance  in  2005.  GM  said  it  expects  to  meet  its  2004  earnings  targets  ""despite  a  tough  competitive  environment"".  |||    GM,  whose  brands  include  Buick,  Cadillac  and  Chevrolet  in  the  US  and  Opel,  Saab  and  Vauxhall  in  Europe,  is  due  to  reveal  2004  earnings  on  19  January.  |||    It  said  it  would  deliver  a  shareholder  payout  of  $6.0-$6.5  per  share  this  year,  as  promised,  but  that  next  year's  earnings  per  share  would  be  lower,  at  between  $4.0-$5.0.  ""We're  following  a  roadmap  that  we  believe  will  deliver  strong  results,""  said  GM  chief  executive  Rick  Waggoner.  GM  said  it  was  expecting  ""reduced  financial  losses""  in  Europe  in  2005.  It  is  in  the  midst  of  cutting  12,000  jobs  -  one  fifth  of  the  European  total  -  in  a  bid  to  cut  costs.  The  biggest  job  losses  are  in  Germany.  Its  vehicle  businesses  have  gained  market  share  in  three  out  of  four  regions  in  2004,  achieving  record  profitability  in  Asia  Pacific  and  returning  to  profit  in  Latin  America,  the  Middle  East  and  Africa.  The  car  maker  has  diversified  into  financial  services,  and  is  extending  the  reach  of  General  Motors  Acceptance  Corp  (GMAC),  which  has  said  it  may  enter  the  home  loans  market.  GMAC  has  been  a  strong  contributor  to  profits  in  2004  but  GM  said  it  will  do  less  well  this  year,  delivering  net  income  of  $2.5bn.  ""Attaining  earnings  of  $10  a  share  remains  GM's  goal,""  the  company  said,  adding  it  believes  it  can  achieve  this  in  2007."

Tautou  will  play  Hanks'  code-cracking  partner,  according  to  various  newspapers.  She  is  currently  starring  in  A  Very  Long  Engagement,  directed  by  Jean-Pierre  Jeunet.  Jeunet  was  also  responsible  for  directing  Tautou  in  Amelie  in  2001,  which  launched  the  actress  into  the  mainstream.  |||    She  also  starred  as  the  lead  role  in  critically-acclaimed  film  Dirty  Pretty  Things  in  2002.  Oscar-winning  director  Ron  Howard  chose  Tautou  for  the  part,  preferring  a  French  actress  to  a  big  name  Hollywood  star.  UK  actress  Kate  Beckinsale  had  been  widely  tipped  as  a  possibility  for  the  role  alongside  Vanessa  Paradis  and  Juliette  Binoche.  The  thriller  upon  which  the  movie  is  based  has  sold  more  than  17  million  copies  and  is  centred  on  a  global  conspiracy  surrounding  the  Holy  Grail  mythology.  The  Louvre  Museum,  scene  of  the  gruesome  murder  at  the  beginning  of  the  novel,  recently  gave  permission  for  filming  to  take  place  there,  showbusiness  newspaper  Variety  reported.  The  $100m  movie  will  be  produced  by  Columbia/Sony  Pictures  and  is  due  for  release  on  May  19,  2006  in  the  United  States  and  France."

Green  Day's  Boulevard  of  Broken  Dreams  is  currently  number  two  in  Billboard's  pop  chart,  and  tops  its  digital  chart.  Download  sales  are  due  to  be  incorporated  into  the  UK  singles  chart  later  this  year.  |||    Digital  sales  in  the  US  are  already  used  to  compile  Billboard's  Hot  Digital  Sales  chart.  They  will  now  be  tallied  with  sales  of  physical  singles  and  airplay  information  to  make  up  its  new  Hot  100  chart.  Its  second  new  chart  -  the  Pop  100  -  also  combines  airplay,  digital  and  physical  sales  but  confines  its  airplay  information  to  US  radio  stations  which  play  chart  music.  In  addition  to  Green  Day,  other  artists  in  the  current  US  digital  sales  top  10  include  Kelly  Clarkson,  The  Game  and  the  Killers.  |||    Sales  of  legally  downloaded  songs  shot  up  more  than  tenfold  in  2004,  with  200  million  track  purchased  online  in  the  US  and  Europe  in  12  months,  the  International  Federation  of  the  Phonographic  Industry  (IFPI)  reported  last  month.  In  the  UK  sales  of  song  downloads  overtook  those  for  physical  singles  for  the  first  time  at  the  end  of  last  year.  The  last  week  of  December  2004  saw  download  sales  of  312,000  compared  with  282,000  physical  singles,  according  to  the  British  Phonographic  Industry.  The  UK's  first  official  music  download  chart  was  launched  last  September,  compiling  the  most  popular  tracks  downloaded  from  legal  UK  sites  -  including  iTunes,  OD2,  mycokemusic.com  and  Napster.  Westlife's  Flying  Without  Wings  -  a  1999  track  reissued  for  the  occasion  -  was  the  first  number  one  of  the  UK  download  chart.  |||    A  spokesman  for  the  British  Phonographic  Industry  (BPI)  said  the  first  combined  UK  download  and  sales  chart  was  due  to  be  compiled  ""within  the  first  half  of  this  year"".  ""Work  is  going  on  across  the  music  business  right  now  to  make  sure  the  new  chart  works  to  plan,""  he  said.  The  BPI  spokesman  described  the  UK  music  download  chart,  compiled  by  the  Official  Charts  Company,  as  having  been  ""a  great  success""  since  its  launch.  ""It  has  provided  a  focus  for  the  industry  and  has  really  driven  interest  in  downloads  among  music  fans,""  he  said."

Ministers,  eager  to  gain  access  to  energy  supplies  to  meet  the  demands  of  a  booming  economy,  secured  a  similar  deal  to  one  between  Iran  and  China.  The  announcement  comes  as  ONGC  said  it  was  in  talks  to  buy  former  assets  of  troubled  Russian  oil  firm  Yukos.  The  agreements  with  Iran  were  sealed  after  talks  in  New  Delhi  between  Middle  East  producers  and  Asia's  biggest  energy  consumers  -  China,  India,  Japan  and  South  Korea.  |||    Iran  -  Opec's  second-biggest  oil  producer  and  one  of  the  world's  top  gas  producers  -  has  been  pursuing  a  series  of  deals,  rewarding  LNG  buyers  with  participation  in  development  of  its  oil  fields.  Under  the  agreement,  it  will  supply  India  with  7.5  million  tonnes  of  LPG  annually  over  a  25  year  period  from  2009.  ONGC  and  the  National  Iranian  Oil  Company  (NIOC)  reached  a  preliminary  deal  for  Indian  firms  to  take  part  in  the  development  of  the  Yadavaran  and  Jufeyr  oilfields,  both  countries  said  in  a  statement.  India's  oil  production  has  stagnated  over  recent  years,  and  it  is  having  to  look  abroad  to  secure  future  supplies.  India  imports  about  70%  of  its  total  oil  consumption.  Consumption  has  jumped  to  2.4  million  barrels  per  day,  compared  with  474,000  bpd  in  1973."

The  market's  buoyancy  reflects  optimism  about  the  Brazilian  economy,  which  could  grow  by  as  much  as  4.5%  in  2004.  Brazil  is  recovering  from  last  year's  recession  -  its  worst  in  a  decade.  |||    Economic  output  declined  0.2%  in  2003  and  President  Luiz  Inacio  Lula  da  Silva  -  elected  as  Brazil's  first  working-class  president  in  2002  -  was  strongly  criticised  for  pursuing  a  hardline  economic  policy.  |||    Investors  have  praised  his  handling  of  the  economy  as  foreign  investment  has  risen,  unemployment  has  fallen  and  inflation  has  been  brought  under  control.  Analysts  believe  the  stock  market  will  rise  above  the  25,000  mark  for  the  first  time  before  too  long.  ""There  should  be  more  space  for  gains  until  the  end  of  the  year,  somewhere  up  to  27,000  points,""  said  Paschoal  Tadeu  Buonomo,  head  of  equities  trading  at  brokers  TOV.  Brazil's  currency,  the  real,  also  rose  to  its  highest  level  against  the  dollar  in  more  than  two  years  on  Friday.  Although  interest  rates  still  stand  at  a  punitive  17.25%,  inflation  has  fallen  from  9%  to  7%  while  exports  are  booming,  particularly  of  agricultural  products.  ""For  the  first  time  in  decades,  we  have  all  three  economic  policy  pillars  in  line  during  a  recovery,""  Finance  Minister  Antonio  Palocci  told  the  Associated  Press  news  agency.  ""Government  accounts  are  in  surplus,  we  have  a  current  account  surplus  and  inflation  is  under  control.""  |||    Investors  were  deeply  suspicious  of  President  da  Silva,  a  former  trade  union  leader  who  campaigned  on  a  programme  of  extensive  land  redistribution  and  a  large  rise  in  the  minimum  wage.  However,  Mr  da  Silva  has  stuck  to  an  orthodox  monetary  policy  inherited  from  his  predecessor  even  in  the  face  of  last  year's  economic  crisis.  This  has  earned  him  the  disapproval  of  rural  farm  workers,  thousands  of  whom  who  took  to  the  streets  of  Brasilia  on  Thursday  to  protest  against  government  policies.  President  da  Silva  has  defended  his  policies,  arguing  that  Brazil  cannot  afford  to  continue  the  cycle  of  boom  and  bust  which  afflicted  it  in  recent  decades."

He  said  Brown  was  arrested  at  his  hotel  after  the  show  at  the  Great  American  Music  Hall  but  released  without  charge.  San  Francisco  police  said  they  could  find  no  record  of  his  arrest.  Mr  Smernicki  said  he  had  been  told  a  fan  ""rugby-tackled""  the  singer  during  the  gig,  which  resulted  in  ""pushing  and  shoving"".  |||    Brown  then  got  into  a  brawl  with  another  man  who  tried  to  restrain  him  -  without  realising  he  was  a  security  guard,  Mr  Smernicki  added.  The  star  went  off  for  15  minutes  before  returning  to  finish  his  set.  Police  took  witness  statements  and  apprehended  Brown  at  his  hotel,  Mr  Smernicki  said.  But  he  was  released  without  charge  and  ""as  far  as  we're  aware,  that's  the  end  of  it"",  Mr  Smernicki  added.  A  spokesperson  for  the  San  Francisco  Police  Department  said  he  may  have  been  detained  but  they  could  find  no  record  of  the  incident.  Brown,  42,  was  lead  singer  with  The  Stone  Roses,  one  of  the  most  seminal  bands  in  British  rock,  until  they  split  in  1996.  He  has  since  forged  a  successful  solo  career,  scoring  nine  UK  top  30  singles  since  1998.  In  1998,  he  was  sentenced  to  four  months  in  jail  for  using  threatening  behaviour  towards  an  aeroplane  captain  and  stewardess."

Fifth  seed  Patty  Schnyder  also  had  a  battle  as  she  needed  three  sets  to  beat  China's  Na  Li  7-5  3-6  7-5.  Slovakian  Daniela  Hantuchova  beat  Bulgarian  Magdaleena  Maleeva  4-6  6-4  6-3  to  set  up  a  second  round  clash  with  Russian  Elena  Bovina.  The  veteran  Martinez  found  herself  in  trouble  early  on  against  Vinci  with  the  Italian  clinching  the  set  thanks  to  breaks  in  the  third  and  11th  games.  But  Vinci's  game  fell  to  pieces  after  that  and  Martinez  swept  her  aside  with  some  crisp  cross-court  returns  and  deft  volleys.

2	"Blair  returns  from  peace  mission  |||    Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  has  arrived  back  from  his  diplomatic  mission  to  the  Middle  East  to  try  to  resurrect  the  peace  process.  |||    Mr  Blair  held  talks  with  his  Israeli  counterpart,  Ariel  Sharon,  and  the  Palestinian  leader,  Mahmoud  Abbas.  He  confirmed  that  a  renewed  drive  to  reform  the  Palestinian  Authority  and  address  security  issues  would  come  at  a  London  conference  in  March.  Mr  Blair  also  made  a  surprise  trip  to  Iraq  this  week.  The  Israelis  described  the  meeting  as  important  but  said  they  would  not  need  to  attend.  Mr  Blair  briefly  visited  the  tomb  of  Yasser  Arafat  in  Ramallah  -  the  first  world  leader  to  do  so.  He  nodded  briefly  towards  the  tomb,  rather  than  lay  a  wreath,  in  what  Palestinian  officials  said  was  a  compromise  gesture  agreed  at  the  last  minute.  |||    The  BBC's  Paul  Reynolds  says  the  London  conference  will  be  a  limited  measure  to  shore  up  the  leadership  of  Mahmoud  Abbas,  also  known  as  Abu  Mazen,  who  is  expected  to  win  the  Palestinian  presidential  election  on  9  January.  At  a  news  conference  following  talks  with  Mr  Blair,  Mr  Abbas  said  the  British  prime  minister  was  ""in  a  unique  position  to  help  us  progress  in  our  peaceful  pursuit"".  He  added:  ""Your  endeavour  to  hold  a  conference  in  London  is  another  example  of  your  deep  commitment  to  this  purpose.""  In  an  interview  with  the  BBC's  political  editor  Andrew  Marr,  Mr  Blair  said  getting  progress  between  Israelis  and  Palestinians  would  be  ""tough,  but  at  least  we  have  got  the  first  step"".  Mr  Blair  acknowledged  some  people  believed  he  was  too  close  to  the  Israelis,  but  said  the  Israelis  were  entitled  to  expect  Palestinians  to  give  up  terrorism.  He  argued  that  Mr  Sharon  was  committed  to  the  internationally-agreed  roadmap  peace  plan  and  said  his  bid  to  disengage  from  Gaza  had  to  be  part  of  the  peace  process,  not  the  end  of  it.  Earlier,  Mr  Sharon  again  said  he  had  not  seen  ""the  slightest  step""  the  Palestinians  were  working  to  end  terror  attacks  -  though  he  acknowledged  Palestinian  leaders  were  in  the  middle  of  an  election  campaign  that  could  be  hampering  their  efforts.  Before  visiting  Israel,  Mr  Blair  made  a  surprise  visit  to  Iraq,  where  he  met  leaders  in  Baghdad  during  his  first  trip  to  the  city.  He  was  briefed  on  preparations  for  the  national  poll,  which  is  scheduled  for  next  month  but  is  threatened  by  a  deadly  campaign  of  insurgent  violence.  He  also  flew  to  Basra  in  southern  Iraq  where  British  forces  are  stationed."

Share  trading  will  begin  on  15  December,  the  LSE  said.  For  China's  aviation  authorities,  the  listing  is  part  of  the  modernisation  of  its  airline  sector  to  cope  with  soaring  demand  for  air  travel.  No  further  details  of  the  share  price  or  number  of  shares  were  given.  |||    The  LSE  has  been  working  hard  to  woo  Chinese  companies  to  choose  London,  rather  than  New  York  for  their  listings.  It  opened  an  Asia-Pacific  office  in  Hong  Kong  last  month.  ""We  are  delighted  that  Air  China  has  chosen  London  for  its  listing  outside  China,""  said  LSE  chief  executive  Clara  Furse.  ""The  London  Stock  Exchange  offers  ambitious  Chinese  companies  access  to  the  world's  most  international  equity  market  combined  with  high  regulatory  and  corporate  governance  standards,""  she  said.  A  spokesman  for  the  LSE  said:  ""We've  been  engaged  with  them  (Air  China)  for  about  18  months,  two  years  now.""  As  part  of  its  pitch  to  bring  listings  to  London,  the  LSE  is  thought  to  be  highlighting  the  extra  costs  and  red-tape  imposed  by  new  US  laws  passed  since  the  Enron  scandal,  whilst  stressing  London's  strong  regulatory  environment.  |||    Germany's  Chancellor  Gerhard  Schroeder  began  a  three-day  visit  to  Beijing  on  Monday  by  signing  a  deal  worth  1bn  euros  ($1.3bn;  £690m)  for  Airbus  to  sell  23  new  planes  to  Air  China,  the  Deutsche  Welle  radio  station  reported.  China's  booming  economy  has  created  huge  demand  for  air  travel  among  middle-class  Chinese,  turning  the  country  into  a  sales  battleground  between  rival  plane  makers  Airbus  and  Boeing.  Air  China's  long-awaited  flotation  is  part  of  a  strategy  to  modernise  a  dozen  state-owned  carriers,  which  have  been  reorganised  into  three  groups  under  Air  China,  China  Southern  and  China  Eastern.  Merrill  Lynch  are  sole  bookrunners  for  Air  China's  flotation,  which  will  take  the  form  of  a  share  placing  with  institutional  investors  in  London,  though  retail  investors  may  be  able  to  buy  Air  China  shares  in  Hong  Kong.  Air  China's  primary  listing  will  be  in  Hong  Kong,  with  a  secondary  listing  in  London.  The  shares  will  be  denominated  in  Hong  Kong  dollars.  However,  investors  may  be  wary  of  Chinese  stocks.  The  collapse  last  week  of  China  Aviation  Oil,  the  Singapore-listed  arm  of  a  Chinese  jet  fuel  trader,  has  cast  the  spotlight  on  corporate  governance  shortcomings  at  Chinese  firms." 

2	"Blair  blasts  Tory  spending  plans  |||    Tony  Blair  has  launched  an  attack  on  Conservative  spending  plans,  saying  they  are  a  ""ludicrous  improbability"".  |||    The  prime  minister  has  told  a  Labour  Party  gathering  that  the  Tory  policies  would  cause  economic  failure.  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  has  said  his  party  would  cut  £35bn  in  ""wasteful""  spending  to  allow  £4bn  in  tax  cuts.  On  Saturday,  Tory  shadow  home  secretary  David  Davis  said  the  Tories  would  fund  the  cuts  by  removing  ""inefficiencies""  which  had  ""burgeoned""  under  Labour.  In  his  speech,  Mr  Blair  contrasted  a  reformed  Labour  party,  which  had  learned  to  occupy  the  political  centre  ground,  with  a  hidebound  Tory  party,  which  he  said  would  turn  the  clock  back  with  spending  cuts.  Mr  Blair  said:  ""The  Conservative  tax  and  spending  proposals  would  put  at  risk,  both  Britain's  hard-won  economic  stability  -  the  lowest  mortgages,  inflation,  unemployment,  for  decades  -  and  the  key  investment  in  public  services.  |||    ""I  believe  that  the  Tory  plans  are  as  plain  a  call  to  return  to  the  past  as  it's  possible  to  imagine,""  he  said.  ""It's  a  recipe  for  exactly  the  same  boom  and  bust  economics  and  cuts  in  public  services  that  were  their  hallmark  in  18  years  of  Conservative  government.""  Mr  Blair  added:  ""They,  the  Conservatives  have  learned  nothing.""  By  contrast,  he  said,  New  Labour  had  listened  to  its  electorate  and  changed.  |||    Mr  Blair  went  on  to  list  his  government's  achievements  and  to  issue  a  rallying  call  to  the  party.  ""So  now  we  have  a  choice,  we  can  defend  this  record  and  we  can  build  on  it  and  go  on  and  fulfil  the  promise  or  give  up  and  go  back.  And  I  say  we  have  to  fight.""  In  response,  David  Davis  said  the  Tories  would  make  cuts,  such  as  removing  regional  assemblies,  but  would  bring  in  more  police  officers  and  match  Labour's  spending  on  health  and  education.  ""Everybody  knows,  having  lived  through  this  government  the  last  seven  years,  that  they  faced  lots  of  stealth  tactics,  lots  of  increases  in  taxes,  but  no  improvement  in  public  services,""  he  said.  Mr  Davis  said  Labour  had  been  responsible  for  ""huge  waste,  huge  overspending,  not  on  the  frontline  at  all  but  on  bureaucracy"".  ""The  public  face  a  choice  between  more  waste  and  more  taxes  with  this  government,  less  waste  and  lower  taxes  with  a  Tory  government,""  he  concluded.  |||    Gordon  Brown  has  addressed  the  conference  behind  closed  doors.  The  Chancellor  said  the  Conservatives'  plans  would  see  some  £50bn  in  spending  cuts  by  2011,  which  the  Tories  deny.  Mr  Brown  also  issued  call  for  party  unity  and  warn  of  the  dangers  of  allowing  themselves  to  be  ""distracted  or  diverted"".  According  to  an  advance  text  released  by  officials,  he  told  delegates:  ""We  must  all  show  the  strength  and  unity  of  purpose  to  take  the  long-term  decisions  necessary  to  meet  them.""  |||    Mr  Brown  warned  that  the  Tories  were  planning  ""the  biggest  cuts  ever  in  the  history  of  any  election  manifesto"".  Meanwhile,  Tory  shadow  chancellor  Oliver  Letwin  accused  Mr  Blair  of  ""misrepresenting""  the  party's  proposals  and  questioned  how  Labour  would  fund  its  own  plans.  ""He  still  cannot  accept  the  simple  truth,  which  is  that  we  will  spend  more  on  what  matters  to  people  -  schools,  hospitals  and  police  -  and  that  we  will  offer  value  for  money  and  lower  taxes,""  Mr  Letwin  said.  ""Once  again  Mr  Blair  and  his  Chancellor  have  failed  to  answer  the  question  that  lies  at  the  heart  of  this  election  -  which  taxes  will  they  put  up  to  fill  the  £8bn  shortfall  in  their  plans?""" 

1	"Wine  comedy  up  for  six  film  gongs  |||    Sideways,  a  wine-tasting  comedy  starring  Paul  Giamatti,  is  up  for  six  Independent  Spirit  Awards,  the  art-house  version  of  the  Oscars.  |||    The  awards  are  held  on  26  February,  the  day  before  the  Oscars.  Spanish  drama  Maria  Full  of  Grace,  about  a  Colombian  woman  who  becomes  a  drug  courier,  got  five  nominations.  Controversial  biopic  Kinsey,  starring  Liam  Neeson  as  sex  researcher  Alfred  Kinsey,  was  one  of  four  films  to  get  four  nominations.  The  awards,  now  in  their  20th  year,  honour  quirky  low-budget  films,  all  of  which  must  have  a  degree  of  independent  financing.  Sideways  is  written  and  directed  by  Alexander  Payne,  who  directed  the  2002  hit  About  Schmidt,  winning  Jack  Nicholson  his  12th  Academy  Award  nomination.  |||    ""These  awards,  for  better  or  worse,  mean  everything,""  said  Sideways  producer  Michael  London,  adding  they  were  a  ""huge  first  step""  toward  getting  recognition  from  other  awards.  Among  the  other  films  receiving  four  nominations  apiece  were  Brother  to  Brother,  a  drama  about  a  young  gay  black  man  forced  to  live  on  the  streets,  Robbing  Peter  and  Primer.  Primer,  a  $7,000  (£3,650)  tale  of  discovery,  won  top  prize  at  the  Sundance  film  festival  earlier  this  year.  Walter  Salles  critically  acclaimed  The  Motorcycle  Diaries  and  the  forthcoming  thriller  The  Woodsman,  starring  Kevin  Bacon,  received  three  nominations  each.  Also  in  the  running,  with  two  nominations,  are  high  school  comedy  Napoleon  Dynamite,  The  Door  in  the  Floor  and  Garden  State  -  written,  directed  and  starring  Scrubs  star  Zach  Braff  alongside  Natalie  Portman.  The  awards  were  announced  by  actors  Selma  Blair  and  Dennis  Quaid  in  Los  Angeles  on  Tuesday." 

1	"UK's  National  Gallery  in  the  pink  |||    The  National  Gallery,  home  to  some  of  the  UK's  greatest  artworks,  has  seen  a  big  jump  in  visitor  numbers.  |||    Five  million  visitors  made  the  London  gallery  -  which  houses  treasures  like  Raphael's  Madonna  of  the  Pinks  -  the  UK's  most  visited  museum  in  2004.  It  recorded  a  13.8%  rise  in  numbers  and  was  the  country's  second  most  visited  tourist  attraction,  behind  Blackpool  Pleasure  Beach.  Charles  Saumarez  Smith,  the  gallery's  director,  said  he  was  ""delighted"".  He  said  the  number  of  visitors  through  the  doors  had  boosted  figures  to  pre-11  September  2001  levels.  Mr  Saumarez  Smith  added  that  the  pedestrianisation  of  Trafalgar  Square,  where  the  gallery  is  located,  and  strong  temporary  collections  throughout  2004  had  led  to  the  strong  performance.  |||    ""Our  2004  exhibition  programme  of  El  Greco,  Russian  Landscape  in  the  Age  of  Tolstoy  and  Raphael:  From  Urbino  to  Rome  was  particularly  strong  and  exceeded  all  targets,""  he  said.  ""The  exceptional  quality  of  the  paintings  in  our  permanent  collection  is  also  huge  draw  for  the  public.  ""The  expectations  of  today's  visitors  are  higher  than  ever  and  we  have  kept  pace  with  their  demands.""  Mr  Saumarez  Smith  said  he  was  confident  the  gallery  could  maintain  the  attendance.  ""With  important  exhibitions  of  the  work  of  Caravaggio,  Stubbs  and  Rubens  in  place  for  2005,  I  am  confident  that  the  gallery  is  set  for  another  highly  successful  year,""  he  added.  The  figures  were  prepared  by  the  Association  of  Leading  Visitor  Attractions  (Alva).  |||    It  found  that  the  figures  had  been  boosted  by  an  increase  in  Europeans  travelling  to  the  UK  on  budget  airlines.  Popular  cultural  tourist  spots  such  as  the  Tate  Modern  and  the  Natural  History  Museum  all  recorded  increases  of  more  than  10%  in  visitor  numbers  compared  with  2003.  But  for  legal  or  confidentiality  reasons  some  Alva  members  did  not  submit  figures  for  2004,  including  Buckingham  Palace,  Windsor  Castle,  Madame  Tussauds  and  Alton  Towers.  Alva  director  Robin  Broke  said:  ""Visits  from  Western  Europe  were  up  by  10%  and  from  North  America  by  some  9%  compared  to  2003,  while  numbers  from  the  rest  of  the  world  rose  20%.  ""European  figures  were  helped  by  the  rapid  growth  of  low-cost  flights  to  Britain  from  Europe,  especially  from  new  EU  countries.""" 

2	"Tories  attack  EU  asylum  moves  |||    David  Blunkett  has  been  accused  of  using  the  ""politics  of  confusion""  to  disguise  new  EU  immigration  measures.  |||    Tory  spokesman  David  Davis  told  MPs  the  UK  was  losing  its  power  of  veto  over  who  was  allowed  to  come  to  Britain.  The  EU  has  opted  to  adopt  qualified  majority  voting  in  this  area  -  previously  measures  needed  unanimous  agreement  from  all  member  states.  Mr  Blunkett  told  MPs  the  UK  would  still  be  able  to  reject  proposals  on  immigration  it  did  not  agree  with.  |||    He  argued  closer  co-operation  with  Europe  over  asylum  and  immigration  was  crucial  to  controlling  the  flow  of  people  into  the  UK.  ""If  we  don't  like  what  other  EU  countries  do  on  immigration  and  nationality  we  have  the  right  to  opt-in  or  out  to  suit  the  British  people,""  he  said.  The  home  secretary  was  responding  to  an  emergency  question  from  his  Tory  opposite  number  Mr  Davis.  ""The  government  is  employing  the  politics  of  confusion  -  I  think,  deliberately,""  argued  Mr  Davis.  ""By  confusing  the  country  it  hopes  no  one  will  notice  the  disappearance  of  the  asylum  and  immigration  veto.""  On  Monday  Tony  Blair  insisted  closer  co-operation  did  not  mean  losing  control  of  British  borders.  He  said  an  enlarged  25-member  EU  needs  a  streamlined  decision  making  process.  Mr  Davis  said  once  Britain  had  opted  into  policies  then  it  could  not  opt  out  -  leaving  the  UK  open  to  unfavourable  interpretations  of  what  those  policies  actually  meant.  |||    He  accused  the  government  of  being  ""pathetic""  when  it  came  to  its  efforts  over  immigration  and  asylum  and  of  ""surrendering""  on  the  issue.  And  he  asked  why  the  government  was  agreeing  to  the  measure  on  asylum  and  immigration  now  when  the  whole  issue  was  part  of  the  EU  constitution,  which  voters  in  the  UK  had  been  promised  a  referendum  over.  Mr  Blair  told  his  monthly  news  conference  Britain  had  the  ""best  of  both  worlds""  and  would  keep  the  veto.  ""There  is  no  question  of  Britain  giving  up  our  veto  on  our  border  controls,""  he  said.  ""With  the  Treaty  of  Amsterdam  seven  years  ago,  we  secured  the  absolute  right  to  opt  in  to  any  of  the  asylum  and  immigration  provisions  that  we  wanted  to  in  Europe.""  Mr  Blunkett  met  his  EU  counterparts  in  Luxembourg  on  Monday  to  consider  proposals  aimed  at  streamlining  decision  making  on  the  issue.  |||    The  25  member-states  are  expected  to  scrap  the  requirement  for  unanimous  agreement  on  immigration  policy,  in  favour  of  the  qualified  majority  voting  (QMV)  system.  Under  this  scheme  larger  states  such  as  Britain  are  expected  to  have  more  power  than  the  smaller  EU  states.  Britain  is  expected  to  retain  an  ""opt-in""  right  which  will  allow  it  to  ignore  any  measures  it  disagrees  with.  Liberal  Democrat  spokesman  Mark  Oaten  called  the  change  pragmatic  and  argued  it  gave  a  better  chance  of  producing  a  European  asylum  solution.  ""If  we  don't  work  together  it  means  some  countries  can  ignore  their  responsibilities  at  the  expense  of  their  neighbours,""  said  Mr  Oaten.  ""The  Liberal  Democrats  have  long  argued  that  Britain  should  be  a  safe  haven  for  asylum  seekers  but  it's  right  that  we  don't  do  this  in  isolation."""

The  live  ceremony  will  be  broadcast  with  a  transmission  delay  on  US  network  ABC  to  ensure  swear  words  are  removed.  ""I've  been  on  TV  and  been  funny  not  cursing,""  he  said  during  an  interview  for  CBS  network's  60  Minutes  show.  ""As  far  as  content  is  concerned,  I  will  talk  about  the  movies.  I'm  not  really  worried  about  it.  I'm  sure  ABC  might  be  more  worried  about  it  than  me,""  he  added.  |||    The  40-year-old  comedian  caused  a  furore  when  he  said  in  an  interview  with  US  magazine  Entertainment  Weekly  recently  that  he  hardly  ever  watched  the  Oscars  and  labelled  awards  ceremonies  ""idiotic"".  The  show's  producers  defended  Rock  and  confirmed  that  he  would  still  be  presenting  the  Oscar  ceremony,  saying  his  comments  were  ""humorous  digs"".  Meanwhile,  the  Academy  has  announced  that  Oscar-nominated  actress  Natalie  Portman  will  present  an  award  at  the  ceremony.  Portman,  who  has  been  nominated  for  a  best  supporting  actress  gong  for  her  role  in  Mike  Nichols'  Closer,  joins  a  growing  list  of  stars  set  to  bestow  an  award  at  the  ceremony  including  Dustin  Hoffman,  Drew  Barrymore,  Renee  Zellweger  and  British-born  actress  Kate  Winslet."

The  quirky  disco-rock  band  beat  The  Red  Hot  Chili  Peppers  who  came  second  for  their  Hyde  Park  performance  in  June.  Virgin  Radio  DJ  Pete  Mitchell  said:  ""This  year  has  seen  an  amazing  array  of  talent  come  into  the  mainstream.""

1	"Public  show  for  Reynolds  portrait  |||    Sir  Joshua  Reynolds'  Portrait  of  Omai  will  get  a  public  airing  following  fears  it  would  stay  hidden  because  of  an  export  wrangle.  |||    The  Tate  Gallery  unsuccessfully  tried  to  buy  the  picture  from  its  anonymous  owner  after  a  ban  was  issued  preventing  the  painting  from  leaving  the  UK.  The  18th  Century  painting  has  remained  in  storage  but  the  owner  has  agreed  to  allow  it  to  be  part  of  an  exhibition.  The  exhibition  of  Reynolds'  work  will  be  shown  at  Tate  Britain  from  May.  Joshua  Reynolds:  The  Creation  of  Celebrity  will  feature  prints,  caricatures,  and  sculpture  by  the  18th  Century  artist,  who  painted  some  of  the  most  famous  personalities  of  his  day.  Portrait  of  Omai  fetched  the  second  highest  amount  for  a  British  painting  when  it  was  sold  at  auction  for  £10.3m  in  2001.  It  was  bought  by  a  London  dealer  who  sold  it  on  to  a  collector.  The  unnamed  collector  wanted  to  take  it  out  of  the  country,  but  was  barred  from  doing  so  by  the  government  because  of  its  historical  significance.  |||    In  March  2004,  the  Tate  managed  to  raise  £12.5m  funding  to  buy  the  portrait  but  the  owner  refused  to  sell  and  it  has  been  held  in  storage  since.  The  portrait  is  of  a  young  man  who  was  dubbed  ""the  noble  savage""  when  he  arrived  in  London  from  Polynesia.  He  became  a  darling  of  London  society  and  was  invited  to  all  the  best  parties  by  people  who  were  fascinated  by  such  an  exotic  character.  Sir  Joshua  painted  him  after  his  arrival  in  1774,  and  it  became  the  artist's  most  famous  work  after  it  was  first  exhibited  at  the  Royal  Academy  in  1776." 

2	"Act  on  detention  ruling,  UK  urged  |||    The  government  must  act  quickly  on  the  Law  Lords'  ruling  that  detention  of  foreign  terror  suspects  without  trial  is  unlawful,  Mary  Robinson  has  said.  |||    The  former  UN  commissioner  for  human  rights  and  Irish  president  told  Radio  4's  Today  the  government's  response  would  be  scrutinised  internationally.  ""It  would  be  very  troubling  if  the  government  did  not  accept  the  judgement  and  then  work  within  it,""  she  said.  Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  has  said  detainees  will  not  be  freed  at  present.  Speaking  to  Parliament  on  his  first  day  in  office  as  home  secretary  following  David  Blunkett's  resignation,  Mr  Clarke  said:  ""I  will  be  asking  Parliament  to  renew  this  legislation  in  the  New  Year.  ""In  the  meantime,  we  will  be  studying  the  judgement  carefully  to  see  whether  it  is  possible  to  modify  our  legislation  to  address  the  concerns  raised  by  the  House  of  Lords.""  |||    Mrs  Robinson  said  the  Law  Lords'  ruling  was  ""in  line  with  international  legal  opinion""  and  praised  their  ""very  decisive""  eight  to  one  majority.  ""What  the  Law  Lords  did  was  acknowledge  the  role  of  the  government,  but  say  that  there  had  been  a  disproportionate  use,  that  it  amounted  to  executive  detention  and  it  was  discriminatory  because  it  didn't  apply  to  British  citizens,""  she  said.  |||    Mrs  Robinson  warned  that  a  lack  of  action  by  the  British  government  could  lead  to  further  action  in  legal  arenas  such  as  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights  in  Strasbourg.  ""If  the  government  were  not  to  accept  this  ruling  then  there  is  further  redress,  including  possible  damages  for  the  individuals  who  could  claim  that  the  government  either  was  tardy  or  was  resisting  the  implications  of  the  judgement  of  the  Law  Lords.""  She  said  a  meeting  of  the  Club  of  Madrid  -  a  group  of  former  world  leaders  -  to  be  held  in  the  Spanish  capital  on  the  March  anniversary  of  the  train  bombings  there  would  probably  discuss  the  ruling  and  its  implications.  ""I  have  no  doubt  that  this  judgement  will  be  looked  at,  both  as  a  very  positive  step  in  clarifying  the  law  and  restating  the  fundamental  principles,  but  also  the  response  of  the  British  government  will  be  under  quite  a  clear  international  scrutiny  there.""  |||    The  detainees  took  their  case  to  the  House  of  Lords  after  the  Court  of  Appeal  backed  the  Home  Office's  powers  to  hold  them  without  limit  or  charge.  The  government  opted  out  of  part  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  concerning  the  right  to  a  fair  trial  in  order  to  bring  in  anti-terrorism  legislation  in  response  to  the  11  September  attacks  in  the  US.  Any  foreign  national  suspected  of  links  with  terrorism  can  be  detained  or  can  opt  to  be  deported.  The  Law  Lords  said  the  rules  were  incompatible  with  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  as  they  allowed  detentions  ""in  a  way  that  discriminates  on  the  ground  of  nationality  or  immigration  status"".  The  case  was  heard  by  a  panel  of  nine  law  lords  rather  than  the  usual  five  because  of  the  constitutional  importance  of  the  case." 

2	"PM  apology  over  jailings  |||    Tony  Blair  has  apologised  to  two  families  who  suffered  one  of  the  UK's  biggest  miscarriages  of  justice.  |||    The  prime  minister  was  commenting  on  the  wrongful  jailing  of  11  people  for  IRA  bomb  attacks  on  pubs  in  Guildford  and  Woolwich  in  1974.  Mr  Blair  said:  ""I  am  very  sorry  that  they  were  subject  to  such  an  ordeal  and  injustice.""  He  made  the  apology  to  members  of  the  Conlon  and  Maguire  families  in  his  private  room  at  Westminster.  In  a  statement  recorded  for  television,  Mr  Blair  said  the  families  deserved  ""to  be  completely  and  publicly  exonerated"".  |||    The  families  had  hoped  the  apology  would  be  made  during  Prime  Minister's  Questions  in  the  House  of  Commons.  However,  one  of  the  so-called  Guildford  Four,  Gerry  Conlon  -  who  was  wrongly  convicted  of  planting  the  bombs  -  said  the  families  were  delighted  with  the  apology.  He  said  Mr  Blair  had  spoken  with  ""such  sincerity"",  adding:  ""He  went  beyond  what  we  thought  he  would,  he  took  time  to  listen  to  everyone.  ""You  could  see  he  was  moved  by  what  people  were  saying.  ""Tony  Blair  has  healed  rifts,  he  is  helping  to  heal  wounds.  It's  a  day  I  never  thought  would  come.""  The  move  followed  a  huge  campaign  in  Ireland  for  a  public  apology  after  eleven  people  were  wrongly  convicted  of  making  and  planting  the  IRA  bombs  which  killed  seven  people.  Mr  Blair's  official  spokesman  said  no-one  present  at  the  meeting  would  ""ever  forget  the  strength  of  feeling  of  relief  that  the  prime  minister's  statement  brought  to  them"".  |||    Most  of  those  convicted  were  either  members  or  friends  of  the  two  families.  All  were  arrested  because  of  a  family  connection  to  Gerry  Conlon.  Mr  Conlon's  father  Giuseppe  was  arrested  when  travelling  to  London  from  Belfast  to  help  his  son.  He  died  while  serving  his  sentence.  Also  arrested  were  Anne  Maguire  and  members  of  her  family.  Mrs  Maguire  was  the  relative  with  whom  Giuseppe  planned  to  stay  in  London,  as  well  as  two  family  friends.  She  said  it  was  a  ""wonderful  feeling""  to  have  had  the  apology  and  that  a  weight  had  been  lifted  off  her  shoulders.  |||    ""The  people  who  were  still  doubting  us  should  now  believe  that  we  were  totally  innocent,""  she  said.  They  were  all  jailed  for  handling  explosives,  based  on  scientific  evidence  which  was  later  entirely  discredited.  In  October  1989  the  Court  of  Appeal  quashed  the  sentences  of  the  Guildford  Four,  and  in  June  1991  it  overturned  the  sentences  on  the  Maguire  Seven.  Mr  Conlon's  case  was  highlighted  in  the  Oscar-nominated  film  In  The  Name  Of  The  Father,  starring  Daniel  Day-Lewis."

Festival  director  Dieter  Kosslick  says  this  strong  showing  signals  ""a  new  consciousness  for  European  films"".  ""They're  on  an  incredible  winning  streak,""  he  told  the  Reuters  agency.  ""This  isn't  to  say  there  aren't  any  good  American  films,""  he  continued.  ""It's  just  that  there  are  more  good  European  films.""  |||    However,  Mr  Kosslick  refused  to  accept  that  widespread  opposition  to  the  Iraq  war  had  turned  audiences  against  Hollywood  imports.  ""There  is  no  anti-American  mood,""  he  said.  Some  350  films  will  be  screened  at  this  year's  festival,  with  a  further  300  shown  at  the  European  Film  Market  that  runs  alongside  it.  More  than  a  dozen  celebrities  are  scheduled  to  attend,  among  them  Will  Smith,  Kevin  Spacey  and  Keanu  Reeves.  But  Mr  Kosslick  says  more  would  be  coming  had  the  Academy  Awards  not  been  brought  forward  to  27  February.  ""I'm  not  worried  that  we  won't  be  able  to  fill  the  red  carpet  with  stars,""  he  said,  though  he  admitted  the  festival  may  be  moved  to  January  next  year  to  avoid  a  similar  clash.  The  10-day  Berlinale  runs  until  20  February."

The  gain  in  non-farm  payrolls  was  below  market  expectations  of  190,000  new  jobs.  Nevertheless  it  was  enough  to  push  down  the  unemployment  rate  to  5.2%,  its  lowest  level  since  September  2001.  The  job  gains  mean  that  President  Bush  can  celebrate  -  albeit  by  a  very  fine  margin  -  a  net  growth  in  jobs  in  the  US  economy  in  his  first  term  in  office.  He  presided  over  a  net  fall  in  jobs  up  to  last  November's  Presidential  election  -  the  first  President  to  do  so  since  Herbert  Hoover.  As  a  result,  job  creation  became  a  key  issue  in  last  year's  election.  However,  when  adding  December  and  January's  figures,  the  administration's  first  term  jobs  record  ended  in  positive  territory.  |||    The  Labor  Department  also  said  it  had  revised  down  the  jobs  gains  in  December  2004,  from  157,000  to  133,000.  |||    Analysts  said  the  growth  in  new  jobs  was  not  as  strong  as  could  be  expected  given  the  favourable  economic  conditions.  ""It  suggests  that  employment  is  continuing  to  expand  at  a  moderate  pace,""  said  Rick  Egelton,  deputy  chief  economist  at  BMO  Financial  Group.  ""We  are  not  getting  the  boost  to  employment  that  we  would  have  got  given  the  low  value  of  the  dollar  and  the  still  relatively  low  interest  rate  environment.""  ""The  economy  is  producing  a  moderate  but  not  a  satisfying  amount  of  job  growth,""  said  Ken  Mayland,  president  of  ClearView  Economics.  ""That  means  there  are  a  limited  number  of  new  opportunities  for  workers."""

The  BBC  denied  it  had  lost  a  bidding  war,  saying  it  had  ""decided  to  pass  the  mantle  to  another  broadcaster"".  The  ceremony,  hosted  by  newcomer  Chris  Rock,  takes  place  on  27  February  2005.  |||    Sky's  coverage  will  launch  with  the  nominations  on  25  January  and  will  include  themed  programming  across  Sky  channels  including  Sky  News,  Sky  Travel  and  the  Biography  Channel.  There  will  also  be  a  month-long  season  of  Oscar-winning  films  on  Sky  Movies  in  the  run  up  to  the  event  and  live  uninterrupted  coverage  on  the  night.  ""We  are  honoured  to  have  won  the  live  and  exclusive  broadcasting  rights  for  The  Academy  Awards,""  said  Sky  Networks'  Sophie  Turner  Laing.  ""Sky  is  the  natural  place  to  see  the  biggest  and  most  prestigious  film  event  of  the  year,  and  will  cover  the  event  in  a  way  that  no  other  broadcaster  could.""  |||    Sky  first  scooped  Oscar  rights  from  the  BBC  in  1999,  but  the  BBC  won  them  back  in  2001  when  Sky  was  forced  to  pull  out  of  a  bidding  war  due  to  financial  constraints.  ""BBC  viewers  will  of  course  be  able  to  watch  quality  coverage  of  the  2005  Academy  Awards  on  the  BBC's  bulletins  and  news  programmes,""  a  spokesman  said.  Among  the  films  tipped  to  do  well  at  this  year's  Academy  Awards  are  Martin  Scorsese's  The  Aviator,  Jean-Pierre  Jeunet's  A  Very  Long  Engagement  and  the  Ray  Charles  biopic,  Ray."

The  rapper's  spokesman  said  the  allegations  were  ""untrue""  and  the  woman  was  ""misusing  the  legal  system  as  a  means  of  extracting  financial  gain"".  ABC  said  the  claims  had  ""no  merit"".  The  star  has  not  been  charged  by  police.  |||    The  lawsuit,  filed  in  Los  Angeles  on  Friday,  says  the  woman's  champagne  was  spiked  and  she  was  then  assaulted.  The  rapper's  spokesperson  said:  ""Snoop  will  have  the  opportunity  to  prove  in  a  court  of  law  that  [the  alleged  victim]  is  opportunistic  and  deceitful.

The  legal  action  comes  after  the  rap  star  sued  a  woman  who  claimed  they  tried  to  blackmail  him  to  keep  quiet  about  an  alleged  assault.  The  32-year-old  rapper  has  enjoyed  six  US  top  10  albums  since  bursting  onto  the  music  scene  with  hit  songs  like  What's  My  Name?  and  Gin  and  Juice  in  1993."

""The  players  are  really  down  in  the  dressing-room.  I  feel  we  really  turned  in  a  bad  performance.  ""At  3-0  we  faced  a  real  struggle,  but  3-1  at  least  gives  us  a  chance.""  |||    Goalscorer  Toure  was  also  at  fault  for  two  goals,  and  Wenger  said:  ""We  need  to  help  Toure  rebuild  his  confidence  as  he  is  low  at  the  moment.""  Wenger  also  tried  to  stay  upbeat  himself,  adding:  ""But  there  is  enough  time  for  crying.  I  could  cry  -  maybe  it  would  be  easier  -  but  life  goes  on.  ""In  this  job,  you  have  good  and  bad  nights.  This  was  a  bad  night  -  but  I  still  have  confidence  in  the  quality  of  my  players,  as  well  as  their  spirit  and  desire.""  But  Wenger's  Bayern  counterpart  Felix  Magath  was  in  no  mood  to  celebrate  either.  He  said:  ""I  am  far  from  happy  despite  the  win.  My  players  failed  to  try  and  score  a  fourth  to  kill  the  tie  and  then  conceded  the  late  goal.  |||    ""Arsenal  are  fully  capable  of  scoring  several  goals  against  us  on  their  own  turf.""

0	"US  bank  boss  hails  'genius'  Smith  |||    US  Federal  Reserve  chairman  Alan  Greenspan  has  given  a  speech  at  a  Scottish  church  in  honour  of  the  pioneering  economist,  Adam  Smith.  |||    He  delivered  the  14th  Adam  Smith  Lecture  in  Kirkcaldy,  Fife.  The  Adam  Smith  Lecture  celebrates  the  author  of  1776's  Wealth  of  Nations,  which  became  a  bible  of  capitalism.  Dr  Greenspan  was  invited  by  Chancellor  Gordon  Brown,  whose  minister  father  John  used  to  preach  at  the  St  Bryce  Kirk  church.  Mr  Brown  introduced  Dr  Greenspan  to  the  400  invited  guests  as  the  ""the  world's  greatest  economist"".  Dr  Greenspan,  79,  who  has  been  in  the  UK  to  attend  the  G7  meeting  in  London,  said  the  world  could  never  repay  the  debt  of  gratitude  it  owed  to  Smith,  whose  genius  he  compared  to  that  of  Mozart.  |||    He  said  the  philosopher  was  a  ""towering  contributor  to  the  modern  world"".  ""Kirkcaldy,  the  birthplace  in  1723  of  Adam  Smith  and,  by  extension,  of  modern  economics,  is  also  of  course,  where  your  chancellor  was  reared.  ""I  am  led  to  ponder  to  what  extent  the  chancellor's  renowned  economic  and  financial  skills  are  the  result  of  exposure  to  the  subliminal  intellect-enhancing  emanation  in  this  area.""  He  continued:  ""Smith  reached  far  beyond  the  insights  of  his  predecessors  to  frame  a  global  view  of  how  market  economics,  just  then  emerging,  worked.  ""In  so  doing  he  supported  changes  in  societal  organisation  that  were  to  measurably  enhance  standards  of  living.""  |||    Dr  Greenspan  said  Smith's  revolutionary  philosophy  on  human  self-interest,  laissez-faire  economics  and  competition  had  been  a  force  for  good  in  the  world.  ""The  incredible  insights  of  a  handful  of  intellectuals  of  the  Enlightenment  -  especially  with  Smith  toiling  in  the  environs  of  Kirkcaldy  -  created  the  modern  vision  of  people  free  to  choose  and  to  act  according  to  their  individual  self-interest,""  he  said.  Following  his  lecture,  Dr  Greenspan  -  who  received  an  honorary  knighthood  from  the  Queen  at  Balmoral  in  2002  -  was  awarded  an  honorary  fellowship  of  the  Royal  Society  of  Edinburgh.  He  later  opened  an  exhibition  dedicated  to  Smith  in  the  atrium  of  Fife  College  of  Further  and  Higher  Education.  Joyce  Johnston,  principal  of  the  college,  said:  ""It  is  very  fitting  that  the  world's  premier  economist  delivered  this  lecture  in  tribute  to  the  world's  first  economist.""  Dr  Greenspan  -  who  became  chairman  of  the  Federal  Reserve  for  an  unprecedented  fifth  term  in  June  2004  -  will  step  down  in  January  next  year.  He  has  served  under  Presidents  George  W  Bush,  Bill  Clinton,  George  Bush,  and  Ronald  Reagan.  He  was  also  chairman  of  the  council  of  economic  advisors  to  Gerald  Ford."

As  a  hydroelectric-power  generator  it  has  not  been  hurt  by  higher  coal  costs.  Net  income  jumped  to  3bn  yuan  in  2004  ($365m;  £190m),  compared  with  1.4bn  yuan  in  2003.  Sales  surged  to  6.2bn  yuan,  from  3bn  yuan  a  year  earlier.  The  figures  topped  analysts  expectations,  even  though  the  rate  of  growth  has  slowed  from  2003.  Analysts  forecast  that  it  is  likely  to  decline  further  this  year  to  a  rate  of  expansion  of  closer  to  20%.  |||    Yangtze  Electric  has  been  expanding  its  output  to  meet  demand  driven  by  China's  booming  economy.  The  government  has  delayed  the  building  of  a  number  of  power  plants  in  an  effort  to  rein  in  growth  amid  concerns  that  the  economy  may  overheat.  That  has  led  to  an  energy  crunch,  with  demand  outstripping  supply.  Earlier  this  month,  work  was  halted  on  an  underground  power  station,  and  a  supply  unit  on  the  Three  Gorges  Dam,  as  well  as  a  power  station  on  its  sister  Xiluodu  dam  because  of  environmental  worries.  A  total  of  30  large-scale  projects  have  been  halted  across  the  country  for  similar  reasons.  The  Three  Gorges  Dam  project  has  led  to  more  than  half  a  million  people  being  relocated  and  drawn  criticism  from  environmental  groups  and  overseas  human  rights  activists.  Its  sister  project,  the  Xiluodu  Dam,  is  being  built  on  the  Jinshajiang  -  or  ""river  of  golden  sand""  as  the  upper  reaches  of  the  Yangtze  are  known."

""It's  a  loss  (to  Milan),  but  it  could  be  worse  if  they  didn't  have  such  quality  to  bring  in,""  Ferguson  said.  ""How  much  they  miss  him  I  think  they'll  know  tomorrow  night.""  Ferguson  said  Milan's  front  line  would  still  represent  a  formidable  challenge  for  his  defenders.  ""They  can  play  Rui  Costa  and  play  Kaka  forward.  They  can  bring  Serginho  in  and  they  can  play  (Jon  Dahl)  Tomasson,""  he  said.  Ferguson's  own  goalscoring  talisman  Ruud  van  Nistelrooy  is  fit  again,  but  the  Scot  admitted  he  was  unsure  whether  to  start  the  Dutchman,  who  has  not  played  for  three  months.  |||    ""Ruud  is  the  best  striker  in  Europe.  What  I  have  to  judge  is  whether  he  will  struggle  with  the  early  pace  after  being  out  for  so  long,""  he  said.  ""His  ability  puts  him  in  with  a  big  shout  but  it  is  a  major  decision.""  Ferguson,  though,  is  confident  his  young  players,  particularly  Wayne  Rooney  and  Cristiano  Ronaldo,  are  up  to  the  task.  ""We  have  an  opportunity  to  win  this  cup  this  year,  no  question  about  that,""  he  declared.  ""With  the  maturity  we  see  every  week  in  Ronaldo  and  Rooney,  the  return  of  Van  Nistelrooy  and  the  form  of  Roy  Keane,  Paul  Scholes  and  Ryan  Giggs,  we  must  have  a  fantastic  chance.""  It  is  a  view  shared  by  Rooney,  who  believes  ""if  we  can  get  past  Milan,  we  have  a  great  chance"".  ""As  soon  as  I  knew  we  were  playing  Milan,  I  got  excited.  Looking  at  the  draw,  it  is  anyone's  trophy  but  we  have  every  chance.  ""Hopefully,  we  can  get  to  that  final  in  Turkey  and  bring  the  cup  back  to  Manchester.""  Milan  coach  Carlo  Ancelotti  said  his  team  were  looking  forward  to  returning  to  the  venue  where  they  lifted  Europe's  most  prestigious  club  title  two  seasons  ago.

Ancelotti  said  he  was  aware  of  the  threat  United  posed  to  his  hopes  of  Champions  League  glory.  ""It's  fundamental  that  we  don't  allow  them  to  take  control  of  the  game.  Our  intention  is  not  to  adapt  to  their  play  but  to  play  our  game,""  he  said.  ""They  have  great  quality  in  attack,  they  use  the  wings  a  lot  and  we  will  have  to  make  sure  we  stop  them."""

The  lawsuit  said  the  star  has  endured  mental  and  physical  injuries  as  a  result  of  the  alleged  incident.  ""We  are  not  able  to  comment  on  pending  litigation,""  Revolution  Studios  spokesman  Sean  Dudas  said.  |||    In  Tears  of  the  Sun  Willis  plays  a  US  military  commander  who  disobeys  orders  to  try  and  help  save  a  doctor  and  patients  trapped  in  the  Nigerian  jungle.  Directed  by  Antoine  Fuqua,  the  film  was  poorly  received  by  critics  and  did  not  perform  strongly  at  the  box  office.  According  to  the  lawsuit,  the  injury  was  suffered  during  the  firing  of  explosions  as  part  of  a  special  effect.  The  explosions,  known  as  squibs,  were  intended  to  ""simulate  the  appearance  of  bullets  striking  the  ground"".

0	"Water  firm  Suez  in  Argentina  row  |||    A  conflict  between  the  Argentine  State  and  water  firm  Aguas  Argentinas,  controlled  by  France's  Suez,  is  casting  doubt  on  the  firm's  future.  |||    The  firm,  which  serves  the  province  of  Buenos  Aires,  wants  a  tariff  rise  of  60%  to  fund  water-supply  improvements.  The  government  has  rejected  the  60%  rise  and  wants  Aguas  Argentinas  to  make  an  annual  investment  of  400m  pesos  ($136m;  £72.3m)  in  improvements.  Planning  Minister  Julio  De  Vido  has  offered  State  help  but  not  for  ""free"".  |||    Mr  De  Vido  said  that  the  Argentine  state  would  not  make  a  contribution  ""in  the  form  of  a  subsidy"".  |||    He  has  said  a  contribution  could  be  made  in  return  for  a  seat  on  the  company's  board.  He  added  that  the  government  is  in  discussions  with  Aguas  Argentinas  about  what  role  it  might  take  in  the  event  that  a  State  contribution  is  agreed.  However,  Aguas  Argentinas  told  the  Argentine  newspaper  Clarin  it  would  not  accept  any  change  to  its  legal  structure  and,  in  practice,  this  rules  out  State  participation  on  its  board.  The  Planning  Minister  didn't  rule  out  the  possibility  of  cancelling  Aguas  Argentinas  water  concession.  Yet  he  added  that  he  didn't  like  to  do  ""futurology"".  But  last  week,  Argentine  Economic  Minister,  Roberto  Lavagna,  told  the  French  media  in  Paris  that  the  government  was  considering  allowing  a  16%  increase  in  tariffs  and  the  possibility  of  a  State  contribution  to  Aguas  Argentinas  infrastructure  investments.  Speaking  in  Buenos  Aires,  Mr  De  Vido  later  denied  the  possibility  of  any  tariff  increase  and  insisted  that  the  annual  investment  in  water  infrastructure  was  at  the  centre  of  the  discussions.  He  added  that  in  the  coming  weeks  the  future  of  Aguas  Argentinas  would  be  decided.  Suez  owns  40%  of  Aguas  Argentinas  (39.9%),  while  Spain's  Aguas  de  Barcelona  is  its  second  biggest  shareholder  with  25.01%.  Recently,  Suez  lost  a  water  concession  in  Bolivia  after  mass  protests  in  the  city  of  El  Alto  (the  poorest  in  the  country),  with  citizens  complaining  of  unfair  water  charges.  This  forced  the  government  to  cancel  the  contract.  |||    In  Argentina,  Suez's  subsidiary,  which  has  been  fined  for  cutting  the  supply  of  water  during  a  recent  heat  wave  and  allegedly  failing  to  keep  up  investment  to  meet  the  demand  for  water,  has  maintained  a  tense  relationship  with  the  Argentine  government.  During  the  last  financial  crisis  in  Argentina,  the  firm  sued  the  state  alleging  that  converting  its  tariffs  from  US  dollars  to  pesos,  and  then  freezing  them  during  devaluation,  had  affected  the  company  and  made  it  difficult  for  it  to  meet  its  contractual  obligations.  When  President  Nestor  Kirchner  of  Argentina  arrived  in  power  he  began  to  negotiate  a  solution  to  the  disagreements  with  international  utilities  operating  in  Argentina.  But  he  has  rejected  any  tariff  increases,  alleging  this  will  impoverish  citizens  further.  He  has  also  asked  for  more  investments  to  meet  the  growing  demand  for  water.  On  May  2004,  Aguas  Argentinas  and  the  government  signed  an  agreement  to  renegotiate  its  Buenos  Aires  water-concession  contract.  The  firm  agreed  to  invest  242m  pesos.  The  issue  has  attracted  European  interest.  Last  week  in  Paris,  President  Kirchner  discussed  this  problem  and  other  issues  with  French  president  Jacques  Chirac.  The  Argentine  government  is  also  under  pressure  from  European  Union  countries  and  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  to  raise  utilities  tariffs,  because  most  of  the  utilities  operating  in  Argentina  are  European."

Other  firms  have  also  expressed  an  interest  in  MCI,  the  second-largest  US  long-distance  phone  firm,  and  may  now  table  rival  bids,  analysts  said.  Shares  in  MCI,  which  changed  its  name  from  Worldcom  when  it  emerged  from  bankruptcy,  were  up  2.4%  at  $20.15.  Press  reports  suggest  that  Qwest  and  MCI  may  reach  an  agreement  as  early  as  next  week,  although  rival  bids  may  muddy  the  waters.  The  largest  US  telephone  company  Verizon  has  previously  held  preliminary  merger  discussions  with  MCI,  Reuters  quoted  sources  as  saying.  |||    Consolidation  in  the  US  telecommunications  industry  has  picked  up  in  the  past  few  months  as  companies  look  to  cut  costs  and  boost  client  bases.  A  merger  between  MCI  and  Qwest  would  be  the  fifth  billion-dollar  telecoms  deal  since  October.  Last  week,  SBC  Communications  agreed  to  buy  its  former  parent  and  phone  trailblazer  AT&T  for  about  $16bn.  Competition  has  intensified  and  fixed-line  phone  providers  such  as  MCI  and  AT&T  have  seen  themselves  overtaken  by  rivals.  Buying  MCI  would  give  Qwest,  a  local  phone  service  provider,  access  to  MCI's  global  network  and  business-based  subscribers.  MCI  also  offers  internet  services.  |||    MCI  was  renamed  after  it  emerged  from  Chapter  11  bankruptcy  protection  in  April  last  year.  It  hit  the  headlines  as  Worldcom  in  2002  after  admitting  it  illegally  booked  expenses  and  inflated  profits.  The  scandal  was  a  key  factor  in  a  global  slide  in  share  prices  and  the  reverberations  are  still  being  felt  today.  Shareholders  lost  about  $180bn  when  the  company  collapsed,  while  20,000  workers  lost  their  jobs.  Former  Worldcom  boss  Bernie  Ebbers  is  currently  on  trial,  accused  of  overseeing  an  $11bn  fraud." 

1	"'Landmark  movies'  of  2004  hailed  |||    US  film  professionals  have  declared  Fahrenheit  9/11  and  The  Passion  of  the  Christ  as  two  of  the  most  significant  cultural  milestones  of  2004.  |||    The  American  Film  Institute  (AFI)  hailed  Mel  Gibson's  biblical  epic  and  Michael  Moore's  political  documentary  as  inspiring  national  debate.  It  claimed  both  film-makers  ""tossed  Hollywood  convention  out  the  window"".  The  Institute  also  cited  the  death  of  actor  Marlon  Brando  and  the  changing  landscape  of  TV  news  in  the  US.  In  referring  to  Marlon  Brando's  death  on  1  July  at  the  age  of  80,  the  13-strong  AFI  jury  concluded  ""the  art  of  screen  acting  has  two  chapters  -  'Before  Brando'  and  'After  Brando'.  |||    It  credited  the  screen  legend's  ""raw  hypnotic  energy""  and  his  ability  to  create  characters  like  Stanley  Kowalski  and  Terry  Malloy  ""that  will  live  forever  in  the  annals  of  film  history"".  The  list  also  acknowledges  key  influences  and  trends  in  the  world  of  film  and  broadcasting.  Among  current  trends,  it  highlighted  the  final  broadcasts  of  veteran  newscasters  Tom  Brokaw,  Barbara  Walters  and  the  impending  retirement  of  CBS  news  anchor  Dan  Rather.  It  its  place,  the  AFI  fears,  is  a  news  landscape  where  ""newscasters  are  more  personalities  than  journalists""  and  balance  and  integrity  are  increasingly  ignored.  |||    The  AFI  also  questioned  ""the  long-term  viability  of  evening  news  broadcasts"",  in  the  light  of  24-hour  news  channels  and  the  internet.  The  list  also  draws  attention  to  the  growing  influence  of  US  broadcasting  regulator,  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  (FCC)  |||    The  institute  concluded  the  threat  of  regulation,  which  went  into  freefall  following  Janet  Jackson's  'wardrobe  malfunction'  during  a  live  Super  Bowl  performance  in  February,  ""had  a  profound  effect  on  television"".  ""Unsure  of  how  the  FCC  will  rule  on  an  issue,  the  creative  community  has  begun  to  self-censor  their  shows,  a  disturbing  trend  in  a  country  founded  on  free  expression,""  the  AFI  jury  declared.  To  illustrate  their  point,  the  AFI  cited  ABC  affiliates  refusal  to  air  Steven  Spielberg's  film  Saving  Private  Ryan  in  an  unedited  form  over  fears  of  possible  fines." 

2	"Watchdog  probes  e-mail  deletions  |||    The  information  commissioner  says  he  is  urgently  asking  for  details  of  Cabinet  Office  orders  telling  staff  to  delete  e-mails  more  than  three  months  old.  |||    Richard  Thomas  ""totally  condemned""  the  deletion  of  e-mails  to  prevent  their  disclosure  under  freedom  of  information  laws  coming  into  force  on  1  January.  Government  guidance  said  e-mails  should  only  be  deleted  if  they  served  ""no  current  purpose"",  Mr  Thomas  said.  The  Tories  and  the  Lib  Dems  have  questioned  the  timing  of  the  new  rules.  |||    Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  has  written  to  Tony  Blair  demanding  an  explanation  of  the  new  rules  on  e-mail  retention.  On  Monday  Lib  Dem  constitutional  affairs  committee  chairman  Alan  Beith  warned  that  the  deletion  of  millions  of  government  e-mails  could  harm  the  ability  of  key  probes  like  the  Hutton  Inquiry.  The  timing  of  the  new  rules  just  before  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act  comes  into  forces  was  ""too  unlikely  to  have  been  a  coincidence"",  Mr  Beith  said.  But  a  Cabinet  Office  spokeswoman  said  the  move  was  not  about  the  new  laws  or  ""the  destruction  of  important  records"".  Mr  Beith  urged  the  information  commissioner  to  look  at  how  the  ""e-mail  regime""  could  ""support  the  freedom  of  information  regime"".  |||    Mr  Thomas  said:  ""The  new  Act  of  Parliament  makes  it  very  clear  that  to  destroy  records  in  order  to  prevent  their  disclosure  becomes  a  criminal  offence.""  He  said  there  was  already  clear  guidance  on  the  retention  of  e-mails  contained  in  a  code  of  practice  from  the  lord  chancellor.  All  e-mails  are  subject  to  the  freedom  of  information  laws,  but  the  important  thing  was  the  content  of  the  e-mail,  said  Mr  Thomas.  |||    ""If  in  doubt  retain,  that  has  been  the  long-standing  principle  of  the  civil  service  and  public  authorities.  It's  only  when  you've  got  no  further  use  for  the  particular  record  that  it  may  be  legitimate  to  destroy  it.  ""But  any  deliberate  destruction  to  avoid  the  possibility  of  later  disclosure  is  to  be  totally  condemned.""  The  Freedom  of  Information  Act  will  cover  England,  Wales  and  Northern  Ireland  from  next  year.  Similar  measures  are  being  brought  in  at  the  same  time  in  Scotland.  It  provides  the  public  with  a  right  of  access  to  information  held  by  about  100,000  public  bodies,  subject  to  various  exemptions.  Its  implementation  will  be  monitored  by  the  information  commissioner." 

2	"Pre-poll  clash  on  tax  and  spend  |||    Labour  and  the  Tories  have  clashed  over  tax  and  spending  plans  as  the  row  over  Gordon  Brown's  Budget  turned  into  a  full  scale  pre-election  battle.  |||    Tony  Blair  claimed  a  Tory  government  would  ""cut""  £35bn  from  public  services  hitting  schools,  hospitals  and  police.  Tory  chairman  Liam  Fox  accused  Labour  of  ""at  best  misrepresentation  at  worst  a  downright  lie""  and  said  the  ""smear""  tactics  were  a  sign  of  desperation.  The  Lib  Dems  accused  Mr  Brown  of  ducking  the  issue  of  council  tax  rises.  |||    Appearing  together  at  a  Labour  poster  launch,  the  prime  minister  hailed  his  chancellor's  ""brilliant""  performance.  And  he  claimed  the  Tories  would  cut  £35bn  from  public  services,  which  was  the  equivalent  of  sacking  every  doctor  and  teacher  in  the  UK.  |||    The  Tories  said  they  would  not  cut  spending  but  agreed  public  spending  would  increase  more  slowly  under  their  plans  -  leading  to  a  total  of  £33.5bn  less  spending  than  that  anticipated  by  Labour  by  2011.  But  they  say  not  a  single  doctor,  teacher  or  nurse  will  be  cut.  Dr  Fox  said:  ""We  have  said  we  will  be  spending  more,  year  on  year  over  and  above  inflation.  ""And  to  call  that  a  cut  is  at  best  a  misrepresentation,  at  worst  a  downright  lie.""  |||    Tory  shadow  chancellor  Oliver  Letwin  also  predicted  Mr  Brown  would  have  to  raise  taxes  by  £10bn  or  £11bn  if  Labour  was  re-elected  because  he  was  borrowing  and  spending  too  much.  For  the  Lib  Dems,  Vince  Cable  said  the  chancellor  had  failed  to  deal  with  the  ""looming  problems""  of  revaluation  of  council  tax  bands  which  he  argued  would  result  in  ""massive  increases""  for  some.  Mr  Brown  and  Mr  Blair  staged  a  show  of  unity  on  Thursday  morning,  the  day  after  the  chancellor  delivered  a  record-breaking  ninth  Budget.  |||    Mr  Cable  said  taxation  as  a  share  of  the  economy  would  go  up  under  all  three  of  the  main  parties.  The  chancellor  meanwhile  insisted  his  spending  plans  were  ""affordable"".  In  Wednesday's  Budget,  Mr  Brown  doubled  the  level  at  which  homebuyers  pay  stamp  duty,  unveiled  a  rise  in  child  tax  credit  and  a  £200  council  tax  refund  for  over-65s.  Defending  the  plans,  he  told  Today:  ""I  will  take  no  risks  with  the  stability  of  the  economy.  ""All  our  spending  plans  announced  yesterday  [Wednesday],  including  what  we  can  do  for  pensioners,  as  well  as  for  young  families  and  on  stamp  duty  and  inheritance  tax,  all  these  are  costed  and  affordable.""  In  a  further  sign,  if  any  were  needed,  that  the  election  is  approaching,  the  House  of  Commons  authorities  have  formally  told  MPs  their  offices  will  be  ""deep  cleaned""  during  the  three-week  poll  campaign.  Mr  Blair  has  yet  to  name  the  day  -  but  it  is  widely  expected  to  be  5  May." 

2	"Chancellor  rallies  Labour  voters  |||    Gordon  Brown  has  issued  a  rallying  cry  to  supporters,  warning  the  ""stakes  are  too  high""  to  stay  at  home  or  protest  vote  in  the  next  general  election.  |||    The  chancellor  said  the  poll  -  expected  to  fall  on  5  May  -  would  give  a  ""clear  and  fundamental""  choice  between  Labour  investment  and  Tory  cuts.  He  told  his  party's  spring  conference  the  Tories  must  not  be  allowed  to  win.  The  Conservatives  and  Lib  Dems  insisted  that  voters  faced  higher  taxes  and  means-testing  under  Labour.  |||    To  a  packed  audience  at  Gateshead's  Sage  Centre,  Mr  Brown  accused  shadow  chancellor  Oliver  Letwin  of  plotting  cuts  that  were  the  equivalent  of  sacking  every  teacher,  GP  and  nurse  in  the  country.  Laying  into  the  Conservative's  record  in  government  he  said:  ""I  give  you  this  promise  -  with  Labour,  Britain  will  never  return  to  the  mistakes  of  ERM  and  10%  inflation,  15%  interest  rates,  £3bn  in  lost  reserves,  250,000  repossessed,  one  million  in  negative  equity  and  three  million  unemployed.  ""Never  again  Tory  boom  and  bust.  |||    ""This  will  be  the  central  dividing  line  at  the  election,  between  a  Conservative  Party  taking  Britain  back  and  planning  deep  cuts  of  £35bn  in  our  services,  and  a  Labour  government  taking  Britain  forward,  which  on  a  platform  of  stability  will  reform  and  renew  our  hospitals,  schools  and  public  services  and,  I  am  proud  to  say,  spend  by  2008  £60bn  more.""  Turning  to  the  economy,  the  chancellor  promised  to  continue  economic  stability  and  growth  in  a  third  term  in  power.  |||    He  also  pledged  to  continue  the  fight  against  child  and  pensioner  poverty.  And  he  promised  help  to  get  young  people  on  the  property  ladder.  ""My  message  to  the  thousands  of  young  couples  waiting  to  obtain  their  first  home  is  that  housing  is  rightly  now  at  the  centre  of  our  coming  manifesto,""  he  said.  ""And  the  next  Labour  government  will  match  our  low  mortgage  rates  with  a  new  first-time  buyers'  initiative.""  In  the  speech,  which  prompted  a  standing  ovation,  he  also  promised  to  end  teenage  unemployment  within  the  next  five  years.  |||    He  also  highlighted  plans  for  100%  debt  relief  for  the  world's  poorest  countries,  a  national  minimum  wage  for  16  and  17-year-olds,  the  creation  of  a  network  of  children's  centres  and  flexibility  in  maternity  leave.  Responding  to  the  speech,  shadow  chief  secretary  to  the  Treasury,  George  Osborne,  said:  ""This  was  more  talk  from  Gordon  Brown.  ""We've  heard  it  all  before.  Instead  of  talking  about  the  future  he  kept  on  talking  about  the  past.  ""He  completely  failed  to  say  which  taxes  he  would  put  up  to  fill  the  black  hole  in  his  spending  plans.  ""There  will  be  a  simple  choice  at  the  election  -  value  for  money  and  lower  taxes  with  the  Conservatives,  or  more  waste  and  higher  taxes  under  Tony  Blair  and  Gordon  Brown.""  |||    Liberal  Democrat  shadow  chancellor  Vince  Cable  warned  the  picture  was  not  as  rosy  as  Mr  Brown  would  like  to  portray  it.  ""For  all  his  trumpeting  of  Labour's  management  of  the  economy,  Gordon  Brown's  record  is  very  mixed,""  he  said.  ""Gordon  Brown  has  created  a  system  of  massive  centralisation  and  bureaucracy,  a  system  which  subjects  millions  of  people  to  means  testing,  and  a  system  of  taxation  which  is  extremely  complex.  ""For  all  his  positive  words,  Gordon  Brown  is  faced  with  economic  problems  looming  on  the  horizon,  not  least  the  unprecedented  levels  of  personal  debt  facing  the  nation.""  Also  in  Gateshead,  the  prime  minister  took  questions  sent  in  by  e-mail,  text  message  and  telephone  as  part  of  Labour's  attempt  to  engage  the  public  in  their  campaign.  Mr  Blair  told  the  audience  he  believed  the  Iraq  war  would  have  made  Britain  a  safer  place  if  its  emerging  democracy  succeeded  and  that  he  wanted  to  bring  troops  home  as  soon  as  possible,  but  not  before  the  job  was  done.  He  also  said  he  wanted  to  carry  on  as  PM  ""because  I  still  think  that  there  are  big  changes  our  country  needs""." 

0	"Peugeot  deal  boosts  Mitsubishi  |||    Struggling  Japanese  car  maker  Mitsubishi  Motors  has  struck  a  deal  to  supply  French  car  maker  Peugeot  with  30,000  sports  utility  vehicles  (SUV).  |||    The  two  firms  signed  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding,  and  say  they  expect  to  seal  a  final  agreement  by  Spring  2005.  The  alliance  comes  as  a  badly-needed  boost  for  loss-making  Mitsubishi,  after  several  profit  warnings  and  poor  sales.  The  SUVs  will  be  built  in  Japan  using  Peugeot's  diesel  engines  and  sold  mainly  in  the  European  market.  Falling  sales  have  left  Mitsubishi  Motors  with  underused  capacity,  and  the  production  deal  with  Peugeot  gives  it  a  chance  to  utilise  some  of  it.  |||    In  January,  Mitsubishi  Motors  issued  its  third  profits  warning  in  nine  months,  and  cut  its  sales  forecasts  for  the  year  to  March  2005.  Its  sales  have  slid  41%  in  the  past  year,  catalysed  by  the  revelation  that  the  company  had  systematically  been  hiding  records  of  faults  and  then  secretly  repairing  vehicles.  As  a  result,  the  Japanese  car  maker  has  sought  a  series  of  financial  bailouts.  Last  month  it  said  it  was  looking  for  a  further  540bn  yen  ($5.2bn;  £2.77bn)  in  fresh  financial  backing,  half  of  it  from  other  companies  in  the  Mitsubishi  group.  US-German  carmaker  DaimlerChrylser,  a  30%  shareholder  in  Mitsubishi  Motors,  decided  in  April  2004  not  to  pump  in  any  more  money.  The  deal  with  Peugeot  was  celebrated  by  Mitsubishi's  newly-appointed  chief  executive  Takashi  Nishioka,  who  took  over  after  three  top  bosses  stood  down  last  month  to  shoulder  responsibility  for  the  firm's  troubles.  Mitsubishi  Motors  has  forecast  a  net  loss  of  472bn  yen  in  its  current  financial  year  to  March  2005.  Last  month,  it  signed  a  production  agreement  with  Japanese  rival  Nissan  Motor  to  supply  it  with  36,000  small  cars  for  sale  in  Japan.  It  has  been  making  cars  for  Nissan  since  2003." 

0	"Steady  job  growth  continues  in  US  |||    The  US  created  fewer  jobs  than  expected  in  December,  but  analysts  said  that  the  dip  in  hiring  was  not  enough  to  derail  the  world's  biggest  economy.  |||    According  to  Labor  Department  figures,  157,000  new  jobs  were  added  last  month.  That  took  2004's  total  to  2.2  million,  the  best  showing  in  five  years.  Job  creation  was  one  of  last  year's  main  concerns  for  the  US  economy.  While  worries  still  remain,  the  conditions  are  set  for  steady  growth  in  2005,  analysts  said.  The  unemployment  rate  stayed  at  5.4%  in  December,  and  about  200,000  jobs  will  need  to  be  created  each  month  if  that  figure  is  to  drop.  |||    ""It  was  a  respectable  report,""  said  Michael  Moran,  analyst  at  Daiwa  Securities.  |||    ""Payroll  growth  in  December  was  a  little  lighter  than  the  consensus  forecast,  but  we  had  upward  revisions  to  the  prior  two  months  and  an  increase  in  manufacturing  employment.""  ""Manufacturing  is  a  cyclical  area  of  the  economy  and  if  it's  showing  job  growth,  it's  a  good  indication  that  the  economy  is  on  a  solid  growth  track.""  That  means  that  the  Federal  Reserve  is  likely  to  continue  its  policy  of  raising  interest  rates.  The  Fed  lifted  borrowing  costs  five  times  last  year  to  2.25%,  citing  evidence  the  US  economic  recovery  was  becoming  more  robust.  |||    Job  creation  was  one  of  last  year's  main  concerns  for  the  US  economy,  and  proved  to  be  a  main  topic  of  debate  in  the  US  presidential  election.  While  demand  for  workers  is  far  from  booming,  the  conditions  are  set  for  steady  growth.  ""Overall,  compared  to  the  previous  year  it  looks  great,  it  just  keeps  going  stronger  and  stronger  and  I  expect  that  to  be  the  case""  in  2005,  said  Kurt  Karl,  economist  at  Swiss  Re  in  New  York.  Meanwhile,  economists  cautioned  against  reading  too  much  into  data  from  the  Federal  Reserve  showing  an  unexpected  $8.7bn  drop  in  consumer  debt  in  November.  A  fall  in  consumer  spending,  which  makes  up  about  two-thirds  of  all  US  economic  activity,  could  help  limit  the  extent  of  any  future  interest  rate  rises.  But  economists  said  there  could  be  a  number  of  reasons  for  a  fall  in  the  borrowing,  which  include  credit  cards  and  personal  loans,  while  noting  that  such  figures  can  vary  on  a  month-to-month  basis."

Rock  band  Keane  won  Sound  of  2004  while  US  rapper  50  Cent  topped  Sound  of  2003.  Other  new  artists  in  this  year's  list  include  London  indie  group  Bloc  Party  at  second  and  UK  rapper  Kano  third.  The  Bravery  played  their  first  gig  in  2003  and  have  since  supported  bands  including  The  Libertines,  Interpol  and  Echo  and  the  Bunnymen.  |||    They  were  the  subject  of  a  record  company  bidding  war  in  2004  and  their  debut  single,  Unconditional,  caused  a  huge  buzz  when  it  was  released  in  the  UK  in  November.  Singer  Sam  Endicott  said  he  felt  ""great""  about  coming  top  of  the  Sound  of  2005  list.  ""Anyone  that  says  they  don't  want  a  zillion  screaming  fans  is  a  jackass,  a  liar,""  he  said.  One  of  the  experts  to  tip  The  Bravery  was  The  Times'  music  critic  Paul  Connolly,  who  said  they  were  ""spiky  but  in  love  with  pop"".  Chris  Hawkins,  host  of  BBC  6  Music's  chart  show,  said  the  band  had  ""great  guitars  and  a  mastery  of  the  electro-clash  sound"".  ""The  Bravery  are  proof  alone  that  New  York  City  is  still  home  to  hot  new  talent,""  he  said.  Alison  Howe,  producer  of  TV  show  Later...  With  Jools  Holland,  booked  the  group  to  appear  the  day  after  seeing  them  at  a  west  London  pub.  |||    ""They  played  like  they  were  headlining  the  main  stage  at  Glastonbury,""  she  said.  ""Great  songs,  a  good  look,  a  touch  of  attitude  and  a  cracking  live  band.""  |||    Q  magazine  reviews  editor  Ted  Kessler  said  they  were  ""pretty-boy  New  York  clothes  horses""  with  ""an  unusually  nimble  ear  for  concise,  yearning  pop  in  the  mould  of  Duran  Duran  or  The  Strokes"".  Other  pundits  to  take  part  in  the  survey  included  BBC  Radio  1  DJ  Trevor  Nelson,  NME  editor  Conor  McNicholas,  Top  of  the  Pops  presenter  Fearne  Cotton,  Glastonbury  organiser  Emily  Eavis  and  BBC  Radio  2  music  editor  Colin  Martin.

US  rapper  The  Game  is  hip-hop  great  Dr  Dre's  latest  protege  while  Leeds  group  Kaiser  Chiefs  came  fifth  with  a  promise  to  lead  a  Britpop  revival.  In  last  year's  survey,  Keane  were  followed  by  Franz  Ferdinand,  Razorlight  and  Joss  Stone  in  the  top  five  -  all  of  whom  were  virtually  unknown  outside  the  music  industry  at  that  point.  |||    Boy  band  McFly  were  sixth  while  Scissor  Sisters,  who  had  the  UK's  best-selling  album  of  2004,  were  seventh.  In  the  survey,  the  pundits  were  asked  for  tips  for  three  acts  they  thought  were  capable  of  reaching  the  top  in  their  chosen  genre,  either  in  terms  of  sales  or  critical  acclaim.  The  artists  could  be  from  any  country  and  any  musical  genre,  but  must  not  have  had  a  UK  top  20  single,  been  a  contestant  on  a  TV  talent  show  or  already  be  famous  for  doing  something  else,  such  as  a  soap  actor.  Those  tips  were  then  counted  and  compiled  to  make  the  top  10."

Frank  Sinatra's  My  Way  was  second  in  the  UK  vote  with  Monty  Python's  Always  Look  on  the  Bright  Side  of  Life  in  third  place.  More  than  45,000  people  were  surveyed  by  digital  TV  station  Music  Choice.  |||    The  European  chart,  which  included  Denmark,  France  and  Germany,  put  Led  Zeppelin's  Stairway  to  Heaven  in  second  and  AC/DC's  Highway  to  Hell  in  third.  Queen's  Who  Wants  to  Live  Forever  was  highly  favoured  by  both  UK  and  European  voters.  |||    Both  lists  featured  only  one  traditional  or  classic  song  each,  with  Britons  requesting  the  Royal  Scots  Dragoon  Guards'  Amazing  Grace  and  their  continental  counterparts  opting  for  Mozart's  Requiem.

2	"Boothroyd  calls  for  Lords  speaker  |||    Betty  Boothroyd  has  said  the  House  of  Lords  needs  its  own  Speaker  and  that  peers  should  lead  the  way  on  reforming  the  upper  chamber.  |||    Baroness  Boothroyd,  who  was  the  first  woman  to  be  Commons  Speaker,  said  she  believed  Tony  Blair  initiated  reforms  without  a  clear  outcome  in  mind.  ""Now  we  have  to  take  care  of  it  ourselves  and  make  the  best  of  it,""  she  told  the  BBC's  Breakfast  with  Frost.  In  1999  Labour  removed  all  but  92  of  the  Lords'  750  hereditary  peers.  That  was  billed  as  the  first  stage  of  reform  of  the  institution.  The  lord  chancellor  hinted  further  reforms  could  be  unveiled  in  the  next  Labour  manifesto.  |||    ""I  think  we  need  to  look  very  carefully  at  the  relationship  between  the  Lords  and  the  Commons,""  Lord  Falconer  told  BBC1's  Breakfast  With  Frost.  ""How  it  interacts  with  the  Commons  is  a  very,  very  important  issue.  ""We  need  to  address  the  issue  in  the  manifesto,  but  you  will  have  to  wait  for  when  the  manifesto  comes.""  The  lord  chancellor  currently  has  the  role  of  House  of  Lords  speaker.  He  is  also  head  of  the  judiciary  and  a  member  of  the  Cabinet  as  constitutional  affairs  secretary.  |||    Lady  Boothroyd  said  she  believed  it  was  unacceptable  for  the  lord  chancellor  to  have  the  role  of  Speaker.  ""I  would  really  like  to  see  a  Speaker  of  the  House  of  Lords,""  she  said.  ""I  don't  go  for  the  idea  of  somebody  -  a  lord  chancellor  -  who  is  head  of  the  judiciary,  a  senior  Cabinet  minister  and  Speaker  of  the  Lords.  ""I  want  somebody  there  who  is  going  to  look  after  that  House  and  do  a  job  there." 

2	"Scots  smoking  ban  details  set  out  |||    Smoke-free  areas  will  save  lives  and  improve  Scotland's  health,  First  Minister  Jack  McConnell  has  insisted.  |||    He  told  the  Scottish  Parliament  on  Wednesday  that  a  ""comprehensive  ban""  on  smoking  in  public  places  would  be  introduced  by  the  spring  of  2006.  Mr  McConnell  said  the  country's  health  rates  were  ""lamentable""  not  least  because  of  smoking.  He  said  fines  of  up  to  £2,500  would  be  levied  on  employers  and  licences  would  be  removed  for  non-compliance.  Earlier,  the  Scottish  Executive  considered  a  range  of  options  but  agreed  unanimously  to  introduce  an  all-out  ban  on  smoking  in  public  places.  In  a  statement  to  parliament,  Mr  McConnell  said  that  the  licensed  trade  would  be  asked  to  join  an  expert  committee  prior  to  the  ban  coming  into  force.  |||    The  health  arguments  far  outweighed  lingering  public  disquiet  about  a  complete  ban  and  claims  by  the  licensed  trade  that  jobs  would  be  lost,  he  told  MSPs.  He  said  there  would  be  an  international  marketing  campaign  whereby  ""tourists  can  enjoy  smoke  free  environment  and  the  sick  man  of  Europe  image  becomes  a  thing  of  the  past"".  ""There  are  still  national  habits  which  hold  us  back  -  the  time  has  come  for  this  parliament  to  accelerate  improvements  in  health,""  he  declared.  ""Health  rates  are  lamentable  because  of  a  lack  of  exercise,  drugs  abuse,  excessive  drinking  and  over-eating.  ""They  all  make  us  one  of  the  most  unhealthy  countries  in  Europe,  and  too  many  smoke.  ""It  is  clear  that  Scotland  must  not  be  held  back  by  poor  public  health  -  the  single  biggest  contribution  devolved  government  can  make  is  to  reduce  the  toll  of  preventable  death  caused  by  smoking.""  The  legislation  will  be  introduced  as  part  of  the  Health  Service  (Miscellaneous  Provisions)  Bill,  which  will  be  considered  by  parliament  before  Christmas.  Main  points  of  the  plan:  |||        -  A  comprehensive  ban  on  smoking  in  all  enclosed  public  places  in  Scotland      -  The  legislation  will  be  enforced  by  environmental  health  and  local  licensing  officers      -  Licensees  or  employers  who  fail  to  enforce  the  law  will  face  fines  up  to  a  maximum  of  £2,500      -  Licensees  who  persistently  refuse  to  comply  with  the  law  will  face  the  ultimate  sanction  of  losing  their  liquor  licence      -  A  system  of  issuing  fixed  penalty  notices  for  those  individuals  who  break  the  law  will  be  examined      -  Individuals  who  persistently  break  the  law  will  face  a  maximum  fine  of  £1,000.        |||    Mr  McConnell  claimed  there  was  evidence  that  smoking  bans  had  helped  smokers  to  either  give  up  quicker  or  smoke  less.  He  said  there  had  been  falling  cigarette  sales  of  13%  in  New  York  and  16%  in  Ireland.  Mr  McConnell  added  that  there  had  been  a  near  nine  per  cent  rise  in  tax  revenues  from  New  York  bars  and  restaurants  and,  in  Ireland,  only  a  one  point  three  per  cent  volume  sales  fall,  where  they  were  declining  before  the  ban.  The  afternoon  announcement,  following  a  cabinet  meeting  on  Wednesday  morning,  won  broad  support  from  opposition  parties.  |||    The  Scottish  National  Party's  Holyrood  leader,  Nicola  Sturgeon,  welcomed  the  move  but  added  that  the  public  should  be  consulted  as  the  clock  ticked  towards  the  ban  date.  She  said:  ""The  time  has  come  for  a  ban  on  smoking  in  public  places.  ""There  is  evidence  a  ban  can  cut  deaths  from  passive  smoking  and  makes  it  easier  for  the  70%  of  smokers  who  desperately  want  to  give  up  the  habit.  ""But  we  must  also  recognise  that  some  people  have  concerns  and  reservations  -  there  are  people  who  are  yet  to  be  persuaded.""  The  Scottish  Conservative  Party  leader,  David  McLetchie,  questioned  what  would  be  exempted  from  the  ban.  He  was  keen  to  know  if  inmates  in  Scottish  prisons  would  continue  to  be  allowed  to  smoke.  Mr  McLetchie  asked:  ""Would  it  not  be  ironic  and  perhaps  entirely  typical  of  the  first  minister's  brave  new  Scotland  that  the  criminals  can  be  smokers  but  the  smokers  will  become  criminals?""  The  Scottish  Green  Party's  health  spokeswoman,  Eleanor  Scott,  said  she  was  pleased  Scotland  would  be  following  the  ""success  stories  of  New  York  and  Ireland"".  She  believed  the  majority  of  people  in  Scotland  wanted  to  go  out  without  having  to  breathe  in  harmful  tobacco  smoke." 

2	"Straw  attacked  on  China  arms  |||    Moves  to  lift  the  European  Union's  ban  on  arms  exports  to  China  have  been  condemned  by  human  rights  groups  and  the  Conservatives.  |||    The  15  year  embargo  was  imposed  in  the  aftermath  of  China's  crackdown  on  protesters  in  Tiananmen  Square  in  1989.  UK  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw,  who  will  hold  talks  in  Beijing  on  Thursday,  said  an  EU  arms  code  was  more  effective  than  the  current  ban.  But  Human  Rights  Watch  says  the  EU  is  putting  commerce  above  abuse  concerns.  |||    In  December,  the  EU  pledged  to  work  towards  lifting  the  ban  but  said  it  was  not  ready  to  do  so  yet.  Germany  and  France  have  repeatedly  called  for  the  embargo  to  be  lifted.  Britain  has  been  more  cautious  but  Mr  Straw  last  week  said  he  also  wanted  it  to  end,  despite  US  objections.  |||    He  expects  it  to  be  lifted  over  the  next  six  months,  a  prediction  which  has  alarmed  critics.  Brad  Adams,  from  Human  Rights  Watch,  said:  ""This  is  a  huge  political  signal  from  Europe  that  they  are  willing  to  forget  about  Tiananmen  Square.  ""There  are  still  thousands  of  people  who  are  unaccounted  for.""  |||    Mr  Straw  said  it  was  wrong  to  put  China  under  the  same  embargo  as  countries  such  as  Zimbabwe  and  Burma.  The  scope  of  the  embargo  was  very  narrow  and  did  not  have  any  force  of  law  behind  it,  he  told  BBC  Radio  4's  World  At  One.  In  the  UK,  more  export  licences  were  refused  under  the  existing  European  Union  arms  code  than  under  the  embargo,  he  said.  And  only  two  of  the  licences  denied  under  the  embargo  would  have  been  granted  under  the  code.  ""The  code  of  conduct  is  much  more  effective,  it's  a  more  powerful  tool  of  and  we  intend  to  strengthen  it  as  a  pre-condition  of  lifting  the  embargo  with  China,""  he  said.  |||    Mr  Straw  denied  the  decision  would  suggest  to  China  that  Tiananmen  Square  had  been  forgotten.  The  level  of  human  rights  was  a  key  criteria  under  the  EU  arms  exports  code,  he  said.  Human  rights  groups  say  the  code  of  conduct  is  not  legally  binding  -  but  Mr  Straw  said  it  would  be  given  legal  force  by  the  laws  of  many  EU  countries.  Conservative  shadow  foreign  secretary  Michael  Ancram  said  the  move  would  be  ""profoundly  wrong"".  The  decision  could  undermine  Nato  as  it  severely  damaged  relations  with  the  US,  which  is  opposed  to  ending  the  ban.  |||    Mr  Ancram  argued:  ""What  the  British  Government  is  doing  is  giving  in  to  French  and  German  pressure,  especially  the  French,  who  see  vast  contracts  available  to  them  if  the  embargo  is  lifted...  ""It  gives  the  wrong  signals  to  China,  who  are  simply  not  prepared  to  accept  that  what  happened  at  Tiananmen  Square  was  wrong.""  Mr  Straw's  China  trip  is  part  of  regular  high-level  meetings  with  Beijing  ministers.  He  will  meet  Chinese  counterpart  Minister  Li  Zhaoxing  to  discuss  developing  relations  between  their  two  countries,  Hong  Kong  and  China's  part  in  the  talks  on  North  Korea."

Among  those  expected  to  receive  nominations  are  The  Aviator,  Million  Dollar  Baby  and  Sideways.  Academy  members  will  now  vote  for  their  favourites  before  the  final  nominees  are  announced  on  25  January.  |||    To  be  eligible  for  nomination  a  film  must  have  been  shown  in  a  commercial  theatre  for  seven  consecutive  days  before  the  deadline  of  31  December.  Director  Martin  Scorsese's  The  Aviator,  starring  Leonardo  DiCaprio  went  on  general  release  on  Christmas  Day  in  the  US,  ensuring  it  just  made  the  deadline.  Studios  have  already  begun  lobbying  voters,  taking  out  full  page  adverts  in  trade  publications  such  as  Variety  urging  them  to  remember  particular  films  when  it  comes  to  choosing  what  to  back.  Other  movies  tipped  for  possible  success  include  Closer,  starring  Jude  Law  and  Julia  Roberts,  Finding  Neverland,  with  Johnny  Depp  as  author  JM  Barry  and  Kinsey  starring  Liam  Neeson  as  the  famed  sex  scientist  Alfred  Kinsey.

The  2004  winner,  Paul  Cavanagh,  went  on  to  sign  a  deal  with  Harper  Collins.  |||    This  year,  the  competition  is  specifically  looking  for  a  crime  writer.  Writers  must  submit  up  to  10,000  words  from  the  opening  chapters  of  their  novels  and  a  synopsis.  Professional  readers  will  choose  a  shortlist  of  five  following  the  competition  closing  date  on  14  January.  |||    The  final  five  will  then  have  to  read  their  work  in  front  of  judging  panel.  A  public  vote  will  also  take  place,  which  will  account  for  25%  of  the  final  decision.  The  winner  will  be  announced  at  the  London  Book  Fair  on  14  March  next  year  and  could  be  screened  on  TV.  ""It's  very,  very  hard  to  find  an  agent  and  extremely  difficult,  without  an  agent,  to  get  a  publisher  to  look  at  your  work,""  said  Cowell.  ""People  do  fall  by  the  wayside  and  the  more  avenues  we  can  provide  for  aspiring  authors,  the  better,""  he  added.  Paul  Cavanagh,  a  former  university  professor  and  health  care  consultant  from  Ontario  in  Canada,  was  one  of  1,466  aspiring  novelists  to  enter  the  first  contest.  He  lifted  the  inaugural  Lit  Idol  prize  after  reading  aloud  an  excerpt  of  his  work  Northwest  Passage.

""It's  hard  to  put  a  date  on  it,""  a  Premier  League  spokesman  confirmed  to  BBC  Sport.  ""It's  not  a  formal  situation  where  they've  got  so  much  time  to  respond.""  Arsenal  and  England  defender  Cole  reportedly  met  Blues  boss  Jose  Mourinho  and  chief  executive  Peter  Kenyon  in  a  London  hotel  11  days  ago.  Chelsea  have  yet  to  officially  confirm  or  deny  the  meeting,  which  would  be  in  breach  of  Premier  League  rule  K3.  |||    Now  the  Gunners  have  asked  for  an  inquiry  to  look  into  claims  that  their  player  has  been  ""tapped  up"".  Both  clubs  have  pledged  to  co-operate  with  the  inquiry  which  will  be  conducted  on  a  single  day  as  opposed  to  being  run  as  an  ongoing  evaluation.

1	"Oasis  star  fined  for  German  brawl  |||    Oasis  singer  Liam  Gallagher  has  been  fined  50,000  euros  (£35,000)  after  a  fight  in  a  German  hotel  two  years  ago.  |||    Gallagher  was  arrested  along  with  drummer  Alan  White  and  three  other  members  of  the  band's  entourage  after  the  brawl  in  Munich  in  December  2002.  The  band  said  they  were  victims  of  an  ""unprovoked  attack""  in  a  nightclub.  But  police  said  Gallagher  kicked  an  officer  in  the  chest  and  had  large  amounts  of  alcohol  and  drugs  -  possibly  cocaine  -  in  his  blood.  Gallagher  lost  two  front  teeth  in  the  fight,  which  led  to  the  band  abandoning  their  German  tour.  His  brother  and  bandmate  Noel  was  in  bed  at  the  time.  |||    ""The  process  has  stopped  by  paying  50,000  euros,""  said  Anton  Winkler,  spokesman  for  the  Munich  prosecutor.  At  the  time,  police  said  a  ""physical  altercation""  broke  out  among  the  musicians  at  about  0200  local  time.  That  led  to  one  of  the  group  being  ""jostled""  and  falling  onto  the  table  of  five  Italian  guests  -  causing  the  fight,  they  said.  The  fight  continued  outside,  where  ""one  of  the  officers  was  kicked  in  the  chest  with  full  force  by  Liam  Gallagher...  and  suffered  minor  injuries"",  they  said."

Many  foreign  firms  had  protested  that  the  SEC  was  imposing  an  unfair  burden.  The  new  rules  are  the  result  of  the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act,  part  of  the  US  clean-up  after  corporate  scandals  such  as  Enron  and  Worldcom.  Section  404  of  the  Sox  Act,  as  the  legislation  is  nicknamed,  calls  for  all  firms  to  certify  that  their  financial  reporting  is  in  line  with  US  rules.  Big  US  firms  already  have  to  meet  the  requirements,  but  smaller  ones  and  foreign-based  firms  which  list  their  shares  on  US  stock  markets  originally  had  until  the  middle  of  this  year.  |||    Over  the  past  few  months,  delegations  of  European  and  other  business  leaders  have  been  heading  to  the  SEC's  Washington  DC  headquarters  to  protest.  They  say  the  burden  is  too  expensive  and  the  timescale  too  short  and  some,  particularly  the  UK's  CBI,  warned  that  companies  would  choose  to  let  their  US  listings  drop  rather  than  get  in  line  with  section  404.  The  latest  delegation  from  the  CBI  met  SEC  officials  on  Wednesday,  just  before  the  decision  to  relax  the  deadline  was  announced.  ""I  think  this  signifies  a  change  of  heart  at  the  SEC,""  CBI  director-general  Sir  Digby  Jones  told  the  BBC's  Today  programme.  ""They  have  been  listening  to  us  and  to  many  overseas  companies,  who  have  reminded  America  what  globalisation  really  means:  that  they  can't  make  these  rules  in  isolation.""  The  SEC  said  it  had  taken  into  consideration  the  fact  that  foreign  companies  were  already  working  to  meet  more  onerous  financial  reporting  rules  in  their  home  countries.  The  European  Union,  in  particular,  was  imposing  new  international  financial  reporting  standards  in  2005,  it  noted.  ""I  don't  underestimate  the  effort  (compliance)  will  require...  but  this  extension  will  provide  additional  time  for  those  issuers  to  take  a  good  hard  look  at  their  internal  controls,""  said  Donald  Nicolaisen,  the  SEC's  chief  accountant."

The  IEA  raised  its  estimate  of  2005  oil  demand  growth  by  80,000  barrels  a  day  to  84  million  barrels  a  day.  US  light  crude  rose  $1.64  to  $47.10,  while  Brent  crude  in  London  gained  $1.32  to  $44.45.  |||    The  Paris-based  IEA  watchdog,  which  advises  industrialized  nations  on  energy  policy,  said  the  upward  revision  was  due  to  stronger  demand  from  China  and  other  Asian  countries.  The  fresh  rally  in  crude  prices  followed  gains  on  Wednesday  which  were  triggered  by  large  falls  in  US  crude  supplies  following  a  cold  spell  in  North  America  in  January.  The  US  Department  of  Energy  reported  that  crude  stockpiles  had  fallen  1m  barrels  to  294.3m.  On  top  of  that,  ongoing  problems  for  beleaguered  Russian  oil  giant  Yukos  have  also  prompted  the  IEA  to  revise  its  output  estimates  from  Russia  -  a  major  non-Opec  supplier.  ""I  think  that  prices  are  now  beginning  to  set  a  new  range  and  it  looks  like  the  $40  to  $50  level,""  said  energy  analyst  Orin  Middleton  of  Barclays  Capital." 

3	"Hodgson  shoulders  England  blame  |||    Fly-half  Charlie  Hodgson  admitted  his  wayward  kicking  played  a  big  part  in  England's  18-17  defeat  to  France.  |||    Hodgson  failed  to  convert  three  penalties  and  also  missed  a  relatively  easy  drop  goal  attempt  which  would  have  given  England  a  late  win.  ""I'm  very  disappointed  with  the  result  and  with  my  myself,""  Hodgson  said.  ""It  is  very  hard  to  take  but  it's  something  I  will  have  to  get  through  and  come  back  stronger.  My  training's  been  good  but  it  just  didn't  happen.""  Hodgson  revealed  that  Olly  Barkley  had  taken  three  penalties  because  they  were  ""out  of  my  range""  but  the  centre  could  not  convert  his  opportunities  either,  particularly  the  drop  goal  late  on.  ""It  wasn't  a  good  strike,""  he  added.  ""I  felt  as  soon  as  it  hit  my  boot  it  had  missed.  It's  very  disappointing,  but  I  must  recover.""  Andy  Robinson  said  he  would  ""keep  working  on  the  kicking""  with  his  squad.  However,  the  England  coach  added  that  he  would  take  some  positives  from  the  defeat.  |||    ""We  went  out  to  play  and  played  some  very  good  rugby  and  what  have  France  done?""  he  said.  ""They  won  the  game  from  kicking  penalties  from  our  10m  line.  ""It's  very  frustrating.  The  lads  showed  a  lot  of  ambition  in  the  first  half,  they  went  out  to  sustain  it  in  the  second  but  couldn't  build  on  it.  ""We  took  the  ball  into  contact,  and  you  know  when  you  do  that  it  is  a  lottery  whether  the  referee  is  going  to  give  the  penalty  to  your  side  or  the  other  side.  ""We  have  lost  a  game  we  should  have  won.  There  is  a  fine  line  between  winning  and  losing,  and  for  the  second  week  we've  been  on  the  wrong  side  of  that  line  and  it  hurts.""  |||    England  went  in  at  half-time  with  a  17-6  lead  but  they  failed  to  score  in  the  second  half  and  Dimitri  Yachvili  slotted  over  four  penalties  as  France  overhauled  the  deficit.  England  skipper  Jason  Robinson  admitted  his  side  failed  to  cope  with  France's  improved  second-half  display.  |||    ""We  controlled  the  game  in  the  first  half  but  we  knew  that  they  would  come  out  and  try  everything  after  half-time,""  he  said.  ""We  made  a  lot  of  mistakes  in  the  second  half  and  they  punished  us.  They  took  their  chances  when  they  came.  ""It's  very  disappointing.  Last  week  we  lost  by  two  points,  now  one  point.""" 

2	"E-University  'disgraceful  waste'  |||    A  failed  government  scheme  to  offer  UK  university  courses  online  has  been  branded  a  ""disgraceful  waste""  by  MPs.  |||    The  e-University  was  scrapped  last  year,  having  attracted  only  900  students  at  a  cost  of  £50m.  Chief  executive  John  Beaumont  was  paid  a  bonus  of  £44,914,  despite  a  failure  to  bring  in  private  sector  backers.  The  Commons  education  select  committee  called  this  ""morally  indefensible""  but  the  government  said  the  e-University  project  had  ""improved  understanding"".  |||    A  Department  for  Education  and  Skills  spokeswoman  said  the  venture  had  been  ""ambitious  and  ground-breaking,  but  take-up  had  not  been  ""sufficient  to  continue  with  the  project"".  She  added:  ""UK  e-Universities  was  not  the  only  organisation  to  have  lost  out  on  private  sector  investment  in  the  collapse  of  the  dotcom  boom.""  The  select  committee  found  that  those  responsible  for  founding  the  e-University  in  2000  had  been  caught  up  in  the  ""general  atmosphere  of  enthusiasm""  surrounding  the  internet.  Initial  business  plans  forecast  a  quarter  of  a  million  students  joining  within  a  decade,  bringing  in  at  least  £110m  in  profit.  |||    But  virtually  no  market  research  was  carried  out  and  just  £4.2m  was  spent  on  worldwide  sales  and  marketing  of  courses.  Some  £14m  went  on  developing  the  technology  to  make  the  e-University  work.  This  was  used  by  just  200  students,  the  rest  preferring  to  work  through  existing  university  websites.  With  no  significant  private  investors  and  no  direct  accountability  to  a  government  minister,  the  e-University  had  had  ""too  much  freedom  to  spend  public  money  as  it  wished"",  the  report  found.  Committee  chairman  Barry  Sheerman  said:  ""UK  e-University  was  a  terrible  waste  of  public  money.  ""The  senior  executives  failed  to  interest  any  private  investors  and  showed  an  extraordinary  over-confidence  in  their  ability  to  attract  students  to  the  scheme.""  The  report  warns  that  the  government  should  not  be  scared  off  investment  in  innovative  but  potentially  risky  schemes  by  the  failure  of  the  e-University,  but  ""should  learn  the  lessons  from  this  disaster""." 

0	"Nigeria  to  boost  cocoa  production  |||    The  government  of  Nigeria  is  hoping  to  triple  cocoa  production  over  the  next  three  years  with  the  launch  of  an  ambitious  development  programme.  |||    Agriculture  Minister  Adamu  Bello  said  the  scheme  aimed  to  boost  production  from  an  expected  180,000  tonnes  this  year  to  600,000  tonnes  by  2008.  The  government  will  pump  154m  naira  ($1.1m;  £591,000)  into  subsidies  for  farming  chemicals  and  seedlings.  Nigeria  is  currently  the  world's  fourth-largest  cocoa  producer.  |||    Cocoa  was  the  main  export  product  in  Nigeria  during  the  1960s.  But  with  the  coming  of  oil,  the  government  began  to  pay  less  attention  to  the  cocoa  sector  and  production  began  to  fall  from  a  peak  of  about  400,000  tonnes  a  year  in  1970.  At  the  launch  of  the  programme  in  the  south-western  city  of  Ibadan,  Mr  Bello  explained  that  an  additional  aim  of  the  project  is  to  encourage  the  processing  of  cocoa  in  the  country  and  lift  local  consumption.  He  also  announced  that  91m  naira  of  the  funding  available  had  been  earmarked  for  establishing  cocoa  plant  nurseries.  The  country  could  be  looking  to  emulate  rival  Ghana,  which  produced  a  bumper  crop  last  year.  However,  some  farmers  are  sceptical  about  the  proposals.  ""People  who  are  not  farming  will  hijack  the  subsidy,""  said  Joshua  Osagie,  a  cocoa  farmer  from  Edo  state  told  Reuters.  ""The  farmers  in  the  village  never  see  any  assistance,""  he  added.  |||    At  the  same  time  as  Nigeria  announced  its  new  initiative,  Ghana  -  the  world's  second  largest  cocoa  exporter  -  announced  revenues  from  the  industry  had  broken  new  records.  The  country  saw  more  than  $1.2bn-worth  of  the  beans  exported  during  2003-04.  Analysts  said  high  tech-production  techniques  and  crop  spraying  introduced  by  the  government  led  to  the  huge  crop,  pushing  production  closer  to  levels  seen  in  the  1960s  when  the  country  was  the  world's  leading  cocoa  grower."

A  further  40,000  farms  are  yet  to  be  inspected,  the  state's  National  Land  Institute  has  told  Associated  Press.  Vice  president  Jose  Vicente  Rangel  has  said  farmers  and  ranchers  with  their  titles  in  order  and  their  lands  productive  have  ""nothing  to  fear.""  Critics  of  the  land  reform  policy  claim  president  Hugo  Chavez  is  trying  to  enforce  a  communist-style  economic  programme  that  ignores  property  rights  and  will  damage  the  country.  Land  owners  claim  the  National  Land  Institute  has  made  mistakes  in  classifying  lands  as  public  or  private.  |||    But  the  government  -  Venezuela's  largest  land  owner  -  say  they  are  proceeding  cautiously  to  prevent  conflicts.  In  a  statement,  Mr  Rangel  said  the  land  reform  is  not  against  the  constitution,  which  permits  private  property,  while  stressing  the  efforts  are  to  ""vindicate  social  and  economically""  years  of  inequality  in  the  country.  |||    One  property  in  conflict  with  the  government  is  the  El  Charcote  cattle  ranch,  run  by  Agroflora,  a  subsidiary  of  the  UK  food  group  Vestey.  Agriculture  minister  Arnoldo  Marquez  told  Reuters  news  agency  the  site's  documents  ""do  not  guarantee  that  this  is  a  private  land"".  Administrators  of  the  ranch,  however,  have  complained  that  pro-Chavez  squatters  have  taken  over  80%  of  the  property  in  the  last  four  years,  and  the  UK  government  has  asked  Venezuelan  authorities  to  resolve  the  conflict.  ""You  should  ask  the  company  when  they  are  going  to  put  their  papers  in  order  and  hand  over  the  land  that  is  not  theirs,""  said  Mr  Marquez."

The  introduction  of  'chip  and  pin'  cards  has  tightened  security  for  transactions  on  the  High  Street.  But  the  clampdown  has  caused  fraudsters  to  change  tack,  Retail  Decisions  said.  |||    The  introduction  of  chip  and  pin  cards  aimed  to  cut  down  on  credit  card  fraud  in  stores  by  asking  shoppers  to  verify  their  identity  with  a  confidential  personal  pin  number,  instead  of  a  signature.  Retail  Decisions  chief  executive  Carl  Clump  told  the  BBC  that  there  was  ""no  doubt""  that  chip  and  pin  would  ""reduce  card  fraud  in  the  card-present  environment"".  ""However,  it  is  important  to  monitor  what  happens  in  the  card-not-present  environment  as  fraudsters  will  turn  their  attention  to  the  internet,  mail  order,  telephone  order  and  interactive  TV,""  he  said.  ""We  have  seen  a  22%  uplift  in  card-not-present  fraud  here  in  the  UK...  since  the  start  of  the  year.  ""Fraud  doesn't  just  disappear,  it  mutates  to  the  next  weakest  link  in  the  chain,""  he  said.  |||    Retail  Decisions'  survey  on  the  implementation  of  chip  and  pin  found  that  shoppers  had  adapted  easily  to  the  new  system,  but  that  banks'  performance  in  distributing  the  new  cards  had  been  patchy,  at  best.  ""The  main  issue  is  that  not  everyone  has  the  pins  they  need,""  said  Mr  Clump.  Nearly  two  thirds  -  65%  -  of  the  1,000  people  interviewed  said  they  had  used  chip  and  pin  to  make  payments.  Of  these,  83%  were  happy  with  the  experience,  though  nearly  a  quarter  said  they  struggled  to  remember  their  pin  number.  However,  only  34%  said  they  had  received  replacement  cards  with  the  necessary  'chip'  technology  from  all  their  card  providers.  Furthermore,  16%  said  that  none  of  their  cards  had  been  replaced,  while  30%  said  only  some  had.  UK  shoppers  spent  £5.3bn  on  plastic  cards  in  2003,  the  last  full  year  for  which  figures  are  available  from  the  Association  of  Payment  Clearing  Services  (Apacs).  Altogether,  card  scams  on  UK-issued  cards  totalled  £402.4m  in  2003.  Card-not-present  fraud  rose  an  annual  6%  to  £116.4m,  making  it  the  biggest  category  even  then.  Within  this,  internet  fraud  totalled  £43m,  Apacs'  figures  show."

Laurent  Beaudoin,  part  of  the  family  that  controls  the  Montreal-based  firm,  will  take  on  the  role  of  CEO  under  a  newly  created  management  structure.  Analysts  said  the  resignations  seem  to  have  stemmed  from  a  boardroom  dispute.  Under  Mr  Tellier's  tenure  at  the  company,  which  began  in  January  2003,  plans  to  cut  the  worldwide  workforce  of  75,000  by  almost  a  third  by  2006  were  announced.  The  firm's  snowmobile  division  and  defence  services  unit  were  also  sold  and  Bombardier  started  the  development  of  a  new  aircraft  seating  110  to  135  passengers.  |||    Mr  Tellier  had  indicated  he  wanted  to  stay  at  the  world's  top  train  maker  and  third  largest  manufacturer  of  civil  aircraft  until  the  restructuring  was  complete.  But  Bombardier  has  been  faced  with  a  declining  share  price  and  profits.  Earlier  this  month  the  firm  said  it  earned  $10m  (£19.2m)  in  the  third  quarter,  down  from  a  profit  of  $133m  a  year  ago.  ""I  understand  the  board's  concern  that  I  would  not  be  there  for  the  long-term  and  the  need  to  develop  and  execute  strategies,  and  the  need  to  reshape  the  management  structure  at  this  time,""  Mr  Tellier  said  in  a  statement  on  Monday.  Bombardier  said  restructuring  plans  drawn  up  by  Mr  Tellier's  would  continue  to  be  implemented.  Shares  in  Bombardier  lost  65  Canadian  cents  or  25%  on  the  news  to  1.90  Canadian  dollars  before  rallying  to  2.20  Canadian  dollars."

De  Niro  recently  spent  three  weeks  at  the  top  with  comedy  Meet  The  Fockers,  which  was  at  number  five  this  week.  Oscar  hopefuls  The  Aviator,  Million  Dollar  Baby  and  Sideways  all  cashed  in  on  their  multiple  nominations  with  stronger  ticket  sales.  |||    In  Hide  and  Seek,  De  Niro  plays  a  widower  whose  daughter  has  a  creepy  imaginary  friend.  Despite  lukewarm  reviews  from  critics,  the  film  took  more  than  the  expected  $18m  (£9.5m).  ""The  element  of  a  real  actor  in  a  psychological  thriller  certainly  elevated  it,""  said  Bruce  Snyder,  president  of  domestic  distribution  at  20th  Century  Fox.  Clint  Eastwood's  Million  Dollar  Baby  led  the  Oscar  hopefuls  with  $11.8m  (£6.3m),  coming  in  at  number  three  during  its  first  weekend  of  wide  release.  The  Aviator,  a  film  biography  of  Howard  Hughes  that  leads  the  Oscar  field  with  11  nominations,  was  at  number  six  for  the  weekend  with  $7.5m  (£4m).  Oscar  best-picture  nominee  Sideways  entered  the  top  ten  for  the  first  time  in  its  15th  week  of  release.  It  came  in  seventh  $6.3  (£3.35m).  Last  week's  top  film,  Ice  Cube's  road-trip  comedy  Are  We  There  Yet?,  slipped  to  second  place  with  $17m  (£9m),  while  Coach  Carter  fell  two  places  to  number  four,  taking  $8m  (£4.25m)  in  its  third  week.  Rounding  out  the  top  ten  were  In  Good  Company  -  starring  Dennis  Quaid  and  Scarlett  Johansson  -  Racing  Stripes  and  Assault  on  Precinct  13."

Fiat  has  yet  to  comment  on  the  matter,  but  the  unions  say  the  new  engines  will  be  made  by  GM  in  Australia.  The  news  comes  a  week  after  GM  pulled  out  of  an  agreement  to  buy  Fiat.  GM  had  to  pay  former  partner  Fiat  1.55bn  euros  ($2bn;  £1.1bn)  to  get  out  of  a  deal  which  could  have  forced  it  to  buy  the  Italian  carmaker  outright.  Fiat  and  GM  also  ended  their  five-year  alliance  and  two  joint  ventures  in  engines  and  purchasing,  but  did  agree  to  continue  buying  each  other's  engines.  |||    ""Powertrain  told  us  today  that  Alfa  Romeo  engines  will  no  longer  be  made  in  Arese,""  said  union  leader  Vincenzo  Lilliu,  as  reported  by  the  Reuters  news  agency.  ""The  assembly  line  will  be  dismantled  and  the  six-cylinder  Alfa  Romeo  motor  will  be  replaced  with  an  engine  GM  produces  in  Australia.""  Reuters  also  said  that  Mr  Lilliu  and  other  union  bosses  shouted  insults  at  Fiat  chairman  Luca  di  Montezemolo,  following  a  meeting  on  Tuesday  regarding  the  future  of  the  Arese  plant.  The  unions  said  the  end  of  engine  production  at  the  facility  would  mean  the  loss  of  800  jobs.  All  Alfa  Romeo  models  can  be  bought  with  a  six-cylinder  engine  -  the  147,  156,  156  Sportwagon,  166,  GTV,  GT  and  Spider."

He  is  working  with  Steve  Brown,  who  wrote  the  award-winning  musical  Spend  Spend  Spend.  A  spokeswoman  said  the  plans  were  in  the  ""very  early  stages"",  with  no  cast,  opening  date  or  theatre  announced.  |||    A  series  of  workshops  have  been  held  in  London,  and  on  Wednesday  a  cast  of  singers  unveiled  the  musical  to  a  select  group  of  potential  investors.  Mr  Thoday  said  the  idea  of  turning  the  film  into  a  musical  had  been  an  ambition  of  his  for  almost  20  years.  It's  a  Wonderful  Life  was  based  on  a  short  story,  The  Greatest  Gift,  by  Philip  van  Doren  Stern.  Mr  Thoday  managed  to  buy  the  rights  to  the  story  from  Van  Doren  Stern's  family  in  1999,  following  Mr  Brown's  success  with  Spend  Spend  Spend.

R&B  singer  Usher  won  best  male  and  best  album  for  Confessions,  while  UK  rock  band  Muse  were  named  best  alternative  act  and  best  British  artists.  OutKast  will  add  their  awards  to  the  four  they  won  at  the  US  MTV  Awards  in  August  and  three  Grammys  in  February.  Not  only  was  Hey  Ya!  one  of  the  biggest  global  hits  of  last  year,  but  OutKast  have  been  widely  acclaimed  as  one  of  the  most  exciting  and  innovative  acts  in  music.  Their  double  CD  album  Speakerboxxx/The  Love  Below,  which  saw  Andre  3000  and  Big  Boi  each  produce  one  disc,  was  hailed  as  the  album  of  2003  by  many  critics.  |||    Andre  3000  thanked  fans  ""for  supporting  OutKast  throughout  the  years"".

Also  competing  for  best  group  had  been  the  Beastie  Boys,  the  Black  Eyed  Peas,  D12  and  Maroon  5.  And  Anastacia,  Britney  Spears,  Maroon  5  and  Ludacris  had  been  on  the  shortlist  for  best  song.  |||    OutKast  did  lose  out  in  the  contest  for  best  album  -  which  was  won  by  Usher,  another  award  favourite.  Usher,  who  performed  a  duet  with  Alicia  Keys,  also  beat  off  competition  from  Justin  Timberlake,  Jay-Z,  Nelly  and  Robbie  Williams  to  take  the  best  male  crown.  He  had  four  nominations  going  into  the  ceremony,  with  seven  artists  nominated  in  three  categories.  |||    Eminem's  group,  D12,  were  surprise  winners  in  the  best  hip-hop  category,  beating  the  Beastie  Boys,  Jay-Z,  Kanye  West  and  Nelly.  Eminem  told  the  crowd:  ""D12  finally  won  an  award,  thank  you  very  much.""  The  rapper  opened  the  show  with  a  performance  of  his  songs  Like  Toy  Soldiers  and  Just  Lose  It,  for  which  he  was  joined  on  stage  by  a  crowd  of  children.  The  Black  Eyed  Peas  -  who  had  a  global  hit  with  Where  is  the  Love?  -  picked  up  the  prize  for  best  pop  act,  beating  Anastacia,  Avril  Lavigne,  Robbie  Williams  and  Britney  Spears.  Spears  was  named  best  female,  sending  a  message  of  thanks  on  video  saying  the  award  ""means  so  much  to  me"".

Muse  were  also  named  best  UK  and  Ireland  act,  ahead  of  Franz  Ferdinand,  Natasha  Bedingfield,  Jamelia  and  The  Streets.  Referring  to  the  fact  that  winners  of  11  of  the  12  main  awards  were  from  the  US,  Muse  singer  Matt  Bellamy  said:  ""There  needs  to  be  more  European  bands.""  The  11th  annual  awards  were  hosted  by  hip-hop  artist  Xzibit  and  watched  by  6,000  people  at  the  Tor  Di  Valle  arena,  plus  millions  more  on  TV  around  the  world.  The  ceremony  featured  performances  from  the  Beastie  Boys,  who  entered  the  stage  on  bicycles  and  skateboards,  No  Doubt  singer  Gwen  Stefani  being  lowered  from  a  giant  clock  and  Nelly  doing  a  duet  with  Pharrell  Williams.  MTV  also  organised  a  huge  open-air  concert  featuring  Anastacia  and  The  Cure  outside  the  Italian  capital's  ancient  Colosseum,  with  some  estimates  putting  the  attendance  there  at  200,000.  Last  year's  big  winner  at  the  MTV  Europe  Awards,  held  in  Edinburgh,  Scotland,  was  Justin  Timberlake,  who  walked  away  with  three  trophies."

Mr  Blair  is  an  enthusiastic  proponent  of  talks  to  bring  Turkey  within  the  recently-expanded  EU.  Italy  and  Germany  also  favour  an  early  start  to  talks,  but  there  is  scepticism  in  France  and  elsewhere.  Some  are  worried  that  Turkey's  large  and  rapidly  growing  population  and  low  average  income  might  make  integration  into  the  EU  difficult.  |||    Some  are  concerned  that  a  change  of  government  could  lead  to  Turkey  reneging  on  key  human  rights  reforms  it  has  recently  enacted.  And  many  in  France  would  prefer  Turkey  to  admit  that  World  War  I-era  killing  of  Armenians  constituted  genocide.  There  are  also  issues  in  France  and  the  Netherlands  over  the  possible  problems  of  integrating  the  first  major  Muslim  nation  into  the  EU.  But  Mr  Blair  and  the  Labour  government  have  been  the  staunchest  backers  of  Turkish  accession,  provided  it  sticks  with  human  rights  and  economic  reform.  Mr  Blair's  official  spokesman  said:  ""The  prime  minister  has  regular  meetings  with  both  of  them  and  particularly  in  advance  of  European  Councils.  ""The  key  issue  at  this  week's  council  will  be  that  of  Turkey,  but  they  will  also  discuss  a  range  of  other  matters.""" 

2	"Protect  whistleblowers,  TUC  says  |||    The  government  should  change  the  law  to  give  more  protection  to  employees  who  raise  health  and  safety  concerns  about  their  workplaces,  the  TUC  has  said.  |||    It  said  data  from  employment  tribunals  suggested  1,500  ""safety  whistleblowers""  had  lost  their  jobs  since  1999.  Some  firms  found  it  cheaper  to  sack  a  worker  than  to  improve  buildings  or  change  working  conditions,  it  said.  The  Health  and  Safety  Executive  said  it  was  trying  to  get  workers  more  involved  in  helping  to  make  workplaces  safer.  The  TUC  figures  were  drawn  from  unfair  dismissal  cases  at  tribunals  were  health  and  safety  were  the  main  issue.  |||    Safety  representatives  were  often  ignored  when  raising  concerns  because  there  was  no  legal  duty  to  respond,  claimed  the  union  organisation.  General  secretary  Brendan  Barber  said:  ""It  shouldn't  be  a  firing  offence  to  object  to  unsafe  work.  ""Workers  should  not  be  placed  in  the  situation  where  they  are  forced  to  choose  between  risking  their  job  or  risking  their  personal  health  and  safety.""  Mr  Barber,  who  said  the  ""problem  is  far  worse  than  official  statistics  show"",  called  for  a  legal  system  that  ""protects  safety  whistleblowers"".  He  added  that  workers  who  are  not  in  a  union,  as  well  as  casual  and  migrant  workers,  ""stand  little  chance  of  redress.""  |||    Rory  O'  Neill,  editor  of  union-backed  Hazards  magazine,  which  conducted  the  research,  said:  ""Giving  union  safety  reps  more  rights  in  more  workplaces  is  the  ultimate  win-win.  ""Death  and  injuries  at  work  increased  last  year,  for  the  second  time  since  the  turn  of  the  century.  ""It  would  be  a  fatal  mistake  not  to  take  full  advantage  of  the  union  safety  effect.""  The  TUC  has  called  on  the  government  to  appoint  ""roving""  safety  reps  and  to  increase  spending  on  health  and  safety  work  inspections.  The  Health  and  Safety  Executive  had  said  that  it  had  launched  an  initiative  to  make  factories  and  offices  safer,  with  more  worker  involvement." 

2	"Brown  names  16  March  for  Budget  |||    Chancellor  Gordon  Brown  will  deliver  his  Budget  to  the  House  of  Commons  on  16  March,  the  Treasury  has  announced.  |||    The  Budget,  likely  to  be  the  last  before  the  General  Election,  will  be  at  1230  GMT  on  that  Wednesday,  just  after  Prime  Minister's  question  time.  The  annual  event  is  when  the  chancellor  outlines  the  government's  taxation  and  broader  economic  predictions.  It  is  likely  to  set  out  much  of  the  tax  and  spending  battleground  for  the  election,  widely  expected  on  5  May.  |||    Next  month's  Budget  will  be  Mr  Brown's  eighth  since  Labour  came  to  power  in  1997.  If  a  May  election  is  called,  there  could  be  as  little  as  18  days  between  the  Budget  and  the  announcement  of  a  date  for  the  election.  A  shortened  Finance  Bill  would  have  to  be  rushed  through  Parliament  with  all-party  support  to  allow  the  Government  to  continue  collecting  revenue.  The  full  Finance  Bill,  with  the  Budget  measures  in  it,  would  then  be  returned  to  the  Commons  after  the  election,  if  Labour  secures  another  term  in  office.  As  Mr  Brown  announced  the  Budget  date  in  a  short  ministerial  statement,  accountancy  firm  Ernst  &  Young  urged  him  to  put  politics  aside  and  focus  on  the  long-term  requirements  of  the  economy.  ""In  the  Budgets  that  were  given  immediately  before  the  last  six  elections,  taxes  were  cut  by  the  incumbent  chancellor  and,  in  many  cases,  taxes  were  increased  soon  after  the  election  result,""  said  Aidan  O'Carroll,  E&Y's  UK  head  of  tax." 

1	"Britney  attacks  'false  tabloids'  |||    Pop  star  Britney  Spears  has  attacked  ""false""  and  ""desperate""  US  tabloid  magazines,  questioning  their  honesty  after  they  reported  she  was  pregnant.  |||    In  a  letter  on  her  website,  the  singer  named  celebrity  tabloids  Us  Weekly,  In  Touch  and  Star  as  the  worst  offenders.  ""Until  you  face  what  is  going  on  in  your  life,  I  guess  you'll  remain  a  false  tabloid,""  the  23-year-old  wrote.  Stories  about  the  state  of  her  marriage  to  Kevin  Federline  and  rumours  about  a  pregnancy  have  recently  appeared.  But  the  chart-topping  singer's  letter  did  not  shed  any  further  light  on  those  stories.  In  February,  Spears  clashed  with  Us  Weekly  for  publishing  pictures  of  her  honeymoon  in  Fiji  without  permission.  The  couple,  who  married  in  Los  Angeles  last  September,  claimed  staff  took  photographs  of  them  which  were  later  sold.  |||    They  said  they  allowed  the  pictures  to  be  taken  after  they  were  assured  they  would  only  be  used  for  a  private  scrapbook,  which  they  later  received  as  a  souvenir.  Us  magazine  was  unrepentant  about  their  decision  to  publish,  saying:  ""Britney  should  start  her  own  magazine  if  she'd  like  to  dictate  her  own  coverage.""  ""Coming  from  a  celebrity  who  sold  pictures  of  both  her  wedding  and  her  stepdaughter,  it's  unlikely  the  issue  here  is  privacy,""  they  added.  Spears  claimed  that  other  magazines  were  approached  with  the  pictures  but  chose  to  contact  her  instead." 

2	"Police  probe  BNP  mosque  leaflet  |||    Police  are  investigating  a  British  National  Party  leaflet  posted  to  homes  in  south  Wales  opposing  plans  for  a  new  mosque.  |||    Anti-racism  campaigners  in  Swansea  have  handed  copies  to  South  Wales  Police.  Swansea's  Muslim  community  is  raising  money  to  open  a  new  mosque  and  community  centre  in  the  former  St  Andrews  United  Reform  Church.  The  building  on  George  Street  has  been  derelict  since  the  1980s.  |||    Taha  Idris,  director  of  the  Swansea  Bay  Race  Equality  Council,  said  his  organisation  contacted  police  after  receiving  complaints  from  the  public.  ""I'm  quite  shocked  to  see  this  sort  of  leaflet  by  the  BNP  in  Swansea,""  he  said.  |||    ""The  BNP  has  tried  in  the  past  to  get  into  Swansea  and  this  is  another  example  of  them  trying  again.  ""I  am  in  no  doubt  that  the  BNP  are  not  needed  and  not  wanted  here.""  A  South  Wales  Police  spokeswoman  confirmed  that  they  were  looking  at  the  contents  of  the  leaflet.  According  to  the  BNP's  website,  they  have  been  posted  to  homes  in  the  Castle  ward.  The  BNP  website  carries  a  photograph  of  party  leader  Nick  Griffin  -  who  lives  near  Welshpool,  mid  Wales  -  delivering  the  leaflet.  The  BNP  has  denied  it  is  trying  to  stir  up  hatred  of  any  race  or  religion,  but  argues  that  they  should  be  able  to  debate  this  without  fear  of  arrest.  Swansea  Unite  Against  Fascism  (UAF)  is  meeting  this  week  to  plan  a  campaign.  Following  the  death  earlier  this  year  of  Kalan  Kawa  Karim,  an  Iraqi  Kurd  living  in  Swansea,  it  organised  an  anti-racism  march  in  the  city  that  was  supported  by  more  than  1,000  people.  It  is  planning  its  own  mail  shot  campaign  and  may  launch  a  petition  in  support  of  the  plans  for  the  mosque.  |||    Andy  Richards,  of  Swansea  UAF,  said  the  leaflet  was  exactly  what  he  had  come  to  expect  from  the  BNP.  |||    ""The  people  of  Swansea  will  not  put  up  with  this.""  Swansea's  Muslim  community  bought  the  former  church,  just  across  the  road  from  the  existing  mosque  on  St  Helen's  Road,  in  the  late  1990s.  Mr  Idris  said  the  community  was  now  raising  money  to  renovate  the  building.  ""It  is  a  landmark  building  in  Swansea  and  would  otherwise  just  crumble,""  he  said.  ""It  is  the  ideal  opportunity  for  the  building  to  be  restored  and  used  in  the  proper  manner.  ""It  will  be  a  Muslim  community  centre.  It's  a  holistic  place  used  for  education,  weddings,  deaths  and  births.""  He  said  space  was  limited  in  the  current  mosque  and  on  some  occasions  Muslims  had  to  travel  to  Llanelli  for  cultural  events." 

2	"Turkey  deal  'to  help  world  peace'  |||    A  deal  bringing  Turkey  a  step  closer  to  EU  membership  is  of  ""fundamental  importance""  to  the  peace  and  security  of  the  world,  Tony  Blair  has  said.  |||    The  deal,  struck  at  the  European  Council  last  week,  also  proved  claims  of  a  clash  between  Muslims  and  Christians  were  ""wrong"",  Mr  Blair  said.  It  represented  the  achievement  of  an  ""historic  British  objective"",  he  added.  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  said  the  deal  laid  to  rest  any  suggestion  the  EU  was  ""anti-Islamic"".  |||    Turkey's  involvement  with  the  EU  would  provide  an  ""invaluable  bridge""  between  Europe  and  the  rest  of  the  world,  Mr  Howard  added.  But  the  Tory  leader  argued  that  the  EU  constitution  was  not  designed  to  take  in  a  country  as  large  as  Turkey.  Mr  Blair  has  been  a  leading  advocate  of  Turkish  membership  despite  controversy  surrounding  the  idea.  He  insisted  that  the  Turkish  leadership  had  made  great  advances  in  improving  its  human  rights  records.  The  deal  to  open  formal  talks  with  Ankara  came  despite  an  EU  demand  for  Turkey  to  recognise  Cyprus.  |||    It  was  agreed  the  issue  can  be  tackled  at  a  later  date  but  Turkish  premier  Recep  Erdogan  had  to  accept  negotiations  did  not  guarantee  his  country  full  EU  membership.  The  internationally  recognised  southern  part  of  Cyprus  is  an  EU  member,  but  Turkey,  which  occupies  northern  Cyprus,  had  previously  insisted  it  would  not  bow  to  demands  to  recognise  the  country,  calling  the  issue  a  ""red  line"".  It  could  take  up  to  15  years  before  Turkey  is  able  to  join,  and  entry  cannot  be  guaranteed.  If  it  joins,  Turkey  may  have  to  accept  restrictions  to  limit  migration  by  its  citizens.  The  EU  has  also  announced  that  it  will  start  accession  talks  with  Croatia  in  April  2005.  However,  talks  will  begin  only  if  the  country  co-operates  fully  with  the  UN  war  crimes  tribunal  for  the  former  Yugoslavia." 

3	"Bellamy  under  new  fire  |||    Newcastle  boss  Graeme  Souness  has  reopened  his  dispute  with  Craig  Bellamy  after  claiming  the  Welshman  was  ""not  good  enough""  for  the  Magpies.  Bellamy  left  Newcastle  to  join  Celtic  on  loan  after  a  major  row  with  Souness.  Souness  -  who  refused  to  refer  to  the  25-year-old  by  name  -  said  Bellamy  did  not  score  enough  goals  ""The  chap  that's  just  gone  has  scored  9.3  goals  a  season  in  his  time  in  senior  football  -  half  of  those  weren't  even  in  the  top  flight,""  said  Souness.  ""That's  not  good  enough  for  a  striker  at  a  club  like  this.  ""We  need  to  have  two  strikers  who  are  near  20  goals  on  a  regular  basis.""  |||    Bellamy  turned  down  a  move  to  Birmingham  in  favour  of  joining  Celtic  after  a  disagreement  about  the  Welsh  international  playing  out  of  position  quickly  escalated.  Earlier  in  the  week,  Souness  had  said  that  he  risked  losing  the  confidence  of  the  players  and  damaging  his  own  reputation  if  he  had  not  taken  a  hard  line  after  Bellamy  accused  him  of  lying.  |||    ""There  are  certain  things  you  can  forgive  and  forget,""  said  Souness.  ""But  if  I'd  been  seen  to  be  weak  in  this  case  there  was  no  future  for  me  with  the  players  in  the  dressing  room  or  any  job  I  have  after  Newcastle.""  He  could  then  return  to  St  James'  Park  -  and  he  says  that  he  wants  to.  However,  it  would  seem  unlikely  he  will  play  for  Newcastle  again  as  long  as  Souness  remains  in  charge." 

2	"Boris  opposes  mayor  apology  |||    Ken  Livingstone  should  ""stick  to  his  guns""  and  not  apologise  for  his  ""Nazi""  comment  to  a  Jewish  reporter,  Tory  MP  Boris  Johnson  has  insisted.  |||    Mr  Johnson  also  claimed  Tony  Blair's  intervention  in  the  row  was  ""an  attempt  to  reassure  Jewish  voters"".  London  mayor  Mr  Livingstone  says  he  is  ""standing  by""  his  remarks  which  likened  an  Evening  Standard  journalist  to  a  ""concentration  camp  guard"".  But  the  prime  minister  says  it  is  time  for  Mr  Livingstone  to  say  sorry.  |||    Labour's  Mr  Livingstone  has  said  his  comments  may  have  been  offensive  but  were  not  racist,  and  said  earlier  this  week  he  would  not  apologise  even  if  Mr  Blair  asked.  Later  the  prime  minister  said:  ""A  lot  of  us  in  politics  get  angry  with  journalists  from  time  to  time,  but  in  the  circumstances,  and  to  the  journalist  because  he  was  a  Jewish  journalist,  yes,  he  should  apologise.""  |||    However,  Mr  Johnson,  who  was  forced  to  apologise  last  year  for  an  article  in  the  magazine  he  edits  about  Liverpudlians  grieving  over  the  death  of  British  hostage  Ken  Bigley,  said  Mr  Blair  ""should  butt  out  of""  the  row.  ""I  don't  see  why  the  prime  minister  has  to  get  involved  in  this,""  The  Spectator  editor  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme.  ""It's  a  dispute  between  Ken  Livingstone  and  a  reporter  on  the  Evening  Standard.""  Mr  Johnson,  MP  for  Henley-on-Thames,  Oxfordshire,  said  he  suspected  Labour  was  now  trying  to  reassure  Jewish  voters  ""because  of  this  curious  way  in  which  Labour  seems  to  be  trying  to  curry  favour  with  disillusioned  Muslim  voters  who  may  be  disillusioned  about  the  war"".  |||    ""Ken  doesn't  think  he's  got  anything  to  say  sorry  for  and  if  that's  really  his  feeling,  then  I  think  that  he  should  stick  to  his  guns,""  he  said.  Mr  Johnson  apologised  last  October  for  perpetuating  an  ""outdated  stereotype""  of  Liverpool  in  the  leader  article  on  the  death  of  Mr  Bigley.  The  article  in  the  magazine  suggested  grieving  Liverpudlians  were  wallowing  in  their  victim  status.  It  also  attributed  blame  to  drunken  Liverpool  football  fans  for  the  1989  Hillsborough  disaster  in  which  96  died.  Mr  Johnson  told  Today:  ""It's  perfectly  true  that  I  got  into  the  grovelling  game  myself  and  when  I  apologised  there  were  some  things  that  I  felt  I  ought  to  say  sorry  for  ...  there  were  also  other  things  I  didn't  think  I  should  apologise  for,""  he  said.  ""But  here's  old  Ken  -  he's  been  crass,  he's  been  insensitive  and  thuggish  and  brutal  in  his  language  -  but  I  don't  think  actually  if  you  read  what  he  said,  although  it  was  extraordinary  and  rude,  I  don't  think  he  was  actually  anti-Semitic.""" 

2	"Kennedy  questions  trust  of  Blair  |||    Lib  Dem  leader  Charles  Kennedy  has  said  voters  now  have  a  ""fundamental  lack  of  trust""  of  Tony  Blair  as  prime  minister.  |||    He  said  backing  his  party  was  not  a  wasted  vote,  adding  that  with  the  Lib  Dems  ""what  you  see  is  what  you  get"".  He  made  his  comments  at  the  start  of  a  day  of  appearances  on  Channel  Five  in  a  session  on  The  Wright  Stuff  programme.  Questions  from  callers,  a  studio  audience  and  the  show's  presenter  covered  Lib  Dem  tax  plans,  anti-terror  laws  and  immigration.  |||    Mr  Kennedy  said  during  his  nearly  22  years  in  Parliament  he  had  seen  prime  ministers  and  party  leaders  come  and  go  and  knew  the  pitfalls  of  British  politics.  ""1983  was  when  I  was  first  elected  as  an  MP  -  so  Tony  Blair,  Michael  Howard  and  myself  were  all  class  of  '83  -  and  over  that  nearly  quarter  of  a  century  the  world  has  changed  out  of  recognition,""  he  said.  ""We  don't  actually  hear  the  argument  any  longer:  'Lib  Dems,  good  people,  reasonable  ideas  but  only  if  we  thought  they  could  win  around  here  -  it's  a  wasted  vote'.  ""You  don't  hear  that  because  the  evidence  of  people's  senses  demonstrates  that  it  isn't  a  wasted  vote.""  But  he  said  Mr  Blair  had  lost  the  trust  of  the  British  people.  ""There  is  a  fundamental  lack  of  trust  in  Tony  Blair  as  prime  minister  and  in  his  government,""  he  said.  |||    ""What  we've  got  to  do  as  a  party  -  what  I've  got  to  do  as  a  leader  of  this  party  -  is  to  convey  to  people  that  what  you  see  is  what  you  get.""  Mr  Kennedy  also  used  his  TV  appearance  to  defend  his  party's  plans  to  increase  income  tax  to  50%  for  those  earning  more  than  £100,000,  saying  it  would  apply  to  just  1%  of  the  population.  He  said  the  extra  revenue  would  allow  his  party  to  get  rid  of  tuition  and  top-up  fees,  introduce  free  personal  care  for  the  elderly  and  replace  the  council  tax  with  a  local  income  tax.  Mr  Blair  has  already  spent  a  day  with  Five  and  Michael  Howard  is  booked  for  a  similar  session." 

0	"Building  giant  in  asbestos  payout  |||    Australian  building  products  group  James  Hardie  has  agreed  to  pay  $1.1bn  (£568m)  to  victims  of  asbestos-related  diseases.  |||    The  landmark  deal  could  see  thousands  of  people  suffering  from  lung  diseases  -  caused  by  asbestos  the  company  once  made  -  receive  compensation.  The  move  follows  angry  protests  after  the  firm  said  a  previous  compensation  fund  was  running  out  of  money.  A  subsequent  New  South  Wales  state  inquiry  criticised  Hardie's  actions.  In  September,  the  inquiry  found  that  the  company  had  misled  the  public  about  the  amount  of  money  set  aside  to  cover  its  asbestos-related  liabilities,  sparking  the  resignation  of  its  then  chief  executive,  Peter  MacDonald.  |||    Campaigners  welcomed  news  of  the  preliminary  agreement.  ""This  is  a  momentous  day  in  the  fight  for  victims  and  their  families,""  said  asbestosis  sufferer  Bernie  Banton,  who  leads  a  victims'  association.  ""There  is  still  a  long  way  to  go,  but  we  are  getting  there.""  James  Hardie  chairwoman,  Meredith  Hellicar,  said  the  deal  provided  for  a  funding  arrangement  ""that  is  affordable,  sensible  and  workable"".  ""At  the  end  of  the  day  we  are  dealing  with  compensation  for  people  who  are  terminally  ill.  We  don't  know  exactly  how  many  of  them  there  will  be,  we  don't  know  over  what  exact  period  they  will  fall  ill,""  she  said.  However,  the  deal  still  has  to  receive  the  approval  of  Hardie's  shareholders.  |||    Hardie,  which  currently  makes  more  than  80%  of  its  revenues  in  the  US,  was  once  Australia's  biggest  supplier  of  asbestos  building  materials.  In  2001,  the  company  set  up  a  fund  to  compensate  asbestos  victims,  but  it  later  admitted  the  fund  was  running  short  of  money.  A  decision  by  Hardie  to  move  its  headquarters  to  the  Netherlands  -  while  remaining  a  listed  company  in  Australia  -  provoked  a  damaging  public  outcry.  Victims  groups  accusing  it  of  trying  to  escape  its  responsibilities  by  moving  abroad,  a  charge  the  company  denies.  Australia's  securities  watchdog  is  currently  investigating  Hardie's  former  chief  executive  and  former  chief  financial  officer  over  allegations  of  misleading  investors  and  the  general  public."

He  said  he  hoped  more  would  be  done  to  build  on  current  tax  credit  rules.  Any  rate  rise  ahead  of  an  expected  May  election  would  not  affect  the  Labour  Party's  chances  of  winning,  he  added.  Last  July,  Mr  Balls  won  the  right  to  step  down  from  his  Treasury  position  and  run  for  parliament,  defending  the  Labour  stronghold  of  Normanton  in  West  Yorkshire.  |||    Mr  Balls  rejected  the  allegation  that  Mr  Brown  had  been  sidelined  in  the  election  campaign,  saying  he  was  playing  a  ""different""  role  to  the  one  he  played  in  the  last  two  elections.  He  rejected  speculation  that  Mr  Brown  was  considering  becoming  Foreign  Secretary,  saying  his  recent  travels  had  been  linked  to  efforts  to  boost  international  development.  Gordon  Brown's  decision  to  announce  the  date  of  the  Budget  while  on  a  trip  to  China  was  a  ""sensible  thing  to  do"",  since  he  was  talking  about  skills  and  investment  at  the  time,  Mr  Balls  told  the  BBC.  Commenting  on  speculation  of  an  interest  rate  rise,  he  said  it  was  not  within  the  remit  of  the  Bank  of  England's  Monetary  Policy  Committee  (MPC)  to  factor  a  potential  election  into  its  rate  decisions.  Expectations  of  a  rate  rise  have  gathered  pace  after  figures  showed  that  house  prices  are  still  rising.  Consumer  borrowing  rose  at  a  near-record  pace  in  January.  ""I  don't  believe  it  would  be  a  big  election  issue  in  Britain  or  a  problem  for  Labour,""  Mr  Balls  said.  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  has  yet  to  name  the  date  of  the  election,  but  most  pundits  are  betting  on  5  May  as  the  likely  day."

Boeing,  in  contrast  to  European  rival  Airbus,  hopes  airlines  will  want  to  fly  smaller  aircraft  over  longer  distances.  Airbus,  which  overtook  Boeing  as  the  number  one  civilian  planemaker  in  2003,  is  focusing  on  so-called  super  jumbos.  |||    Analysts  are  divided  over  which  approach  is  best  and  say  that  this  latest  tussle  between  Boeing  and  Airbus  may  prove  to  be  a  defining  moment  for  the  airline  industry.  Boeing  plans  to  offer  twin-engine  planes  that  are  able  to  fly  direct  to  many  of  the  world's  airports,  getting  rid  of  the  need  for  connecting  flights.  |||    It  is  banking  on  smaller,  slimmer  planes  such  as  the  777-200LR  and  its  much-anticipated  787  Dreamliner  plane,  which  is  set  to  take  to  the  skies  in  2008.  The  777-200LR,  which  had  its  launch  delayed  by  the  11  September  attacks  in  the  US,  is  the  fifth  variation  of  Boeing's  twin-aisle  777  plane.  The  company  offically  ""rolled-out""  the  new  777  in  Seattle  at  2200  GMT.  Better  fuel  efficiency  from  engines  made  by  GE  and  lighter  materials  mean  that  the  plane  can  connect  almost  any  two  cities  worldwide.  |||    ""Boeing  has  the  latest  variant  in  a  very  successful  line  of  airplanes  and  there  is  no  doubt  it  will  continue  to  be  very  successful,""  said  David  Learmount,  operations  and  safety  editor  at  industry  magazine  Flight  International.  But  the  777-200LR  ""is  a  niche  player"",  Mr  Learmount  continued,  adding  that  reach  was  not  the  only  criteria  airlines  used  when  picking  their  aircraft.  Mr  Learmount  pointed  out  that  the  777-200LR  has  been  on  the  market  for  a  couple  of  years  and  only  had  limited  success  at  attracting  orders.  He  also  said  that  while  the  plane  may  be  able  to  fly  to  Sydney  from  London  in  one  hit,  prevailing  winds  meant  that  it  would  have  to  stop  somewhere  on  the  return  journey.  |||    For  Airbus,  the  future  is  big  -  it  is  pinning  its  hopes  on  planes  that  can  carry  as  many  as  840  people  between  large  hub  airports.  From  there,  passengers  would  be  ferried  to  their  final  destinations  by  smaller  planes.  Airbus  is  also  keeping  its  options  open  and  plans  to  compete  in  all  the  main  categories  of  aircraft.  It  has  been  producing  a  rival  to  Boeing's  777  line  for  more  than  a  year.  ""Airbus  is  now  where  Boeing  was  a  few  years  ago""  with  its  product  range,  said  Flight  International's  Mr  Learmount.  |||    Both  Boeing  and  Airbus  have  been  taking  orders  for  their  new  planes.  Boeing  said  it  expected  to  sell  about  500  of  its  777-200LR  planes  over  the  next  20  years.  It  already  has  orders  from  Pakistan  International  Airlines  and  EVA  of  Taiwan.  These  orders  should  help  underpin  the  company's  profits.  Boeing  said  earnings  during  the  last  three  months  of  2004  dropped  by  84%  because  of  costs  relating  to  stopping  production  of  its  smallest  airliner,  the  717,  and  the  cancellation  of  a  US  air  force  767  tanker  contract.  Net  profit  was  $186m  (£98m;  143m  euros)  in  the  quarter,  compared  with  $1.13bn  in  the  same  period  in  2003." 

0	"Mixed  reaction  to  Man  Utd  offer  |||    Shares  in  Manchester  United  were  up  over  5%  by  noon  on  Monday  following  a  new  offer  from  Malcolm  Glazer.  |||    The  board  of  Man  Utd  is  expected  to  meet  early  this  week  to  discuss  the  latest  proposal  from  the  US  tycoon  that  values  the  club  at  £800m  ($1.5bn).  Manchester  United  revealed  on  Sunday  that  it  had  received  a  detailed  proposal  from  Mr  Glazer.  A  senior  source  at  the  club  told  the  BBC:  ""This  time  it's  different"".  The  board  is  obliged  to  consider  this  deal.  But  the  Man  Utd  supporters  club  urged  the  club  to  reject  the  new  deal.  Manchester  United  past  and  present  footballers  Eric  Cantona  and  Ole  Gunnar  Solskjaer,  and  club  manager  Sir  Alex  Ferguson,  have  lent  their  backing  to  the  supporters'  group,  Shareholders  United.  They  have  all  spoken  out  against  the  bid.  |||    A  spokesman  for  the  supporters  club  said:  ""I  can't  see  any  difference  (compared  to  Mr  Glazer's  previous  proposals)  other  than  £200m  less  debt.  ""He  isn't  bringing  any  money  into  the  club;  he'll  use  our  money  to  buy  it.""  |||    Mr  Glazer's  latest  move  is  being  led  by  Mr  Glazer's  two  sons,  Avi  and  Joel,  according  to  the  Financial  Times.  A  proposal  was  received  by  David  Gill,  United's  chief  executive,  at  the  end  of  last  week,  pitched  at  about  300p  a  share.  David  Cummings,  head  of  UK  equities  for  Standard  Life  Investments,  said  he  believed  a  ""well  funded""  300p  a  share  bid  would  be  enough  for  Mr  Glazer  to  take  control  of  the  club.  ""I  do  not  think  there  is  anything  that  Manchester  United  fans  can  do  about  it,""  he  told  the  BBC.  ""They  can  complain  about  it  but  it  is  curtains  for  them.  They  may  not  want  him  but  they  are  going  to  get  him.""  The  US  tycoon,  who  has  been  wooing  the  club  for  the  last  12  months,  has  approached  the  United  board  with  ""detailed  proposals"",  it  has  confirmed.  |||    Mr  Glazer,  who  owns  the  Tampa  Bay  Buccaneers  team,  hopes  this  will  lead  to  a  formal  bid  being  accepted.  He  is  believed  to  have  increased  the  amount  of  equity  in  the  new  proposal,  though  it  is  not  clear  by  how  much.  For  his  proposal  to  succeed,  he  needs  the  support  of  United's  largest  shareholders,  the  Irish  horseracing  tycoons  JP  McManus  and  John  Magnier.  They  own  29%  of  United  through  their  Cubic  Expression  investment  vehicle.  Mr  Glazer  and  his  family  hold  a  stake  of  28.1%.  But  it  is  not  yet  known  whether  Mr  McManus  and  Mr  Magnier  would  support  a  Glazer  bid.  NM  Rothschild,  the  investment  bank,  is  advising  Mr  Glazer,  according  to  the  Financial  Times.  His  previous  adviser,  JPMorgan,  quit  last  year  when  Mr  Glazer  went  ahead  and  voted  against  the  appointment  of  three  United  directors  to  the  board,  against  its  advice.  But  the  FT  said  it  thought  JP  Morgan  may  still  have  had  some  role  in  financing  Mr  Glazer's  latest  financial  proposal."

China  is  trying  to  clean  up  its  banking  system,  which  is  weighed  down  by  billions  of  dollars  of  unpaid  loans.  It  has  already  pumped  $45bn  (£24bn)  into  two  of  its  largest  banks,  and  has  identified  ICBC  as  a  recipient  of  aid.  ICBC's  profits  were  74.7bn  yuan  ($9bn;  £4.8bn)  in  2004,  the  bank  said  in  a  statement.  The  percentage  of  non-performing  loans  dropped  to  19.1%,  down  about  2  percentage  points.  ICBC  was  founded  in  1984  and  had  total  assets  of  5.3  trillion  yuan  at  the  end  of  2003.  China  committed  to  gradually  opening  up  its  banking  sector  when  it  joined  the  World  Trade  Organisation  in  2002."

He  is  expected  to  be  transferred  to  a  state  prison  while  a  decision  is  made  on  whether  he  should  be  released.  Mr  Knight,  founder  of  Death  Row  Records,  served  a  10-month  jail  term  in  2004  for  punching  a  man  while  on  parole  for  an  assault  conviction.  Police  said  Mr  Knight  was  stopped  on  Saturday  after  performing  an  illegal  U-turn  and  a  search  of  his  car  allegedly  found  marijuana.  |||    He  is  also  accused  of  not  having  insurance.  A  18-year-old  woman  in  the  car  was  arrested  for  providing  false  information  and  having  a  fake  ID  card.  She  was  later  released.  It  was  his  second  alleged  violation,  having  previously  served  half  of  a  nine-year  sentence  for  breaking  the  terms  of  his  parole.  Mr  Knight,  39,  was  jailed  in  October  1996  following  his  involvement  in  a  fight  with  a  rival  gang  just  hours  before  rapper  Tupac  Shakur  was  killed  in  a  Las  Vegas  drive-by  shooting.  He  was  driving  Shakur's  car  at  the  time  and  was  shot  in  the  head.  At  the  time  he  was  on  probation  for  assaulting  two  musicians.  Mr  Knight,  a  former  bodyguard,  set  up  Death  Row  records  in  the  early  1990s  with  Shakur  and  Dr  Dre  among  his  protegees.  But  the  label  has  always  been  dogged  by  allegations  it  supports  gang  culture  and  fuels  the  east  and  west  coast  rap  rivalry." 

1	"Fears  raised  over  ballet  future  |||    Fewer  children  in  the  UK  are  following  in  the  dainty  footsteps  of  dancers  like  Darcey  Bussell,  and  carving  out  potential  careers  as  ballet  dancers.  |||    New  research  from  the  Royal  Academy  of  Dance  (RAD)  has  found  fewer  children  over  the  age  of  10  are  attending  ballet  classes  and  taking  exams  in  the  discipline.  The  organisation  blames  the  growing  popularity  of  computer  games  and  other  changes  in  lifestyle.  And  there  are  fears  that  if  the  trend  is  not  reversed,  there  could  be  fewer  British  ballet  stars  in  the  future.  The  RAD  found  that  the  number  of  youngsters  taking  their  ballet  exams  drops  by  almost  70%  after  the  age  of  10  or  11.  Dance  teacher  Eve  Trew,  who  has  taught  ballet  for  over  48  years,  told  BBC  News  she  had  seen  a  ""vast""  change  over  the  years.  She  blamed  modern  lifestyles  for  the  fall  in  ballet  attendance.  ""I  think  the  children  of  many  years  ago  did  not  have  as  many  hobbies,""  she  said.  ""The  trouble  now  is  that  they  are  wide  open  to  computers,  Gameboys  and  everything  else  children  have  got.  ""As  a  result,  there  is  less  time  being  spent  on  ballet  lessons.""  |||    Hazel  Gilbert,  23,  an  information  manager  from  Newcastle,  gave  up  ballet  at  the  age  of  10  and  is  typical  of  the  problem.  ""It's  not  a  very  cool  thing  to  do  when  you  go  to  'big'  school  and  I  think  you  have  to  be  very  focused  on  ballet  to  want  to  carry  on  doing  it,""  she  said.  ""I  used  to  love  it,  but  after  a  certain  age  it  becomes  much  more  disciplined  and  I  didn't  want  that.  ""I  started  getting  into  other  things,  like  swimming  and  kickboxing,  and  ballet  just  wasn't  something  I  wanted  to  do  any  more.""  Ms  Trew,  who  runs  a  dance  school  in  Gateshead,  admitted  it  would  be  ""very  difficult""  to  reverse  the  trend  and  said  many  young  ballet  dancers  were  no  longer  willing  to  make  the  sacrifices  to  succeed.  ""You  have  to  be  very  dedicated  and  you  have  to  be  very  disciplined.  ""It  is  a  career  that  you  have  got  to  really  want  to  do  because  it  is  such  hard  work.  ""Children  these  days  have  not  got  the  time  to  spend  perfecting  it...  that  is  very  sad.""  |||    Currently,  only  two  out  of  16  principal  dancers  at  the  Royal  Ballet  -  Darcey  Bussell  and  Jonathan  Cope  -  are  British,  compared  to  16  of  the  21  principals  in  1985.  But  a  spokesman  for  the  English  National  Ballet  told  BBC  News  that  although  only  two  out  of  their  12  principal  dancers  were  British,  around  a  quarter  of  the  company's  dancers  were  from  the  UK.  He  said  competition  at  open  auditions  in  London  was  ""fierce""  between  talented  dancers  from  all  over  the  world.  The  RAD  have  launched  a  new  competition  to  try  and  reverse  the  decline  in  British  ballet.  Dame  Antoinette  Sibley,  president  of  the  RAD,  launched  the  Fonteyn  Nureyev  Young  Dancers  competition  earlier  this  week.  |||    Aimed  at  children  aged  10  to  13,  it  is  hoped  the  contest  will  help  keep  British  ballet  evolving.  A  spokeswoman  for  the  RAD  said:  ""It  is  our  responsibility  to  re-ignite  the  passion  and  nurture  young  dancers  for  the  long-term  future  of  ballet.  ""We  need  to  provide  them  with  a  framework  and  a  goal  to  work  towards,  with  constant  support  and  coaching  in  an  environment  where  they  can  work  with  their  peers  and  possibly  leading  artists  and  choreographers.  ""Perhaps  more  importantly  provide  them  with  the  opportunity  to  experience  'performance'  themselves.  ""What  better  way  to  reignite  a  passion  for  ballet  than  to  let  them  experience  the  thrill  of  performance?"""

Kraft  rival  PepsiCo  began  a  similar  labelling  initiative  last  year.  The  moves  come  as  the  firms  face  criticism  from  consumer  groups  concerned  at  rising  levels  of  obesity  in  US  children.  Major  food  manufacturers  have  recently  been  reformulating  the  content  of  some  calorie-heavy  products.  |||    Kraft's  new  advertising  policy,  which  covers  advertising  on  TV,  radio  and  in  print  publications,  is  aimed  at  children  between  the  ages  of  six  and  11.  It  means  commercials  for  some  of  its  most  famous  snacks  and  cereals  shown  during  early  morning  cartoon  shows  on  TV  will  now  be  replaced  by  food  and  drink  qualifying  for  Kraft's  new  ""Sensible  Solution""  label.

0	"Brazil  approves  bankruptcy  reform  |||    A  major  reform  of  Brazil's  bankruptcy  laws  has  been  approved  by  the  country's  Congress,  in  a  move  which  it  is  hoped  will  cut  the  cost  of  borrowing.  |||    The  bill,  proposed  in  1993,  has  finally  been  approved  by  the  leadership  of  President  Luiz  Inacio  Lula  da  Silva.  The  old  law,  dating  from  1945,  gave  priority  first  to  workers,  second  to  tax  revenue  and  finally  to  creditors.  The  new  legislation  changes  this,  giving  priority  to  creditors  and  limiting  payments  to  workers.  The  new  regulations  will  limit  payments  to  workers  to  150  times  the  minimum  monthly  salary,  which  is  currently  $94.  The  law  also  makes  it  more  difficult  for  a  company  to  declare  bankruptcy.  However,  when  a  firm  is  declared  bankrupt  it  will  gain  protection  from  creditors  for  180  days  while  a  recovery  plan  is  worked  out.  |||    The  proposals  were  opposed  in  the  past  by  leftist  parties,  including  Mr  Lula's  Worker  Party.  They  considered  that  they  undermined  workers'  rights.  But  President  Lula  became  a  defender  of  the  reforms,  arguing  that  the  country's  bank  lending  margins  were  among  the  highest  in  the  world  and  were  damaging  the  economy.  According  to  Andreas  Adriano  of  Latin  Trade  Magazine,  the  new  bankruptcy  law  will  help  in  reducing  the  spread  -  difference  between  the  interest  rates  of  the  banks  and  federal  bonds.  Nevertheless,  Mr  Adriano  said  to  reduce  the  basic  interest  rate  the  Central  Bank  needs  to  change  its  policy,  focusing  not  only  on  inflation  but  also  on  economic  growth."

But  the  figures  -  revised  after  an  audit  which  led  to  the  sacking  of  the  Canadian  firm's  chief  -  showed  revenue  was  about  4%  higher  than  first  thought.  Nortel  shares,  which  have  lost  nearly  50%  of  their  value  since  last  year,  climbed  1.46%  in  Toronto  on  Tuesday.  Nortel's  head  Frank  Dunn  and  two  other  executives  were  fired  in  January  last  year  after  the  company  announced  it  had  conducted  the  internal  audit.

Analysts  expected  a  figure  closer  to  A$431m.  Qantas  shares  fell  almost  3%,  however,  after  it  warned  that  earnings  growth  would  slow  in  the  second  half.  Sales  will  dip  by  at  least  A$30m  after  the  Indian  ocean  tsunami  devastated  many  holiday  destinations,  Qantas  said.  |||    ""The  tsunami  affected  travel  patterns  in  ways  that  we  were  a  bit  surprised  about,""  chief  executive  Geoff  Dixon  explained.  ""It  certainly  affected  Japanese  travel  into  Australia.  As  soon  as  the  tsunami  hit  we  saw  ...  a  lessening  with  bookings  for  Australia.""  Higher  fuel  costs  also  are  expected  to  eat  into  earnings  in  coming  months.  ""We  don't  have  as  much  hedging  benefit  in  the  second  half  as  we  had  in  the  first,""  said  chief  financial  officer  Peter  Gregg.  Qantas  is  facing  increased  pressure  from  rivals  such  as  low-cost  carrier  Virgin  Blue  and  the  Australian  government  is  in  talks  about  whether  to  allow  Singapore  Airlines  to  fly  between  the  Australia  and  the  US  -  one  of  Qantas'  key  routes.  |||    Even  so,  the  firm  is  predicting  that  full-year  earnings  will  increase  from  the  previous  12  months.  Analysts  have  forecast  full-year  profit  will  rise  about  11%  to  around  A$720  million  ($563  million).  Qantas  boss  Mr  Dixon  also  said  he  would  be  reviewing  the  group's  cost-cutting  measures.  During  the  first  six  months  of  the  fiscal  year,  Qantas  made  savings  of  A$245m,  and  is  on  track  to  top  its  target  of  A$500m  for  the  full  year.  Last  month,  the  company  warned  it  may  transfer  as  many  as  7,000  jobs  out  Australia,  with  Mr  Dixon  quoted  as  saying  that  the  carrier  could  no  longer  afford  to  remain  ""all-Australian""."

""I  wish  I  was  playing  for  Real  Madrid,""  the  21-year-old  told  Cadena  Cope.  ""Hopefully  it  could  happen.  I  love  the  way  Madrid  play.  I'm  not  happy  with  the  way  things  are.""  The  striker  joined  the  Gunners  from  Seville  for  £17m  at  the  start  of  2004,  but  it  has  frequently  been  reported  that  he  is  homesick.  He  began  the  season  in  superb  form  but  has  struggled  to  maintain  his  high  standards  as  Arsenal  have  gradually  lost  the  Premiership  initiative  to  Manchester  United  and  Chelsea.  ""If  I'm  not  (playing  for  Real)  I'm  going  to  have  to  carry  on  playing  with  some  bad  people,""  he  added.  |||    ""I'm  sure  there  are  none  in  the  Real  dressing  room.  ""I'm  happy  Madrid  is  interested  in  me  because  it  has  always  been  my  dream  since  I  was  little  to  play  there.""  Before  the  story  surfaced,  Reyes  had  moved  to  play  down  reports  linking  him  with  the  Spanish  giants,  issuing  a  statement  through  Arsenal  describing  the  speculation  as  ""flattering"".  ""I  have  seen  the  stories  in  the  media  linking  me  with  Real  Madrid,""  he  had  said  on  Thursday  lunchtime.  ""But  not  only  am  I  under  contract  at  Arsenal,  I  am  happy  here  and  committed  to  helping  the  team  win  more  trophies.""  Butragueno,  meanwhile,  was  angry  at  being  impersonated  by  the  radio  disc  jockey.  ""It  is  a  disgrace,  there  is  no  foundation  to  this,""  he  said.  ""He  is  an  Arsenal  player  and  we  have  to  be  respectful.  We  have  to  be  careful  because  of  the  rumours  that  appear  in  the  news.""" 

0	"Japan  economy  slides  to  recession  |||    The  Japanese  economy  has  officially  gone  back  into  recession  for  the  fourth  time  in  a  decade.  |||    Gross  domestic  product  fell  by  0.1%  in  the  last  three  months  of  2004.  The  fall  reflects  weak  exports  and  a  slowdown  in  consumer  spending,  and  follows  similar  falls  in  GDP  in  the  two  previous  quarters.  The  Tokyo  stock  market  fell  after  the  figures  were  announced,  but  rose  again  on  a  widespread  perception  that  the  economy  will  recover  later  this  year.  On  Wednesday,  the  government  revised  growth  figures  from  earlier  in  2004  which,  when  taking  into  account  performance  in  the  most  recent  period,  effectively  tips  Japan  into  recession.  |||    A  previous  estimate  of  0.1%  growth  between  July  and  September  was  downgraded  to  a  0.3%  decline.  A  recession  is  commonly  defined  as  two  consecutive  quarters  of  negative  growth,  although  the  Japanese  government  takes  other  factors  into  account  when  judging  the  status  of  its  economy.  |||    Figures  released  by  the  government's  Cabinet  Office  showed  that  GDP,  on  an  annualised  basis,  fell  0.5%  in  the  last  three  months  of  2004.  However,  politicians  remain  upbeat  about  prospects  for  an  economic  boost  later  in  the  year.  ""The  economy  has  some  soft  patches  but  if  you  look  at  the  bigger  picture,  it  is  in  a  recovery  stage,""  said  Economic  and  Fiscal  Policy  Minister  Heizo  Takenaka.  Gross  domestic  product  measures  the  overall  value  of  goods  and  services  produced  in  a  country.  ""The  economy  must  be  assessed  comprehensively  and  we  cannot  look  at  GDP  alone,""  Mr  Takenaka  stressed.  |||    Ministers  pointed  to  the  fact  that  consumer  spending  had  been  depressed  by  one-off  factors  such  as  the  unseasonably  mild  winter.  Analysts  said  the  figures  were  disappointing  but  argued  that  Japan's  largest  companies  had  been  recording  healthy  profits  and  capital  spending  was  on  the  rise.  Japan's  economy  grew  2.6%  overall  last  year  -  fuelled  by  a  strong  performance  in  the  first  few  months  -  and  is  forecast  to  see  growth  of  2.1%  in  2005.  However,  the  economy's  fragile  recovery  remains  dependent  on  an  upturn  in  consumer  spending,  a  fall  in  the  value  of  the  yen  and  an  improvement  in  global  economies.  ""The  results  came  in  at  the  lower  end  of  expectations  but  we  shouldn't  be  too  pessimistic  about  the  current  state  and  the  outlook  for  the  economy,""  said  Naoki  Iizuka,  senior  economist  at  the  Dai-ichi  Life  Research  Institute.  Japan's  economy  has  seen  stretches  of  moderate  growth  over  the  past  decade  but  has  periodically  slipped  back  into  recession."

But  Deutsche  Boerse  told  news  agency  Reuters  such  a  move  would  have  to  wait  until  May's  annual  general  meeting.  Investors  want  Deutsche  to  return  cash  to  shareholders  rather  than  bid.  ""We  are  long-term  investors  and  are  experienced  in  removing  management.  We  are  not  scared  to  take  this  to  its  conclusion  this  time,""  Atticus'  David  Slager  told  the  Sunday  Times.  However,  Deutsche  Boerse  told  Reuters:  ""TCI's  request  for  the  removal  of  the  supervisory  board  will  be  considered  at  the  annual  general  meeting  on  May  25.""  |||    The  Sunday  Times  reported  that  TCI  had  been  drawing  up  a  list  of  heavyweight  executives  to  replace  Deutsche's  chairman  Rolf  Breuer  and  chief  executive  Werner  Seifert.  The  group  owns  more  than  5%  of  Deutsche  -  more  than  enough  to  demand  an  extraordinary  general  meeting  to  call  on  shareholders  to  oust  the  German  exchange's  management.  Under  German  law  Deutsche  does  not  need  investor  backing  to  make  a  takeover  bid.  TCI  and  Atticus  have  opposed  the  LSE  bid  for  some  time  saying  it  would  destroy  shareholder  value,  and  would  be  better  spent  on  a  share  buyback.  Deutsche  is  in  competition  with  pan-European  bourse  Euronext  to  take  over  the  London  exchange.  Many  commentators  have  suggested  a  bidding  war  between  the  two  could  break  out.  However,  any  such  move  would  have  to  wait  until  March  when  the  Office  of  Fair  Trading  completes  an  investigation  into  the  competition  aspects  of  the  pair's  takeover  proposals."

His  Graceland,  Tennessee,  home  was  the  focus  for  US  celebrations  with  four  days  of  events  including  a  concert  by  the  Memphis  Symphony  Orchestra.  Elvis'  single  Jailhouse  Rock  became  the  UK's  number  one  on  Sunday.  Fans  in  France  celebrated  with  a  tribute  concert  by  Elvis  cover  bands  and  a  special  exhibition  of  memorabilia  is  on  display  in  Bonn,  Germany.  |||    Jailhouse  Rock  is  now  the  999th  number  one  single  in  UK  pop  history.  Record  company  SonyBMG  are  releasing  Elvis'  18  number  one  singles  at  the  rate  of  one  a  week  in  Britain,  complete  with  original  artwork  and  a  collector's  box.  Hit  single  One  Night  will  follow  next  week  -  with  the  chance  of  becoming  the  1,000th  number  one  as  interest  surrounding  Elvis'  birthday  grows.  HMV  spokesman  Gennaro  Castaldo  said:  ""It  would  be  a  fantastic  and  truly  fitting  way  to  celebrate  Elvis'  landmark  birthday.""" 

2	"Russian  ex-spy  on  hunger  strike  |||    An  ex-Russian  intelligence  officer  who  risked  his  life  spying  for  MI6  is  entering  the  seventh  week  of  a  hunger  strike  near  10  Downing  Street.  |||    Viktor  Makarov,  50,  claims  he  has  been  betrayed  by  the  British  authorities,  who  promised  he  would  live  like  an  ""average  British  citizen"".  But  despite  a  £65,000  settlement  four  years  ago,  he  says  he  has  been  denied  defector  status  and  a  decent  pension.  Other  ex-Russian  spies  have  been  given  civil  service  pensions.  ""Hunger  strike  is  a  weapon  of  last  resort.  It  can  work  only  with  determination  and  of  course  the  realisation  of  the  righteousness  of  your  case  -  without  that  it  will  not  work,""  Mr  Makarov  told  the  BBC's  Newsnight  programme.  ""Since  I  came  to  this  country  two  batches  of  promises  have  been  made  and  broken  one  after  the  other.""  |||    Oleg  Gordievsky,  a  senior  KGB  officer  who  became  a  secret  agent  for  the  British,  said  he  was  ""very  happy""  with  the  way  the  government  have  treated  him  since  him  since  he  defected  in  1985.  Commenting  on  Mr  Makarov's  case,  he  said:  ""The  British  state  is  not  a  fat  cow  -  it  is  impossible  to  come  here  and  demand  give  me  more  money  every  week.""  But  Mr  Makarov's  case  has  been  backed  by  David  Kahn  -  a  former  Yale  historian,  and  a  leading  expert  on  code-breaking,  who  has  confirmed  his  information  was  valuable  to  the  Western  allies.  ""I  believe  the  government  of  the  United  Kingdom,  which  in  that  respect  was  probably  the  same  as  most  other  power  authorities  -  took  the  information  that  Victor  Makarov  had,  wrung  him  dry  and  left  him  to  hang  out  in  the  cold,""  Mr  Kahn  said.  |||    Mr  Makarov  joined  the  KGB  in  1970s  Russia,  as  an  idealistic  20  year-old.  One  of  his  fellow  pupils  at  intelligence  school  was  Vladimir  Putin.  At  KGB  headquarters  in  Moscow,  he  was  posted  to  the  secret  16th  directorate  -  which  decoded  intercepted  diplomatic  traffic  from  the  West.  By  the  1980s  he  had  risen  to  the  rank  of  senior  lieutenant  -  and  was  privy  to  the  thoughts  of  Western  powers.  But  he  had  became  deeply  disenchanted  with  the  Soviet  regime  -  fuelled  by  its  repression  both  at  home  and  in  Poland.  |||    Through  his  English  teacher,  he  made  an  approach  to  M16  -  and  then  began  passing  secrets  to  the  British  intelligence  service.  He  spied  for  MI6  for  two  years  before  being  betrayed  by  a  friend  and  sent  to  Perm  35  -  a  Soviet  hard  labour  camp  in  the  Artic  circle.  Within  a  week  of  his  release  in  1992,  he  made  contact  with  the  British  authorities  he'd  been  spying  for,  who  arranged  a  meeting  between  him  and  an  MI6  agent  in  Latvia.  He  was  given  a  false  passport,  and  he  says,  promised  that  he  would  be  given  the  chance  to  live  like  an  average  UK  citizen.  But  after  arriving  in  London  13  years  ago,  he  feels  this  promise  has  not  been  fulfilled.  After  long  periods  of  living  in  bedsits,  with  deteriorating  health,  four  years  ago  he  took  legal  action  against  the  government  -  and  settled  for  £65,000  to  buy  a  small  house.  But  he  says  he  will  remain  on  hunger  strike  until  he  receives  a  decent  pension  and  the  right  to  work,  something  he  feels  he  has  been  denied  because  the  authorities  do  not  trust  him.  Government  sources  told  the  BBC  they  had  reached  a  final  settlement  with  the  former  spy,  which  he  has  been  able  to  appeal  to  security  and  intelligence  tribunals." 

2	"Labour's  Cunningham  to  stand  down  |||    Veteran  Labour  MP  and  former  Cabinet  minister  Jack  Cunningham  has  said  he  will  stand  down  at  the  next  election.  |||    One  of  the  few  Blair-era  ministers  to  serve  under  Jim  Callaghan,  he  was  given  the  agriculture  portfolio  when  Labour  regained  power  in  1997.  Mr  Cunningham  went  on  to  become  Tony  Blair's  ""cabinet  enforcer"".  He  has  represented  the  constituency  now  known  as  Copeland  since  1970.  Mr  Blair  said  he  was  a  ""huge  figure""  in  Labour  and  a  ""valued,  personal  friend"".  |||    During  Labour's  long  period  in  opposition,  Mr  Cunningham  held  a  number  of  shadow  roles  including  foreign  affairs,  the  environment  and  as  trade  spokesman.  As  agriculture  minister  he  caused  controversy  when  he  decided  to  ban  beef  on  the  bone  in  the  wake  of  fears  over  BSE.  He  quit  the  government  in  1999  and  in  recent  years  has  served  as  the  chairman  of  the  all-party  committee  on  Lords  reform  and  has  been  a  loyal  supporter  of  the  government  from  the  backbenches." 

2	"Drink  remark  'acts  as  diversion'  |||    The  first  minister's  statement  that  it  was  okay  to  get  drunk  ""once  in  a  while""  has  diverted  attention  from  the  real  issues,  it  has  been  claimed.  |||    Jack  Law,  chief  executive  of  Alcohol  Focus  Scotland,  said  Jack  McConnell's  comment  was  ""ill-advised"".  The  media  attention  had  helped  to  move  the  focus  from  Scotland's  binge  drinking  problems,  Mr  Law  said.  Scotsman  journalist  Hamish  MacDonell  said  he  believed  the  bigger  picture  had  been  ""obscured""  by  the  remark.  Mr  McConnell  was  speaking  on  Monday  to  more  than  100  secondary  pupils  from  schools  in  the  Highlands  about  the  problems  of  binge  drinking  and  drink  promotions.  |||    The  one-sentence  comment  was  immediately  criticised  by  the  Scottish  National  Party  which  accused  him  of  encouraging  young  people  to  get  drunk.  But  the  Scottish  Executive  has  insisted  Mr  McConnell  was  speaking  about  adults  and  his  comments  were  ""a  recognition  that  people  will  get  drunk"".  Mr  MacDonell,  political  editor  of  The  Scotsman,  said:  ""I  think  we  have  to  say  right  at  the  outset  that  this  was  a  very  stupid  and  ill-advised  remark  by  the  first  minister.  ""If  you  come  out  with  something  like  this,  saying  that  by  all  means  get  drunk,  then  you  will  be  pilloried  for  it.""  However,  he  added  that  ""perhaps  Mr  McConnell  could  feel  rightly  aggrieved  about  the  coverage"".  |||    Mr  MacDonell  said:  ""I  think  the  problem  here  is  that  he  did  say  a  lot  more  things  about  binge  drinking  and  under  age  drinking.  ""But  that  whole  side  of  things  has  been  lost  in  the  furore  over  one  sentence.  I  understand  why,  but  I  think  there  is  a  much  bigger  message  here  that  has  been  obscured.""  Mr  Law,  from  voluntary  body  Alcohol  Focus  Scotland,  believed  damage  had  been  done  to  Scotland's  fight  against  binge  drinking.  He  said  he  accepted  that  young  people  drank  and  they  did  have  problems  with  drink.  Mr  Law  added:  ""I  think  the  remark  was  ill-advised  -  but  these  remarks  are  blown  out  of  all  proportion  and  they  so  easily  misrepresent  what  we  are  trying  to  do  in  Scotland.  |||    ""We  don't  want  to  preach  to  young  people,  but  we  need  to  acknowledge  that  they  do  drink  problematically.  ""This  diverts  us  from  the  real  issues  which  are  about  promoting  responsibility  and  reducing  harm  and  indeed  tackling  our  drinking  culture  which  is  a  culture  about  binge  drinking  and  drunkenness.""  He  said  it  was  vital  that  young  people  were  properly  informed  about  the  risks  incurred  to  themselves  and  others  when  they  got  drunk.  Mr  MacDonell  said  that  the  first  minister  should  know  by  now  that  if  he  said  things  which  were  ""off  the  mark"",  they  were  bound  to  ""come  back  and  bite  him"".  He  added:  ""Here,  Mr  McConnell  was  talking  in  the  Highlands  to  100  teenagers  and  every  word  he  said  was  put  out  on  a  webcast  by  the  Scottish  Executive  and  then  looked  at  by  other  politicians  and  reporters.  ""I  think  in  this  instance  he  has  done  a  lot  of  really  good  things  and  he  will  be  regretting  this  remark.""  |||    The  Scottish  National  Party's  Holyrood  leader  Nicola  Sturgeon  wrote  to  Mr  McConnell  on  Tuesday  accusing  him  of  an  error  of  judgement  and  calling  for  him  to  apologise  for  his  ""ill-judged  comment""  and  withdraw  it  immediately.  In  a  furious  response,  the  first  minister  said  his  comments  had  been  distorted  and  taken  out  of  context.  He  told  Ms  Sturgeon:  ""It  is  disappointing  that  you  have  contributed  to  this  distortion  by  saying  it  is  staggering  that  I  'should  encourage  young  people  to  get  drunk'.  ""That  is  completely  untrue.  Perhaps  it  would  have  been  wiser  for  you  to  find  out  what  was  actually  said  before  you  rushed  to  represent  my  position,  undermine  the  convener  of  education  at  Highland  Council  and  insult  the  intelligence  of  the  young  people  I  spoke  with  -  all  for  the  sake  of  a  simple  soundbite."""

He  claims  the  banks  were  aware  of  the  problems  but  continued  to  work  with  the  company  so  they  could  earn  commissions.  Parmalat  has  not  identified  which  banks  it  has  gone  after  this  time.  Under  Italian  law,  administrators  can  seek  to  get  back  money  paid  to  financial  institutions  prior  to  insolvency,  if  there  is  a  suspicion  that  the  institutions  knew  that  the  company  was  in  financial  trouble.  The  firm  also  said  it  is  preparing  further  law  suits.  |||    According  to  the  Reuters  news  agency,  35  of  the  companies  sued  on  Thursday  are  Italian  while  the  remaining  10  are  international.  The  unidentified  Parmalat  source  also  told  Reuters  that  the  company  was  planning  to  take  action  against  a  total  of  80  financial  institutions.  Among  those  already  targeted  are  Bank  of  America,  UBS,  Credit  Suisse  First  Boston,  Deutsche  Bank  and  Citigroup.  It  has  also  gone  after  auditors  Grant  Thornton.  They  have  all  denied  any  wrongdoing.  Parmalat  was  declared  insolvent  in  December  2003  after  it  emerged  that  4bn  euros  thought  to  be  held  in  an  offshore  account  did  not  in  fact  exist.  In  the  investigation  that  followed  it  became  apparent  that  the  company,  among  other  things,  had  been  billing  clients  twice  in  order  to  boost  sales  and  bolster  the  balance  sheet.  That  enabled  Parmalat  to  borrow  heavily  and  expand  overseas,  allowing  it  to  become  a  darling  of  the  Italian  stock  exchange." 

2	"Talks  aim  to  avert  pension  strike  |||    Talks  aimed  at  averting  a  series  of  national  strikes  over  pensions  reforms  will  take  place  this  weekend.  |||    Five  public  sector  unions  will  hold  private  talks  with  Deputy  Prime  Minister  John  Prescott  at  Labour's  spring  conference  in  Gateshead.  They  want  the  government  to  withdraw  regulations  -  due  to  be  introduced  in  weeks  -  which  would  raise  the  pension  age  for  council  workers  from  60  to  65.  Up  to  1.4m  workers  could  take  part  in  a  strike  already  earmarked  for  23  March.  However,  all  sides  are  anxious  to  avoid  a  major  confrontation  in  the  run  up  to  the  general  election,  said  BBC  labour  affairs  correspondent  Stephen  Cape.  In  four  days,  Britain's  biggest  union  Unison  will  start  balloting  800,000  local  government  workers  on  strikes.  Other  public  sector  unions  have  pledged  to  follow.  It  is  just  weeks  before  new  regulations  are  introduced  to  raise  the  pension  age  of  local  government  workers.  |||    The  five  unions  meeting  Mr  Prescott  want  the  government  to  withdraw  these  regulations.  This  would  allow  months  of  tough  negotiations  to  follow,  said  our  correspondent.  But  a  spokesman  for  Mr  Prescott  warned  that  the  changes  to  the  local  government  pension  scheme  would  have  to  go  ahead  in  April.  Privately  ministers  believe  this  will  be  the  ""less  painful""  option,  our  correspondent  added.  The  Public  and  Commercial  Services  Union  (PCS)  will  co-ordinate  any  industrial  action  with  up  to  six  other  public  sector  unions.  PCS  leader  Mark  Serwotka  warned  last  week  that  there  could  be  further  walkouts  unless  there  was  a  government  rethink.  ""For  a  government  that  lectures  everyone  on  choice  -  choice  on  public  service,  choice  on  this  and  choice  on  that  -  isn't  it  ironic  that  they're  saying  to  public  sector  workers  there  is  no  choice,""  he  said.  ""If  you  want  the  pension  you  were  promised  when  you  started  you  must  work  for  an  extra  five  years  -  that  is  working  until  people  drop.  ""In  the  20th  century,  it's  completely  unacceptable.""  |||    Unison's  800,000  workers,  the  Transport  and  General  Workers'  Union's  70,000  and  Amicus'  20,000  are  among  those  being  balloted  about  a  23  March  walkout.  Mr  Prescott  held  a  private  meeting  with  senior  union  figures  last  week.  It  is  understood  no  deal  was  offered  in  that  meeting  but  there  was  room  for  further  negotiations."

Rival  pan-European  bourse  Euronext  is  working  also  on  a  bid.  Late  on  Monday,  Deutsche  Boerse  said  it  would  lift  its  2004  dividend  payment  to  70  euro  cents  (£0.48;  $0.98)  from  55  euro  cents  a  year  earlier.  ""There  is  a  whiff  of  a  sweetener  in  there,""  Anais  Faraj,  an  analyst  at  Nomura  told  the  BBC's  World  Business  Report.  ""Most  of  the  disgruntled  shareholders  of  Deutsche  Boerse  are  complaining  that  the  money  that  is  being  used  for  the  bid  could  be  better  placed  in  their  hands,  paid  out  in  dividends,""  Mr  Faraj  continued.  Deutsche  Boerse  is  ""trying  to  buy  them  off  in  a  sense"",  he  said."

In  2003,  the  US  was  ahead  with  20.5%  and  China  came  second  with  19.2%.  The  change  highlights  China's  growing  importance  as  an  economic  powerhouse.  In  2004,  Japan's  imports  from  and  exports  to  China  (and  Hong  Kong)  added  up  to  22,201bn  yen  ($214.6bn;£114.5bn).  This  is  the  highest  figure  for  Japanese  trade  with  China  since  records  began  in  1947.  It  compares  with  20,479.5bn  yen  in  trade  with  the  US.  |||    Trade  with  the  US  during  2004  was  hurt  by  one-off  factors,  including  a  13-month  ban  on  US  beef  imports  following  the  discovery  of  a  cow  infected  with  mad  cow  disease  (BSE)  in  the  US.  However,  economists  predict  China  will  become  an  even  more  important  Japanese  trading  partner  in  the  coming  years.  On  Tuesday,  figures  showed  China's  economy  grew  by  9.5%  in  2004  and  experts  say  the  overall  growth  picture  remains  strong.  Analysts  see  two  spurs  to  future  growth  as  being  China's  membership  of  the  World  Trade  Organisation  and  lower  trade  tariffs.  During  2004,  Japan's  trade  surplus  grew  17.9%  to  12.011  trillion  yen,  with  more  than  half  the  surplus,  6.962  trillion  yen,  accounted  for  by  its  trade  with  the  US.  In  December,  the  surplus  grew  1.8%  on  a  year  ago  to  1.14  trillion  yen  thanks  to  stronger-than-expected  exports."

The  firms  took  action  after  the  death  from  a  central  nervous  system  disease  and  a  suspected  case  of  the  condition.  The  cases  cited  involved  the  use  of  both  Tysabri  and  Avonex,  Biogen  Idec's  existing  multiple  sclerosis  drug.  The  companies  said  they  have  no  reports  of  the  rare  condition  -  progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy  (PML)  -  in  patients  taking  either  Tysabri  or  Avonex  alone.  Tysabri  was  approved  for  use  in  the  US  last  November  and  was  widely  tipped  to  become  the  world's  leading  multiple  sclerosis  treatment.  |||    ""The  companies  will  work  with  clinical  investigators  to  evaluate  Tysabri-treated  patients  and  will  consult  with  leading  experts  to  better  understand  the  possible  risk  of  PML,""  the  two  firms  said  in  a  statement.  ""The  outcome  of  these  evaluations  will  be  used  to  determine  possible  re-initiation  of  dosing  in  clinical  trials  and  future  commercial  availability.""  |||    Analysts  had  believed  the  product  would  provide  a  new  growth  opportunity  for  Biogen  Idec,  which  had  faced  increased  competition  from  rivals  to  Avonex.  Elan,  once  the  biggest  firm  on  the  Irish  stock  exchange,  was  also  expected  to  receive  a  boost,  from  the  new  product.  An  inquiry  into  Elan's  accounts  in  2002  brought  the  group  close  to  bankruptcy  but  the  firm  has  been  rebuilding  itself  since,  with  its  share  price  increasing  by  almost  four-fold  last  year.  ""Most  of  the  value  in  the  company  was  in  Tysabri,""  said  Ian  Hunter  at  Goodbody  Stockbrokers  in  Dublin.  ""Now  there's  a  question  mark  over  it.""  Elan  finished  down  $18.90  at  $8,  while  Biogen  fell  $28.63  to  $38.65.  |||    -  Shares  in  UK  pharmaceutical  firm  Phytopharm  closed  down  19.84%  at  151.5  pence  on  the  London  Stock  Exchange  on  Monday,  after  it  said  a  partner  was  set  to  pull  out  of  a  deal  on  an  experimental  Alzheimer's  disease  treatment.  Phytopharm  said  Japan's  Yamanouchi  Pharmaceutical  was  likely  to  end  a  licensing  agreement,  prompting  analysts  to  raise  questions  over  the  level  of  its  future  cash  reserves." 

1	"Corbett  attacks  'dumbed-down  TV'  |||    Ronnie  Corbett  has  joined  fellow  comedy  stars  Victoria  Wood  and  David  Jason  in  attacking  the  declining  standards  of  British  television  programmes.  |||    Speaking  to  the  Radio  Times,  the  Two  Ronnies  star  said  there  is  too  much  bad  language  and  reality  TV.  ""You  get  fed  up  watching  shows  with  not  much  care  and  love,""  he  complained.  Corbett,  soon  to  reunite  with  Ronnie  Barker  for  a  new  Two  Ronnies  series,  also  criticised  quiz  shows  like  the  BBC's  They  Think  It's  All  Over.  ""It's  just  laughing  at  each  other  and  thinking,  'Aren't  we  clever?'""  said  the  74-year-old  comedian.  Corbett  is  the  latest  comedy  star  to  bemoan  the  ""dumbing  down""  of  modern  TV  programmes.  In  an  interview  published  in  the  Radio  Times  in  January,  Victoria  Wood  slated  comedian  Sacha  Baron  Cohen  for  his  character  Ali  G's  ""horrible""  brand  of  ""victim""  humour.  |||    ""With  so  many  good  writers  and  good  performers,  it's  a  shame  people  can't  just  write  a  script  and  have  other  people  learn  it,""  she  said.  And  last  week  Only  Fools  and  Horses  star  David  Jason  criticised  British  TV  for  being  ""too  safe  and  too  cheap"".  ""We've  got  to  be  careful  not  to  dumb  down  for  the  audience,""  he  said.  ""They  shouldn't  be  sitting  at  home  on  the  sofa  vegetating.""  Corbett  said  he  and  Barker  were  always  mindful  of  their  family  audience  while  making  The  Two  Ronnies.  ""Our  material  was  good-natured,""  he  said.  ""We  knew  what  would  upset  the  average  man  in  the  street.  ""There's  a  lot  of  swearing  on  TV  today.  They  even  have  documentaries  with  the  f-word.""  |||    Corbett  goes  on  to  criticise  ""reality  programmes  where  they  put  people  in  a  house  for  a  fortnight  and  film  them  doing  everything"".  The  Two  Ronnies  ran  from  1971  to  1987  and  attracted  17  million  viewers  at  its  peak.  Its  bespectacled  stars  will  return  later  this  year  in  The  Two  Ronnies  Sketchbook,  which  will  combine  classic  sketches  with  newly  recorded  material.  Corbett  claims  he  and  Barker  differ  from  today's  celebrities  in  that  they  did  not  allow  their  success  to  go  to  their  heads.  ""We  were  never  temperamental,  fractious  or  walked  out  slamming  doors,""  he  said.  ""We  were  fussy  though,""  he  added.  ""We  wanted  everything  done  properly.""" 

2	"Blair  ready  to  call  election  |||    Tony  Blair  seems  certain  to  end  weeks  of  phoney  war  on  Monday  and  announce  there  will  be  a  general  election  on  5  May.  |||    The  date  has  been  pencilled  into  the  diaries  of  politicians  and  political  journalists  for  many  months  and,  despite  occasional  panics  that  the  prime  minister  was  on  the  verge  of  calling  a  snap  poll,  it  has  not  shifted.  Over  the  weeks,  there  have  been  any  number  of  signs  that  050505  was  going  to  be  the  day  Mr  Blair  would  go  for  an  historic  third  term.  And  the  calling  of  a  special  political  cabinet  meeting  has  only  added  to  the  belief  that  the  announcement  is  imminent.  The  prime  minister  and  his  campaign  boss  Alan  Milburn  have  already  insisted  the  election  will  be  fought  on  the  economy  and  what  they  claim  is  a  stark  choice  between  Labour's  stability  and  investment  against  Tory  cuts  and  boom  and  bust.  |||    And  Chancellor  Gordon  Brown  has  stepped  into  the  front  line  of  the  campaign  -  to  the  relief  of  many  of  his  supporters  in  Westminster  -  to  underline  that  economic  message.  And  it  is  certain  one  of  the  big  arguments  at  the  centre  of  the  election  battle  will  be  around  the  big  parties'  tax  and  spend  policies.  |||    During  the  phoney  campaign,  Labour  got  into  trouble  over  its  central  claim  that  Michael  Howard  was  planning  £35  bn  cuts  in  public  services.  The  prime  minister  found  himself  struggling  to  explain  how  a  smaller,  slower  increase  in  spending  planned  by  the  Tories  compared  to  Labour's  plans  was  a  cut.  And  it  looked  like  the  Labour  campaign  -  which  was  already  being  criticised  for  being  thrown  into  defensive  mode  by  Mr  Howard  on  issues  such  as  immigration  and  health  -  was  on  the  rocks.  Then  deputy  Conservative  Chairman  Howard  Flight  was  reported  to  have  suggested  Mr  Howard  was  secretly  planning  even  bigger  ""cuts"".  |||    He  was  sacked  for  his  gaffe,  but  the  damage  had  been  done  and  the  faltering  Labour  campaign  was  back  on  track.  A  second  central  argument  will  be  over  taxation,  with  the  Tories  claiming  the  Chancellor  has  to  fill  a  black  hole  at  the  centre  of  his  finances  and  will  be  forced  to  raise  taxes  if  Labour  wins  again.  Mr  Brown  slaps  that  aside,  claiming  his  forecasts  are  accurate  and  that  previous  claims  of  looming  economic  disaster  have  proved  inaccurate.  As  usual,  the  Liberal  Democrats  will  have  to  fight  to  get  their  voice  heard  over  the  sounds  of  battle  between  the  two  big  parties.  But  leader  Charles  Kennedy  believes  he  has  set  out  a  distinctive  manifesto  with  plans  for  a  tax  rise  for  the  wealthiest  to  finance  extra  spending  and  the  abolition  of  the  council  tax  in  favour  of  a  local  income  tax.  Other  issues  are  certain  to  play  a  part  -  immigration  and  asylum,  the  war  on  Iraq,  law  and  order  and  education,  for  example.  But,  as  ever,  it  will  be  the  economy  that  will  almost  certainly  decide  the  outcome.  And,  whatever  that  outcome,  2005  is  set  to  be  a  far  more  lively,  even  bitter  campaign  than  2001's  non-event." 

0	"Worldcom  boss  'left  books  alone'  |||    Former  Worldcom  boss  Bernie  Ebbers,  who  is  accused  of  overseeing  an  $11bn  (£5.8bn)  fraud,  never  made  accounting  decisions,  a  witness  has  told  jurors.  |||    David  Myers  made  the  comments  under  questioning  by  defence  lawyers  who  have  been  arguing  that  Mr  Ebbers  was  not  responsible  for  Worldcom's  problems.  The  phone  company  collapsed  in  2002  and  prosecutors  claim  that  losses  were  hidden  to  protect  the  firm's  shares.  Mr  Myers  has  already  pleaded  guilty  to  fraud  and  is  assisting  prosecutors.  |||    On  Monday,  defence  lawyer  Reid  Weingarten  tried  to  distance  his  client  from  the  allegations.  During  cross  examination,  he  asked  Mr  Myers  if  he  ever  knew  Mr  Ebbers  ""make  an  accounting  decision?"".  ""Not  that  I  am  aware  of,""  Mr  Myers  replied.  ""Did  you  ever  know  Mr  Ebbers  to  make  an  accounting  entry  into  Worldcom  books?""  Mr  Weingarten  pressed.  ""No,""  replied  the  witness.  Mr  Myers  has  admitted  that  he  ordered  false  accounting  entries  at  the  request  of  former  Worldcom  chief  financial  officer  Scott  Sullivan.  Defence  lawyers  have  been  trying  to  paint  Mr  Sullivan,  who  has  admitted  fraud  and  will  testify  later  in  the  trial,  as  the  mastermind  behind  Worldcom's  accounting  house  of  cards.  |||    Mr  Ebbers'  team,  meanwhile,  are  looking  to  portray  him  as  an  affable  boss,  who  by  his  own  admission  is  more  PE  graduate  than  economist.  Whatever  his  abilities,  Mr  Ebbers  transformed  Worldcom  from  a  relative  unknown  into  a  $160bn  telecoms  giant  and  investor  darling  of  the  late  1990s.  Worldcom's  problems  mounted,  however,  as  competition  increased  and  the  telecoms  boom  petered  out.  When  the  firm  finally  collapsed,  shareholders  lost  about  $180bn  and  20,000  workers  lost  their  jobs.  Mr  Ebbers'  trial  is  expected  to  last  two  months  and  if  found  guilty  the  former  CEO  faces  a  substantial  jail  sentence.  He  has  firmly  declared  his  innocence." 

1	"Prince  crowned  'top  music  earner'  |||    Prince  earned  more  than  any  other  pop  star  in  2004,  beating  artists  such  Madonna  and  Elton  John  in  US  magazine  Rolling  Stone's  annual  list.  |||    The  singer  banked  $56.5m  (£30.4m)  from  concerts,  album  and  publishing  sales  with  his  Musicology  tour  and  album.  He  kept  Madonna  in  second  place,  as  she  earned  $54.9m  (£29.5m)  while  embarking  on  her  global  Re-Invention  Tour.  Veterans  Simon  and  Garfunkel  were  in  10th  place,  their  comeback  tour  helping  them  earn  $24.9m  (£13.4m)  last  year.  |||    ""Prince  returned  to  centre  stage  after  a  decade  in  the  commercial  wilderness,""  the  magazine  reported.  The  singer's  2004  tour  took  $90.3m  (£48.5m)  in  ticket  sales  and  he  sold  1.9  million  copies  of  his  latest  album  Musicology.  |||    Although  she  grossed  more  than  Prince  last  year,  Madonna  remained  in  second  place  because  of  the  ""monumental""  production  costs  of  her  tour.  Heavy  metal  band  Metallica's  Madly  in  Anger  with  the  World  tour  helped  push  their  2004  earnings  up  to  $43.1m  (£23.1m).  They  were  ahead  of  Sir  Elton  John,  who  took  fourth  place  and  almost  $42.7m  (£23m)  from  performances  including  a  debut  on  the  Las  Vegas  Strip.  Other  seasoned  performers  in  the  list  included  Rod  Stewart,  whose  sold-out  shows  and  third  volume  of  The  Great  American  Songbook  covers  album  helped  net  him  £35m  (£19m).  The  highest-ranking  rap  act  in  the  list  was  50  Cent,  who  at  number  19  took  $24m  (£13m)  to  the  bank." 

2	"Jowell  rejects  'Las  Vegas'  jibe  |||    The  Secretary  of  State  for  Culture,  Media  and  Sport,  Tessa  Jowell,  has  hit  out  at  critics  of  the  Gambling  Bill.  |||    She  told  the  Guardian  newspaper  there  would  be  no  ""Las  Vegas-style""  super-casinos,  as  rumoured  in  the  press.  Meanwhile  Labour  backbencher  Stephen  Pound  labelled  casino-related  regeneration  schemes  ""a  pile  of  pants"".  The  MP  for  Ealing  North  claimed  the  legislation  would  encourage  a  mafia-like  culture  of  vice  and  corruption,  in  an  interview  on  BBC  Radio  4.  ""You  look  at  some  of  the  people  who  are  involved...they  aren't  in  there  to  regenerate  Blackpool.  They  are  in  it  to  fill  their  boots,""  Mr  Pound  told  the  Today  programme.  ""I  just  really  think  that  we  have  made  a  terrible  mistake  here.  And  over  all  of  it  hangs  the  shadow  of  the  men  in  the  chalk-stripe  suits  with  names  that  rhyme  with  spaghetti,""  he  said.  |||    Ms  Jowell  complained  of  the  ""scale  of  misrepresentation""  in  the  media  over  the  bill  in  her  interview  with  the  newspaper,  her  first  since  the  bill  was  launched.  The  culture  secretary  said  a  four  year  consultation  period  had  produced  a  consensus  on  the  need  to  ""protect  children  and  the  vulnerable""  in  a  swiftly  changing  sector.  Ms  Jowell  insisted:  ""We  have  a  good  track  record  for  extracting  planning  gain  in  this  country,  for  instance  in  social  housing.""  And  continued:  ""We  can  be  proud  to  have  one  of  the  lowest  rates  of  problem  gambling  in  the  world.  I  intend  to  keep  it  that  way.""  Ms  Jowell  will  set  out  her  position  when  the  Bill  is  debated  in  the  Commons  on  Monday.  In  prime  minister's  questions  last  week  Tony  Blair  assured  Parliament  that  90%  of  the  bill  was  about  tightening  up  the  regulation  of  the  gambling  industry." 

2	"Tories  pledge  free  sports  lessons  |||    Children  would  be  offered  two  hours'  free  sports  training  a  week  by  a  future  Tory  government,  the  party  has  said.  |||    The  Club2School  policy  would  provide  up  to  £250m  yearly  for  local  sports  clubs  in  the  UK  to  deliver  after-school  sport.  The  extra  coaching  would  be  funded  by  the  National  Lottery  and  would  come  on  top  of  the  two  hours  of  sport  a  week  children  are  supposed  to  get  in  school.  Shadow  home  secretary  David  Davis  said  five  million  children  were  being  denied  adequate  sporting  opportunities.  |||    The  plans  would  help  tackle  the  ""fastest  growing  rate  of  obesity  in  the  developed  world"",  he  said.  Shadow  sports  minister  Lord  Moynihan  said  the  policy  would  empower  local  clubs  and  create  a  lasting  legacy.  ""We  aim  to  shift  the  emphasis  on  after-school  sport  provision  away  from  our  overstretched  teachers  and  schools  directly  in  to  the  151,000  sports  clubs  in  the  UK.""  The  Tories  say  Labour's  plans  to  give  all  children  two  hours  of  sports  lessons  a  week  in  schools  have  failed.  Government  figures  show  that  in  England  in  2002  only  a  third  of  schools  at  Key  Stages  1,  3  and  4  and  two-fifths  of  schools  at  Key  Stage  2,  met  that  target.  The  Tories  also  claim  that  of  the  £750m  the  prime  minister  pledged  in  2000  to  invest  on  school  sports  facilities,  only  £41m  had  been  spent.  But  the  Big  Lottery  Fund  has  said  that  complex  capital  projects  are  involved  -  and  it  was  confident  the  money  would  all  be  allocated  by  next  year  as  intended."
