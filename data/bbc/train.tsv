China  has  sucked  in  raw  materials  and  energy  to  feed  its  expansion,  which  could  have  knock-on  effects  on  the  rest  of  the  world  if  it  overheats.  But  officials  pointed  out  that  industrial  growth  had  slowed,  with  services  providing  much  of  the  impetus.  Growth  in  industrial  output  -  the  main  target  of  government  efforts  to  impose  curbs  on  credit  and  investments  -  was  11.5%  in  2004,  down  from  17%  the  previous  year.  |||    Still,  consumer  prices  -  at  2.4%  -  rose  faster  than  in  2004,  adding  to  concern  that  a  sharp  rise  in  producer  prices  of  7.1%  could  stoke  inflation.  And  overall  investment  in  fixed  assets  was  still  high,  up  21.3%  from  the  previous  year  -  although  some  way  off  the  peak  of  43%  seen  in  the  first  quarter  of  2004.  The  result  could  be  higher  interest  rates.  China  raised  rates  by  0.27  percentage  points  to  5.8%  -  its  first  hike  in  nine  years  -  in  October  2004.  |||    Despite  the  apparent  rebalancing  of  the  economy  the  overall  growth  picture  remains  strong,  economists  said.  ""There  is  no  sign  of  a  slowdown  in  2005,""  said  Tim  Congdon,  economist  at  ING  Barings.  |||    China's  economy  is  not  only  gathering  speed  thanks  to  domestic  demand,  but  also  from  soaring  sales  overseas.  Figures  released  earlier  this  year  showed  exports  at  a  six-year  high  in  2004,  up  35%.  Part  of  the  impetus  comes  from  the  relative  cheapness  of  the  yuan,  China's  currency.  The  government  keeps  it  pegged  close  to  a  rate  of  8.28  to  the  US  dollar,  -  much  to  the  chagrin  of  many  US  lawmakers  who  blame  China  for  lost  jobs  and  competitiveness.  Despite  urging  to  ease  the  peg,  officials  insist  they  are  a  long  way  from  ready  to  make  a  shift  to  a  more  market-set  rate.  ""We  need  a  good  and  feasible  plan  and  formulating  such  a  plan  also  needs  time,""  National  Bureau  of  Statistics  chief  Li  Deshui  told  Reuters.  ""Those  who  hope  to  make  a  fortune  by  speculating  on  a  renminbi  revaluation  will  not  succeed  in  making  a  profit.""" 

1	"Cage  film's  third  week  at  US  top  |||    Nicolas  Cage  movie  National  Treasure  has  topped  the  US  and  Canada  box  office  for  the  third  week  in  a  row.  |||    National  Treasure  made  $17.1m  (£8.8m)  in  ticket  sales  from  Friday  to  Sunday,  according  to  studio  estimates,  taking  its  total  to  $110.2m  (£56.7m).  Comedy  Christmas  with  the  Kranks,  starring  Tim  Allen  and  Jamie  Lee  Curtis,  was  in  second  place.  The  Polar  Express  entered  in  third  place  while  Jude  Law  film  Closer  made  its  debut  at  number  six.  |||    Oliver  Stone's  big-budget  epic  Alexander,  starring  Colin  Farrell,  followed  last  week's  disappointing  sixth-place  opening  with  a  slump  to  seventh  place  and  takings  of  $4.7m  (£2.4m).  Critics  have  savaged  the  three-hour  epic,  which  reportedly  cost  $150m  (£77m)  to  make.  National  Treasure,  which  sees  Cage's  character  Ben  Gates  chase  a  hidden  fortune,  has  been  made  by  Disney  Studios.  It  is  Cage's  fourth  collaboration  with  Jerry  Bruckheimer,  who  is  usually  noted  for  his  male-orientated  action  films." 

2	"Clarke  to  press  on  with  ID  cards  |||    New  Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  has  vowed  to  plough  on  with  plans  for  ID  cards  despite  a  call  for  him  to  ""pause  for  thought""  from  Charles  Kennedy.  |||    The  Lib  Dem  leader  said  David  Blunkett's  resignation  was  a  ""good  opportunity""  to  question  whether  the  legislation  was  necessary.  But  Mr  Clarke  said  he  had  supported  the  plans  when  Mr  Blunkett  argued  for  them  in  Cabinet  and  he  supported  them  now.  ""ID  cards  are  a  means  to  creating  a  more  secure  society,""  he  said.  Mr  Clarke  acknowledged  how  the  measure  was  introduced  remained  a  matter  for  debate  but  he  said  legislation  had  already  been  ""significantly  influenced""  by  the  recommendations  of  the  Commons'  home  affairs  committee.  |||    The  issue  would  be  debated  in  Parliament  next  Monday  as  scheduled  he  insisted.  Earlier  Mr  Kennedy,  whose  party  opposes  the  ID  cards  plan  as  ""deeply  flawed""  said  with  Christmas  coming  up  the  new  home  secretary  had  time  to  think  again.  He  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme  that  Mr  Clarke  had  been  reported  to  be  less  enthusiastic  about  ID  cards  than  his  predecessors.  ""Wouldn't  this  be  a  good  opportunity  for  a  new  home  secretary,  a  new  broom,  to  sweep  clean  in  this  respect  and  why  do  we  need  this  legislation  in  the  first  place?""  he  asked.  Earlier  this  week  the  Tories  announced  they  would  back  the  government's  plans  although  Michael  Howard  was  forced  to  deny  the  shadow  cabinet  was  split  over  its  decision.  |||    They  had  decided  to  support  the  plans  as  the  police  said  they  would  help  fight  terror,  crime  and  illegal  immigration.  Among  those  reported  to  have  serious  reservations  over  the  strategy  were  senior  shadow  cabinet  members  David  Davis,  Oliver  Letwin  and  Tim  Yeo.  The  chairman  of  the  Bar  Council,  Guy  Mansfield  QC  has  warned  there  is  a  real  risk  that  people  on  the  ""margins  of  society""  would  be  driven  into  the  hands  of  extremists.  ""What  is  going  to  happen  to  young  Asian  men  when  there  has  been  a  bomb  gone  off  somewhere?  They  are  going  to  be  stopped.  If  they  haven't  [ID  cards]  they  are  going  to  be  detained.""  |||    The  Home  Office  says  people  will  pay  £85  for  a  passport  and  ID  card  together  or  a  undecided  fee  for  a  separate  ID  card.  The  first  cards  would  be  issued  in  2008  and  when  he  was  introducing  the  bill,  Mr  Blunkett  suggested  Parliament  could  decide  in  2011  or  2012  whether  to  make  it  compulsory  for  everybody  to  own  the  cards,  although  not  to  carry  them.  The  new  bill  will  also  create  new  criminal  offences  on  the  possession  of  false  identity  documents.  And  there  will  be  civil  penalties  including  a  fine  of  up  to  £1,000  fine  for  people  who  fail  to  say  they  have  moved  house  or  changed  other  details  and  of  up  to  £2,500  for  failing  to  sign  up  if  the  cards  become  compulsory.  The  scheme  will  be  overseen  by  a  new  independent  watchdog." 

1	"Jackson  film  'absolute  disaster'  |||    A  PR  expert  has  told  the  Michael  Jackson  child  abuse  trial  that  the  TV  documentary  at  the  heart  of  the  case  was  an  ""absolute  disaster"".  |||    Ann  Kite  told  the  court  in  the  Californian  town  of  Santa  Maria  she  was  hired  to  ""crisis  manage""  the  fallout  after  the  programme  had  aired  in  2003.  Jurors  saw  the  film,  in  which  the  pop  star  held  hands  with  the  alleged  victim,  on  Tuesday.  Mr  Jackson  denies  10  charges  of  child  abuse  and  false  imprisonment.  If  convicted,  he  could  face  up  to  21  years  in  prison.  |||    Ms  Kite  suggested  Jackson's  associates  had  been  intent  on  launching  a  smear  campaign  against  the  accuser's  family  after  the  airing  of  Martin  Bashir's  film  Living  with  Michael  Jackson.  She  told  the  court  that  in  the  aftermath  of  the  broadcast,  a  Jackson  lawyer  had  told  her  the  boy's  mother  would  be  made  to  look  like  a  ""crack  whore"".  Jackson's  defence  questioned  Ms  Kite's  credibility,  pointing  that  she  worked  for  the  singer's  team  for  less  than  a  week  before  being  fired,  and  had  never  met  or  spoken  to  the  star.  |||    Ms  Kite  said  she  received  a  phone  call  on  13  February  2003  from  a  Jackson  associate,  Marc  Schaffel,  who  said  the  boy  and  his  family  had  left  the  Neverland  ranch  where  they  had  been  staying.  |||    Ms  Kite  told  the  court  she  had  later  asked  Jackson's  lawyer,  David  LeGrand,  what  had  happened.  ""I  said,  `Don't  make  me  believe  that  these  people  were  hunted  down  like  dogs  and  brought  back  to  the  ranch',""  she  said.  Ms  Kite  began  to  work  for  Mr  Jackson  in  February  2003,  after  the  controversial  film  was  televised  in  the  US  and  Europe.  The  documentary  sparked  a  media  storm  and  the  subsequent  investigation  into  Mr  Jackson's  relationship  with  the  boy.  In  the  film,  the  singer  said  he  did  not  see  anything  wrong  with  sharing  a  bed  with  a  child.  |||    Questioned  by  the  prosecution,  Ms  Kite  said  her  plan  had  been  to  move  media  coverage  of  the  star  away  from  a  focus  on  his  human  frailties  to  concentrate  more  on  his  musical  genius.  Ms  Kite  said  that  an  additional  problem  was  the  release  of  documents  relating  to  a  previous  allegation  of  child  abuse  against  Mr  Jackson.  The  Smoking  Gun  website  publication  was  ""beyond  disaster"",  Ms  Kite  said.  Correspondents  say  the  reference  is  important  because  it  was  unclear  whether  the  prosecution  would  be  able  to  bring  up  the  previous  case  in  front  of  the  jury.  |||    The  judge  is  studying  whether  the  prosecution's  first  witness,  reporter  Martin  Bashir,  is  in  contempt  of  court.  The  defence  protested  after  Mr  Bashir,  who  interviewed  Jackson  for  the  TV  documentary,  refused  to  answer  nearly  all  their  questions,  citing  a  California  ""shield""  law  intended  to  allow  journalists  to  protect  their  sources.  In  the  prosecution's  opening  statement  on  Monday,  Tom  Sneddon  told  the  court  that  Mr  Jackson  had  shown  the  boy  porn  and  plied  him  with  wine,  in  order  to  molest  him.  He  said  the  singer  had  visited  sexually  explicit  websites  and  showed  the  boy  -  who  was  13  at  the  time  -  and  his  younger  brother  pornography  at  his  ranch."

Annette  Bening  and  Ana  Geislerova  shared  the  best  actress  award  at  the  Bangkok  festival.  This  year's  event  was  scaled  down  following  the  Asian  tsunami  disaster.  |||    Falling  Down  and  The  Phantom  of  the  Opera  director  Joel  Schumacher  won  a  lifetime  achievement  award  while  Hong  Kong  director  Wong  Kar-Wai  was  honoured  for  promoting  Asian  cinema.  ""It's  a  great  honour,  I  want  to  share  this  honour  with  my  Thai  colleagues,""  Wong  said.  French  writer  Christophe  Barratie  and  Korean  writer  Park  Chan-Chook  shared  the  best  screenplay  award  for  Les  Choristes  and  Old  Boy  respectively.  Now  in  its  third  year,  the  Bangkok  International  Film  Festival  is  donating  profits  from  ticket  sales  to  the  tsunami  relief  fund." 

0	"Court  rejects  $280bn  tobacco  case  |||    A  US  government  claim  accusing  the  country's  biggest  tobacco  companies  of  covering  up  the  effects  of  smoking  has  been  thrown  out  by  an  appeal  court.  |||    The  demand  for  $280bn  (£155bn)  -  filed  by  the  Clinton  administration  in  1999  -  was  rejected  in  a  2-1  decision.  The  court  in  Washington  found  that  the  case  could  not  be  brought  under  federal  anti-racketeering  laws.  Among  the  accused  were  Altria  Group,  RJ  Reynolds  Tobacco,  Lorillard  Tobacco,  Liggett  Group  and  Brown  and  Williamson.  In  its  case,  the  government  claimed  tobacco  firms  manipulated  nicotine  levels  to  increase  addiction,  targeted  teenagers  with  multi-billion  dollar  advertising  campaigns,  lied  about  the  dangers  of  smoking  and  ignored  research  to  the  contrary.  |||    Prosecutors  wanted  the  cigarette  firms  to  surrender  $280bn  in  profits  accumulated  over  the  past  50  years  and  impose  tougher  rules  on  marketing  their  products.  But  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  District  of  Columbia  ruled  that  the  US  government  could  not  sue  the  firms  under  legislation  drawn  up  to  counteract  Mafia  infiltration  of  business.  The  tobacco  companies  deny  that  they  illegally  conspired  to  promote  smoking  and  defraud  the  public.  They  also  say  they  have  already  met  many  of  the  government's  demands  in  a  landmark  $206bn  settlement  reached  with  46  states  in  1998.  Shares  of  tobacco  companies  closed  higher  after  the  ruling,  with  Altria  rising  5%  and  Reynolds  showing  gains  of  4.5%." 

2	"Game  warnings  'must  be  clearer'  |||    Violent  video  games  should  carry  larger  warnings  so  parents  can  understand  what  their  children  are  playing,  the  trade  and  industry  secretary  has  said.  |||    Patricia  Hewitt  is  expected  to  call  for  the  law  banning  the  sale  of  18-rated  games  to  children  to  be  enforced  better  at  a  games  industry  meeting  on  Sunday.  She  is  concerned  too  many  children  are  playing  games  aimed  at  adults  which  include  ""high  levels  of  violence"".  Parents  are  expected  to  spend  millions  on  video  games  as  Christmas  presents.  |||    Violent  games  have  been  hit  by  controversy  after  the  game  Manhunt  was  blamed  by  the  parents  of  14-year-old  Stefan  Pakeerah,  who  was  stabbed  to  death  in  Leicester  in  February.  His  mother,  Giselle,  said  her  son's  killer,  Warren  Leblanc,  17  -  who  was  jailed  for  life  in  September  -  had  mimicked  behaviour  in  the  game.  Police  investigating  the  Stefan's  murder  dismissed  its  influence  and  Manhunt  was  not  part  of  its  legal  case.  Ahead  of  Sunday's  meeting  in  London,  Ms  Hewitt  said  she  was  proud  of  the  UK's  ""vibrant  games  industry""  but  was  concerned  too  many  children  were  playing  games  which  should  only  be  sold  to  adults.  Roger  Bennett,  head  of  gaming  industry  body  ELSPA,  said  banning  violent  games  would  be  wrong.  He  said:  ""We  don't  want  to  go  down  that  route.  We  have  seen  that  the  government  is  supportive  of  the  industry.""  The  government  is  holding  a  further  meeting  on  Friday  with  industry  and  retail  representatives  as  well  as  the  British  Board  of  Film  Classification  to  discuss  how  labelling  can  be  made  clearer.  Ms  Hewitt  said:  ""Adults  should  be  treated  as  adults  and  children  as  children.  It  is  important  that  retailers  respect  the  classifications  and  do  not  sell  games  with  high  levels  of  violence  to  minors.  |||    ""Equally  parents  need  to  know  what  they  might  be  buying  for  their  children.  ""Video  games  are  different  to  films  or  videos,  and  not  all  parents  have  grown  up  playing  games  in  the  way  our  children  do.  ""We  need  to  look  carefully  at  how  we  improve  content  warnings  and  strengthen  sales  enforcement.""  Her  call  was  backed  by  Culture,  Media  and  Sport  Secretary  Tessa  Jowell  who  said:  ""You  wouldn't  let  your  child  watch  the  Texas  Chainsaw  Massacre.  You  wouldn't  let  them  go  to  a  strip  club.  ""So  you  shouldn't  let  them  play  an  18-rated  game.  It's  the  same  principle  -  adults  can  make  their  own  informed  choices,  but  children  can't  always  and  need  to  be  protected.""  Anyone  convicted  of  selling  an  18-rated  game  to  a  child  can  be  jailed  for  six  months  and  fined  up  to  £5,000.  Rockstar  Games,  the  makers  of  Manhunt,  has  said  in  the  past  it  markets  its  games  responsibly  and  only  targets  its  adverts  at  adults." 

1	"Byrds  producer  Melcher  dies  at  62  |||    Record  producer  Terry  Melcher,  who  was  behind  hits  by  the  Byrds,  Ry  Cooder  and  the  Beach  Boys,  has  died  aged  62.  |||    The  son  of  actress  Doris  Day,  he  helped  write  Kokomo  for  the  Beach  Boys,  which  was  used  in  the  movie  Cocktail,  earning  a  1988  Golden  Globe  nomination.  He  also  produced  Mr  Tambourine  Man  for  the  Byrds,  as  well  as  other  his  such  as  Turn,  Turn  Turn.  Melcher  died  on  Friday  night  at  his  home  in  Beverly  Hills,  California,  after  a  long  battle  with  skin  cancer.  He  joined  Columbia  Records  as  a  producer  in  the  mid-1960s,  and  also  worked  with  Gram  Parsons  and  the  Mamas  and  the  Papas.  |||    Earlier  in  his  career,  Melcher  had  hits  as  part  of  duo  called  Bruce  &  Terry,  with  future  Beach  Boy  Bruce  Johnston,  which  evolved  into  the  Rip  Chords  group.  Melcher  also  worked  closely  with  his  mother,  producing  The  Doris  Day  Show  and  helping  to  run  her  charitable  activities.  In  1969  his  name  became  linked  with  the  Charles  Manson  murders,  which  saw  the  deaths  of  actress  Sharon  Tate  and  four  of  her  friends  at  a  home  which  Melcher  once  rented.  Rumours  circulated  that  Melcher  -  who  knew  Manson  -  was  the  killer's  real  target,  because  he  had  turned  him  down  for  a  record  contract.  But  Los  Angeles  police  discounted  the  rumours,  pointing  out  Melcher  had  moved  to  Malibu,  and  Manson  knew  of  his  new  address." 

1	"CSI  shows  give  'unrealistic  view'  |||    People  have  unrealistic  expectations  of  forensic  science  thanks  to  the  success  of  the  CSI  TV  shows,  real  experts  say.  |||    Evidence  submitted  to  forensic  labs  has  shot  up  as  a  result  of  the  programmes,  at  a  time  when  many  have  large  backlogs,  science  investigators  claim.  Lawyers  also  fear  the  effect  because  jurors  have  a  distorted  view  of  how  forensic  evidence  is  used.  The  issue  was  discussed  at  a  major  science  conference  in  Washington  DC.  Crime  Scene  Investigation  (CSI)  and  its  spin-offs,  CSI:  Miami  and  CSI:  New  York,  have  proven  exceptionally  popular  with  audiences  on  both  sides  of  the  Atlantic.  |||    Each  episode,  a  team  of  forensic  investigators  goes  about  solving  a  crime  through  the  ingenious  appliance  of  science  -  and  the  extensive  resources  at  their  disposal.  ""The  CSI  effect  is  basically  the  perception  of  the  near-infallibility  of  forensic  science  in  response  to  the  TV  show,""  said  Max  Houck,  who  runs  a  forensic  science  graduate  course  at  West  Virginia  University,  US.  ""This  TV  show  comes  on  and  everyone  starts  watching  it  -  including  the  cops  and  prosecutors  -  and  submissions  to  forensic  laboratories  go  through  the  roof,""  he  told  the  annual  meeting  of  the  American  Association  for  the  Advancement  of  Science  (AAAS).  The  American  forensics  expert  said  there  were  roughly  200,000-300,000  backlogged  DNA  samples  in  US  labs.  Yet  these  constituted  just  10%  of  the  total  test  backlog,  said  Dr  Houck.  Forensic  pathologist  Dr  Patricia  McFeeley  said  she  had  started  to  see  the  show's  influence  in  dealing  with  the  families  of  victims.  ""What  I  find  is  that  families  now  are  more  dissatisfied  with  the  investigation  than  was  previously  the  case,""  she  explained.  ""For  example,  on  television,  the  toxicology  results  are  available  almost  instantaneously.  But  when  people  find  out  that  it  can  take  several  months,  they  can  find  that  very  difficult.""  |||    Dr  McFeeley  added  that  the  accuracy  with  which  forensic  investigators  can  determine  time  of  death  was  far  lower  than  most  people's  perceptions.  The  show's  influence  can  follow  forensic  investigators  all  the  way  into  the  courtroom,  making  lawyers  jittery.  ""Prosecutors  fear  the  CSI  effect  with  juries  because,  for  example,  they  wonder:  'why  wasn't  everything  tested?'  Well,  in  fact,  not  everything  needs  to  be  tested,""  Dr  Houck  explained.  ""Defence  attorneys  also  worry  about  the  CSI  effect  because  they  think  that  jurors  come  in  and  have  this  view  of  science  as  a  juggernaut;  this  objective  method  that's  always  accurate.""  However,  he  admitted  the  show  had  had  positive  as  well  as  negative  effects  on  the  field.  ""My  university  course  started  with  four  graduates  in  1999;  we're  now  the  largest  major  on  campus  -  with  400  students,""  he  said.  Dr  Houck  added  that  there  was  an  urgent  need  for  better  funding  of  forensic  science  at  the  university  level:  ""There's  more  money  spent  in  this  country  on  holistic  medicine  than  there  is  on  forensic  science  research.""" 

2	"Tory  expert  denies  defeatism  |||    The  Conservatives'  campaign  director  has  denied  a  report  claiming  he  warned  Michael  Howard  the  party  could  not  win  the  next  general  election.  |||    The  Times  on  Monday  said  Australian  Lynton  Crosby  told  the  party  leader  to  focus  on  trying  to  increase  the  Tories'  Commons  presence  by  25  to  30  seats.  But  Mr  Crosby  said  in  a  statement:  ""I  have  never  had  any  such  conversation...  and  I  do  not  hold  that  view.""  Mr  Howard  later  added  there  was  not  ""one  iota""  of  truth  in  the  report.  The  strategist  helped  Australia's  PM,  John  Howard,  win  four  elections.  Mr  Howard  appointed  Mr  Crosby  as  his  elections  chief  last  October.  Mr  Crosby's  statement  said:  ""The  Conservative  Party  has  been  making  an  impact  on  the  issues  of  lower  tax  and  controlled  immigration  over  the  past  week.""  It  added:  ""The  Labour  Party  will  be  wanting  to  do  all  they  can  to  distract  attention  away  from  the  issues  that  really  matter  to  people."""

The  new  rules  will  apply  to  all  scheduled  and  charter  flights,  including  budget  airlines.  Airlines  have  attacked  the  legislation  saying  they  could  be  forced  to  push  prices  higher  to  cover  the  extra  cost.  The  European  Commission  is  facing  two  legal  challenges  -  one  from  the  European  Low-fare  Airlines  Association  (ELAA)  and  the  other  from  the  International  Air  Transport  Association  (IATA),  which  has  attacked  the  package  as  a  ""bad  piece  of  legislation"".  Previously,  passengers  could  claim  between  150  euros  and  300  euros  if  they  had  been  stopped  from  boarding.  |||    However,  only  scheduled  flight  operators  were  obliged  to  offer  compensation  in  cases  of  overbooking  and  they  did  not  have  to  offer  compensation  for  flight  cancellations.  |||    The  EU  decided  to  increase  passenger  compensation  in  a  bid  to  deter  airlines  from  deliberately  overbooking  flights.  Overbooking  can  often  lead  to  'bumping'  -  when  a  passenger  is  moved  to  a  later  flight.  When  this  happens  against  a  passenger's  will,  airlines  will  now  have  to  offer  compensation.  In  addition,  if  a  flight  is  cancelled  or  delayed  for  more  than  two  hours  through  the  fault  of  the  airline,  all  passengers  must  be  paid  compensation.  |||    However,  airlines  do  not  have  to  offer  compensation  if  flights  are  cancelled  or  delayed  due  to  ""extraordinary  circumstances"".  Airlines  fear  that  ""extraordinary  circumstances""  may  not  include  bad  weather,  security  alerts  or  strikes  -  events  which  are  outside  of  their  control.  All  EU-based  airlines  and  operators  of  flights  which  take  off  from  the  EU  will  have  to  adhere  to  the  new  compensation  regime  which  came  into  force  on  Thursday.  Low-cost  airlines  have  criticised  the  new  compensation  levels,  arguing  that  the  pay-out  could  be  worth  more  than  the  ticket.  ""It's  a  preposterous  piece  of  legislation,  we  among  all  airlines  are  fighting  this,""  Ryanair  deputy  chief  executive  Michael  Cawley  told  Radio  4's  Today  programme.  |||    The  European  Regions  Airline  Association  (ERAA)  claims  that  neither  airlines  nor  consumers  were  consulted  over  the  changes.  Andy  Clarke,  ERAA  director  of  air  transport,  said  that  the  EC  advice  misleads  customers  as  it  leads  them  to  believe  that  airlines  could  be  liable  for  payouts  if  flights  are  delayed  because  of  bad  weather.  |||    EC  spokeswoman  Marja  Quillinan-Meiland  conceded  there  were  ""grey  areas""  but  said  ""these  are  not  as  big  as  the  airlines  are  making  out"".  In  cases  of  dispute,  national  enforcement  bodies  would  decide  whether  the  passenger  had  a  case,  she  said.  New  technology  means  it  is  easier  for  airlines  to  take  off  and  land  in  bad  weather,  she  added.  The  ERAA's  Mr  Clarke  also  warned  that  while  airlines  would  comply  with  the  new  rules,  the  extra  costs  would  be  passed  onto  passengers.  ""We  reckon  it's  going  to  cost  European  air  passengers  -  not  the  airlines,  the  airlines  have  no  money,  it  has  to  be  paid  by  passengers  -  1.5bn  euros,  that's  over  £1bn  a  year  loaded  onto  European  passengers,""  Mr  Clarke  said.  ""That's  basically  a  transfer  of  money  from  passengers  whose  journeys  are  not  disrupted  to  passengers  whose  journeys  are  disrupted.""  |||    On  Wednesday,  Jacques  Barrot,  vice  president  of  the  European  Commission  and  also  Commissioner  for  Transport,  said  that  the  changes  were  necessary.  ""The  boom  in  air  travel  needs  to  be  accompanied  by  proper  protection  of  passengers'  right.""  ""This  is  a  concrete  example  of  how  the  Union  benefits  people's  daily  lives,""  he  added.  The  EC  has  launched  an  information  campaign  in  airports  and  travel  agencies  to  inform  airline  passengers  of  their  new  rights."

Earlier  on  Thursday,  the  Japanese  yen  touched  its  lowest  versus  the  euro  on  concerns  about  economic  growth  in  Asia.  Currency  markets  have  been  volatile  over  the  past  week  because  of  technical  and  automated  trading  and  light  demand.  This  has  amplified  reactions,  analysts  said,  adding  that  they  expect  markets  to  become  less  jumpy  in  January.  |||    ""People  want  to  go  into  the  weekend  and  the  New  Year  positioned  for  a  weaker  buck,""  said  Tim  Mazanec,  director  of  foreign  exchange  at  Investors  Bank  and  Trust.  The  dollar  slid  to  a  record  $1.3666  versus  the  euro  on  Thursday,  before  bouncing  back  to  $1.3636.  Against  the  yen  the  dollar  was  trading  down  at  $103.05.  |||    The  yen,  meanwhile,  dropped  to  141.60  per  euro  in  afternoon  trading.  It  later  strengthened  to  140.55.  Investors  are  concerned  about  the  size  of  the  US  trade  and  budget  deficits  and  are  betting  that  George  W  Bush's  administration  will  allow  the  dollar  to  weaken  despite  saying  they  favour  a  strong  currency.  Also  playing  on  investors'  minds  are  mixed  reports  about  the  state  of  the  US  economy.  On  Thursday,  disappointing  business  figures  from  Chicago  brought  a  sudden  end  to  a  rally  in  the  value  of  the  dollar.  The  National  Association  of  Purchasing  Management-Chicago  said  its  index  dropped  to  61.2,  more  than  analysts  had  expected.  German  Chancellor  Gerhard  Schroeder  and  Italian  Prime  Minister  Silvio  Berlusconi  voiced  concerns  about  the  strength  of  the  euro.  Mr  Berlusconi  said  the  euro's  strength  was  ""absolutely  worrying""  for  Italian  exports.  Mr  Schroeder  said  in  a  newspaper  article  that  stability  in  foreign  exchange  markets  required  a  correction  of  global  economic  imbalances." 

0	"Pension  hitch  for  long-living  men  |||    Male  life  expectancy  is  much  higher  than  originally  estimated,  leading  pension  researchers  have  said.  |||    The  Pensions  Policy  Institute  (PPI)  said  life  expectancy  for  unskilled  and  professional  men  has  been  understated.  Life  expectancy  at  birth  is  71  years  for  a  manual  worker  and  79  years  for  a  professional  -  a  gap  of  eight  years.  But  if  measured  at  age  65  instead,  the  PPI  said,  a  manual  worker  will  live  to  81  years  and  a  professional  worker  to  86  years  -  a  gap  of  just  five  years.  The  PPI's  estimate  is  higher  because  it  excludes  people  who  have  died  before  they  reach  65  years  of  age  and  also  takes  into  account  ongoing  improvements  in  life  expectancy.  |||    The  government  has  ruled  out  raising  the  state  pension  age,  because  it  says  it  would  penalise  lower-skilled  workers  who  generally  have  lower  life  expectancies.  Chris  Curry,  PPI  research  director,  said  its  calculations  suggested  there  could  be  more  pressure  on  state  pension  spending  than  originally  envisaged.  ""Even  people  in  social  class  V  [unskilled  manual  workers]  who  are  widely  likely  to  have  the  lowest  life  expectancy  can  still  expect  to  live  16  years  after  state  pension  age,""  he  said.  Researchers  have  not  updated  life  expectancy  projections  for  women,  who  on  average  live  longer  than  men." 

2	"McConnell  details  Scots  wave  toll  |||    At  least  three  people  from  Scotland  died  in  the  tsunami  disaster  and  a  further  three  are  on  the  missing  list,  the  first  minister  has  told  MSPs.  |||    The  figures  came  out  during  a  statement  by  Jack  McConnell  to  the  Scottish  Parliament  on  Wednesday.  He  formally  expressed  Scotland's  sympathy  for  the  victims  of  the  Indian  Ocean  tidal  wave  which  killed  150,000.  Mr  McConnell  went  on  to  promise  that  Scotland  would  play  its  part  in  the  reconstruction  effort.  He  said  the  provisional  figures  on  the  dead  and  lost  had  been  provided  by  the  police.  |||    Mr  McConnell  said  the  tragedy  should  persuade  everyone  to  step  up  the  fight  against  global  poverty  and  change  the  world  for  the  better.  He  said  he  was  proud  of  the  generous  response  of  people  in  Scotland  to  the  disaster  appeal,  which  is  expected  soon  to  top  £20m.  The  first  minister  also  praised  Scottish  Water  for  immediately  flying  bottled  water  and  five  large  generators  to  the  disaster  zone.  The  Scottish  Executive  has  seconded  11  staff  to  the  aid  agencies.  |||    But  he  said  Scotland  was  ""in  it  for  the  long  term""  with  help  planned  for  fishing  communities,  for  children's  services,  and  for  the  aid  charities.  He  said  2005  must  be  the  year  that  Scotland  showed  clearly  it  cared  for  what  happened  to  people  elsewhere  in  the  world,  whether  in  Asia  or  in  Africa.  Mr  McConnell  went  on  to  signal  that  the  executive  would  play  its  part  in  the  Make  Poverty  History  campaign  being  mounted  by  a  variety  of  aid  charities,  trade  unions  and  churches  in  the  run-up  to  the  G8  summit  in  Gleneagles  in  July.  Edinburgh  architect,  Dominic  Stephenson,  became  the  first  Scot  to  be  confirmed  as  a  victim  of  the  Asian  tsunami.  The  27-year-old  was  holidaying  on  the  Thai  island  of  Koh  Phi  Phi  with  Eileen  Lee,  24.  She  is  still  missing." 

2	"February  poll  claim  'speculation'  |||    Reports  that  Tony  Blair  is  planning  a  snap  general  election  for  February  2005  have  been  described  as  ""idle  speculation""  by  Downing  Street.  |||    A  spokesman  said  he  had  ""no  idea""  where  the  reports  in  the  Sunday  Times  and  Sunday  Telegraph  had  come  from.  The  papers  suggest  ministers  believe  the  government  could  benefit  from  a  ""Baghdad  bounce""  following  successful  Iraq  elections  in  January.  A  British  general  election  was  last  held  in  February  in  1974.  In  that  election,  Edward  Heath  lost  and  failed  to  build  a  coalition  with  the  Liberals.  Harold  Wilson  took  over  and  increased  his  majority  later  in  the  year  in  a  second  election  |||    The  latest  speculation  suggests  the  prime  minister  favours  a  February  poll  in  order  to  exploit  his  current  opinion  poll  lead  over  Conservative  leader  Michael  Howard.  But  that  strategy  could  prompt  criticism  he  was  seeking  to  ""cut  and  run""  after  less  then  four  years  of  a  parliamentary  term.  The  papers  report  that  Alan  Milburn,  Labour's  head  of  elections  strategy,  has  played  a  key  role  in  the  plan  for  a  February  election,  which  would  include  a  New  Year  advertising  blitz.  New  Labour's  campaign,  both  newspapers  said,  would  be  centred  around  the  slogan  ""Britain  is  Working"".  A  Labour  Party  spokesman  said  the  election  date  was  ultimately  a  matter  for  Mr  Blair,  but  he  was  unaware  of  anything  to  suggest  it  would  be  in  February.  Most  commentators  have  been  expecting  an  election  on  5  May.  The  last  election  was  in  June  2001."

2	"Abbas  'will  not  tolerate'  attacks  |||    Palestinian  leader  Mahmoud  Abbas  has  said  he  will  not  tolerate  attacks  such  as  last  Friday's  suicide  bombing  in  the  Israeli  city  of  Tel  Aviv.  |||    In  an  interview  ahead  of  a  meeting  in  London  to  discuss  Palestinian  reforms,  Mr  Abbas  said  such  attacks  were  against  Palestinian  interests.  The  Palestinian  Authority  (PA)  was  exerting  ""a  100%  effort""  to  end  the  violence,  Mr  Abbas  added.  The  attack,  which  killed  five,  was  the  first  of  its  kind  since  he  took  office.  Mr  Abbas  confirmed  Israel  shared  information  with  the  PA  in  the  hunt  for  the  organisers  of  the  attack.  The  Israeli  government  refuses  to  accept  Syria's  denials  that  it  was  implicated  in  the  nightclub  bombing.  Israeli  officials  gave  an  intelligence  briefing  to  foreign  ambassadors  on  Monday,  explaining  Syria's  alleged  involvement.  British  foreign  minister  Jack  Straw  said  there  had  been  a  ""continuing  stream""  of  information  suggesting  Palestinian  militant  groups  were  operating  from  within  Syria.  |||    In  an  email  interview  in  the  British  newspaper  the  Independent,  Mr  Abbas  said:  ""We  believe  peace  is  possible  now  and  we  are  ready  to  negotiate  with  Israel  to  reach  a  true  and  lasting  peace  based  on  justice  and  international  legitimacy.""  He  added:  ""We  have  an  opportunity  and  it  would  be  irresponsible  if  we,  the  Israelis,  or  the  world  allow  it  to  slip  away.""  Tuesday's  meeting  on  Palestinian  reform  is  being  hosted  by  British  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair.  Also  due  to  attend  are  US  Secretary  of  State  Condoleezza  Rice,  UN  Secretary  General  Kofi  Annan,  World  Bank  officials  and  foreign  ministers  from  23  European  and  Arab  countries.  The  conference  was  a  ""vital  step""  in  renewing  the  peace  process,  Mr  Straw  said.  ""It's  a  high-level  attendance,  which  reflects  the  sense  of  momentum  and  opportunity  created  by  recent  events,""  he  added.  A  spokesman  for  Mr  Blair  said  the  Prime  Minister  expected  the  conference  to  discuss  ""a  comprehensive,  co-ordinated  and,  above  all,  practical  work  plan  for  both  the  Palestinian  Authority  and  the  international  community"".  Israel  will  not  attend,  but  is  said  to  be  closely  watching  the  outcome."

The  865  million  share  offer,  a  mix  of  new  shares  and  sales  by  the  government,  raised  54bn  rupees($1.2bn).  It  was  India's  second  $1bn  stock  debut  in  three  months,  coming  after  the  flotation  by  software  firm  Tata.  The  share  offer  was  eleven  times  oversubscribed.  ""It  is  a  good  investment  bet,""  said  Suhas  Naik,  an  investment  analyst  from  ING  Mutual  Fund.  ""Power  needs  in  India  are  set  to  rise  and  NTPC  will  benefit  from  that.""  Analysts  say  the  success  of  the  NTPC  flotation  would  encourage  the  government  to  reduce  stakes  in  more  power  companies.  NTPC  has  said  it  will  use  the  money  from  the  share  sale  to  feed  the  growing  needs  of  the  country's  energy-starved  economy.  The  firm  is  the  largest  utility  company  in  India,  and  the  sixth  largest  power  producer  in  the  world."

Metrovias,  the  private  firm  which  runs  the  five  tube  lines  in  the  city,  has  offered  an  8%  increase  in  wages.  The  firm  promised  no  jobs  would  be  lost  as  a  result  of  new  ticket  machines.  It  said  it  would  put  this  commitment  on  paper.  |||    Underground  staff  have  warned  they  will  continue  with  the  protests  until  the  management  put  an  acceptable  offer  on  the  table.  The  Argentine  Work  Ministry  has  been  mediating  in  the  conflict  and  it  could  call  an  ""obligatory  conciliation"",  which  would  force  both  sides  to  find  a  solution  and  put  an  end  to  the  conflict.  Some  tube  commuters  have  not  hidden  their  frustration  at  the  ongoing  strike  and  have  broken  the  windows  of  the  underground  trains,  according  to  the  local  press.  ""We  are  taken  as  hostages.  I  don't  know  who  is  right,  but  the  harm  ones  are  us,""  said  accountant  Jose  Lopez." 

2	"The  memory  driving  Brown's  mission  |||    The  memory  Gordon  Brown  says  keeps  returning  to  him  -  the  one  that  he  says  is  burnt  into  him  -  is  that  of  a  12  year-old  girl,  whose  parents  died  of  Aids,  and  who  is  HIV  positive  herself.  |||    Mr  Brown  seems  haunted  by  her  eyes,  desolate  of  all  hope.  And  then  he  talks  of  those  eyes  that  do  inspire  optimism:  an  extraordinary  performance  by  schoolgirls  of  Kenya's  largest  slum,  advancing  with  crowded  menace,  flicking  their  hips  in  a  manner  almost  as  disturbing,  before  the  finale  of  a  clenched  fist  salute  and  shout  of  ""free  education  -  free  education  for  all"".  Mr  Brown's  message  generally,  that  compassion  must  become  action  before  that  hope  is  squandered.  But  he  is  such  a  pivotal  figure  in  British  politics,  it  is  almost  impossible  not  to  ask  him  why  he  is  doing  this.  His  answer,  in  part,  is  because  of  the  missionaries  that  used  to  come  to  his  father's  church.  Ever  since,  he  says,  Africa  has  been  important  to  him.  |||    I've  absolutely  no  doubt  whatsoever  this  is  heartfelt.  But  he  also  believes  it  is  time  for  the  world  to  see  a  new  Gordon  Brown.  Not  the  dull,  reassuring  bank  manager  but  a  man  driven  by  a  moral  passion  -  and  it  just  so  happens  the  Labour  Party  feels  an  awful  lot  happier  ridding  the  world  of  debt  than  ridding  the  world  of  dictators.  |||    There's  also  a  sense  of  liberation.  If  Mr  Blair  won't  allow  him  to  run  the  election  campaign  then  he  can  at  least  pretend  it  was  all  getting  tedious  and  he'd  much  rather  be  out  examining  social  problems  in  the  raw.  It  also  goes  some  way  to  solving  one  of  the  overarching  problems  for  all  politicians  of  all  parties:  scepticism  sliding  into  cynicism  about  politics  itself.  If  he  can  help  the  world's  poor  just  a  little,  then  it  shows  politics  isn't  worthless.  But  is  his  vision  for  Africa  too  grand?  Can  poverty  in  the  continent  really  be  halved?  Brown  replies  that  no  one  thought  the  Berlin  Wall  would  ever  come  down  either.  He's  still  got  to  overcome  -  not  only  the  reluctance  of  other  finance  ministers  in  the  world  -  but  also  the  cynicism  of  experts  who  wonder  whether  debt  relief  will  just  be  squandered  by  governments  that  just  won't  in  the  end  spend  wisely." 

0	"Criminal  probe  on  Citigroup  deals  |||    Traders  at  US  banking  giant  Citigroup  are  facing  a  criminal  investigation  in  Germany  over  a  controversial  bond  deal.  |||    The  deal  saw  the  sale  of  11bn  euros  ($14.4bn;  £7.6bn)  of  government  bonds  in  a  few  minutes  on  2  August,  with  4bn  euros-worth  then  bought  back  later.  The  move  was  widely  criticised  at  the  time,  and  now  the  German  regulator  has  said  it  has  found  evidence  of  possible  market  manipulation.  Citigroup  said  it  would  continue  to  co-operate  fully  with  the  authorities.  ""We  are  disappointed  that  the  BaFin  has  referred  to  the  prosecutor  the  question  of  whether  action  should  be  brought  against  individuals  involved,""  Citigroup  said.  If  the  traders  are  found  guilty,  they  could  face  a  five-year  jail  term  or  a  fine,  Reuters  reported  BaFin  as  saying.  However,  under  German  criminal  law,  prosecutors  cannot  pursue  Citigroup  itself.  |||    Germany's  financial  watchdog  BaFin  told  BBC  News  it  had  now  transferred  the  investigation  to  the  public  prosecutor.  ""I  can  confirm  that  BaFin  has  passed  through  the  case  to  the  public  prosecutor,""  a  BaFin  spokeswoman  said.  ""It  is  now  a  criminal  investigation.""  ""We  found  clues  of  possible  market  manipulation,""  the  spokeswoman  said,  which  included  signs  of  linked  bond  trading  ahead  of  the  main  trades  on  2  August.  ""Germany's  Securities  Trading  Act  says  that  if  BaFin  finds  such  clues,  it  has  to  put  the  case  in  the  hands  of  the  prosecutor.""  Regulatory  investigations  are  still  going  on  in  France,  the  UK  and  elsewhere.  Some  Citigroup  operations  elsewhere  in  the  world  came  under  regulatory  criticism  in  2004.  Its  private  banking  operation  in  Japan  was  closed  down  by  regulators  in  Tokyo  after  an  ""aggressive  sales  culture""  led  the  bank  to  flout  anti-money  laundering  rules." 

0	"Iran  budget  seeks  state  sell-offs  |||    Iran's  president,  Mohammad  Khatami,  has  unveiled  a  budget  designed  to  expand  public  spending  by  30%  but  loosen  the  Islamic  republic's  dependence  on  oil.  |||    The  budget  for  the  fiscal  year  starting  on  21  March  calls  for  the  sell-off  of  20%  of  the  state's  corporate  holdings.  Mr  Khatami's  second  term  as  president  ends  on  1  August,  making  this  his  last  budget.  But  opposition  from  members  of  parliament  who  have  attacked  previous  privatisations  could  block  his  plans.  Elections  in  May  2004  ousted  many  of  Mr  Khatami's  supporters  in  parliament  in  favour  of  more  hard-line  religious  conservatives.  Late  last  year,  they  backed  a  law  which  would  give  parliament  a  veto  over  foreign  investment.  The  ruling  was  a  response  to  the  involvement  in  telecoms  and  airport  projects  by  Turkish  companies,  which  hardliners  accused  of  doing  business  with  Israel.  It  came  not  long  after  the  Expediency  Council  -  Iran's  ultimate  decision-maker  -  blessed  Mr  Khatami's  policy  of  selling  stakes  in  sectors  protected  by  the  constitution  such  as  energy,  transport,  telecoms  and  banking.  Continued  obstruction  of  foreign  investment  could  get  in  the  way  not  only  of  privatisation  plans,  but  also  of  Mr  Khatami's  hope  of  modestly  reducing  the  government's  reliance  on  oil  revenues.  |||    In  an  address  to  the  Majlis,  Mr  Khatami  predicted  economic  growth  of  7.1%  in  2005-6,  up  from  6.7%  in  the  current  year.  He  said  he  wanted  to  increase  the  2005-6  budget  to  1,546  trillion  rials  ($175.6bn;  £93.6bn)  from  the  previous  year's  1,070  trillion.  Within  that  figure,  taxation  would  rise  to  $14.3bn,  a  rise  of  over  40%  from  what  is  expected  from  the  current  year.  In  contrast,  oil  revenues  were  expected  to  fall  to  $14.1bn  from  $16bn  in  the  year  to  March  2005.  ""Current  government  expenditure  should  come  from  tax  revenues,""  Mr  Khatami  said.  ""Oil  revenues  should  be  used  for  productive  investment.""  Mr  Khatami  has  already  been  blocked  by  parliament  from  reducing  the  subsidies  on  many  products  including  bread  and  petrol,  reducing  his  room  to  manoeuvre." 

2	"Kennedy  calls  for  Iraq  exit  plans  |||    Tony  Blair  should  set  out  a  proper  exit  strategy  from  Iraq  in  the  wake  of  next  Sunday's  elections  in  the  country,  Lib  Dem  leader  Charles  Kennedy  has  said.  |||    In  a  speech  focusing  on  issues  arising  from  the  re-election  of  George  W  Bush,  Mr  Kennedy  said  Iraq  had  become  a  ""crucible  of  militant  terrorism"".  He  wants  to  see  a  phased  withdrawal  of  UK  troops  ""as  soon  as  the  situation  allows"",  he  said  in  London.  Any  exit  strategy  must  ""augment  and  support""  the  democratic  process.  |||    ""There  are  some  who  are  of  the  opinion  that  the  mere  presence  of  British  and  American  troops  in  Iraq  feeds  the  insurgency,""  he  said.  ""There  is  some  truth  in  that,  especially  after  the  initial  mistakes  that  were  made  -  the  heavy-handedness  of  operations  like  Fallujah,  and  the  well-publicised  instances  of  abuse  at  the  hands  of  coalition  forces.""  Mr  Kennedy  pointed  out  that  the  Netherlands,  Portugal  and  the  Czech  Republic,  which  all  have  troops  operating  in  the  southern  sector  of  Iraq,  have  announced  their  imminent  withdrawal  ""regardless  of  the  situation  on  the  ground"".  |||    He  accused  Mr  Blair's  government  of  ""being  less  than  straightforward""  over  its  plans.  ""Next  week  the  prime  minister  should  make  a  statement  regarding  the  elections  in  Iraq,""  Mr  Kennedy  said  during  his  City  of  London  speech.  ""He  should  set  out  a  proper  exit  strategy,  including  the  phased  withdrawal  of  British  troops,  as  the  security  situation  allows.""  Mr  Kennedy  also  argued  that  British  troops  deployed  in  Iraq  should  be  replaced  with  forces  from  other  countries  -  ""especially  Islamic  countries""." 

1	"Portishead  back  after  eight  years  |||    Cult  British  group  Portishead  have  revealed  they  are  writing  their  third  album,  their  first  in  eight  years.  |||    Founding  member  Geoff  Barrow  told  BBC  6  Music  the  record  was  well  on  the  way  to  being  completed.  ""We're  actually  into  it  as  we  speak.  We  took  some  time  off  for  Christmas,  but  generally  we're  doing  another  record,""  Barrow  told  the  digital  radio  station.  News  of  their  album  plans  comes  after  confirmation  the  Bristol  band  will  play  a  tsunami  charity  show  next  month.  Portishead  will  play  alongside  fellow  Bristol  band  Massive  Attack  at  Oxfam's  Tsumani  appeal,  held  at  the  Bristol  Academy  on  19  February.  Barrow  said  he  was  surprised  people  thought  the  band,  who  won  a  Mercury  Music  Prize  in  1995  for  their  debut  album  Dummy,  had  split  up.  |||    ""We've  just  had  our  heads  down  really,  we've  never  actually  broken  up,  or  parted,  or  whatever.  ""So  for  us  it  just  seems,  even  though  we  haven't  played  for  years,  we  still  see  each  other  and  write  -  we  just  haven't  released  a  record  for  a  long  time.""  Portishead  will  not  play  any  new  material  at  next  month's  concert,  which  will  feature  singer  Beth  Gibbons  playing  with  an  acoustic  backing.  Other  acts  appearing  include  Liverpool  band  The  Coral  and  former  Led  Zeppelin  singer  Robert  Plant.  Portishead  became  an  international  success  and  a  deeply  influential  band  despite  their  scant  recorded  output.  Dummy  was  a  critics'  favourite  in  1994,  hailed  for  its  blend  of  menacing  sounds  and  hip-hop  beats  married  to  old  soul  samples.  The  follow  up,  Portishead,  was  released  three  years  later."

The  low-budget  film,  directed  by  Nicole  Kassell,  is  about  a  convicted  child  molester  trying  to  rebuild  his  life  after  12  years  in  jail.  Judges  said  the  film  tackled  the  contentious  subject  with  ""great  insight  and  sensitivity"".  Previous  films  to  take  the  prize  include  the  Oscar-winning  Boys  Don't  Cry,  which  was  about  the  true  life  story  of  murdered  transsexual  Brandon  Teena.  |||    British  writer-director  Amma  Asante  won  the  UK  Film  Talent  Award  this  year  for  her  debut  feature  A  Way  Of  Life.  Set  in  South  Wales,  the  film  is  about  a  teenage  single  mother  who  becomes  embroiled  in  a  tense  stand-off  with  a  Turkish  neighbour.  Also  on  Thursday  night,  the  Fipresci  International  Critics  Awards  went  to  Aaltra,  a  Belgian  film  about  the  handicapped;  and  the  Sutherland  Trophy,  which  was  won  by  Jonathan  Caouette  for  his  film  Tarnation.  The  festival  closed  with  a  screening  of  the  film  I  Heart  Huckabees,  starring  Jude  Law  and  Dustin  Hoffman  and  directed  by  Three  Kings  film-maker  David  O  Russell.  The  festival  this  year  also  included  the  first  European  screening  of  the  new  Pixar  animation  The  Incredibles,  and  the  British  film  Bullet  Boy,  starring  So  Solid  Crew  rapper  Asher  D." 

2	"'No-one  can  define  new  hunt  ban'  |||    The  new  law  banning  hunting  with  dogs  is  ""so  poorly  drafted""  no-one  can  define  the  offence,  pro-hunt  MPs  say.  |||    The  accusation  came  after  it  emerged  a  Devon  man  had  been  told  he  could  use  his  four  dogs  to  ""chase  away  unwanted  animals""  from  his  farm.  Because  he  did  not  intend  to  kill  deer  or  foxes  it  was  not  hunting.  Lib  Dem  MP  Lembit  Opik  said  ministers  had  invented  a  new  category  of  hunting  -  chasing  away  -  and  asked  how  police  were  supposed  to  interpret  the  rules.  |||    North  Devon  landowner  Giles  Bradshaw  was  put  in  touch  with  the  Middle  Way  Group,  of  which  Mr  Opik  is  a  co-chairman,  after  he  had  been  in  contact  with  the  rural  affairs  ministry,  Defra.  He  had  asked  whether  his  technique  of  using  his  four  dogs  to  frighten  off  deer  and  foxes  would  be  outlawed  under  the  Hunting  Act.  Mr  Bradshaw  was  initially  told  it  was  an  offence  -  prompting  him  to  complain.  The  Middle  Way  group  also  said  Mr  Bradshaw  would  be  put  in  a  position  where  he  would  have  to  buy  a  rifle  to  shoot  animals  that  would  have  previously  gone  free.  In  a  later  conversation  Mr  Bradshaw  was  told  that  according  to  Defra's  lawyers  chasing  away  unwanted  animals  was  ""not  in  fact  hunting  as  described  in  the  Hunting  Act  2004  therefore  you  would  not  be  committing  an  offence"".  |||    Mr  Opik  said:  ""Hunting  with  dogs  and  flushing  are  not  defined  in  the  Hunting  Act.  ""Now  Defra  have  also  invented  a  completely  new  category  of  hunting  -  'chasing  away'  which  isn't  even  covered  by  the  Act.  ""However,  all  these  activities  involve  the  use  of  dogs  to  chase  wild  mammals.  ""How  is  the  village  bobby  who  sees  a  group  of  people  with  dogs  supposed  to  distinguish  between  illegal  hunting,  exempt  hunting,  drag  hunting,  unintentional  hunting,  a  hunt  exercising  hounds  or  simply  chasing  away?""  Tory  MP  Peter  Luff,  another  co-chairman  of  Middle  Way,  said  that  the  legislation  was  ""so  poorly  drafted  nobody  appears  able  to  properly  define  the  offence"".  |||    ""It  is  no  wonder  the  government  desperately  wants  to  move  on  from  this  disastrous  law.  However,  I  seriously  doubt  the  countryside  will  be  that  accommodating.""  Mike  Hobday,  of  the  League  Against  Cruel  Sports,  said:  ""There  is  no  confusion,  it  is  a  matter  of  simple  common  sense.  ""If  Mr  Bradshaw  is  setting  his  dogs  to  chase  wild  animals  then  he  is  hunting  them  and  that  will  be  a  criminal  offence.  ""If  all  the  dogs  are  doing  is  barking  at  the  deer,  then  nobody  can  define  that  as  hunting.""" 

2	"Blair  to  face  trust  issue  head  on  |||    Tony  Blair  says  he  will  be  facing  the  issue  of  trust  and  his  own  integrity  head  on  during  the  election  campaign.  |||    During  a  question  and  answer  session  with  first-time  voters  on  Five  News,  Mr  Blair  said  he  had  no  option  but  to  ""confront  it""  by  talking  to  people.  He  also  dismissed  claims  government  plans  to  get  50%  of  young  people  into  university  would  devalue  degrees.  He  was  not  ""forcing""  anyone  to  go  to  university,  but  places  should  be  there  for  those  who  wanted  them,  he  said.  In  answer  to  a  question  from  22-year-old  Liverpool  student  David  Dunne  about  concerns  over  the  prime  minister's  personal  integrity,  Mr  Blair  said  talking  was  the  only  answer.  ""You've  just  got  to  confront  it  and  say  to  people  let's  have  a  discussion  on  the  things  that  worry  you,  the  things  that  make  you  say  'I  can't  trust  you'  or  'I  am  against  you  on  this.'""  The  ""worst  thing  in  politics""  was  that  the  electorate  only  got  ""little  snatches  of  policy""  from  things  like  Prime  Minister's  Questions  and  the  news  headlines.  This  was  why  he  wanted  to  ""get  out  of  the  30  seconds  on  the  news,""  he  added.  |||    By  talking  through  policies  at  least  people  understood  the  reason  for  them,  even  if  they  did  not  agree  with  them,  he  said.  Mr  Blair  also  faced  questions  about  British  policy  on  Iran  and  its  alleged  nuclear  weapons  programme.  He  insisted  there  was  no  plan  for  an  invasion  of  the  country  saying:  ""Sometimes  people  say  because  of  what  has  happened  in  Iraq  this  is  the  next  place.""  Instead  there  was  a  real  chance  of  a  ""peaceful  resolution""  to  the  problem,  he  said." 

0	"EU  to  probe  Alitalia  'state  aid'  |||    The  European  Commission  has  officially  launched  an  in-depth  investigation  into  whether  Italian  airline  Alitalia  is  receiving  illegal  state  aid.  |||    Commission  officials  are  to  look  at  Rome's  provision  of  a  400m  euro  ($495m;  £275m)  loan  to  the  carrier.  Both  the  Italian  government  and  Alitalia  have  repeatedly  denied  that  the  money  -  part  of  a  vital  restructuring  plan  -  is  state  aid.  The  investigation  could  take  up  to  18  months.  However,  Transport  Commissioner  Jacques  Barrot  said  he  wanted  it  to  be  carried  out  as  swiftly  as  possible.  ""The  Italian  authorities  have  presented  a  serious  industrial  plan,""  said  Mr  Barot.  ""We  now  have  to  verify  certain  aspects  to  confirm  that  this  plan  contains  no  state  aid.  I  would  like  our  analysis  to  be  completed  swiftly.""  |||    The  matter  of  possible  state  aid  was  brought  to  the  Commission's  attention  by  eight  of  Alitalia's  rivals,  including  Germany's  Lufthansa,  British  Airways  and  Spain's  Iberia.  While  Alitalia  needs  to  restructure  to  bring  itself  back  to  profitability,  the  rival  carriers  say  it  has  both  violated  state  aid  rules  and  threatened  competition.  Alitalia  lost  330m  euros  in  2003  as  it  struggled  to  get  to  grips  with  high  costs,  spiralling  oil  prices,  competition  from  budget  carriers  and  reduced  demand.  It  plans  to  split  into  AZ  Fly  and  AZ  Services,  which  will  handle  air  and  ground  services  respectively.  Alitalia  already  enjoyed  state  aid  in  1997.  EU  rules  prevent  that  from  happening  again  in  what  is  known  as  the  ""one  time,  last  time""  rule  for  airlines.  Otherwise,  EU  regulations  on  state  aid  stipulate  that  governments  may  help  companies  financially,  but  only  on  the  same  terms  as  a  commercial  investor.  The  airline  declined  to  comment  on  the  Commission  decision."

Overall  UK  exports  -  including  both  goods  and  services  -  rose  by  more  than  3.2%  to  £24.8bn,  although  total  imports  rose  again  to  a  new  record  of  £27.9bn.  The  deficit  for  goods  alone  was  £4.6bn,  down  from  October's  £5bn.  During  November  the  UK  exported  £16.9bn  worth  of  goods,  but  imported  £21.5bn.  The  cumulative  deficit  for  the  first  eleven  months  of  2004  now  stands  at  £36.3bn,  £4.5bn  higher  than  the  same  period  in  2003.  |||    November  saw  an  improvement  in  export  levels  to  both  the  European  Union  and  the  rest  of  the  world,  the  Office  for  National  Statistics  (ONS)  said.  EU  exports  rose  2%,  fuelled  by  an  increase  in  sales  of  chemicals.  Non-EU  exports  shot  up  7.5%,  with  growth  seen  across  a  range  of  manufacturing  sectors  including  cars,  consumer  durables  and  chemicals.  The  export  boost  offset  a  1%  rise  in  imports.  Non-EU  imports  rose  3%,  but  the  growth  in  goods  entering  the  UK  from  the  EU  slowed  to  0.5%.  |||    The  UK's  deficit  with  the  EU  fell  to  £1.9bn  from  £2.1bn,  while  its  non-EU  shortfall  dropped  to  £2.7bn  from  £2.9bn  in  October.  |||    The  country's  surplus  on  trade-in-services  remained  steady  at  £1.5bn  for  the  fifth  month  in  a  row.  Paul  Dales,  UK  economist  for  Capital  Economics,  said  the  figures  represented  an  improvement  on  recent  months.  However,  he  stressed  that  the  long-term  prognosis  for  exports  was  still  uncertain.  ""The  figures  are  a  lot  better  than  expected  but  the  trend  still  remains  poor,""  he  said.  ""There  have  been  some  very  encouraging  signs  that  the  UK  export  recovery  is  starting  to  take  hold.  But  there  is  a  danger  that  this  could  be  held  back  by  the  ongoing  weakness  of  domestic  demand  on  the  continent."""

Yukos'  owner  Menatep  Group  says  it  will  ask  Rosneft  to  repay  a  loan  that  Yugansk  had  secured  on  its  assets.  Rosneft  already  faces  a  similar  $540m  repayment  demand  from  foreign  banks.  Legal  experts  said  Rosneft's  purchase  of  Yugansk  would  include  such  obligations.  ""The  pledged  assets  are  with  Rosneft,  so  it  will  have  to  pay  real  money  to  the  creditors  to  avoid  seizure  of  Yugansk  assets,""  said  Moscow-based  US  lawyer  Jamie  Firestone,  who  is  not  connected  to  the  case.  Menatep  Group's  managing  director  Tim  Osborne  told  the  Reuters  news  agency:  ""If  they  default,  we  will  fight  them  where  the  rule  of  law  exists  under  the  international  arbitration  clauses  of  the  credit.""  |||    Rosneft  officials  were  unavailable  for  comment.  But  the  company  has  said  it  intends  to  take  action  against  Menatep  to  recover  some  of  the  tax  claims  and  debts  owed  by  Yugansk.  Yukos  had  filed  for  bankruptcy  protection  in  a  US  court  in  an  attempt  to  prevent  the  forced  sale  of  its  main  production  arm.  The  sale  went  ahead  in  December  and  Yugansk  was  sold  to  a  little-known  shell  company  which  in  turn  was  bought  by  Rosneft.  Yukos  claims  its  downfall  was  punishment  for  the  political  ambitions  of  its  founder  Mikhail  Khodorkovsky  and  has  vowed  to  sue  any  participant  in  the  sale." 

2	"What  the  election  should  really  be  about?  |||    A  general  election  is  the  best  chance  most  pressure  groups  get  to  make  a  real  impact  on  government  policy.  Here  is  how  six  leading  lobbies  plan  to  make  sure  their  cause  is  being  debated  ahead  of  an  expected  Spring  poll.  |||    We've  called  for  the  state  pension  to  be  increased  from  £79.60  to  the  pensioner  credit  guarantee  level  of  £105.45.  That's  what  we're  calling  for.  Many  pensioners  are  disadvantaged  by  the  current  system.  If  we've  got  one  in  five  pensioners  below  the  poverty  line,  we've  got  to  make  it  more  generous  or  have  these  people  living  in  poverty.  |||    We've  drawn  up  a  pensioners'  manifesto.  This  will  be  sent  to  each  of  the  candidates  in  the  659  constituencies.  They  will  be  asked  which  of  the  top  five  issues,  including  the  pension  issue,  they  would  support.  Once  we've  got  their  responses  we  will  publish  the  results  within  the  constituencies  and  nationally  as  well.  It's  our  way  of  putting  the  politicians  on  notice.  We  are  trying  to  get  across  the  fact  that  there  are  11m  voters  over  60  in  the  country,  they  are  more  likely  to  vote  than  other  sections  of  society  and  thirdly  they  are  true  swing  voters.  Before  1997  most  pensioners  voted  Conservative.  In  1997  and  2001  they  voted  Labour.  But  there  is  no  guarantee  they  will  vote  for  a  Labour  government  this  time  around.  They  cannot  take  that  vote  for  granted.  |||    Pensions  generally  will  certainly  be  a  big  election  issue  even  though  the  government  has  postponed  the  publication  of  Adair  Turner's  full  report  into  the  issue.  He  said  the  UK  had  one  of  the  least  generous  pensions  systems  in  the  developed  world.  |||    That  the  government  takes  seriously  the  impact  of  aviation  on  the  environment.  |||    We  haven't  worked  out  specific  plans  but  I  imagine  we  will  lobby  political  parties  and  incumbent  MPs.  Various  local  groups  will  do  that  in  their  particular  areas  and  we  will  provide  a  national  briefing.  We  don't  have  any  large  demonstrations  planned  but  they  can't  be  ruled  out.  |||    It  is  hard  to  say  whether  we  will  be  successful.  We  have  got  the  issue  in  the  public  consciousness  to  an  extent,  but  it  is  difficult  to  say  whether  an  election  will  raise  its  importance  in  the  public  mind  or  whether  it  will  be  pushed  out  by  big  issues  like  Iraq.  |||    Repealing  the  Hunting  Bill.  |||    We  are  challenging  the  use  of  the  Parliament  Act  1949  in  a  High  Court  action.  We  are  hoping  to  hear  in  the  New  Year.  Whichever  way  the  court  rules  the  other  side  will  appeal  so  we  expect  it  to  fall  plumb  in  electioneering  time.  When  the  ban  comes  into  force  on  18  February  we  will  be  going  to  the  European  Court  because  no  compensation  is  being  paid.  So  there's  a  lot  of  legal  territory  to  go.  We  are  trying  to  engage  with  the  ministers  by  demonstrating  and  talking.  Whatever  intelligence  we  get  we  will  try  to  turn  up  and  speak  to  whoever  it  is.  (Rural  affairs  minister)  Alun  Michael  has  avoided  us  and  cancelled  engagements  so  that  makes  it  difficult.  It  is  not  intimidatory  -  on  the  whole  it  is  groups  of  angry  housewives.  Of  course  there  is  an  element  of  shouting  because  people  are  angry  but  there  is  no  violence  because  that  does  not  achieve  anything.  |||    It  will  fall  plumb  in  the  run  up  to  the  most  important  general  election  Tony  Blair  will  ever  face.  It's  exactly  what  the  prime  minister  did  not  want.  He  wanted  the  issue  off  the  table  until  after  the  election.  |||    People  using  live  animals  as  targets  for  sport  both  here  and  abroad.  The  reason  for  including  abroad  is  because  of  trophy  hunting.  It  is  another  sort  of  form  of  shooting  for  sport.  The  principle  is  the  same  whether  it's  a  tiger  or  a  pheasant.  |||    We  will  widely  publicise  what's  happening  in  relation  to  trophy  hunting.  We  will  publicise  the  darker  aspects  of  the  target  animal  industry  the  UK.  We  will  seek  to  get  pledges  from  individual  MPs  and  would-be  MPs  saying  that  they  are  against  the  use  of  animals  as  targets  for  sports.  We  would  like  the  support  of  political  parties  but  I  think  a  general  election  is  very  much  to  do  with  pledges  MPs  make  to  their  electors.  With  hunting  we  had  many  MPs  who  were  happy  to  say  they  were  against  it.  |||    I  think  what  we  will  get  is  a  very  real  climbing  up  the  agenda.  Whether  or  not  we  will  get  a  ban  I  am  not  sure.  But  it  will  mobilise  public  opinion.  Everything  we  do  will  reduce  animal  suffering  and  in  time  that  will  lead  to  a  ban.  |||    The  issue  that  we  think  is  the  most  important  for  this  election  is  choice.  The  language  of  consumerism  is  very  commonplace  in  government  and  across  the  political  spectrum.  Choice  as  an  ideology  is  beginning  to  be  the  privatisation  of  this  decade.  It's  become  an  issue  in  itself  but  what's  really  missing  from  the  debate  is  the  consumer's  choice  in  that.  Choice  is  not  choice  at  all  if  all  you  have  to  choose  from  is  two  failing  schools.  We  have  seen  so  many  pensions  mis-selling  scandals  and  in  the  pensions  industry  there's  a  maximum  of  choice  but  a  minimum  quality  in  that.  We  want  choice  on  the  consumer's  terms  -  that  means  clear  and  accessible  information  to  operate  that  choice.  |||    Firstly,  we  have  our  website.  It  features  our  campaigns  and  changes  every  day.  Secondly  through  our  700,000  members  who  communicate  with  us.  Thirdly  through  the  media  and  also  what  we  will  be  doing  is  holding  a  pre-election  conference.  We  will  invite  the  opinion  formers,  MPs,  journalists  and  others.  The  idea  is  that  we  open  up  communications  between  members  of  the  public  and  the  politicians.  |||    I  think  we  will  be  successful.  It's  very  much  the  language  being  used  by  the  main  political  parties.  Politicians  on  all  sides  are  very  sensitive  to  this  issue  they  want  to  be  seen  to  be  responding  to  this  issue.  |||    Fuel  duty  is  a  large  part  of  operational  costs  for  road  haulage  workers.  We  have  been  hearing  about  this  proposed  increase  of  1.92p  per  litre  that  Gordon  Brown  has  been  postponing  and  postponing.  Tuppence  does  not  sound  like  a  great  deal  but  every  year  if  you  operate  one  vehicle  that's  an  increase  of  about  £750.  If  you're  running  10  vehicles  it's  obviously  10  times  that.  |||    If  fuel  duty  does  rise  we  will  be  absolutely  horrified.  There  will  be  a  huge  effect  throughout  the  industry  and  I  would  not  be  surprised  if  you  see  widespread  demonstrations.  What  it  will  mean  is  there  will  be  a  number  of  firms  going  out  of  business.  |||    We  will  continue  to  do  what  we  have  always  done  we  keep  the  issue  in  the  trade  press.  Regrettably  it's  one  of  those  stories  that  it  is  getting  harder  to  get  into  the  national  press.  Whatever  we  do,  the  public  don't  like  lorries  -  they  see  us  as  a  complaining  minority.  But  they  don't  realise  that  when  you  see  a  car  on  the  road  it  is  probably  going  to  work,  when  you  see  a  lorry  it's  already  at  work." 

2	"Howard  'truanted  to  play  snooker'  |||    Conservative  leader  Michael  Howard  has  admitted  he  used  to  play  truant  to  spend  time  with  his  school  friends  at  a  snooker  hall.  |||    Mr  Howard  said  his  time  at  Jack's  Snooker  Hall  in  Llanelli  in  the  1950s  had  not  done  him  ""any  lasting  damage"".  But  he  told  the  Times  Educational  Supplement  that  truancy  was  ""very  bad""  and  said  ""firm  action""  was  needed.  Mr  Howard  also  called  for  a  return  to  O-levels  and  more  classroom  discipline.  |||    Mr  Howard  eventually  left  Llanelli  Grammar  School  -  and  the  snooker  hall  -  to  go  to  Cambridge  University.  He  said:  ""I  don't  think  it's  done  me  any  lasting  damage.  Nor  has  it  made  me  a  snooker  world  champion.  ""There  might  have  been  some  occasions  when  we  left  early  of  an  afternoon.  |||    ""I'm  just  being  honest.  I  think  truancy  is  a  very  bad  thing  and  that  firm  action  should  be  taken  to  deal  with  it.""  Another  player  who  has  failed  to  win  snooker's  world  championship  -  Jimmy  ""the  Whirlwind  ""  White  -  has  previously  admitted  missing  lessons,  instead  spending  his  days  in  smoky  halls.  ""Tony  Meo  [another  player]  and  me  used  to  spend  all  of  our  spare  time  there,""  Mr  White  said,  ""We  loved  the  game  and  the  atmosphere.  ""School  went  out  of  the  window.  I  went  for  a  while  and  then  started  taking  time  off.""  Mr  Howard's  fellow  Welshman  Ray  Reardon  -  known  by  his  fellow  professionals  as  ""Dracula""  -  won  the  snooker  world  championship  six  times,  having  left  school  at  14  to  work  as  a  miner.  And  Terry  Griffiths,  like  Mr  Howard  from  Llanelli,  won  the  tournament  in  1979.  It  is  not  known  whether  the  two  of  them  ever  clashed  cues  at  Jack's."

Rock  band  Keane  won  Sound  of  2004  while  US  rapper  50  Cent  topped  Sound  of  2003.  Other  new  artists  in  this  year's  list  include  London  indie  group  Bloc  Party  at  second  and  UK  rapper  Kano  third.  The  Bravery  played  their  first  gig  in  2003  and  have  since  supported  bands  including  The  Libertines,  Interpol  and  Echo  and  the  Bunnymen.  |||    They  were  the  subject  of  a  record  company  bidding  war  in  2004  and  their  debut  single,  Unconditional,  caused  a  huge  buzz  when  it  was  released  in  the  UK  in  November.  Singer  Sam  Endicott  said  he  felt  ""great""  about  coming  top  of  the  Sound  of  2005  list.  ""Anyone  that  says  they  don't  want  a  zillion  screaming  fans  is  a  jackass,  a  liar,""  he  said.  One  of  the  experts  to  tip  The  Bravery  was  The  Times'  music  critic  Paul  Connolly,  who  said  they  were  ""spiky  but  in  love  with  pop"".  Chris  Hawkins,  host  of  BBC  6  Music's  chart  show,  said  the  band  had  ""great  guitars  and  a  mastery  of  the  electro-clash  sound"".  ""The  Bravery  are  proof  alone  that  New  York  City  is  still  home  to  hot  new  talent,""  he  said.  Nigel  Harding,  head  of  music  at  London  rock  radio  station  Xfm,  said  every  track  from  their  live  set  ""sounded  like  a  potential  single"".  |||    Unconditional  reached  the  summit  of  the  station's  listeners'  chart  within  a  fortnight  of  its  first  play,  which  Mr  Harding  described  as  ""an  unheard  of  achievement  for  a  debut  single"".  |||    Q  magazine  reviews  editor  Ted  Kessler  said  they  were  ""pretty-boy  New  York  clothes  horses""  with  ""an  unusually  nimble  ear  for  concise,  yearning  pop  in  the  mould  of  Duran  Duran  or  The  Strokes"".  Other  pundits  to  take  part  in  the  survey  included  BBC  Radio  1  DJ  Trevor  Nelson,  NME  editor  Conor  McNicholas,  Top  of  the  Pops  presenter  Fearne  Cotton,  Glastonbury  organiser  Emily  Eavis  and  BBC  Radio  2  music  editor  Colin  Martin.  Elsewhere  on  the  top  10,  second-placed  rock  band  Bloc  Party  began  their  rise  after  supporting  Franz  Ferdinand  and  UK  garage  MC  Kano,  in  third,  is  signed  to  The  Streets'  record  label.  US  rapper  The  Game  is  hip-hop  great  Dr  Dre's  latest  protege  while  Leeds  group  Kaiser  Chiefs  came  fifth  with  a  promise  to  lead  a  Britpop  revival.  In  last  year's  survey,  Keane  were  followed  by  Franz  Ferdinand,  Razorlight  and  Joss  Stone  in  the  top  five  -  all  of  whom  were  virtually  unknown  outside  the  music  industry  at  that  point.  |||    Boy  band  McFly  were  sixth  while  Scissor  Sisters,  who  had  the  UK's  best-selling  album  of  2004,  were  seventh.  In  the  survey,  the  pundits  were  asked  for  tips  for  three  acts  they  thought  were  capable  of  reaching  the  top  in  their  chosen  genre,  either  in  terms  of  sales  or  critical  acclaim.  The  artists  could  be  from  any  country  and  any  musical  genre,  but  must  not  have  had  a  UK  top  20  single,  been  a  contestant  on  a  TV  talent  show  or  already  be  famous  for  doing  something  else,  such  as  a  soap  actor.  Those  tips  were  then  counted  and  compiled  to  make  the  top  10." 

3	"Johnson  accuses  British  sprinters  |||    Former  Olympic  champion  Michael  Johnson  has  accused  Britain's  top  sprinters  of  lacking  pride  and  ambition.  |||    ""At  the  moment,  the  biggest  factor  on  the  mind  of  British  sprinters  is  to  be  number  one  in  Britain,""  the  world  200m  and  400m  record  holder  told  Five  Live.  ""Athletics  at  the  moment  is  all  about  international  competitions  and  they  need  to  show  a  little  more  pride.""  However,  Linford  Christie  countered:  ""It's  easy  to  criticise  when  you  haven't  gone  through  the  system  here.""  Johnson  was  involved  in  a  verbal  spat  with  Britain's  Darren  Campbell  earlier  this  year.  The  American  had  cast  doubt  on  Campbell's  claims  he  had  torn  a  hamstring  in  the  wake  of  his  failure  to  reach  the  Olympic  100m  and  200m  finals.  |||    And  the  American  remains  highly  critical  of  aspects  of  British  sprinting.  ""The  only  time  you  see  British  sprinters  getting  upset  or  riled  is  when  there  is  a  debate  as  to  which  one  is  better  than  the  other,""  he  claimed.  ""Athletes  here  have  to  compete  more  outside  the  UK.  Their  focus  has  to  be  on  being  the  best  in  the  world  and  not  just  on  being  the  top  British  sprinter.""  Speaking  at  an  elite  coaches'  conference  in  Birmingham,  Johnson  also  argued  that  although  there  has  been  more  investment  in  the  sport  in  Britain,  it  had  not  necessarily  reaped  the  rewards.  ""You  can't  fix  everything  with  money,""  he  admitted.  ""You  contrast  the  situation  here  to  that  of  some  US  athletes  who  have  no  funding.  ""Those  who  aren't  funded  might  be  hungrier  and  more  motivated  because  their  road  to  success  is  a  lot  more  difficult  and  challenging.  ""So  when  they  get  to  the  top  they  are  more  appreciative.""" 

0	"Deutsche  attacks  Yukos  case  |||    German  investment  bank  Deutsche  Bank  has  challenged  the  right  of  Yukos  to  claim  bankruptcy  protection  in  the  US.  |||    In  a  court  filing  on  Tuesday,  it  said  the  Russian  oil  giant  has  few  Texas  ties  beyond  bank  accounts  and  a  Texas-based  finance  chief.  Deutsche  Bank  claimed  Yukos  had  artificially  manufactured  a  legal  case  to  stop  the  sale  of  its  main  asset.  It  had  wanted  to  help  fund  Gazprom's  plans  for  a  $10bn  (£5.18bn)  bid  for  Yukos  unit  Yuganskneftegas.  |||    Deutsche  Bank  would  have  earned  large  fees  from  the  deal,  which  could  not  be  carried  out  because  US  chapter  11  bankruptcy  rules  made  the  Kremlin's  auction  of  Yuganskneftegas  on  19  December  illegal  under  US  law.  |||    But  the  US  bankruptcy  court  judge  in  Texas  granted  Yukos  an  injunction  that  barred  Gazprom  and  its  lenders  from  taking  part.  Yuganskneftegas  will  ultimately  end  up  with  Gazprom.  The  winning  bidder  at  the  auction  was  a  previously  unknown  firm,  Baikal  Finance  Group,  which  was  snapped  up  days  later  by  Rosneft,  a  Russian  oil  firm  that  is  in  the  process  of  merging  with  Gazprom.  The  effect  of  these  transactions  is  to  renationalise  Yuganskneftegas.  Deutsche  Bank  contends  Yukos  filed  for  bankruptcy  earlier  this  month  in  Texas  in  a  desperate  and  unsuccessful  bid  to  stave  off  the  19  December  auction  of  its  top  unit  by  the  Russian  government,  which  was  in  a  tax  dispute  with  Yukos.  |||    ""This  blatant  attempt  to  artificially  manufacture  a  basis  for  jurisdiction  constitutes  cause  to  dismiss  this  case,""  Deutsche  Bank  said  in  its  court  filing.  Mike  Lake,  a  spokesman  for  Yukos'  lawyers,  said  on  Tuesday  that  the  company  stands  by  its  legal  action.  Yukos  is  confident  of  its  right  to  US  bankruptcy  protection,  and  ""we  are  prepared  to  be  back  in  court  defending  that  position  again,""  he  said.  Yukos  has  said  it  intends  to  seek  $20bn  in  damages  from  the  buyer  of  Yuganskneftegas  once  the  sale  finally  goes  through.  In  its  filing,  Deutsche  Bank  said  Houston  was  ""a  jurisdiction  in  which  Yukos  owns  no  real  or  personal  property  and  conducts  no  business  operations.""  |||    It  also  said  the  US  bankruptcy  court  should  not  become  involved  in  ""a  tax  dispute  between  the  Federation  and  one  of  its  corporate  citizens"".  It  suggested  the  European  Court  or  an  international  arbitration  tribunal  were  more  appropriate  jurisdictions  for  the  legal  fight  between  Russia  and  Yukos.  The  next  hearing  in  the  bankruptcy  is  expected  on  6  January.  Analysts  believe  the  tax  dispute  between  the  Russian  government  and  Yukos  is  partly  driven  by  Russian  president  Vladimir  Putin's  hostility  hostility  to  the  political  ambitions  of  ex-Yukos  boss  Mikhail  Khordokovsky.  Mr  Khodorkovsky  is  in  jail,  and  on  trial  for  fraud  and  tax  evasion."

""Sluggish  demand  reported  previously  for  November  and  now  December  2004  continues,""  said  Virgin  Blue  chief  executive  Brett  Godfrey.  Virgin  Blue,  which  is  25%  owned  by  Richard  Branson,  has  been  struggling  to  fend  off  pressure  from  rival  Jetstar.  It  cut  its  full  year  passenger  number  forecast  by  ""approximately  2.5%"".  Virgin  Blue  reported  a  22%  fall  in  first  quarter  profits  in  August  2004  due  to  tough  competition.  In  November,  first  half  profits  were  down  due  to  slack  demand  and  rising  fuel  costs.  Virgin  Blue  was  launched  four  years  ago  and  now  has  roughly  one  third  of  Australia's  domestic  airline  market.  But  the  national  carrier,  Qantas,  has  fought  back  with  its  own  budget  airline,  Jetstar,  which  took  to  the  skies  in  May  2004.  Sydney-listed  Virgin  Blue's  shares  recovered  slightly  to  close  12%  down  on  Wednesday.  Shares  in  its  major  shareholder,  Patrick  Corporation  -  which  owns  46%  of  Virgin  Blue  -  had  dropped  31%  by  the  close." 

2	"TV  debate  urged  for  party  chiefs  |||    Broadcasters  should  fix  a  date  for  a  pre-election  televised  debate  between  the  three  main  political  leaders,  according  to  the  Hansard  Society.  |||    It  would  then  be  up  to  Tony  Blair,  Michael  Howard  and  Charles  Kennedy  to  decide  whether  to  take  part,  the  non-partisan  charity  said.  Chairman  Lord  Holme  argued  that  prime  ministers  should  not  have  the  right  of  veto  on  a  matter  ""of  public  interest"".  ""The  broadcasters  should  make  the  decision  to  go  ahead,""  he  said.  |||    Lord  Holme's  proposal  for  a  televised  debate  comes  just  four  months  after  millions  of  viewers  were  able  to  watch  US  President  George  W  Bush  slug  it  out  verbally  with  his  Democratic  challenger  John  Kerry.  He  said  it  was  a  ""democratically  dubious  proposition""  that  it  was  up  to  the  incumbent  prime  minister  to  decide  whether  a  similar  event  takes  place  here.  |||    If  Mr  Blair  did  not  want  to  take  part,  the  broadcasters  could  go  ahead  with  an  empty  chair  or  cancel  the  event  and  explain  their  reasons  why,  Lord  Holme  said.  ""What  makes  the  present  situation  even  less  acceptable  is  that  although  Mr  Howard  and  Mr  Kennedy  have  said  they  would  welcome  a  debate,  no-one  has  heard  directly  from  the  prime  minister,""  he  said.  ""It  has  been  left  to  nudges  and  winks,  hints  and  briefings  from  his  aides  and  campaign  managers  to  imply  that  Mr  Blair  doesn't  want  one,  but  we  haven't  heard  from  the  prime  minister  himself.""  |||    Lord  Holme,  who  has  campaigned  for  televised  debates  at  previous  elections,  said  broadcasters  were  ""more  than  willing  to  cooperate  with  the  arrangements"".  Opinion  polls  suggested  that  the  idea  had  the  backing  of  the  public  who  like  comparing  the  personalities  and  policies  of  the  contenders  in  their  own  homes,  he  said.  |||    Lord  Holme  argued  that  as  part  of  their  public  service  obligations,  broadcasters  ""should  make  the  decision  to  go  ahead""  as  soon  as  the  election  is  called.  An  independent  third-party  body  such  as  the  Hansard  Society  or  Electoral  Commission  could  work  out  the  ground  rules  so  they  were  fair  to  participants  and  informative  to  the  public,  he  said.  ""It  would  be  up  to  each  party  leader  to  accept  or  refuse,""  said  Lord  Holme.  |||    ""If  the  prime  minister's  reported  position  is  true  and  he  does  want  to  take  part,  he  would  then  be  obliged  to  say  why  publicly.  ""The  broadcasters  would  then  have  the  option  of  cancelling  the  event  for  obvious  and  well-understood  reasons,  or  going  ahead  with  an  empty  chair.  ""Either  way  would  be  preferable  to  the  present  hidden  veto.""  The  Hansard  Society  has  long  campaigned  for  televised  debates  and  has  published  reports  on  the  issue  in  1997  and  2001.  Tony  Blair  has  already  ruled  out  taking  part  in  a  televised  debate  during  the  forthcoming  election  campaign.  Last  month  he  said:  ""We  answer  this  every  election  campaign  and,  for  the  reasons  I  have  given  before,  the  answer  is  no,""  he  said  at  his  monthly  news  conference.""" 

2	"Hospital  suspends  'no  Welsh'  plan  |||    An  English  hospital  has  suspended  plans  to  stop  treating  Welsh  patients  who  have  waited  more  than  three  months.  |||    Hereford  County  Hospital  had  earlier  said  that  from  the  new  year  patients  waiting  longer  than  this  would  be  taken  off  waiting  lists  for  hip  and  knee  operations.  GPs  in  Wales  had  feared  patients  could  be  pushed  to  the  back  of  another  queue.  But  after  talks  with  Powys  Health  Board  the  hospital  called  off  its  plan  until  health  chiefs  meet  early  in  January.  Hereford  Hospital  Trust  caused  an  outcry  when  it  sent  out  a  letter  telling  patients  that  for  financial  and  administrative  reasons  it  planned  to  turn  down  some  orthopaedic  patients.  Shocked  health  officials  in  Powys  said  this  meant  they  would  be  left  with  the  prospect  of  patients  and  doctors  having  to  find  new  appointments  in  other  hospitals.  Andy  Williams,  chief  executive  of  Powys  Local  Health  Board,  had  said  it  was  ""a  totally  unacceptable  way  to  behave"".  |||    Mr  Williams  had  said  he  did  not  think  it  was  a  Welsh-English  issue,  but  said  Hereford  hospital  was  ""struggling  financially  and  trying  to  pass  the  problem  back  to  Powys"".  He  had  told  BBC  Radio  Wales:  ""I  have  written  straight  back  to  the  trust...  to  insist  they  withdraw  this  threat  and  treat  the  patients  I  am  paying  them  to  treat.""  But  after  the  hospital  had  agreed  to  the  suspension,  Mr  Williams  said  he  was  optimistic  a  compromise  could  be  reached  which  would  ensure  Welsh  patients  continued  to  be  treated  there.  He  said  the  problem  had  been  caused  by  the  difference  in  waiting  time  targets  between  England  and  Wales.  |||    The  target  is  12  months  for  Welsh  patients,  but  just  three  months  in  England.  The  contract  with  the  Powys  health  board  was  worth  £7m  a  year  for  the  hospital  and  accounts  for  12%  of  its  patients.  In  a  statement  before  the  suspension  of  the  idea,  the  Welsh  Assembly  Government  said  the  situation  was  ""unacceptable"".  ""But  Powys  Local  Health  Board  is  committed  to  ensuring  our  patients  receive  the  care  that  is  appropriate,""  said  the  assembly  government.  ""Although  we  will  be  challenging  Hereford's  decision  we  will  put  in  place  appropriate  care  for  our  patients.  They  will  be  contacted  by  their  GPs  in  the  next  week.""  Earlier,  David  Rose,  Chief  Executive  of  Hereford  Hospitals  NHS  Trust,  had  said:  ""It  is  with  real  regret  that  we  have  taken  this  step.  ""We  want  to  continue  providing  an  excellent  and  fast  service  to  Powys  people  but  can  only  do  this  if  we  are  paid  to  provide  the  service.  ""In  2005  our  waiting  time  will  fall  to  a  maximum  of  6-months  and  we  want  Powys  people  to  ask  to  be  referred  to  our  modern  hospital.  ""We  appeal  to  Powys  Local  Health  Board  to  allow  Powys  people  to  choose  Hereford  for  their  treatment."""

Shanda  said  that  it  may  boost  its  stake  in  Sina,  even  buying  it  outright.  A  merger  would  create  a  firm  that  offers  online  role-playing  games,  news,  entertainment  and  wireless  messaging.  |||    Sina  said  that  the  purchase  of  a  stake  by  Shanda  would  have  no  impact  on  its  business.  |||    The  board  of  directors  said  in  a  statement  that  it  would  ""continue  to  act  in  the  best  interests  of  all  the  company  stakeholders,  including  shareholders,  employees  and  customers"".  Both  companies  are  listed  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange's  (NYSE)  technology-dominated  Nasdaq  index.  In  a  filing  with  the  US  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  Sina  said  its  shares  were  purchased  between  12  January  and  10  February  for  about  $230m.  Rumours  about  a  possible  takeover  boosted  Sina's  shares  by  more  than  10%  on  Friday.  They  added  an  extra  6.4%  to  $27.24  in  electronic  trading  after  the  trading  session  had  finished.  And  there  may  be  more  gains  amid  bid  speculation  when  trading  resumes  in  New  York  on  Tuesday  after  Monday's  public  holiday,  analysts  forecast.  ""There  could  still  be  some  potential  parties  that  could  still  counter  bid,""  said  Wallace  Cheung,  an  analyst  at  DBS  Vickers.  ""Even  though  Shanda  has  20%  of  Sina,  they  still  have  quite  a  long  way  to  take  full  control.""  However,  Mr  Cheung  noted  that  a  foreign  company  trying  to  take  control  of  a  Chinese  internet  portal  firm,  with  its  ability  to  filter  and  pass  on  news,  may  not  be  viewed  very  favourably  by  Beijing."

Meeting  in  Brussels,  finance  ministers  of  the  12  eurozone  countries  voiced  their  concern  that  the  rise  of  the  european  currency  was  harming  exports.  The  dollar  is  within  touching  distance  of  an  all-time  low  reached  earlier  in  November.  At  0619  GMT  on  Tuesday,  the  dollar  was  up  slightly  at  just  above  $1.29  to  the  euro,  and  buying  105.6  yen  in  Tokyo.  It  rallied  briefly  on  Monday  amid  signs  that  oil  prices  are  easing.  |||    But  analysts  said  the  respite  was  likely  to  be  only  temporary.  The  European  ministers'  comments,  said  Junya  Tanase  of  JPMorgan  Chase  bank  in  Tokyo,  were  ""generally  too  weak  to  produce  a  market  reaction"".  |||    Still,  by  the  standards  of  diplomacy  the  European  ministers  were  forthright.  Nicolas  Sarkozy  of  France  said  he  and  his  colleagues  were  unanimous  in  their  worry  that  the  decline  of  the  dollar  would  hit  Europe's  economies  by  eating  into  their  exports.  ""We  are  concerned  about  these  developments,  which  are  destabilising,  and  which  are  linked  to  the  accumulation  of  deficits  by  our  American  friends,""  he  said.  The  comments  come  a  day  after  US  Treasury  Secretary  John  Snow  said  a  strong  dollar  was  ""in  America's  interest"".  |||    But  that  was  not  enough  for  Mr  Sarkozy.  |||    ""If  the  Americans  were  to  change  their  policy,  it's  up  to  them  to  say  so,""  he  said.  And  the  European  Union's  monetary  affairs  commissioner,  made  it  clear  that  action  was  necessary.  ""I  fully  welcome  the  words  of  Mr  Snow,""  said  Joaquin  Almunia,  ""but  we  will  need  to  see  decisions  adopted  in  that  direction.  ""If  the  imbalances  in  the  US  economy  are  not  adjusted  in  the  future,  the  decision  in  the  market  will  be  as  in  the  past  weeks.""  Economists  point  out  that  whatever  Europe  says,  in  the  short  term  a  weaker  dollar  is  a  boon  to  President  George  W  Bush's  administration.  Not  only  does  it  boost  US  exports,  but  it  also  makes  the  budget  deficit  easier  to  fund.  On  the  other  hand,  slower  European  exports  would  mean  slower  EU  growth  -  potentially  reducing  the  demand  for  US  goods."

Next  week's  chart  will  reveal  who  will  have  the  festive  chart-topper  Minogue's  latest  release  I  Believe  in  You  went  in  at  number  two,  pushing  down  Ice  Cube's  You  Can  Do  It  to  three.  Destiny's  Child  also  slipped  one  place  to  four  with  Lose  My  Breath,  followed  by  Girls  Aloud  at  five  with  the  Children  in  Need  record  I'll  Stand  By  You.  |||    The  only  other  new  entry  in  the  top  10  came  from  Robbie  Williams  track  Misunderstood,  a  new  track  written  for  his  Greatest  Hits  album.  There  were  no  new  releases  in  the  entire  top  40  album  charts  as  record  companies  put  out  all  the  big  releases  early  hoping  to  cash  in  on  the  lucrative  Christmas  market.  U2's  How  to  Dismantle  a  Bomb  remains  at  number  one  for  a  third  week  in  a  row,  followed  by  Williams'  Greatest  Hits.  Opera  band  Il  Divo  have  moved  up  one  place  with  their  eponymous  album  to  number  three.  Maroon  5's  album  Songs  About  Jane  has  moved  up  to  number  seven  despite  being  released  47  weeks  ago.  And  the  Abba  Gold  greatest  hits  album  has  crept  back  into  the  top  40  more  than  nine  years  after  it  was  first  released." 

1	"Arthur  Hailey:  King  of  the  bestsellers  |||    Novelist  Arthur  Hailey,  who  has  died  at  the  age  of  84,  was  known  for  his  bestselling  page-turners  exploring  the  inner  workings  of  various  industries,  from  the  hotels  to  high  finance.  |||    Born  in  Luton,  Bedfordshire,  on  5  April  1920,  Hailey  was  the  only  child  of  working  class  parents,  They  could  not  afford  to  keep  him  in  school  beyond  the  age  of  14.  He  served  as  a  pilot  with  the  Royal  Air  Force  during  World  War  II,  flying  fighter  planes  to  the  Middle  East.  It  was  an  occupation  that  was  later  to  feature  in  his  authorial  debut,  the  television  screenplay  Flight  into  Danger.  Hailey  emigrated  to  Canada  in  1947,  where  he  eventually  became  a  citizen.  He  wanted  to  be  a  writer  from  an  early  age,  but  did  not  take  it  up  professionally  until  his  mid-thirties,  when  he  was  inspired  to  write  his  first  screenplay  while  on  a  return  flight  to  Toronto.  |||    ""I  fell  to  daydreaming.  I  visualised  the  pilots  at  the  controls  and  wondered  what  would  happen  if  they  both  got  sick.  Could  I  fly  the  airplane?  I  was  a  rusty  wartime  pilot  who  hadn't  flown  for  nine  years...  ""  Hailey  later  recalled.  The  Canadian  Broadcasting  Corporation  bought  Flight  into  Danger  for  $600  (£318)  and  it  was  shown  on  TV  in  April  1956.  It  was  later  memorably  spoofed  in  the  1980  comedy  Airplane!,  starring  Leslie  Nielsen.  Hailey  worked  as  a  screenwriter  for  a  couple  of  years,  before  turning  to  novels.  He  went  on  to  produce  11  best-selling  books,  which  were  published  into  38  languages  in  40  countries.  Flight  into  Danger  was  adapted  to  become  Hailey's  first  novel,  Runaway  Zero-Eight  in  1958.  The  Final  Diagnosis  and  In  High  Places  followed,  both  achieving  a  popular  following.  But  it  was  not  until  Hotel,  in  1965,  that  Hollywood  came  calling.  The  hit  novel  took  four  years  to  write,  and  stayed  on  national  best-seller  lists  for  a  full  year.  It  was  turned  into  a  movie  in  1967  and  later  adapted  into  a  glossy  soap  in  the  1980s,  starring  James  Brolin.  Airport  (1968)  arguably  remains  Hailey's  best-loved  work  and  prompted  the  disaster  movie  genre.  The  thriller  follows  events  in  the  sky,  and  on  the  ground  at  a  snow-logged  airport,  when  a  terrorist  boards  an  airplane  with  a  bomb.  |||    The  book  was  adapted  into  a  hit  film  in  1970,  starring  Burt  Lancaster  as  the  harassed  aiport  manager  and  Dean  Martin  as  a  womanising  pilot,  alongside  Jean  Seberg  and  Jacqueline  Bisset.  In  a  testament  to  the  popularity  of  the  fledgling  disaster  genre  -  three  sequels  followed.  The  writer  was  known  for  his  painstaking  research  into  the  professions  around  which  each  novel  was  centred,  drawing  his  characters  ""from  real  life""  and  taking  up  to  three  years  to  produce  each  book.  ""I  have  never  been  able  to  write  quickly  or  easily.  I  am  too  self-critical  for  that.  I  am  never  satisfied,""  he  once  said.  In  1969,  he  moved  to  Nassau  in  the  Bahamas,  with  his  wife  Sheila.  Wheels  (1971),  The  Moneychangers  (1975)  and  Overload  (1979)  followed.  Despite  a  lukewarm  response  from  critics,  and  few  literary  accolades,  Hailey  was  at  the  height  of  his  fame  in  the  seventies  and  continued  to  attract  the  attention  of  Hollywood  producers.  Strong  Medicine,  Hailey's  blockbuster  focusing  on  the  pharmaceutical  industry,  was  turned  into  a  film  in  1986,  starring  Sam  Neill,  Douglas  Fairbanks  Jr  and  a  panoply  of  former  soap  stars.  The  1997  novel  Detective  proved  to  be  Hailey's  final  book,  when  at  the  age  of  77  he  decided  to  retire.  Hailey's  health  began  to  deteriorate  in  recent  years,  twice  undergoing  heart  surgery.  He  suffered  a  stroke  just  two  months  ago.  He  died  in  his  sleep  on  Wednesday,  after  dinner  with  his  wife  and  two  of  his  six  children  at  his  home  in  New  Providence  island.  ""He  had  a  wonderful  life.  His  greatest  ambition  was  to  see  his  name  on  a  book  and  he  certainly  achieved  that,""  said  his  wife,  Sheila." 

2	"Clarke  defends  terror  detentions  |||    The  home  secretary  has  defended  his  decision  not  to  release  foreign  terror  suspects  despite  a  legal  ruling  their  detention  breached  human  rights  laws.  |||    House  of  Lords  law  lords  ruled  against  the  detention  measures  last  week.  They  said  it  was  wrong  to  have  one  set  of  laws  for  foreign  suspects  and  another  for  British  suspects.  New  Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  said  he  would  carefully  consider  the  ruling  and  would  return  to  Parliament  early  in  the  new  year  with  proposals.  |||    He  insisted  that  he  would  not  be  rushed  into  judgement  but  would  examine  the  law  lords'  findings  in  detail.  ""My  duty  is  to  look  at  first  of  all  the  security  of  this  country  and  in  so  doing  to  consider  very  carefully  the  precise  legal  measures  that  there  are.""  Mr  Clarke's  comments  came  in  response  to  an  emergency  question  from  Liberal  Democrat  constitutional  affairs  spokesman  David  Heath.  Mr  Heath  said  the  judgement  contained  ""unprecedented  condemnation  and  could  not  have  been  more  unequivocal"".  He  said  he  accepted  the  difficult  balance  between  the  nation's  security  and  human  rights  but  questioned  why  the  home  office  had  made  ""no  contingency  plans  for  the  present  circumstances"".  |||    ""These  detainees  should  be  prosecuted  and  tried.  Simply  renewing  the  present  deeply  unsatisfactory  legislation  is  not  an  option.""  Shadow  home  secretary  David  Davis  said  it  was  not  possible  to  overstate  the  importance  of  the  judgment  and  urged  the  government  to  move  as  fast  as  ""competently  possible""  to  sort  the  problem  out  in  the  interests  of  natural  justice.  ""If  you  do,  we  will  give  you  every  support.""  The  law  lords'  ruling  came  on  Charles  Clarke's  first  day  as  home  secretary  last  Thursday  following  David  Blunkett's  resignation.  In  a  statement  on  the  same  day,  Mr  Clarke  said:  ""I  will  be  asking  Parliament  to  renew  this  legislation  in  the  New  Year.  ""In  the  meantime,  we  will  be  studying  the  judgment  carefully  to  see  whether  it  is  possible  to  modify  our  legislation  to  address  the  concerns  raised  by  the  House  of  Lords.""  |||    But  the  government  was  widely  criticised  for  insisting  the  detentions  would  continue  following  the  ruling  last  week.  Lord  Bingham  -  a  senior  law  lord  -  said  the  rules  were  incompatible  with  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  as  they  allowed  detentions  ""in  a  way  that  discriminates  on  the  ground  of  nationality  or  immigration  status""  by  justifying  detention  without  trial  for  foreign  suspects,  but  not  Britons.  Lord  Nicholls  of  Birkenhead,  in  his  ruling,  said:  ""Indefinite  imprisonment  without  charge  or  trial  is  anathema  in  any  country  which  observes  the  rule  of  law.""  The  detainees  took  their  case  to  the  House  of  Lords  after  the  Court  of  Appeal  backed  the  Home  Office's  powers  to  hold  them  without  limit  or  charge.  The  government  opted  out  of  part  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  concerning  the  right  to  a  fair  trial  in  order  to  bring  in  anti-terrorism  legislation  in  response  to  the  11  September  attacks  in  the  US." 

2	"Tory  backing  for  ID  cards  |||    The  Tories  are  to  back  controversial  government  plans  to  introduce  ID  cards.  |||    The  shadow  cabinet  revealed  its  support  ahead  of  next  week's  Commons  vote  on  a  bill  to  introduce  compulsory  ID.  The  decision  follows  a  ""tough  meeting""  where  some  senior  Tories  argued  vociferously  against  the  move,  party  sources  told  the  BBC.  The  bill,  which  ministers  claim  will  tackle  crime,  terrorism  and  illegal  immigration,  is  expected  to  be  opposed  by  the  Liberal  Democrats.  |||    They  have  said  the  scheme  is  ""deeply  flawed""  and  a  waste  of  money.  Sources  within  the  Conservative  Party  told  the  BBC  Michael  Howard  has  always  been  in  favour  of  ID  cards,  and  tried  to  introduce  them  when  he  was  Home  Secretary.  The  party  has  been  ""agnostic""  on  the  issue  until  now  but  had  now  decided  to  come  off  the  fence,  the  Tory  source  said.  Despite  giving  their  backing  to  ID  cards,  the  Conservatives  insisted  they  would  hold  ministers  to  account  over  the  precise  purpose  of  the  scheme.  |||    They  said  they  would  also  press  Labour  over  whether  objectives  could  be  met  and  whether  the  Home  Office  would  deliver  them.  And  they  pledged  to  assess  the  cost  effectiveness  of  ID  cards  and  whether  people's  privacy  would  be  properly  protected.  ""It  is  important  to  remember  that  this  bill  will  take  a  decade  to  come  into  full  effect,""  a  spokesman  said.  ""It  will  do  nothing  to  solve  the  immediate  problems  of  rising  crime  and  uncontrolled  immigration.""  |||    Lib  Dem  home  affairs  spokesman  Mark  Oaten  said:  ""This  has  all  the  signs  of  Michael  Howard  overruling  colleagues'  concerns  over  ID  cards.  ""The  Tories  should  have  the  courage  to  try  and  change  public  opinion  not  follow  it.""  The  new  chairman  of  the  Bar  Council,  Guy  Mansfield  QC  warned  there  was  a  real  risk  that  people  on  the  ""margins  of  society""  would  be  driven  into  the  hands  of  extremists.  ""What  is  going  to  happen  to  young  Asian  men  when  there  has  been  a  bomb  gone  off  somewhere?  They  are  going  to  be  stopped.  If  they  haven't  [ID  cards]  they  are  going  to  be  detained.""" 

2	"UKIP  candidate  suspended  |||    Eurosceptic  party  UKIP  have  suspended  a  candidate  for  allegedly  suggesting  the  criminally  insane  should  be  killed.  |||    John  Houston,  54,  was  due  to  stand  in  the  East  Kilbride  seat  in  Lanarkshire  at  the  next  election.  But  he  was  suspended  after  his  reported  views,  including  the  return  of  the  British  Empire,  were  sent  to  two  Scottish  newspapers.  UKIP  spokesman  Mark  Croucher  said  those  who  selected  Mr  Houston  knew  nothing  of  his  views.  The  episode  comes  at  a  difficult  time  for  UKIP,  soon  after  the  high-profile  departure  of  MEP  Robert  Kilroy-Silk.  Mr  Houston  is  alleged  to  have  said  that  the  organs  of  the  criminally  insane  should  be  ""made  available  to  law-abiding  members  of  the  community""  and  proposed  the  legalisation  of  drugs  and  the  sex  trade.  The  document  reportedly  said:  ""We're  looking  for  the  resurrection  of  the  British  Empire.  ""The  problems  for  the  human  race  -  environmental  and  others  -  can  only  be  dealt  with  on  a  global  scale,  and  that  calls  for  a  radical  alliance  of  the  English-speaking  nations,  which  they  are  uniquely  able  to  do.""  Mr  Croucher  said  the  main  issue  would  be  that  Mr  Houston's  reported  views  had  been  presented  as  UKIP  policy,  which  they  were  not.  He  said  they  might  have  been  submissions  to  a  committee  working  on  the  party's  manifesto,  but  would  not  have  been  matched  to  Mr  Houston  when  he  was  standing  to  become  a  candidate.  He  told  BBC  News:  ""He  appears  to  have  said  these  things.  We  have  suspended  him  as  a  member  and  as  a  candidate.  ""By  all  accounts  none  of  this  was  mentioned  at  his  selection  meeting.  ""It  is  simply  a  distraction  from  the  task  in  hand,  the  EU  constitution,  not  individual  idiocies.""  Mr  Houston  was  quoted  in  the  Herald  newspaper  saying:  ""I  feel  UKIP  have  over-reacted  and  overshot  the  runway.""  |||    Peter  Nielson,  who  is  UKIP  Scotland  chairman,  said  he  had  suspended  Mr  Houston  on  Friday  night.  ""He  will  remain  suspended  while  the  matter  is  being  investigated  and  then  we  will  decide  if  and  what  further  action  will  be  taken.""  He  said  that  any  evidence  would  be  looked  into  and  Mr  Houston  may  be  interviewed  by  the  party.  He  added:  ""I  can't  comment  too  much  at  the  moment,  I  have  one  version  from  him  but  I  haven't  seen  the  papers  yet.""" 

2	"Howard's  unfinished  business  |||    ""He's  not  finished  yet,""  whispered  the  Conservative  Party  person  as  your  reporter  attempted  to  slip  quietly  from  the  hall.  And  indeed  he  wasn't.  Michael  Howard  had  already  broken  away  from  the  printed  text  of  his  speech,  at  his  party's  spring  conference  in  Brighton,  to  deliver  a  smart  rebuff  to  Peter  Hain's  description  of  him  as  an  ""attack  mongrel"",  claiming  such  personal  abuse  meant  Labour  was  ""rattled""  by  the  Tory  challenge.  And  here  he  was  again,  moving  to  the  front  of  the  stage  as  the  party  faithful  rose  to  their  feet  in  applause,  to  make  a  personal,  ad-libbed  appeal  to  them  to  go  out  and  fight  for  victory.  ""One  day  you  will  be  able  to  tell  your  children  and  grandchildren  as  I  will  tell  mine,  'I  was  there.  I  did  my  bit.  I  played  my  part.  I  helped  to  win  that  famous  election  -  the  election  that  transformed  our  country  for  the  better'.""  The  speech,  which  was  peppered  with  references  to  Mr  Howard's  humble  beginnings  as  the  ""child  of  immigrants"",  had  been  introduced  by  his  son  Nick,  a  trainee  vicar,  who  praised  his  father's  honesty.  ""I  always  know  where  I  am  with  him  because  all  my  life  he  has  meant  what  he  has  said  to  me,""  he  said.  Mr  Howard  was  also  joined  on  stage  by  his  wife  Sandra,  daughter  Larissa  and  stepson  Sholto.  |||    The  audience's  reaction  to  all  of  this  was  a  little  muted  by  party  conference  standards.  |||    But  Mr  Howard's  overall  message  -  that  the  Tories  have  Labour  on  the  run  and  that  they  can  win  the  next  election  -  did  not  sound  quite  as  hollow  as  it  might  have  done  six  months  ago.  Mr  Howard  claimed,  with  some  justification,  that  the  Tories'  campaign  has  got  off  to  a  ""great  start"".  They  have  had  Labour  on  the  back  foot  over  immigration,  with  Tony  Blair  hastily  adding  a  sixth  promise  on  the  issue  to  his  latest  pledge  card,  and  have  even  managed  to  score  points  in  traditional  Labour  territory  such  as  health  and  education.  The  stunts  involving  Margaret  Dixon  with  her  postponed  operation  and  Maria  Hutchings  with  concerns  about  her  son's  special  needs  education  may  not  have  been  to  everyone's  taste,  but  they  succeeded  in  bringing  the  issues  alive  and  forcing  Labour  to  react.  Senior  Tories  believe  they  are,  at  long  last,  starting  to  tap  into  the  public  mood,  cutting  through  the  background  noise  to  connect  with  the  ordinary  voter.  Their  latest  poster  campaign  flags  up  a  range  of  policies  from  better  school  discipline,  cleaner  hospitals  (""I  mean,  how  hard  is  it  to  keep  a  hospital  clean?"")  and  immigration  (""It's  not  racist  to  impose  limits  on  immigration"")  -  under  the  headline  ""are  you  thinking  what  we  are  thinking?""  This,  they  say,  contrasts  with  Labour's  negative  campaigning,  such  as  its  now  infamous  ""flying  pigs""  poster.  |||    Oliver  Letwin,  one  of  the  men  lampooned  in  the  Labour  poster,  affects  bewilderment  at  what  he  believes  is  Labour's  loss  of  its  once  sure  footing  on  the  campaign  trail.  The  Peter  Hain  ""mongrel""  attack,  he  says,  is  just  the  latest  example  of  the  party  getting  the  tone  wrong  -  a  by-product,  he  claims,  of  the  Tories  setting  the  agenda.  |||    ""I  have  to  say  I  don't  understand  what  they  are  doing.  The  Labour  machine  appears  to  be  in  some  kind  of  state  of  shock,  it  doesn't  seem  to  know  what  to  do.""  A  few  weeks  of  positive  headlines  have  also  done  wonders  for  Tory  activists'  morale  -  likely  to  be  a  crucial  factor  at  an  election  which,  most  analysts  seem  to  agree,  will  hinge  on  which  party  can  get  their  core  support  out.  ""It  has  been  a  fantastic  few  weeks,""  said  20-year-old  politics  student  Nick  Vaughan.  ""Our  policies  have  been  getting  in  the  media  and  there  is  a  sense  that  we  can  win.  I  wouldn't  be  here  if  I  didn't  think  we  could.""  Some  delegates  even  spoke  of  the  next  election  being  like  1970,  when  Ted  Heath,  behind  in  the  polls  and  written  off  by  the  pundits,  snatched  victory  from  Harold  Wilson's  Labour  Party.  |||    They  all  insisted  it  was  not  going  to  be  a  re-run  of  2001.  ""We  thought  in  2001  we  were  going  to  dent  that  massive  majority  but  it  just  didn't  happen,""  said  John  Murray,  of  Aldridge  Browhills  Conservatives.  ""It  was  very  disappointing.  This  time  it  really  is  different.  ""Whoever  is  running  our  strategy  from  the  top  has  got  it  bang  on.  Blair  is  on  the  back  foot.""  Much  of  the  credit  for  the  Tories'  recent  change  of  fortune  must  go  to  Lynton  Crosby,  the  Australian  strategist  who  succeeded  in  turning  political  veteran  and  apparent  no-hoper  John  Howard,  of  Australia's  Liberal  Party,  into  a  serial  election  winner.  The  Tories  still  have  a  mountain  climb  if  Michael  Howard  is  to  walk  through  the  doors  of  Number  10.  Even  allowing  for  the  natural  bias  against  the  Tories  in  some  opinion  polls,  they  are  still  behind,  when  to  have  a  chance  of  overturning  Labour's  whopping  majority,  they  should  really  be  ahead.  But  as  they  gear  up  for  the  start  of  the  campaign  proper,  the  party  at  least  has  reason  to  hope  that,  like  his  Australian  namesake,  Mr  Howard  really  isn't  finished  yet."

Swank,  who  previously  won  the  Golden  Globe  and  Oscar  for  Boys  Don't  Cry,  paid  tribute  to  Million  Dollar  Baby  director  and  co-star  Clint  Eastwood.  ""You  guided  us  so  brilliantly,  while  you  also,  in  my  humble  opinion,  gave  the  performance  of  your  career,""  she  said.  Foxx  was  nominated  for  three  awards  but  was  beaten  to  the  best  supporting  actor  title  by  Owen  and  the  best  actor  in  a  TV  movie  prize  by  Geoffrey  Rush  in  The  Life  and  Death  of  Peter  Sellers.  |||    A  BBC  co-production,  The  Life  and  Death  of  Peter  Sellers  was  also  named  best  TV  movie.  Mick  Jagger  and  Dave  Stewart  won  the  best  original  song  award  for  Old  Habits  Die  Hard  from  movie  re-make  Alfie,  while  Ian  McShane  was  named  best  actor  in  a  TV  drama  for  his  lead  role  in  Deadwood.  |||    Other  UK  hopes  Kate  Winslet  and  Imelda  Staunton  went  home  empty-handed  despite  lead  actress  nominations  for  Eternal  Sunshine  of  the  Spotless  Mind  and  Vera  Drake  respectively.  Winning  a  Golden  Globe  is  said  to  improve  a  film  or  performer's  chance  of  subsequently  winning  an  Academy  Award.  Unlike  the  Oscars,  the  Golden  Globes  split  awards  by  genre  -  one  prize  for  dramas  and  the  other  for  musicals  and  comedies.  The  Globes  also  honour  the  best  in  television,  with  suburban  series  Desperate  Housewives  named  best  TV  comedy  show.  Actress  Teri  Hatcher  beat  fellow  Desperate  Housewives  stars  Marcia  Cross  and  Felicity  Huffman  to  the  best  comedy  actress  prize.  |||    Hatcher  thanked  the  show's  cast,  crew  and  ""a  network  who  gave  me  a  second  chance  at  a  career  when  I  couldn't  have  been  a  bigger  'has  been'"".  Cosmetic  surgery  series  Nip/Tuck  beat  The  Sopranos  and  Deadwood  to  the  best  television  drama  title.  Arrested  Development  star  Jason  Bateman  was  named  best  TV  actor  in  a  musical  or  comedy  series.  The  Golden  Globes  are  awarded  by  the  Hollywood  Foreign  Press  Association,  comprising  film  reporters  based  in  Los  Angeles  and  working  for  overseas  outlets.  Robin  Williams,  a  five-time  Globe  winner  for  such  films  as  The  Fisher  King  and  Good  Morning,  Vietnam,  received  the  Cecil  B  DeMille  award  for  career  achievement.  He  dedicated  his  prize  to  Superman  actor  Christopher  Reeve,  who  died  last  year."

She  released  four  number  ones  from  her  2000  album  Drama,  including  the  top  five  hit  Money  featuring  the  vocals  of  reggae  artist  Beenie  Man.  She  racked  up  five  Mobo  nominations  in  2000,  winning  one  for  best  video.  But  in  the  same  year  she  also  fell  pregnant  and  decided  to  take  a  break  from  music  to  bring  up  her  daughter  Teja,  who  was  born  in  March  2001.  While  she  originally  planned  to  get  back  to  work  pretty  swiftly  after  giving  birth  it  was  actually  two  years  before  she  released  another  single.  During  her  absence  R&B  music  exploded  and  a  whole  host  of  female  artists  were  on  the  scene,  meaning  Jamelia  had  to  once  again  prove  herself.  Her  comeback  song  Bout  featuring  Rah  Digga  only  just  scrapped  into  the  top  40.  |||    It  was  her  next  single,  Superstar,  that  really  put  her  back  on  the  map  as  one  of  Britain's  most  popular  female  R&B  singers,  holding  her  own  in  a  music  scene  dominated  by  US  artists  such  as  Beyonce  and  Ashanti.  |||    Superstar  was  followed  by  Thank  You,  winner  of  best  single  at  the  2004  Mobos,  which  reached  number  two  in  the  UK  charts.  The  autobiographical  song,  which  deals  with  domestic  abuse,  hit  number  one  in  New  Zealand  and  Australia.  Next  came  the  song  See  It  In  A  Boy's  Eyes,  which  was  especially  written  for  her  by  Coldplay's  Chris  Martin.  His  involvement  with  the  song  meant  not  only  was  it  given  massive  publicity  but  it  was  also  greeted  favourably  by  a  new  audience  who  would  not  usually  listen  to  R&B.  She  now  combines  singing  with  modelling  and  supporting  charities  including  the  NSPCC  and  Make  Trade  Fair.  Despite  her  huge  success  in  recent  years,  Jamelia  remains  down-to-earth  about  her  fame  and  her  chances  of  lasting  in  the  fickle  music  business,  partly  due  to  motherhood.  ""When  I  first  got  into  the  industry,  I'd  be  away  from  home  for  months  at  a  time.  But  now  I  have  other  things  in  my  life.  I  still  want  to  make  it,  but  it's  not  the  end  of  the  world  if  I  don't,""  commented  Jamelia." 

1	"Row  threatens  Hendrix  museum  plan  |||    Proposals  to  open  a  museum  dedicated  to  Jimi  Hendrix  are  flailing  because  of  a  row  over  the  home  of  his  late  father.  |||    The  run-down  house  in  Seattle  has  already  been  moved  wholesale  once  and  local  authorities  are  now  demanding  it  be  moved  to  another  site.  Hendrix  supporters  hoped  to  turn  the  home  into  a  museum  for  the  guitarist.  ""The  mayor  is  going  to  go  down  as  the  mayor  who  destroyed  Jimi  Hendrix's  house,""  said  Ray  Rae  Marshall  of  the  James  Marshall  Hendrix  Foundation.  The  foundation  moved  the  building,  in  which  Al  Hendrix  lived  between  1953  and  1956,  when  the  land  it  was  built  on  was  to  be  developed  for  housing  in  2002.  Now  the  City  of  Seattle  wants  its  new  plot  to  be  used  for  development,  giving  a  deadline  of  22  February  for  the  home  to  be  moved.  Mr  Goldman  said  the  authority  had  promised  the  house  could  remain  on  its  new  site  and  be  turned  into  a  memorial  and  community  centre.  Seattle  officials  said  no  such  deal  had  been  offered.  |||    ""We  never  said,  'You  can  own  this  property,'""  said  John  Franklin,  chief  of  its  operations  department.  ""From  our  perspective,  it  was  a  temporary  situation.  We  have  not  threatened  to  demolish  the  house.  We've  simply  asked  that  they  have  to  move  it.""  Now  Mr  Goldman  is  calling  for  the  authority  to  pay  to  move  the  building  to  Seattle's  central  district,  where  Hendrix  grew  up.  Janie  Hendrix,  the  guitarist's  stepsister,  said  the  family  were  still  hoping  the  guitarist  would  be  honoured  by  having  a  road  named  after  him.  ""That's  something  my  father  really  wanted  to  see,""  she  said.  ""It  would  be  nice  if  we  didn't  have  to  fight  for  everything  to  get  it.""  Hendrix  was  widely  considered  one  of  the  most  important  guitarists  of  his  time.  He  died  of  drug  overdose  in  1970  at  the  age  of  27." 

3	"O'Connor  aims  to  grab  opportunity  |||    Johnny  O'Connor  is  determined  to  make  a  big  impression  when  he  makes  his  RBS  Six  Nations  debut  for  Ireland  against  Scotland  on  Saturday.  |||    The  Wasps  flanker  replaces  Denis  Leamy  but  O'Connor  knows  that  the  Munster  man  will  be  pushing  hard  for  a  recall  for  the  following  game  against  England.  ""It's  a  'horses  for  courses'  selection  really,""  said  O'Connor.  ""There's  a  lot  of  competition  here  and  I  can't  just  drag  my  heels  around  if  I  don't  get  picked.""  It  looks  a  definite  head-to-head  battle  between  himself  and  23-year-old  Leamy  -  three  stone  heavier  than  O'Connor  -  for  the  number  seven  role  against  the  world  champions.  Nonetheless,  all  O'Connor  is  currently  concerned  about  is  making  an  impression  while  winning  his  third  cap.  |||    ""Missing  the  Italian  game  was  disappointing  certainly,  but  you  can't  dwell  on  these  things  -  it's  part  and  parcel  of  rugby.  ""Denis  has  been  playing  really  well  and  deserved  his  opportunity.  ""It's  a  good  situation  to  be  in  if  there  are  good  players  around  you,  pushing  for  a  place  in  the  side.""  O'Connor,  who  celebrated  his  25th  birthday  on  Wednesday,  was  touted  by  Wasps  director  of  rugby  Warren  Gatland  as  a  possible  2005  Lions  Test  openside  as  far  back  as  last  September.  And  his  reputation  as  a  breakdown  scavenger  and  heavy  hitter  has  seen  him  come  to  the  forefront  of  O'Sullivan's  mind  for  the  Scottish  tussle.  O'Connor  added:  ""It  will  be  interesting  to  see  how  situations  on  the  deck  is  reffed,  with  the  new  laws  having  come  in.  |||    ""Obviously  the  breakdown  a  big  part  of  what  I  do  on  the  pitch  so  I'm  hoping  to  hold  some  influence  there  against  what  is  a  very  solid  Scottish  pack.""  O'Connor  will  be  winning  his  third  cap  after  making  his  debut  in  the  victory  over  South  Africa  last  November." 

0	"Feta  cheese  battle  reaches  court  |||    A  row  over  whether  only  Greece  should  be  allowed  to  label  its  cheese  feta  has  reached  the  European  Court  of  Justice.  |||    The  Danish  and  German  governments  are  challenging  a  European  Commission  ruling  which  said  Greece  should  have  sole  rights  to  use  the  name.  The  Commission's  decision  gave  the  same  legal  protection  to  feta  as  to  Italian  Parma  ham  and  French  Champagne.  But  critics  of  the  judgement  say  feta  is  a  generic  term,  with  the  cheese  produced  widely  outside  Greece.  |||    The  Commission's  controversial  2002  ruling  gave  ""protected  designation  of  origin""  status  to  feta  cheese  made  in  Greece,  effectively  restricting  the  use  of  the  feta  name  to  producers  there.  |||    From  2007  onwards,  Greek  firms  will  have  the  exclusive  use  of  the  feta  label  and  producers  elsewhere  in  Europe  must  find  another  name  to  describe  their  products.  The  German  and  Danish  governments  argue  that  feta  does  not  relate  to  a  specific  geographical  area  and  that  their  firms  have  been  producing  and  exporting  the  cheese  for  years.  ""In  our  opinion  it  is  a  generic  designation  and  we  do  not  have  any  other  name  or  term  for  this  type  of  cheese,""  Hans  Arne  Kristiansen,  a  spokesman  for  the  Danish  Dairy  Board,  told  the  BBC.  Denmark  is  Europe's  second  largest  producer  of  feta  after  Greece  -  producing  about  30,000  tonnes  a  year  -  and  exports  its  products  to  Greece.  It  is  concerned  that  the  ruling  could  threaten  the  production  of  other  cheeses  in  Denmark  such  as  brie.  ""It  would  cost  millions  if  we  wanted  to  introduce  a  new  designation,""  Mr  Kristiansen  said.  ""That  is  just  one  of  the  costs.""  |||    The  case  will  also  have  a  major  impact  on  Britain's  sole  feta  producer,  Yorkshire  company  Shepherds  Purse  Cheeses.  |||    Judy  Bell,  the  company's  founder,  said  it  would  cost  a  huge  amount  to  rebrand  its  product.  ""If  we  lose  we  will  have  to  go  through  a  massive  re-merchandising  process  and  reorganisation,""  she  said.  ""We  have  never  tried  to  pull  the  wool  over  anyone's  eyes  -  it's  very  clear  from  the  label  that  it's  Yorkshire  feta.""  The  original  decision  was  a  victory  for  Greece,  where  feta  cheese  is  believed  to  have  been  produced  for  about  6,000  years.  Feta  is  a  soft  white  cheese  made  from  sheep  or  goat's  milk,  and  is  an  essential  ingredient  in  Greek  cuisine.  Greece  makes  115,000  tonnes,  mainly  for  domestic  consumption.  The  Court  is  expected  to  reach  a  verdict  in  the  case  in  the  autumn."

Flights  were  affected  for  an  hour  on  Wednesday  morning,  double  the  time  that  had  been  expected,  leading  to  cancellations  and  delays.  Lufthansa  accounts  for  six  out  of  every  10  planes  using  Frankfurt's  airport.  |||    ""We  are  doing  research  into  the  possibilities  we  have,""  Michael  Lamberty,  a  Lufthansa  spokesman  told  the  BBC.  ""We  are  checking  if  there  is  action  to  be  taken  and  in  which  courts  it  could  be  taken.""  Mr  Lamberty  explained  that  the  company  did  not  plan  to  pursue  Germany's  air  traffic  controllers'  organisation  or  the  airport  authority  but  wanted  instead  to  see  if  it  was  possible  to  sue  the  German  federal  agencies  that  gave  the  orders.  The  company  said  that  it  had  to  cancel  77  short  and  medium-distance  flights,  affecting  about  5,000  passengers.  Long-haul  travellers  were  not  disrupted.  |||    Central  to  the  problem  was  that  instead  of  half  an  hour,  the  arrival  of  President  Bush  on  the  German  leg  of  his  European  tour  took  the  best  part  of  an  hour,  Lufthansa  said.  During  that  time,  restrictions  were  put  on  planes  taxiing,  taking  off  and  landing  at  Frankfurt's  Rhein-Main  airport.  The  extra  time  taken  by  President  Bush  and  his  entourage  meant  that  there  was  a  knock-on  effect  that  led  to  significant  delays.  Mr  Lamberty  said  that  92  outgoing  flights  and  86  income  flights  were  delayed  by  an  average  of  an  hour  following  President  Bush's  arrival,  affecting  almost  17,000  passengers.  Despite  the  problems,  Mr  Lamberty  said  that  it  was  not  certain  that  Lufthansa  would  take  legal  action." 

2	"Mallon  wades  into  NE  vote  battle  |||    Middlesbrough  mayor  Ray  Mallon  has  been  drafted  in  to  boost  the  Yes  campaign  as  the  North  East  assembly  referendum  enters  its  final  week.  |||    The  former  police  chief,  dubbed  Robocop  for  his  zero  tolerance  style,  clashed  on  Thursday  with  Sunderland  No  campaigner  Neil  Herron.  Mr  Mallon  said  an  assembly  would  give  local  people  more  of  a  say  over  key  issues  such  as  transport  and  crime.  But  Mr  Herron  said  North  East  people  did  not  want  or  need  an  assembly.  |||    The  pair  met  on  the  platform  at  Sunderland  station  as  Mr  Mallon  toured  the  region  highlighting  claimed  improvements  to  transport  if  the  area  gets  an  assembly.  But  Mr  Herron  -  who  gained  fame  as  one  of  Sunderland's  ""metric  martyrs""  and  is  running  his  own  No  campaign  alongside  the  official  North  East  Says  No  campaign  -  said  he  was  not  convinced  by  Mr  Mallon's  arguments.  ""The  reality  is  that  it  is  not  going  to  deliver,""  he  said.  ""Labour  has  had  two-and-a-half  years  to  convince  people  of  this.  If  you  can't  sell  a  deal  in  that  time,  it  is  a  bad  deal.""  On  Wednesday,  Mr  Mallon  provoked  fury  by  branding  the  official  No  Campaign  ""two-bit  Tories""  in  a  confrontation  outside  its  Durham  headquarters.  ""The  campaign  is  being  run  by  two-bit  Conservatives  who  are  not  interested  in  what  happens  in  the  North  East;  they  are  interested  in  hitting  the  Labour  party  over  the  head,""  he  said.  Mr  Mallon  is  a  late  recruit  to  the  Yes  campaign  after  rejecting  overtures  from  No  campaigners  including,  he  claims,  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard.  |||    Most  local  observers  believe  the  contest  is  too  close  to  call,  although  little  recent  polling  has  been  carried  out.  Yes  campaign  chairman  John  Tomaney  said  he  hoped  for  a  late  flurry  of  votes  to  boost  turnout  -  something  he  says  will  boost  their  cause.  He  added:  ""The  government  exerts  a  lot  of  political  power  in  the  North  East.  The  accountability  should  be  in  the  North  East  as  well.""  He  also  defended  the  decision  to  attack  the  official  No  campaign's  alleged  political  allegiances.  ""We  felt  we  had  to  show  what  people  were  behind  the  No  campaign  -  London  Tory  spin  doctors.""  Graham  Robb,  spokesman  for  North  East  Says  No,  said  the  Yes  campaign's  decision  to  get  personal  dragged  the  campaign  ""into  the  gutter""  and  showed  they  were  ""rattled"".  And  he  hit  back  at  Mr  Mallon's  claim  that  an  assembly  would  improve  transport  links  in  the  region.  ""It  can  push  paper  around  but  it  can  not  get  people  moving,""  he  said.  Some  487,939  people  had  returned  their  ballot  papers  by  Wednesday  -  a  turnout  of  25.7%.  The  deadline  for  voting  is  next  Thursday,  4  November."

He  then  accused  the  Tory  Leader  of  behaving  like  an  ""attack  mongrel""  and  ""playing  opposition  for  opposition  sake"".  |||    Mr  Howard  told  his  party  that  Labour  would  ""do  anything,  say  anything,  claim  anything  to  cling  on  to  office  at  all  costs"".  ""So  far  this  year  they  have  compared  me  to  Fagin,  to  Shylock  and  to  a  flying  pig.  This  morning  Peter  Hain  even  called  me  a  mongrel.  ""I  don't  know  about  you,  but  something  tells  me  that  someone,  somewhere  out  there  is  just  a  little  bit  rattled.""  Environment  Secretary  Margaret  Beckett  rejected  Mr  Howard's  comment,  telling  Radio  4's  PM  programme  that  Labour  was  not  ""rattled"".  ""We  have  a  very  real  duty  to  try  to  get  people  to  focus  on  Michael  Howard's  record,  what  the  proposals  are  that  he  is  trying  to  put  forward  to  the  country  and  also  the  many  examples  we  are  seeing  now  of  what  we  believe  is  really  poor  judgement  on  his  behalf.""  |||    Mr  Howard  said  Tory  policies  on  schools,  taxes,  immigration  and  crime  were  striking  a  chord  with  voters.  |||    ""Since  the  beginning  of  this  year  -  election  year  -  we've  been  making  the  political  weather,""  he  told  the  party  conference.  Mr  Howard  denied  he  had  been  ""playing  politics""  by  raising  the  case  of  Margaret  Dixon,  whose  operation  had  been  cancelled  seven  times,  which  grabbed  headlines  for  the  party  two  weeks  ago.  And  he  hit  back  at  Labour  claims  he  had  used  Mrs  Dixon  as  a  ""human  shield"".  ""She's  not  a  human  shield  Mr  Blair,  she's  a  human  being.""  Mr  Howard  said  his  party  plans  for  immigration  quotas,  which  have  also  been  the  focus  of  much  media  coverage,  were  not  ""racist""  -  just  ""common  sense"".  |||    He  pledged  cleaner  hospitals  and  better  school  discipline,  with  a  promise  to  get  rid  of  ""political  correctness""  in  the  national  curriculum  and  give  everyone  to  the  same  chance  of  a  ""decent""  state  education  as  he  had.  ""I  come  from  an  ordinary  family.  If  the  teenage  Michael  Howard  were  applying  to  Cambridge  today,  Gordon  Brown  would  love  me.""  |||    And  he  stressed  his  party's  commitment  to  cut  taxes  and  red  tape  and  increase  the  basic  state  pension  in  line  with  earnings.  He  finished  with  a  personal  appeal  to  party  activists  to  go  out  and  win  the  next  election.  ""One  day  you  will  be  able  to  tell  your  children  and  grandchildren  as  I  will  tell  mine,  'I  was  there.  I  did  my  bit.  I  played  my  part.  I  helped  to  win  that  famous  election  -  the  election  that  transformed  our  country  for  the  better'.""  Labour  election  co-ordinator  Alan  Milburn  said:  ""Michael  Howard's  speech  today  confirms  what  we  have  always  said  -  that  his  only  strategy  is  opportunism  but  he  has  no  forward  vision  for  the  country.  In  reference  to  the  appearance  of  Mr  Howard's  family  on  the  conference  stage  with  him,  Mr  Milburn  said:  ""Michael  Howard  is  perfectly  entitled  to  pose  with  his  family  today.  ""But  it  is  the  hard  working  families  across  Britain  that  will  be  damaged  by  his  plan  to  cut  £35bn  from  public  spending.""" 

2	"Parties  warned  over  'grey  vote'  |||    Political  parties  cannot  afford  to  take  older  UK  voters  for  granted  in  the  coming  election,  says  Age  Concern.  |||    A  survey  for  the  charity  suggests  69%  of  over-55s  say  they  always  vote  in  a  general  election  compared  with  just  17%  of  18  to  24  year  olds.  Charity  boss  Gordon  Lishman  said  if  a  ""decisive  blow""  was  struck  at  the  election  it  would  be  by  older  voters  who  could  be  relied  on  to  turn  out.  A  total  of  3,028  adults  aged  18  or  over  were  interviewed  for  the  study.  Mr  Lishman  urged  the  next  government  to  boost  state  pension.  |||    He  also  called  for  measures  to  combat  ageism  and  build  effective  public  services  to  ""support  us  all  in  an  ageing  society"".  ""Older  people  want  to  see  manifesto  commitments  that  will  make  a  difference  to  their  lives,""  Mr  Lishman  said.  ""Political  parties  must  wake  up  to  the  fact  that  unless  they  address  the  demands  and  concerns  of  older  people  they  will  not  keep  or  attract  their  vote.""  In  the  survey  carried  out  by  ICM  Research,  14%  of  people  aged  between  18  and  34  said  they  never  voted  in  general  elections.  Among  the  over-65s,  70%  said  they  would  be  certain  to  vote  in  an  immediate  election,  compared  with  39%  of  people  under  55.  Age  Concern  says  the  over-55s  are  ""united  around""  key  areas  of  policy  they  want  the  government  to  focus  on.  For  57%,  pensions  and  the  NHS  were  key  issues,  while  the  economy  was  important  for  a  third,  and  tax  was  a  crucial  area  for  25%.  |||    The  report  was  welcomed  by  Conservative  shadow  pensions  secretary  David  Willetts.  ""The  pensioners'  voice  must  certainly  be  heard  in  the  next  election  as  they  have  never  fitted  into  Blair's  cool  Britannia,""  he  said.  ""Labour's  continued  refusal  to  admit  the  true  extent  of  the  pensions  crisis  will  be  one  of  the  monumental  failures  of  this  government.""  He  pointed  to  Tory  plans  to  increase  the  basic  state  pension  to  reduce  means  testing,  strengthen  company  pensions  and  encourage  savings.  A  Liberal  Democrat  spokesman  said  the  party  took  the  issues  raised  in  the  report  very  seriously.  He  highlighted  the  party's  promises  to  raise  the  basic  state  pension,  provide  free  long-term  care  for  the  elderly  and  replace  council  tax,  seen  as  a  particular  problem  for  pensioners  on  fixed  incomes.  Labour  has  said  it  wants  to  use  savings  reforms  to  Incapacity  Benefit  to  improve  the  basic  state  pension  and  has  set  up  a  review  of  the  council  tax  system."

Sales  climbed  8%  for  the  year,  the  best  performance  since  an  8.5%  rise  in  1999,  the  Commerce  Department  added.  The  gains  were  led  by  a  4.3%  jump  in  auto  sales  as  dealers  used  enhanced  offers  to  get  cars  out  of  showrooms.  Dealers  were  forced  to  cut  prices  in  December  to  maintain  sales  growth  in  a  tough  quarter  when  the  usual  end-of-year  holiday  sales  boom  was  slow  to  get  started.  |||    The  increase  in  sales  during  December  pushed  total  spending  for  the  month  to  $349.4bn  (£265.9bn).  Sales  for  the  year  also  broke  through  the  $4  trillion  mark  for  the  first  time  -  with  annual  sales  coming  in  at  $4.06  trillion  However,  if  automotives  are  excluded  from  December's  data,  retail  sales  rose  just  0.3%  on  the  month.  Home  furnishings  and  furniture  stores  also  performed  well,  rising  2.2%.  But  as  well  as  hitting  the  shops,  more  US  consumers  were  going  online  or  using  mail  order  for  their  purchases  -  with  non-store  retailers  seeing  sales  rise  by  1.9%.  However,  analysts  said  that  the  strong  figures  were  unlikely  to  put  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  off  its  current  policy  of  measured  interest  rate  rises.  ""Consumers  for  now  remain  willing  to  spend  freely,  sustaining  the  US  expansion.  Given  that  attitude,  the  Fed  remains  likely  to  continue  boosting  the  Fed  funds  rate  at  upcoming  meetings,""  UBS  economist  Maury  Harris  told  Reuters.  |||    Retail  sales  are  seen  as  a  major  part  of  consumer  spending  -  which  in  turn  makes  up  two-thirds  of  economic  output  in  the  US.  Consumer  spending  has  been  picking  up  in  recent  years  after  slumping  during  2001  and  2002  as  the  country  battled  to  recover  from  its  first  recession  of  the  decade  and  the  World  Trade  Centre  attacks.  During  that  time,  sales  grew  a  lacklustre  2.9%  in  2001  and  2.5%  a  year  later.  Looking  ahead,  analysts  now  expect  improvement  in  jobs  growth  to  feed  through  to  the  High  Street  with  consumer  spending  remaining  strong.  The  belief  comes  despite  the  latest  labor  department  report  showing  a  surprise  rise  in  unemployment.  The  number  of  Americans  filing  initial  jobless  claims  jumped  to  367,000,  the  highest  rate  since  September.  However,  long-term  claims  slipped  to  their  lowest  level  since  2001."

The  offence  carries  a  sentence  of  16  months  to  four  years  in  state  prison.  Mr  Spitzer's  office  added  Mr  Stearns  had  also  agreed  to  testify  in  future  cases  during  the  industry  inquiry.  ""We  are  saddened  by  the  development,""  Marsh  said  in  a  statement.  The  company  added  it  would  continue  to  co-operate  in  the  case,  adding  it  was  ""committed  to  resolving  the  company's  legal  issues  and  to  serving  our  clients  with  the  highest  standards  of  transparency  and  ethics"".  |||    According  to  a  statement  from  Mr  Spitzer's  office,  the  Marsh  executive  admitted  he  instructed  insurance  companies  to  submit  non-competitive  bids  for  insurance  business  between  2002  and  2004.  Those  bids  were  then  ""conveyed  to  Marsh  clients  under  false  and  fraudulent  pretences"".  Through  the  practice,  Marsh  was  allowed  to  determine  which  insurers  won  business  from  clients,  and  so  control  the  insurance  market,  Mr  Spitzer's  office  added.  It  also  protected  incumbent  insurers  when  their  business  was  up  for  renewal  and  helped  Marsh  to  maximise  its  fees,  a  statement  said.  In  one  case,  an  email  showed  Mr  Stearns  had  instructed  a  colleague  to  solicit  a  non-competitive  -  or  ""B""  -  quote  from  AIG  that  was  ""higher  in  premium  and  more  restrictive  in  coverage""  and  so  fixed  the  bids  in  a  way  that  would  support  the  present  provider  Chubb.  The  company  is  also  still  being  examined  by  US  stock  market  regulator  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC).  Late  last  month  the  SEC  asked  for  information  about  transactions  involving  holders  of  5%  or  more  of  the  firm's  shares."

Get  Me  Out  of  Here  drew  an  average  of  10.9m  viewers  -  about  four  million  fewer  than  the  previous  series.  |||    The  fourth  series  of  the  show  peaked  on  Monday  at  11.9m  and  49.2%  of  the  audience,  just  before  Joe  Pasquale  won.  This  compared  with  a  peak  of  15.3m  at  and  a  record  62.2%  of  the  TV  audience  when  Kerry  McFadden  won  in  February.  Comic  Pasquale  beat  former  Royal  butler  Paul  Burrell  who  came  second,  nightclub  owner  Fran  Cosgrave,  who  was  third.  Pasquale  follows  Kerry  McFadden,  Phil  Tufnell  and  Tony  Blackburn  as  winners  of  the  show.  |||    Singer  and  TV  presenter  McFadden  was  the  show's  first  female  winner.  When  cricketer  Phil  Tufnell  won  in  May  2003,  12.3  million  people  -  50%  of  the  viewing  public  -  tuned  in  to  watch.  And  when  Tony  Blackburn  won  the  first  show  in  2002,  10.9  million  people  saw  the  show.  Pasquale  had  been  the  show's  hottest  ever  favourite  to  win,  and  its  hosts  Anthony  McPartlin  and  Declan  Donnelly,  known  as  Ant  and  Dec,  said  Monday's  deciding  vote  was  the  closest  in  the  programme's  history.  |||    Pascuale  has  been  flooded  with  offers  of  TV  work,  according  to  his  management  company,  but  one  of  his  first  jobs  on  his  return  is  pantomime.  |||    Before  joining  I'm  a  Celebrity,  he  had  signed  up  to  play  Jack  in  Jack  and  the  Beanstalk  in  Birmingham,  and  tickets  for  the  show  have  become  increasingly  popular  since  he  joined  the  TV  show.

2	"Blair  backs  'pre-election  budget'  |||    Tony  Blair  has  backed  Chancellor  Gordon  Brown's  pre-Budget  report  amid  opposition  claims  he  was  too  bullish  about  the  state  of  the  UK  economy.  |||    In  a  speech  in  Edinburgh,  the  prime  minister  said  Thursday's  report  reinforced  stability  and  opportunity.  And  that  would  be  central  to  Labour's  next  election  campaign,  planning  for  which  was  already  well  advanced.  Mr  Brown  earlier  denied  his  economic  forecasts  were  too  optimistic  -  but  refused  to  rule  out  future  tax  rises.  |||    He  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme:  ""No  politician  should  make  the  mistake  that  John  Major  and  his  colleagues  made  in  1992  of  saying  no  matter  what  the  circumstances  are,  they  can  make  all  sorts  of  guarantees  on  every  individual  thing.  |||    ""That  is  not  what  politicians  should  do,  it  would  not  be  responsible  to  do.""  Mr  Brown  insisted  his  spending  plans  were  ""affordable""  and  he  could  afford  to  be  optimistic  because  Britain  was  now  a  stable,  low-inflation  economy  and  house  prices  were  now  stabilising.  Mr  Blair  praised  his  chancellor  for  his  role  in  creating  economic  stability,  which  he  said  was  the  ""cornerstone""  of  Labour's  programme.  |||    In  a  speech  at  Edinburgh's  Napier  University,  he  said  Labour  would  publish  over  the  next  few  months  ""a  rich  agenda  for  future  policy  in  any  possible  third  term"".  |||    ""In  every  area  of  work  there  is  a  detailed  plan  for  the  future,  much  clearer  than  those  in  1997  or  2001.  All  of  it  fits  together  around  common  themes  of  opportunity,  security  and  stability  for  all,""  Mr  Blair  said.  In  his  pre-Budget  report,  Mr  Brown  surprised  some  City  experts  by  forecasting  UK  growth  at  between  3%  and  3.5%  for  next  year.  Many  believe  the  figure  is  more  likely  to  be  under  3%  -  and  fear  tax  rises  or  spending  cuts,  saying  tax  receipts  have  been  overestimated.  Carl  Emmerson,  from  the  Institute  for  Fiscal  Studies,  told  BBC  News:  ""He  thinks  everything  will  come  out  in  the  wash  and  it  will,  in  fact,  be  OK.  We're  not  so  sure.""  David  Page,  of  Investec  Securities,  said:  ""His  forecast  that  he  will  meet  the  golden  rule  with  a  margin  of  £8bn  is  way  too  optimistic.  ""It's  going  to  take  a  significant  turnaround  in  the  economy  to  meet  these  targets.""  |||    Conservative  Shadow  chancellor  Oliver  Letwin  said:  ""I  can't  find  a  single  economic  forecaster  from  the  IMF  to  the  Institute  of  Fiscal  Studies  who  believes  anything  other  than  the  chancellor  has  got  a  black  hole  in  his  finances.  ""In  order  to  deal  with  that  he  will  have  to  raise  taxes  after  the  next  general  election.""  Mr  Letwin  accused  the  chancellor  of  using  ""fancy  statistics""  to  hide  public  service  failures.  Vincent  Cable,  for  the  Liberal  Democrats,  called  on  Mr  Brown  to  open  up  the  government's  books  to  the  National  Audit  Office,  to  see  if  he  had  met  his  ""golden  rule"".  ""It  is  very  clear  that  there  are  some  serious  loose  ends  in  government  public  spending,""  Mr  Cable  told  MPs."

With  assets  of  $200m  and  liabilities  totalling  $648m,  it  needs  creditors'  backing  for  the  offer  to  avoid  going  into  bankruptcy.  The  trading  scandal  is  the  biggest  to  hit  Singapore  since  the  $1.2bn  collapse  of  Barings  Bank  in  1995.  Chen  Jiulin,  chief  executive  of  China  Aviation  Oil  (CAO),  was  arrested  by  at  Changi  Airport  by  Singapore  police  on  8  December.  He  was  returning  from  China,  where  he  had  headed  when  CAO  announced  its  trading  debacle  in  late-November.  The  firm  had  been  betting  heavily  on  a  fall  in  the  price  of  oil  during  October,  but  prices  rose  sharply  instead.  |||    Among  the  creditors  whose  backing  CAO  needs  for  its  restructuring  plan  are  banking  giants  such  as  Barclay's  Capital  and  Sumitomo  Mitsui,  as  well  as  South  Korean  firm  SK  Energy.  Of  the  immediate  payment,  the  firm  -  China's  biggest  jet  fuel  supplier  -  said  it  would  be  paying  $30m  out  of  its  own  resources.  The  rest  would  come  from  its  parent  company,  China  Aviation  Oil  Holding  Company  in  Beijing.  The  holding  company,  owned  by  the  Chinese  government,  holds  most  of  CAO's  Singapore-listed  shares.  It  cut  its  holding  from  75%  to  60%  on  20  October."

He  made  his  comments  at  the  start  of  a  day  of  appearances  on  Channel  Five  in  a  session  on  The  Wright  Stuff  programme.  Questions  from  callers,  a  studio  audience  and  the  show's  presenter  covered  Lib  Dem  tax  plans,  anti-terror  laws  and  immigration.  |||    Mr  Kennedy  said  during  his  nearly  22  years  in  Parliament  he  had  seen  prime  ministers  and  party  leaders  come  and  go  and  knew  the  pitfalls  of  British  politics.  ""1983  was  when  I  was  first  elected  as  an  MP  -  so  Tony  Blair,  Michael  Howard  and  myself  were  all  class  of  '83  -  and  over  that  nearly  quarter  of  a  century  the  world  has  changed  out  of  recognition,""  he  said.  ""We  don't  actually  hear  the  argument  any  longer:  'Lib  Dems,  good  people,  reasonable  ideas  but  only  if  we  thought  they  could  win  around  here  -  it's  a  wasted  vote'.  ""You  don't  hear  that  because  the  evidence  of  people's  senses  demonstrates  that  it  isn't  a  wasted  vote.""  But  he  said  Mr  Blair  had  lost  the  trust  of  the  British  people.  ""There  is  a  fundamental  lack  of  trust  in  Tony  Blair  as  prime  minister  and  in  his  government,""  he  said.  |||    ""What  we've  got  to  do  as  a  party  -  what  I've  got  to  do  as  a  leader  of  this  party  -  is  to  convey  to  people  that  what  you  see  is  what  you  get.""  Mr  Kennedy  also  used  his  TV  appearance  to  defend  his  party's  plans  to  increase  income  tax  to  50%  for  those  earning  more  than  £100,000,  saying  it  would  apply  to  just  1%  of  the  population.  He  said  the  extra  revenue  would  allow  his  party  to  get  rid  of  tuition  and  top-up  fees,  introduce  free  personal  care  for  the  elderly  and  replace  the  council  tax  with  a  local  income  tax.

Viotti  was  born  in  Switzerland  and  studied  the  piano,  cello  and  singing  at  the  Lausanne  Conservatory.  His  career  breakthrough  came  in  1982  when  he  won  first  prize  at  the  Gino  Marinuzzi  conducting  competition  in  Italy.  Viotti  established  himself  as  chief  conductor  of  the  Turin  Opera  and  went  on  to  become  chief  conductor  of  Munich's  Radio  Orchestra.  At  La  Fenice  Viotti  was  widely  acclaimed  for  his  production  of  the  French  composer  Massenet's  Thais  and  some  of  his  other  productions  included  Giuseppe  Verdi's  La  Traviata  and  Richard  Strauss's  Ariadne  auf  Naxos.  |||    The  last  opera  he  directed  at  La  Fenice  was  Massenet's  Le  Roi  de  Lahore.  Viotti's  debut  at  the  New  York's  Metropolitan  Opera  came  in  2000  with  Giacomo  Puccini's  Madame  Butterfly,  followed  by  La  Boheme,  La  Traviata  and  Fromental  Halevy's  La  Juive.  Giampaolo  Vianello,  superintendent  of  the  Fenice  Theatre  Foundation,  said:  ""I  am  filled  with  extreme  sadness  because,  other  than  a  great  artist,  he  is  missed  as  a  friend  -  a  main  character  in  the  latest  joyous  times,  during  the  rebirth  of  our  theatre.""  Viotti's  last  public  performance  was  on  5  February  when  he  conducted  Vincenzo  Bellini's  Norma  at  the  Vienna  State  Opera."

Less  welcome  was  the  news  that  the  firm  had  been  fined  11m  euros  for  having  violated  takeover  rules  five  years  ago.  The  firm  sought  bankruptcy  protection  in  December  2003  after  disclosing  a  4bn-euro  hole  in  its  accounts.  Overall,  the  company's  debt  is  close  to  12bn  euros,  and  is  falling  only  slowly.  Its  brands,  well-known  in  Italy  and  overseas,  have  continued  to  perform  strongly,  however,  and  have  barely  lost  revenue  since  the  scandal  broke.  |||    But  a  crucial  factor  for  the  company's  future  is  the  legal  unwinding  of  its  intensely  complex  financial  position.  On  Tuesday,  the  company's  administrator,  turnaround  expert  Enrico  Bondi,  sued  Morgan  Stanley,  its  former  banker,  to  return  136m  euros  relating  to  a  2003  bond  deal.  That  brought  to  49  the  number  of  banks  that  Mr  Bondi  has  sued,  a  mass  of  legal  action  that  could  bring  in  as  much  as  3bn  euros.  The  company  has  also  sued  former  auditors  and  financial  advisors  for  damages.  And  criminal  cases  against  the  company's  former  management  are  proceeding  separately." 

2	"Councils  prepare  to  set  tax  rises  |||    Council  tax  in  Scotland  is  set  to  rise  by  an  average  of  about  4%  in  the  coming  year,  BBC  Scotland  has  learned.  |||    Authorities  will  decide  final  figures  on  Thursday  when  projected  increases  will  be  more  than  twice  the  rate  of  inflation,  which  is  currently  1.6%.  The  finance  minister  has  urged  councils  to  limit  increases  but  they  have  warned  that  they  will  struggle  to  maintain  services  unless  funding  is  increased.  They  say  much  additional  government  money  is  for  new  initiatives.  Scottish  Finance  Minister,  Tom  McCabe  MSP,  said:  ""Last  week  in  parliament  I  announced  an  additional  £419m  for  core  expenditure  to  local  government  in  Scotland.  ""That's  a  5.5%  increase  and  sits  against  an  inflation  rate  of  1.6%,  so  I  think  we  have  quite  rightly  said  to  councils  this  year  that  we  would  at  the  very  least  ask  them  to  exercise  restraint.""  Mr  McCabe  is  also  looking  for  local  authorities  to  become  more  efficient  and  save  money  in  coming  years.  He  told  BBC  Radio  Scotland's  Sunday  Live  programme:  ""Here  in  Scotland  we  have  32  councils  who  all  have  their  own  individual  collection  systems  for  council  tax,  they  have  their  own  payroll  systems  and  their  own  human  resource  systems.  |||    ""We  think  there  has  to  be  opportunities  there  for  rationalisation  and  using  the  money  saved  to  reinvest  in  frontline  services.""  The  councils'  umbrella  organisation  Cosla,  which  provided  BBC  Scotland  with  the  indicative  figures  for  next  year,  warned  that  councils  would  face  a  continuous  struggle  to  maintain  services.  Mr  McCabe  has  promised  them  about  £8.1bn  next  year.  ""However,  most  of  the  increase  is  targeted  to  new  initiatives  and  councils  will  experience  difficulties  in  maintaining  core  services,""  a  Cosla  spokesman  said.  Cosla  says  that  it  is  willing  to  work  with  the  executive  on  finding  efficiency  savings  but  that  these  will  not  be  enough  to  maintain  services.  They  say  the  funding  plans  for  the  next  three  years  will  see  councils  lose  more  of  the  share  of  public  spending.  The  Conservatives  accuse  the  Scottish  Executive  of  using  the  council  tax  to  raise  funds  because  it  is  too  afraid  to  raise  income  tax.  |||    The  Tory  finance  spokesman,  Brian  Monteith  MSP,  said:  ""Its  a  form  of  disguise...  yet  again  we  see  that  council  tax  is  being  used  as  a  way  of  passing  on  costs.  ""Scared  of  actually  using  its  three  pence  income  tax  that  it  could  put  up,  what  we've  seen  over  the  years  is  more  and  more  burdens  being  put  onto  local  authorities  and  the  council  tax  payer  having  to  pick  up  the  bill.""  There  are  also  warnings  that  unless  funding  to  councils  is  increased  in  the  next  few  years  then  services  may  have  to  be  reduced.  Linda  Knox,  Director  of  the  Scottish  Local  Authority  Management  Centre  at  Strathclyde  University,  said:  ""With  this  current  settlement  the  increase  is  slowing.  At  the  same  time,  the  burdens  on  councils  are  greater  than  they  were.  ""The  settlement  figures  don't  include  pay  increases  and  the  executive  is  also  requiring  a  substantial  figure  -  in  the  area  of  £325m  -  in  efficiency  savings  across  the  settlement  period.""  Education  will  be  protected  from  any  cuts  but  Linda  Knox  says  this  will  mean  other  services  will  suffer.  She  said:  ""In  practice,  that  will  mean  a  4-5%  cut  for  other  services.  On  the  face  of  it  the  settlement  looks  like  an  increase  of  about  9.7%  but  by  the  time  you  take  into  account  other  factors  its  probably  only  about  1%  in  real  terms.""" 

1	"Johnny  and  Denise  lose  Passport  |||    Johnny  Vaughan  and  Denise  Van  Outen's  Saturday  night  entertainment  show  Passport  to  Paradise  will  not  return  to  screens,  the  BBC  has  said.  |||    The  ex-Big  Breakfast  presenters  were  recruited  to  host  the  BBC  One  family  variety  show  last  July.  ""There  are  currently  no  plans  for  another  series,""  a  spokeswoman  said.  She  added  the  pair  ""brought  a  real  warmth  to  Saturday  night,  but  in  the  end  we  felt  we  had  done  enough  with  the  format  of  the  show"".  |||    Passport  to  Paradise  involved  a  combination  of  games  and  outside  broadcasts  with  a  high  level  of  audience  participation.  The  first  instalment  attracted  more  than  4.1  million  viewers  -  but  that  had  dropped  to  fewer  than  2.7  million  by  the  time  it  ended.  The  BBC  spokeswoman  said  Graham  Norton's  Strictly  Dance  Fever  would  be  a  priority  for  2005.  ""That's  very  much  on  the  cards  for  next  year,  and  we're  concentrating  at  the  moment  on  Strictly  Come  Dancing,  which  is  doing  phenomenally  well,""  she  said." 

2	"Terror  powers  expose  'tyranny'  |||    The  Lord  Chancellor  has  defended  government  plans  to  introduce  control  orders  to  keep  foreign  and  British  terrorist  suspects  under  house  arrest,  where  there  isn't  enough  evidence  to  put  them  on  trial.  |||    Lord  Falconer  insists  that  the  proposals  do  not  equate  to  a  police  state  and  strike  a  balance  between  protecting  the  public  against  the  threat  of  terrorism  and  upholding  civil  liberties.  But  thriller  writer  Frederick  Forsyth  tells  BBC  News  of  his  personal  response  to  the  move.  |||      |||    There  is  a  mortal  danger  aimed  at  the  heart  of  Britain.  Or  so  says  Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke.  My  reaction?  So  what?  It  is  not  that  I  am  cynical  or  just  do  not  care.  I  care  about  this  country  very  much.  |||    But  in  the  66  years  that  I  have  been  alive,  there  has  not  been  one  hour,  of  one  day,  of  one  month,  of  one  year,  when  there  has  not  been  a  threat  aimed  at  us.  My  point  is,  the  British  have  always  coped  without  becoming  a  dictatorship.  We  have  coped  with  fear  without  becoming  a  state  based  on  fear;  we  have  coped  with  threat  without  turning  our  country  into  a  land  of  state  threat.  But  that  is  what  the  Blair  government  now  seeks  to  do  -  create  a  tyranny  to  defend  us  from  the  al-Qaeda  tyranny.  |||    I  was  born  on  25  August,  1938.  The  mortal  threat  back  then  was  a  scruffy  little  Austrian  called  Adolf  Hitler.  A  week  after  my  first  birthday,  the  threat  had  become  reality.  We  were  at  war.  My  father  wore  a  uniform  for  five  years.  After  1945  we  yearned  for  peace  at  last.  But  in  1946  Winston  Churchill  told  us  -  from  the  Baltic  to  the  Adriatic  an  Iron  Curtain  has  descended  across  Europe.  Behind  the  Iron  Curtain,  another  genocidal  psychopath,  another  threat.  Josef  Stalin  triggered  the  Cold  War,  with  the  Berlin  blockade  in  1948.  My  whole  generation  was  blighted  by  it.  |||    We  were  threatened  by  the  nuclear  holocaust,  the  nuclear  wind,  the  nuclear  winter.  We  built  shelters  that  would  have  sheltered  nothing.  We  spent  our  treasure  on  weapons  instead  of  hospitals.  We  took  silly  precautions.  Some  fought  it;  some  marched  futilely  against  it.  Some  pretended  it  was  not  there.  The  Cold  War  lasted  43  years,  but  we  remained  a  parliamentary  democracy.  By  the  early  seventies  it  was  terrorism  as  well.  Al  Fatah,  Black  September,  Red  Brigades,  but  most  of  all  for  us  the  IRA  and  the  INLA.  Thirty  more  years;  300  policemen  and  women,  over  600  soldiers,  more  than  3,000  civilians  dead,  but  we  won  because  even  IRA  bombs  could  not  force  us  to  become  a  tyranny.  That  was  why  the  tyrants  lost.  Civil  rights  were  infringed  as  little  as  humanly  possible.  Evidence  had  to  be  taken  in  secret  to  protect  covert  sources;  yes  ,  and  one  judge,  no-jury  courts  had  to  be  instituted  when  juries  were  terrorised.  Informants  had  to  be  given  immunity  from  their  own  crimes  to  win  the  bigger  battle.  But  habeas  corpus  did  not  die;  right  of  appeal  was  not  abolished.  Now  the  threat  is  Islamic  fundamentalism.  Its  leaders  want  to  destroy  our  society;  so  did  the  IRA.  |||    It  is  based  and  funded  abroad;  so  was  the  IRA.  It  has  sleeper  fanatics  inside  our  society;  so  did  the  IRA.  It  is  extremely  hard  to  penetrate  with  our  agents;  so  was  the  IRA.  The  prime  movers  are  not  easy  to  bring  to  trial;  neither  were  the  IRA.  But  we  did.  And  without  becoming  a  tyranny.  Now  the  Blair  government  proposes  the  law  system  of  fascism  and  communism.  The  citizen  can  be  arrested  and  held  without  charge  or  trial,  not  even  on  the  careful  consideration  of  an  experienced  judge,  but  the  whim  of  a  political  activist  called  a  government  minister.  To  be  protected  from  terror  the  government  says,  we  must  become  a  tyranny.  But  a  tyranny  is  based  on  the  citizen's  terror.  This  is  not  victory;  this  is  defeat  before  a  shot  is  fired.  |||    An  interesting  article  -  its  good  to  see  widening  participation  in  the  debate  -  but  I  suggest  we  move  one  step  further.  Our  own  bombs  and  bullets  will  can  only  shatter  peace,  because  invading  foreign  nations,  imprisoning  the  innocent  and  'hunting'  in  the  'shadows'  cannot  destroy  an  evil  of  the  mind,  and  hatred  within  the  heart.  Rather  than  focusing  upon  effect,  we  should  consider  the  cause,  because  terrorism  does  not  begin  with  bombs.  Why  not  try  a  foreign  policy  of  compassion,  it  can  only  enhance  our  democracy,  and  share  our  freedom.  |||    I  agree  with  Frederick  Forsyth.  We  really  can't  deal  with  terrorism  by  turning  Britain  into  a  fascist  state.  What  we  really  need  is  more  honesty  from  our  security  services  and  our  politicians.  If  they  do  not  have  evidence  to  bring  these  people  to  trial,  there  probably  isn't  any.  Our  security  services,  behave  like  the  detective  who  having  decided  that  a  certain  person  is  guilty,  rakes  over  all  kinds  of  obscure  and  flimsy  evidence  to  try  and  prove  it,  while  the  real  villain  gets  away.  Remember  there  were  no  WMD  in  Iraq.  Just  because  a  person  may  have  made  some  stupid  and  naive  decisions  in  life  does  not  make  them  a  terrorist.  |||    In  this  overly  'politically  correct'  society,  it  is  good  to  see  someone  like  Mr.  Forsyth  speak  out.  Yes,  there  has  been  oppression  by  the  British  government  in  the  past,  and  overstepping  the  mark  in  places  like  Ireland,  but  yes,  we  are  still  a  democracy  where  it  is  rare  to  be  arrested  without  charge/trial  etc.  (apart  from  a  number  of  prisoners  in  Belmarsh  goal,  for  example).This  country  signs  up  to  human  rights,  and  then  pretends  that  they  only  apply  to  the  people  with  nothing  to  fear,  the  innocent  people  (defined  by  whom?).  When  ID  cards  become  mandatory,  the  data  collected  will  not  be  protected  by  the  Data  Protection  Act,  and  will  be  readily  available  to  people  like  GCHQ,  with  no  control  by  the  person  whose  ID  is  being  checked.  |||    The  threat  now  is  new.  You  cannot  compare  the  threats  of  past  years  with  now.  Forsyth  says  3000  died  over  30  years  or  terrorism;  3000  people  died  in  one  morning  in  NY  on  September  11th  2001.  The  threat  today  is  that  terrorists  will  acquire  nuclear  or  biological  technology.  A  Kilo  of  Semtex  will  flatten  a  building,  a  Kilo  of  plutonium  will  flatten  a  city.  You  now  have  a  combination  of  people  who  will  perform  terrorist  acts  with  technology  that  is  rapidly  becoming  accessible.  I  agree,  the  government  is  probably  encouraging  a  degree  of  mass-hysteria  and  talking  up  the  threat;  but  talking-down  the  threat  and  doing  nothing  is  unacceptable  too.  |||    The  problem  with  this  issue  is  not  that  it  isn't  important,  but  the  fact  that  in  general  we  Brits  can  be  so  politically  apathetic  some  times,  that  we  will  just  let  this  go  without  telling  the  government  no.  However,  as  the  nation  that  gave  the  world  the  common  law  and  a  true  sense  of  the  rights  of  individual  liberty  I  hope  this  will  prove  to  be  one  step  too  far.  |||    As  somebody  of  Chinese  origin,  I  can  say  that  this  country  used  to  be  a  good  place  to  migrate  and  start  a  new  life.  Whilst  life  wasn't  perfect,  we  could  make  better  for  ourselves.  Now  we  are  riddled  with  red  tape  and  be  told  what  we  can  or  cannot  do.  We  have  to  be  politically-correct  and  we  are  not  allowed  to  have  beliefs  or  opinions.  We  have  a  Prime  Minister  who  spends  too  much  time  meddling  in  US  politics  and  affairs  which  have  little  to  do  with  the  lives  of  British  Citizens  at  home  or  abroad.  Mr  Forsyth  has  done  a  good  job  in  voicing  his  opinions.  Let's  hope  the  BBC  doesn't  get  gagged  for  letting  people  express  their  views.  The  people  have  the  right  to  know  and  the  BBC's  role  is  to  Inform,  Educate  and  Entertain...  |||    I  agree.  Terrorists  intend  to  spread  fear  but  in  reality  it  is  the  government  which  has  spread  the  fear,  by  its  constant  publicising  of  the  this  invisible  enemy  so  dangerous  that  we  must  allow  them  to  ride  roughshod  over  our  rights  and  liberties.  In  the  end,  the  very  thing  we  seek  to  protect  is  what  we  are  giving  up  in  the  name  of  safety  from  this  invisible  enemy.  The  terrorists  have  already  won.  |||    I  absolutely  agree  with  Frederick  Forsyth.  Yes  we  have  to  defend  ourselves  against  terrorism  but  existing  laws  seem  to  be  more  than  adequate.  The  idea  that  the  ""new  terrorism""  demands  new  powers  is  erroneous.  The  evidence  of  any  real  terrorist  capability  in  the  UK  is  scant.  Ricin,  for  example,  is  a  dangerous  poison  but  it  is  not  a  weapon  of  mass  destruction.  What  is  really  worrying  is  the  enthusiasm  of  Mr  Blair  and  his  government  for  authoritarian  reactions  and  attempts  to  manipulate  the  electorate  through  fear.  |||    If  the  government  has  its  way  with  ID  cards,  tracking  and  so  on  then  totalitarianism  has  won  and  as  such  it  then  matters  little  whether  we  give  in  to  the  terrorists  demands  or  not.  We  will  have  lost  the  precious  freedom  which  Bush  and  Blair  constantly  tells  us  we  have  and  that  they  seek  to  bring  to  others.  |||    I  agree  wholeheartedly  with  Mr  Forsyth.  I  am  shocked  at  the  ease  with  which  this  government  is  prepared  to  wipe  out  a  major  portion  of  the  liberties  that  British  people  have  enjoyed  for  centuries  -  the  right  not  to  be  deprived  of  our  liberty  without  a  trial  in  open  court.  That  goes  right  back  to  Magna  Carta,  and  ordinary  people  have  spilled  their  blood  to  enforce  that  right  against  governments  who  thought  they  ""knew  best"".  |||    When  you  look  at  today's  Britain,  you  realise  George  Orwell  was  only  wrong  about  one  thing:  the  date.  |||    Frederick  Forsyth  puts  it  beautifully.  The  government  is  seeking  to  introduce  a  police  state.  The  new  powers  of  home  internment  without  trial  follow  a  pattern  which  includes  the  introduction  of  surveillance  via  compulsory  ID  cards  and  the  linking  of  data  bases,  together  with  the  un-British  idea  that  we  will  have  to  swear  allegiance  to  the  state  at  the  age  of  18  years.  We  are  sleep-walking  into  this.  Wake  up!  |||    An  interesting  view  but  missing  two  crucial  facts  of  this  new  threat:  1)  If  these  terrorists  acquire  weapons  of  mass  destruction  they  WILL  use  them  without  fear  of  Mutually  Assured  Destruction  that  kept  the  cold  war  in  a  state  of  tense  balance.  These  people  will  use  devastating  force  against  us  without  fear  of  ANY  consequence.  2)  The  terrorists  are  prepared  to  use  suicide  bombers  which  means  they  could  kill  innocent  people  on  the  London  Underground  and  we  could  do  very  little  to  stop  it.  Because  these  terrorists  are  potentially  SO  deadly,  we  have  to  come  up  with  new,  tougher  responses.  It  will  be  a  little  late  in  the  day  when  people  outside  London  wake  up  one  morning  to  find  out  that  London  has  been  nuked.  We  won't  have  much  of  a  society  left  to  debate  !  |||    He's  correct  in  most  of  what  he  says.  Mind  you  he  does  seem  to  have  forgotten  that  disgraceful  internment  policy  in  Northern  Ireland  which  probably  caused  many  idealistic  if  misguided  young  Catholics  to  join  the  IRA.  Administrative  detention  of  Muslims  could  have  a  similar  effect  now.  |||    Surely  we  the  public  would  be  better  protected  if  the  security  services,  rather  than  alerting  a  suspect  terrorist  by  placing  them  under  house  arrest  (and  for  how  long?)They  were  to  place  suspect  terrorist  under  surveillance  and  maybe  acquire  sufficient  evidence  to  prosecute  or  even  better  prevent  a  terrorist  attack.  |||    I  don't  usually  have  much  time  for  Mr  Forsyth's  largely  right  wing  views  but  this  time  he  has  got  it  spot  on.  There  is  no  doubt  that  there  are  terrorist  organisations  who  would  like  to  do  harm  to  the  U.K.  but  it  is  very  doubtful  whether  al-Qaeda  is  a  global  organisation  co-ordinating  this.  The  rise  of  surveillance  cameras,  ID  cards,  the  plan  to  charge  for  road  use  by  tracking  every  vehicle  at  all  times,  this  is  the  stuff  of  nightmares.  Add  to  this  this  new  legislation  which  effectively  means  that  the  protection  of  the  law  will  be  removed  from  anyone  at  the  whim  of  the  Home  Secretary,  and  I  genuinely  wonder  what  sort  of  world  my  two  children  will  inherit.  Where  will  this  end.  As  it  stands  terrorists  do  not  need  to  attack  the  U.K.  it's  government  will  soon  have  it's  people  terrorised  more  that  they  could  very  achieve  with  a  few  bombs.  |||    Mr  Forsyth  has  expressed  exactly  what  my  gut  fears  and  reservations  were  about  this  proposed  legislation,  but  could  not  verbalise.  Thank  you.  |||    Mr  Forsyth  seems  to  forget  that  killings  in  the  Troubles  occurred  on  both  sides  of  the  religious  divide  and  was  carried  out  by  killers  from  both  sides.  He  also  forgets  basic  Human  Rights  were  suspended  then  as  now.  Experienced  Judges  sat  over  some  of  the  greatest  miscarriages  of  justice  during  those  times.  For  very  little  return  and  maximum  alienation.  These  laws  and  the  emphasis  on  the  Islamic  threat  will  just  do  the  same.  |||    Forsyth  is  wrong.  The  nature  of  the  current  threat  is  new.  It  is  no  longer  to  our  armed  forces,  as  the  Soviet  threat  in  the  Eastern  bloc  was.  It  is  to  you  and  I.  The  terrorist  aim  to  kill  indiscriminately.  The  best  comparison  is  therefore  the  blitz,  1941.  At  this  time,  let  us  not  forget,  suspects  (foreign  and  British  were  routinely  rounded  up  and  interned  for  the  duration  of  the  war,  without  any  complaints  from  the  public.  We  must  not  forget  we  are  at  war.  |||    I'd  say  that  that  the  likelihood  of  an  attack  by  a  sleeper  cell  of  fundamentalist  lunatics  against  a  major  UK  target  is  a  ""When""  not  an  ""If""  probability.  I'll  bet  any  money  you  like  that  the  day  after  any  such  attack  Freddie  Forsyth  will  be  saying  that  the  government  didn't  do  enough  to  protect  the  UK.  People  like  Forsyth  can  only  see  one  side  of  any  argument  and  for  him  it  is  the  side  that  is  opposite  New  Labour  and  Tony  Blair.  |||    I  agree  wholeheartedly  with  Mr  Forsyth.  The  very  reason  this  country  has  been  such  a  wonderful  place  to  live,  is  under  attack,  not  from  terrorists,  but  from  this  government.  The  perpetuation  of  the  perceived  terrorist  threat  is  not  because  of  what  the  'alleged'  terrorists  are  doing,  but  from  our  own  government.  I  believe  what  this  government  is  doing,  is,  at  the  very  least,  highly  questionable  and  at  worst,  sinister.  At  what  point  will  they  feel  they  have  enough  control  over  every  single  person  in  the  British  Isles;  when  we  are  all  tagged  and  monitored  constantly?  Our  freedom  is  being  craftily  and  surreptitiously  whittled  away  by  this  government  and  we  are  gaining  nothing.  It  should  be  of  great  concern  to  everyone.  |||    I  am  slightly  older  than  Mr  Forsyth  and  therefore  have  lived  through  the  same  history  as  him.  I  am  against  a  police  state  and  would  not  like  to  think  that  I  lived  in  one.  I  think  that  the  attack  on  Iraq  made  the  international  situation  worse  and  may  have  provoked  further  acts  of  terrorism.  |||    How  true.  There  are  extremely  worrying  parallels  between  Britain  now  and  Germany  during  the  30's.  I  never  thought  it  would  be  so  easy  to  take  over  a  country  from  within.  |||    Mr  Forsyth  has  forgotten  one  key  point;  the  terrorists  who  threaten  Britain  today  are  well  aware  that  Hitler,  Stalin,  and  the  IRA  all  failed.  As  a  result  modern  day  terrorists  are  willing  to  do  things  their  predecessors  did  not.  That  does  not  mean  that  the  civil  liberties  of  modern  Britain  must  be  eroded  to  counter  the  threat;  that  should  always  be  the  absolute  last  resort.  But  to  meet  the  new  threat,  to  defeat  the  sinister  fanaticism  of  today's  terrorists,  we  may  need  to  do  things  a  little  differently.  Let  us  hope  not.  |||    Frederic  Forsythe's  comments  seem  to  me  to  be  a  well-thought-out  analysis  of  why  we  (human  society  as  a  whole,  and  Britain  in  particular)  should  resist  the  temptation  to  over-protect  through  fear.  It  is  this  fear  which  enables  terrorists  to  succeed  in  the  end,  and  terrorists  can  come  in  all  forms,  as  Mr.  Forsythe's  opening  comments  suggest.  |||    I  am  reminded  of  a  quote  attributed  to  Thomas  Jefferson.  ""A  nation  that  limits  freedom  in  the  name  of  security  will  have  neither.""  |||    The  government  are  faced  with  an  incredibly  difficult  task,  and  have  made  a  policy  to  deal  with  it.  It's  all  very  well  criticising  that  policy,  but  if  Mr  Forsythe  can't  draw  on  his  years  of  experience  to  offer  an  alternative,  I  say  'So  what?'  to  his  opinions.  |||    Frederick  Forsyth's  rhetoric  is  absurd  and  his  conclusions  laughable.  He  distorts  reality  to  serve  his  own  prejudice  against  New  Labour.  This  government  seeks  to  balance  protection  of  our  democracy  with  minimum  loss  of  civil  rights.  It  is  Frederick  Forsyth  who  is  the  extremist,  because  he  does  not  appreciate  the  need  for  balance.  |||    I  rarely  find  myself  agreeing  with  My  Forsyth,  but  in  this  instance  I  think  he  is  correct.  The  rule  of  law  must  prevail,  civil  liberties  are  worth  defending.  If  the  government  can  hold  'suspects'  without  charge  or  trial,  what's  next?  |||    I  agree  absolutely.  By  introducing  fascist  type  laws  we  loose  the  moral  high  ground  in  our  fight  against  terror.  Our  democratic  system  is  not  perfect,  but  as  Churchill  points  out  it  is  ""better  than  all  the  others  that  have  been  tried"".  Terrorist  attacks  will  take  place  but  for  many  reasons  we  should  take  that  personal  risk  in  return  for  personal  freedom.  |||    I  do  not  usually  agree  with  Mr.  Forsyth,  but  he  is  spot  on  here.  The  single  biggest  threat  we  face  is  that  of  a  government  dedicated  to  acting  illegally  and  manipulating  international  and  national  law  to  suit  its  own  purpose.  Totalitarianism  always  requires  an  outside  threat,  justifying  a  range  of  extraordinary  powers  leaders  want.  The  British  government  is  a  far  greater  threat  that  and  terrorist  organisation.  |||    Although,  in  principle  I  agree  with  him,  Frederick  Forsyth  fails  to  address  one  key  point-  al-Qaeda  attacks  (though  obviously  there  have  been  none  yet  in  the  UK)  seek  to  kill  the  maximum  number  of  people.  The  IRA  wanted  to  limit  the  death  toll  of  their  attacks  so  as  to  maintain  support  among  the  republican  movement.  |||    Yes,  I  agree  with  Mr.  Forsyth's  views.  I  do  not  believe  the  government's  plans  are  justified.  There  is  over  reaction  to  and  the  negative  influence  of  the  US  President's  interpretation  of  democracy  and  freedom.  He  uses  the  same  arguments  that  were  current  before  the  WWII,  the  Wars  to  ""liberate""  Iraq,  Afghanistan  with  Syria  and  Iran  to  come.  We  are  leaving  a  poor  inheritance  for  the  future  generations.  |||    Mr  Forsyth  is  a  wonderful  writer  and  should  keep  his  fiction  where  it  belongs.  The  British  Government  is  not  going  down  the  road  that  Mr  Forsyth  suggests.  Sadly  comments  such  as  his  will  make  a  lot  of  people  believe  that  they  are  governed  by  people  who  are  fast  becoming  tyrants  instead  of  being  genuinely  committed  to  stopping  tyranny,  even  if  the  method  employed  to  do  that  is  at  the  moment  alien  to  the  British  people  who  have  lived  in  a  democracy  protected  by  Tony  Blair  and  others  of  like  mind  who,  Mr.  Forsyth  seems  to  be  putting  along  side  the  'scruffy  little  Austrian.'  |||    Thomas  Hobbes  would  be  smiling  in  his  grave  at  Labour's  propositions.  Like  New  Labour,  he  called  himself  a  libertarian.  Like  New  Labour,  he  believed  he  was  promoting  the  people's  best  interests.  But  as  Forsythe  criticises  this  government,  Hobbes  has  been  criticised  by  most  subsequent  philosophers  for  arguing  his  way  into  the  hands  of  the  totalitarians.  Simply  put,  he  argued  that  in  favour  of  the  ultimate  liberty  -  the  liberty  to  live  -  man  should  be  prepared  to  surrender  all  other  liberties  to  a  supreme  sovereign,  as  protection  against  his  fellow,  barbaric,  man.  Hobbes  has  been  roundly  condemned  by  posterity,  and  rightly  so.  I  hope  New  Labour  suffers  the  same  treatment.  |||    I  agree  with  Mr  Forsyth's  views.  The  governments  approach  is  totally  against  the  spirit  of  British  democracy.  They  must  not  be  allowed  to  get  away  with  it.  |||    Of  course  Frederick  is  wrong  about  Britain  winning  the  war  against  the  IRA  and  he's  wrong  too  about  the  country  not  becoming  a  tyranny.  Has  he  forgotten  about  shoot  to  kill,  torture,  internment  without  trial,  collusion  with  loyalist  death  squads  etc?  |||    My  background  is  somewhat  similar  to  Freddie's  so  I  am  persuaded  to  agree  with  many  of  his  sentiments.  We  can  have  no  moral  justification  for  imposing  our  system  of  government  on  anyone  while  we  are  systematically  depriving  our  own  citizens  of  basic  individual  and  collective  freedoms.  |||    Whilst  the  principle  of  keeping  potential  terrorists  under  house  arrest  might  seem  superficially  attractive,  it  is,  unfortunately,  also  the  first  step  towards  totalitarianism.  Who  is  to  decide  whom  is  a  suspect?  Why  should  we  believe  them?  Who  can  have  faith  in  the  honesty,  integrity,  and  competence  of  our  intelligence  services  and  politicians  in  light  of  the  events  of  recent  years?  What  is  to  stop  false  denunciations?  What  of  those  falsely  accused  who  will  lose  their  careers?  Who  will  support  their  families?  Will  their  children  still  go  to  school?  It  smacks  to  me  of  the  methods  of  Nazi  Germany,  Stalin's  Russia,  Ceausescu's  Romania  -  the  list  goes  on.  It  looks  as  if  a  new  dark  age  is  coming.  |||    I  see  that  opinion  on  Mr  Forsyth's  remarks  are  divided.  The  problem  I  see  is  that  those  who  support  imprisonment  without  trial  believe  it  will  never  happen  to  them  or  their  family,  only  to  people  they  don't  like  or  are  scared  of.  But  history  has  shown  that  if  you  have  laws  like  that,  they  always  get  abused  by  those  in  power.  After  all,  today  you  may  be  scared  of  the  same  people  as  those  in  power  but  someday  those  in  power  may  be  scared  of  you!  And  that  day,  you'll  be  the  one  imprisoned  without  the  chance  of  justice.  Our  laws  are  such  that  you  cannot  just  be  imprisoned  at  the  whim  of  our  police  forces,  you  have  to  be  shown  to  be  deserving  of  it.  If  we  imprison  people  without  trial  for  an  indeterminate  period,  we  are  no  better  that  those  we  are  fighting.  |||    I  never  thought  it  possible  for  me  to  agree  with  a  single  word  uttered  by  Frederick  Forsyth,  but  I'm  in  wholehearted  agreement  with  him  on  this  one.  We,  as  a  nation  are  in  grave  danger  of  being  duped  by  pro  US  propaganda,  which  of  course  also  means  we'll  inherit  most,  if  not  all  of  their  total  paranoia,  and  allow  our  governments,  of  any  political  persuasion  incidentally,  to  gradually,  and  insidiously,  impose  a  police  state  by  well  tried  &  tested  back  door  methods.  I  grieve  for  the  future  of  my  children,  it's  no  wonder  they're  adamant  they  don't  ever  want  any  of  their  own.  |||    This  government,  with  much  fanfare,  signs  us  up  to  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  but  now  wants  to  introduce  indefinite  house  arrest  without  trial.  This  puts  it  on  a  par  with  the  government  of  Burma.  |||    Like  many  of  your  respondents,  I  wouldn't  usually  think  of  Mr  Forsyth  as  someone  whose  views  I  share,  but  in  the  instance  of  opposing  Charles  Clark's  proposals  for  house  arrest,  I  agree  wholeheartedly  with  Mr  Forsyth/  |||    I  agree  with  Mr  Forsyth.  Just  look  at  the  facts  -  our  government  (along  with  the  US)  invaded  another  sovereign  country  (Iraq)  by  selecting  intelligence  that  backed  it's  case  based  on  fear.  The  facts  turned  out  to  be  very  different.  If  individuals  are  treated  in  the  same  distorted  way,  then  we've  done  ourselves  more  damage  than  any  terrorist  organisation  could  with  bombs.  We  become  animals  too.  |||    I  agree  in  many  ways  with  what  Mr  Forsyth  has  said  -  if  we  are  to  be  respected  and  have  influence  within  the  world  we  must  be  seen  to  be  walking  the  walk  as  well  as  talking  the  talk  -  how  can  we  accuse  countries  such  as  Zimbabwe  and  Burma  of  human  rights  abuses  when  we  are  locking  up  people  who  may  be  totally  innocent,  it  is  hypocrisy  of  the  highest  order.  Mr  Forsyth  links  ""Islamic  fundamentalism""  to  the  new  ""threat"".  However  it  appears  that  he  has  misunderstood  the  term  ""Islamic  fundamentalism"".  It  should  be  pointed  out  that  a  Muslim  who  adheres  to  the  true  fundamentals  of  the  Qur'aan  and  the  teachings  of  the  last  Prophet  Muhammad  is  an  Islamic  Fundamentalist.  This  person  does  not  commit  suicide  in  any  shape  or  form,  nor  does  she/he  kill  innocent  women,  men  and  children.  This  person  is  self-reflective  and  constantly  tries  to  better  her/his  actions  by  being  good  to  others.  The  people  who  Mr  Forsyth  labels  the  new  ""threat""  are  those  who  do  not  follow  the  correct  teachings  of  Islam.  They  have  arrived  at  their  own  interpretations  and  assumptions  with  regards  their  actions.  On  top  of  that,  they  claim  to  be  following  Islam  in  its  true  form!  |||    I  accept  that  the  intentions  of  these  policies  are  to  make  Britain  a  safer  place  but  I  cannot  think  of  a  single  example  from  history  where  doing  this  sort  of  thing  has  ever  made  any  difference  -  in  Northern  Ireland  internment  certainly  didn't  achieve  anything  -  the  bombings  didn't  stop,  and  it  could  be  argued  that  all  it  achieved  was  to  just  supply  the  IRA  with  yet  more  angry  and  resentful  republicans  willing  to  take  up  arms  against  the  British.  |||    Being  eight  years  older  than  Frederick  Forsyth  and  a  survivor  of  the  Blitz  on  London,  it  is  easy  to  agree  with  him,  he  is  absolutely  spot  on.  During  the  IRA  bombings  there  were  massive  explosions  in  Canary  Wharf,  to  the  right  of  where  I  write  this,  and  also  to  the  left  in  the  City  of  London.  Notwithstanding  these  and  the  attempted  and  nearly  successful  assassination  attempts  on  Prime  Minister  Thatcher  in  Brighton  and  on  later  occupants  of  10  Downing  Street,  there  was  no  retaliatory  blitz  on  Belfast  or  Dublin  as  there  has  been  on  Afghanistan  and  Iraq.  Even  when  England  was  in  true  peril  in  1940  apart  from  some  detentions  there  were  no  wholesale  derogation  of  habeas  corpus  and  the  like.  We  have  to  see  off  these  latest  attempts  on  our  liberties  including  ID  cards,  which  Winston  Churchill  decided  had  to  go  since,  he  said,  the  average  Bobby  on  the  beat  could  not  be  relied  on  to  not  be  tempted  to  take  undue  advantage  against  the  citizen  going  about  their  lawful  activities  (incidentally  I  can  still  remember  my  old  ID  card  number).  Hence  it  is  clear  that  the  far  too  great  police  state  powers  set  for  the  statute  books  have  to  be  resisted  and  neutered.  |||    What  can  I  add  to  Mr.  Forsyth's  eloquently  put  arguments...  except  applause!  Well  done  that  man  for  standing  up  and  being  counted  in  the  ""war  against  tyranny""."

Its  main  drug,  desmoteplase,  is  based  on  a  protein  in  the  bat's  saliva.  The  protein  stops  blood  from  clotting  -  which  helps  the  bat  to  drink  from  its  victims,  but  could  also  be  used  to  help  stroke  sufferers.  The  company's  shares  go  on  sale  later  this  week,  and  are  scheduled  to  start  trading  on  the  Frankfurt  Stock  Exchange  on  10  February.  If  the  final  price  is  at  the  top  of  the  range,  the  company  could  be  valued  at  as  much  as  200m  euros.  The  money  raised  will  be  spent  largely  on  developing  the  company's  other  drugs,  since  desmoteplase  has  already  been  licensed  to  one  manufacturer,  Forest  Laboratories."

No  reason  was  given  for  Roberts'  departure.  The  role  will  be  played  by  understudy  Joey  Collins  until  Slater  joins  the  show.

2	"Campbell:  E-mail  row  'silly  fuss'  |||    Ex-No  10  media  chief  Alastair  Campbell  is  at  the  centre  of  a  new  political  row  over  an  e-mail  containing  a  four-letter  outburst  aimed  at  BBC  journalists.  |||    Mr  Campbell  sent  the  missive  by  mistake  to  BBC2's  Newsnight  after  it  sought  to  question  his  role  in  Labour's  controversial  poster  campaign.  He  later  contacted  the  show  saying  the  original  e-mail  had  been  sent  in  error  and  that  it  was  all  a  ""silly  fuss"".  Mr  Campbell  has  recently  re-joined  Labour's  election  campaign.  |||    The  e-mail  was  revealed  the  day  after  Peter  Mandelson,  former  Labour  minister  and  now  a  European  Commissioner,  warned  the  BBC  to  steer  away  from  ""demonising""  Mr  Campbell.  Mr  Campbell  messaged  Newsnight  after  the  programme  investigated  claims  that  Labour's  advertising  agency  TBWA  was  blaming  him  for  controversy  over  its  campaign  posters.  The  images,  including  one  of  flying  pigs  and  another  of  what  critics  claim  depicted  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  as  Fagin,  prompted  accusations  of  anti-Semitism,  claims  denied  by  Labour.  |||    Mr  Campbell's  e-mail,  which  was  apparently  intended  for  a  party  official,  suggested  they  should  get  Trevor  Beattie,  TBWA's  boss,  to  issue  a  statement.  In  it,  he  said:  ""Just  spoke  to  trev.  think  tbwa  shd  give  statement  to  newsnight  saying  party  and  agency  work  together  well  and  nobody  here  has  spoken  to  standard.  Posters  done  by  by  tbwa  according  to  political  brief.  Now  fuck  off  and  cover  something  important  you  twats!""  The  e-mail  was  sent  by  mistake  to  Newsnight  journalist  Andrew  McFadyen.  Realising  his  error,  Mr  Campbell  then  e-mailed  Mr  McFadyen  pointing  out  the  mistake,  but  suggesting  presenter  Jeremy  Paxman  would  have  seen  the  funny  side.  |||    He  said:  ""Not  very  good  at  this  e-mail  Blackberry  malarkey.  Just  looked  at  log  of  sent  messages,  have  realised  e-mail  meant  for  colleagues  at  TBWA  has  gone  to  you.  For  the  record,  first  three  sentences  of  email  spot  on.  No  row  between  me  and  trevor.  ""Posters  done  by  them  according  to  our  brief.  I  dreamt  up  flying  pigs.  Pigs  not  great  but  okay  in  the  circs  of  Tories  promising  tax  cuts  and  spending  rises  with  the  same  money.  TBWA  made  production.  ""Campbell  swears  shock.  Final  sentence  of  earlier  e-mail  probably  a  bit  colourful  and  personal  considering  we  have  never  actually  met  but  I'm  sure  you  share  the  same  sense  of  humour  as  your  star  presenter  Mr  P.  ""Never  known  such  a  silly  fuss  since  the  last  silly  fuss  but  there  we  go.  Must  look  forward  not  back.""  |||    Later  the  prime  minister's  spokesman  was  asked  by  journalists  about  his  view  on  Mr  Campbell's  use  of  abusive  language.  The  spokesman  said:  ""The  person  you  are  referring  to  is  capable  of  speaking  for  himself  and  he  no  longer  works  in  government.""  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw  said  he  had  always  had  ""very  good  and  polite  relations""  with  Mr  Campbell,  who  he  described  as  ""very  talented"".  But  on  the  former  spin  doctor's  use  of  language,  Mr  Straw  said:  ""I  do  know  the  odd  journalist  who  has  occasionally  used  the  odd  word  that  would  probably  be  inappropriate  in  some  circumstances.  Maybe  I  mix  with  the  wrong  kind  of  journalists.""  Liam  Fox,  Tory  co-chairman,  said  the  return  of  Mr  Campbell  was  a  sign  of  new  ""sinister  and  underhand  tactics""  by  Labour." 

1	"De  Niro  completes  box  office  coup  |||    Robert  De  Niro  has  completed  a  transatlantic  box  office  double  by  topping  the  UK  and  US  film  charts  with  two  different  films  at  the  same  time.  |||    Comedy  sequel  Meet  the  Fockers,  in  which  he  stars  with  Ben  Stiller,  Dustin  Hoffman  and  Barbra  Streisand,  shot  to  the  top  of  the  UK  chart  at  the  weekend.  It  took  £7.2m  in  three  days  -  eight  times  more  than  the  number  two,  Closer.  Assault  on  Precinct  13  was  in  third.  At  the  same  time,  US  audiences  were  won  over  by  his  new  thriller  Hide  and  Seek.  In  Meet  the  Fockers,  he  picks  up  the  role  of  an  uptight  father  and  ex-CIA  agent  from  2000  hit  comedy,  Meet  the  Parents.  |||    It  is  a  big  leap  to  his  role  in  Hide  and  Seek,  a  supernatural  horror  in  which  he  plays  a  widower  whose  daughter's  imaginary  friend  turns  nasty.  In  the  UK  box  office  chart,  Meet  the  Fockers  pushed  Closer  off  the  top  spot  while  police  action  movie  Assault  On  Precinct  13,  starring  rapper  Ja  Rule,  made  £750,000  in  its  first  weekend.  London  Underground  thriller  Creep  was  another  new  entry  at  six  while  quirky  comedy  Sideways,  which  got  five  Oscar  nominations  last  week,  entered  in  eighth  place.  The  Oscar  nominations  do  not  seem  to  have  had  an  impact  on  fans'  choices  at  cinemas.  Leading  contenders  The  Aviator,  Million  Dollar  Baby  and  Ray  all  suffered  substantial  drops  in  takings  compared  with  the  previous  weekend."

Continental  also  said  that,  if  it  did  not  make  any  cuts,  it  expects  to  lose  ""hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars""  in  2005  in  current  market  conditions.  Failure  to  make  cutbacks  may  also  push  it  to  reduce  its  fleet,  the  group  said.

""Without  the  reduction  in  wage  and  benefit  costs  and  a  reasonable  prospect  of  future  profitability,  we  believe  that  our  ability  to  raise  additional  money  through  financings  would  be  uncertain,""  Continental  said  in  its  filing  to  the  US  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC).  |||    Airlines  have  faced  tough  conditions  in  recent  years,  amid  terrorism  fears  since  the  11  September  World  Trade  Centre  attack  in  2001.  But  despite  passengers  returning  to  the  skies,  record-high  fuel  costs  and  fare  wars  prompted  by  competition  from  low  cost  carriers  have  taken  their  toll.  Houston-based  Continental  now  has  debt  and  pension  payments  of  nearly  $984m  which  it  must  pay  off  this  year.  The  company  has  been  working  to  streamline  its  operations  -  and  has  managed  to  save  $1.1bn  in  costs  without  cutting  jobs.  Two  weeks'  ago  the  group  also  announced  it  would  be  able  to  shave  a  further  $48m  a  year  from  its  costs  with  changes  to  wage  and  benefits  for  most  of  its  US-based  management  and  clerical  staff." 

1	"Lasting  influence  of  legend  Charles  |||    Ray  Charles,  who  has  won  a  string  of  posthumous  Grammy  Awards,  belonged  to  a  pioneering  generation  of  artists  that  had  a  huge  influence  on  the  course  of  rock  and  pop  music.  |||    His  sound  encompassed  so  many  styles  -  blues,  gospel,  jazz,  rock  'n'  roll,  even  country  -  and  had  a  real  impact  on  the  nascent  UK  beat  and  R&B  scenes.  |||    Compared  in  stature  to  Elvis  Presley  by  some  commentators,  Charles'  songs  cast  their  spell  on  such  1960s  stalwarts  as  Joe  Cocker,  Steve  Winwood,  Eric  Burdon  and  Van  Morrison.  His  influence  has  extended  to  contemporary  artists  such  as  Norah  Jones,  with  whom  he  recently  recorded  a  duet.  If  James  Brown  was  the  godfather  of  soul,  then  Ray  Charles  was  indisputably  one  of  its  founding  fathers.  Along  with  Sam  Cooke,  he  was  instrumental  in  bringing  together  the  gospel  fervour  of  the  deep  south  Baptist  church  with  the  ""devil's""  music  of  R&B  to  pave  the  way  for  a  new  generation  of  soul  artists.  |||    Without  Charles,  it  is  hard  to  imagine  the  tear-stained  Atlantic  R&B  sound  of  Aretha  Franklin,  Otis  Redding  or  Wilson  Pickett.  He  was  also  a  talented  jazz  composer,  arranger  and  band  leader,  playing  at  the  Newport  Jazz  Festival  and  Carnegie  Hall  and  recording  with  noted  jazz  musicians  such  as  Milt  Jackson  and  David  ""Fathead""  Newman.  Unfortunately,  he  also  shared  another  trait  common  among  many  jazz  artists  of  the  era  -  that  of  heroin  addiction,  which  led  to  him  being  arrested  in  1965.  His  string  of  1950s  Atlantic  R&B  successes  included  songs  that  would  be  covered  by  the  first-generation  rock  'n'  roll  greats,  including  I've  Got  A  Woman  (Roy  Orbison,  Elvis  Presley)  and  Hallelujah,  I  Love  Her  So  (Eddie  Cochran).  After  the  exuberance  of  his  1959  signature  song  What'd  I  Say,  Charles  turned  towards  a  more  pop-oriented  style,  recording  Hoagy  Carmichael's  sentimental  string  ballad  Georgia  On  My  Mind,  and  the  upbeat  Hit  The  Road  Jack.  |||    He  also  won  acclaim  in  the  country  arena  with  his  interpretations  of  Hank  Williams  standards  such  as  Your  Cheating  Heart  and  You  Win  Again.  More  than  40  years  after  its  release,  his  1962  ABC  album  Modern  Sounds  in  Country  and  Western  Music  is  still  regarded  as  a  classic.  His  version  of  Don  Gibson's  I  Can't  Stop  Loving  You  topped  the  pop  and  R&B  charts  in  the  US.  In  1972,  he  made  a  rare  foray  into  protest  songs  with  his  album  A  Message  from  the  People.  |||    On  it,  he  took  a  stand  on  poverty  and  civil  rights  -  echoing  similar  recordings  of  the  era  from  progeny  such  as  Stevie  Wonder,  James  Brown,  Curtis  Mayfield  and  Marvin  Gaye.  More  than  20  years  later,  he  would  embrace  contemporary  production  with  his  1993  album  My  World,  which  featured  hip-hop  beats  -  although  Charles  claimed  at  the  time  not  to  know  what  hip-hop  was.  Among  the  tributes  that  poured  in  from  all  sections  of  the  music  world  when  Charles  died  aged  73  in  June  2004  was  one  from  his  friend,  the  producer  Quincy  Jones,  who  described  him  as  a  ""brother  in  every  sense  of  the  word"".  ""There  will  never  be  another  musician  who  did  as  much  to  break  down  the  perceived  walls  of  musical  genres  as  much  as  Ray  Charles  did,""  he  said.  Former  Manfred  Mann  singer  Paul  Jones,  who  sang  on  1960s  hits  such  as  Come  Tomorrow  and  Sha  La  La,  said  Charles  was  one  of  his  heroes.  ""I'm  quite  sure  my  own  writing  was  influenced  by  him,""  he  told  BBC  News  Online.  ""I  would  put  money  on  the  proposition  that  Ray  Charles  will  have  an  influence  on  music  forever."""

Meanwhile  the  number  of  sales  dropped  32%  to  an  average  of  22  per  surveyor.  The  amount  of  unsold  properties  on  their  books  rose  for  the  sixth  month  in  a  row  to  an  average  of  67  properties.  ""The  slowdown  occurring  in  the  market  has  given  buyers  more  power  to  negotiate,  but  this  time  of  year  is  traditionally  a  quiet  one,""  RICS  housing  spokesman  Ian  Perry  said.  ""The  decision  by  the  Bank  of  England  not  to  increase  interest  rates  further  and  the  healthy  economy  is  allowing  confidence  to  consolidate.""  |||    The  figures  support  recent  data  from  the  government  and  other  bodies  which  all  point  to  a  slowdown  in  the  housing  market.  On  Monday,  the  Council  of  Mortgage  Lenders,  British  Bankers  Association  and  Building  Societies  Association  all  said  mortgage  lending  was  slowing.  The  figures  were  published  as  another  survey  by  property  website  Rightmove  said  the  average  asking  price  of  a  home  fell  by  more  than  £600  from  £190,329  in  November  to  £189,733  in  December.  Around  the  UK,  the  Midlands  and  South  saw  the  biggest  price  falls,  while  London  prices  fell  but  at  less  than  the  national  rate.  In  Scotland,  where  prices  have  remained  on  an  upward  path,  increases  were  more  ""moderate"",  RICS  added.  But  the  news  failed  to  dent  confidence  that  sales  will  recover  in  future,  with  surveyors  at  their  most  optimistic  in  a  year  -  as  new  purchase  inquiries  stabilised  despite  holding  at  lower  levels.  ""Sales  usually  pick  up  in  the  New  Year  and  I  am  confident  this  year  will  be  no  exception,""  Mr  Perry  added.  Looking  ahead,  the  group  is  anticipating  a  quiet  start  to  2005  with  the  market  picking  up  in  the  second  half  -  prompting  a  3%  rise  in  prices  over  the  coming  12  months."

Santa  Monica-based  Activison  is  said  to  be  one  firm  on  its  takeover  list.  Video  games  are  ""big  business"",  the  paper  quoted  Mr  Chernin  as  saying.  We  ""would  like  to  get  into  it"".  |||    The  success  of  products  such  as  Sony's  Playstation,  Microsoft's  X-Box  and  Nintendo's  Game  Cube  have  boosted  demand  for  video  games.  |||    The  days  of  arcade  classics  such  as  Space  Invaders,  Pac-Man  and  Donkey  Kong  are  long  gone.  Today,  games  often  have  budgets  big  enough  for  feature  films  and  look  to  give  gamers  as  real  an  experience  as  possible.  And  with  their  price  tags  reflecting  the  heavy  investment  by  development  companies,  video  games  are  proving  almost  as  profitable  as  they  are  fun.  Mr  Chernin,  however,  told  the  FT  that  News  Corp  was  finding  it  difficult  to  identify  a  suitable  target.  ""We  are  struggling  with  the  gap  between  companies  like  Electronic  Arts,  which  comes  with  a  high  price  tag,  and  the  next  tier  of  companies,""  he  explained  during  a  conference  in  Phoenix,  Arizona.

0	"US  seeks  new  $280bn  smoker  ruling  |||    The  US  Justice  Department  is  to  try  to  overturn  a  court  ruling  that  threw  out  its  claim  for  $280bn  (£149bn)  in  damages  from  tobacco  firms.  |||    Earlier  this  month,  a  three-judge  appeal  court  panel  rejected  the  claim  -  filed  in  1999  by  the  administration  of  Bill  Clinton  -  in  a  2-1  decision.  Government  lawyers  said  they  would  ask  the  full  US  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  District  of  Columbia  to  hear  the  case.  The  court  room  battle  is  seen  as  key  in  government  attempts  to  fight  smoking.  ""It's  pretty  clear  that  they've  suffered  a  severe  setback,""  said  Anthony  Sebok,  a  professor  at  Brooklyn  Law  School,  adding  that  the  appeal  was  what  the  government  ""would  be  expected  to  ask  for"".  |||    Prosecutors  had  argued  that  tobacco  firms  lied  about  the  dangers  of  smoking,  ignored  research  that  highlighted  problems,  looked  to  increase  addiction  by  manipulating  nicotine  levels  and  targeted  the  young  with  their  adverts.  Among  the  firms  accused  were  Altria  Group,  RJ  Reynolds  Tobacco,  Lorillard  Tobacco,  Liggett  Group  and  Brown  and  Williamson.  Prosecutors  went  after  the  companies  using  legislation  put  in  place  to  fight  organised  crime,  and  accused  the  firms  of  conspiring  and  running  ""Racketeer  Influenced  and  Corrupt  Organisations"".  The  tobacco  companies  denied  the  charges,  saying  that  they  never  illegally  conspired  to  promote  smoking  and  fool  the  public.  They  also  said  that  they  have  met  many  of  the  government's  demands  laid  out  in  a  landmark  $206bn  settlement  hammered  out  in  1998  with  46  states.  A  three-judge  panel  agreed  with  the  companies,  finding  that  the  case  could  not  be  brought  under  federal  anti-racketeering  laws.  |||    Central  to  the  government's  case  was  a  meeting  in  the  Plaza  Hotel,  New  York,  on  15  December,  1953.  Prosecutors  contend  that  executives  from  the  major  tobacco  firms  met  and  agreed  to  present  a  unified  strategy  denying  the  harmful  effects  of  smoking.  Despite  denying  for  decades  that  smoking  could  be  linked  to  illness,  the  companies  have  modified  their  stances  in  recent  years.  Altria's  Philip  Morris  now  accepts  that  nicotine  is  harmful,  and  the  company's  main  lawyer  William  Ohlemeyer  told  the  BBC  last  year  that  earlier  statements  may  have  been  wrong  but  they  were  not  dishonest.  Government  lawyers  have  until  21  March  to  file  their  appeal."

More  than  two  thirds  of  its  28,000  staff  have  now  accepted  wage  cuts.  But  talks  are  still  continuing  with  a  union  representing  mechanics,  baggage  handlers  and  cleaners,  which  has  so  far  failed  to  negotiate  a  new  contract.  The  seventh  largest  carrier  in  the  US  sought  bankruptcy  protection  for  a  second  time  in  two  years  last  September.  It  had  been  one  of  the  quickest  to  deal  with  difficulties  faced  by  the  aviation  industry  after  the  9/11  attacks  in  2001.  But  it  emerged  from  Chapter  11  bankruptcy  in  March  2003  to  face  competition  from  low-cost  carriers  and  higher  fuel  costs.

The  original  size  of  Libya's  funds  was  $400m,  the  central  bank  told  Reuters.  However,  the  withdrawal  did  not  mean  that  Libya  had  cut  its  ties  with  the  US,  he  added.  |||    ""We  are  in  the  process  of  opening  accounts  in  banks  in  the  United  States,""  the  central  bank's  vice  president  Farhat  Omar  Ben  Gadaravice  said.  The  previously  frozen  assets  had  been  invested  in  various  countries  and  are  believed  to  have  included  equity  holdings  in  banks.  The  US  ban  on  trade  and  economic  activity  with  Tripoli  -  imposed  by  then  president  Ronald  Regan  in  1986  after  a  series  of  what  the  US  deemed  terrorist  acts,  including  the  1988  Lockerbie  air  crash  -  was  suspended  in  April.  Bankers  from  the  two  country's  had  been  working  on  how  to  unfreeze  Libya's  assets."

The  High  Street  retailer  said  it  now  expected  to  report  annual  profits  of  between  £415m  and  £425m  ($779m-798m).  Next's  shares  fell  more  than  3%  following  the  release  of  the  trading  statement.  |||    Next  chief  executive  Simon  Wolfson  admitted  that  festive  sales  were  ""below  where  we  would  expect  a  normal  Christmas  to  be"",  but  said  sales  should  still  top  analyst  expectations.  |||    Among  areas  where  Next  could  have  done  better,  Mr  Wolfson  said  menswear  ranges  were  ""a  little  bit  too  similar  to  the  previous  year"".  Mr  Wolfson  also  said  that  disappointing  pre-Christmas  sales  were  ""more  to  do  with  the  fact  that  we  went  in  with  too  much  stock  rather  than  (the  fact  that)  demand  wasn't  there  for  the  stock"".  Next's  like-for-like  store  sales  in  the  five  months  from  3  August  to  24  December  were  up  2.9%  on  a  year  earlier.

0	"UK  economy  ends  year  with  spurt  |||    The  UK  economy  grew  by  an  estimated  3.1%  in  2004  after  accelerating  in  the  last  quarter  of  the  year,  says  the  Office  for  National  Statistics  (ONS).  |||    The  figure  is  in  line  with  Treasury  and  Bank  of  England  forecasts.  The  ONS  says  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  rose  by  a  strong  0.7%  in  the  three  months  to  31  December,  compared  with  0.5%  in  the  previous  quarter.  The  rise  came  despite  a  further  decline  in  production  output  and  the  worst  Christmas  for  retailers  in  decades.  |||    The  annual  figure  marked  out  the  best  year  since  2000,  and  was  also  well  ahead  of  the  2.2%  recorded  in  2003.  Growth  in  the  final  three  months  of  2004  marked  the  50th  consecutive  quarter  of  expansion.  ""On  the  basis  of  the  latest  information  the  UK  has  entered  2005  on  course  to  continue  its  record  period  of  growth,""  said  Paul  Boateng,  chief  secretary  to  the  Treasury  in  a  statement.  |||    The  ONS  said  the  services  sector,  which  accounts  for  nearly  three-quarters  of  the  UK  economy,  grew  1.0%  in  the  quarter.  The  strong  services  figure  was  welcomed  by  analysts,  given  lacklustre  retail  sales  in  December  and  across  the  Christmas  holiday  period.  ""The  fact  that  other  services  components  are  doing  so  well  suggests  to  me  that  we  are  back  to  trend  (growth)  and  I  am  not  particularly  concerned  about  any  further  slowdown,""  said  Ross  Walker,  UK  economist  at  RBS  Financial  Markets.  |||    However,  output  in  the  production  sector  contracted  0.5%,  the  second  quarterly  fall  in  row  and  a  state  of  affairs  that  some  economists  classify  as  a  recession.  However  the  ONS  would  not  comment  on  the  definition  of  a  recession  and  whether  the  manufacturing  recovery  was  over.  But  Steve  Radley,  chief  economist  at  the  manufacturers'  organisation  EEF,  said:  ""These  figures  remain  at  odds  with  what  is  actually  happening  on  the  ground.  ""Whilst  companies  may  be  experiencing  tougher  conditions  this  year,  'recession'  is  not  a  word  that  manufacturers  would  currently  recognise.""  The  ONS  said  a  sharp  fall  in  mining  and  quarrying,  which  was  driven  by  oil  and  gas  extraction,  was  primarily  responsible  for  the  overall  contraction  in  manufacturing  production  figures.  |||    Simon  Rubinsohn,  chief  economist  at  Gerrard,  said:  ""This  outturn  (of  0.7%)  was  well  ahead  of  the  market  expectations  and  cast  doubt  on  the  scare  stories  doing  the  rounds  surrounding  the  current  state  of  the  UK  economy.""  And  he  said  the  GDP  figures  may  help  to  ""push  interest  rate  expectations  a  little  higher  along  the  curve"".  ""The  suggestion  from  the  money  markets  is  that  the  next  move  is  now  more  likely  to  be  in  an  upward  rather  than  a  downward  direction.  This  is  consistent  with  our  own  thinking,""  said  Mr  Rubinsohn.  The  Bank  of  England's  nine-strong  rate-setting  committee  voted  unanimously  earlier  this  month  to  keep  interest  rates  steady  at  4.75%,  minutes  of  the  meeting  showed  on  Wednesday."

2	"Iraqis  win  death  test  case  probe  |||    The  family  of  an  Iraqi  civilian  allegedly  killed  by  UK  troops  have  won  a  challenge  against  the  government's  refusal  to  order  a  full  inquiry.  |||    The  High  Court  ruled  on  Tuesday  that  Baha  Mousa's  death  in  British  custody  in  Iraq  fell  within  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights.  And  the  judges  paved  the  way  for  an  independent  inquiry  by  saying  previous  investigations  were  inadequate.  But  judicial  reviews  into  five  other  deaths  in  southern  Iraq  were  ruled  out.  Their  families  will  be  appealing  against  the  judgement.  |||    The  families'  solicitor  Phil  Shiner  described  it  as  ""a  historic  day  for  human  rights  and  the  rule  of  law  in  the  UK"".  Father-of-two  Mr  Mousa,  28,  a  hotel  receptionist,  was  arrested  with  eight  men  seized  at  a  hotel  in  Basra  in  September  2003.  He  was  allegedly  beaten  to  death  while  in  the  custody  of  the  Queen's  Lancashire  Regiment.  The  Iraqi  families'  lawyer  argued  that  failing  to  adequately  investigate  the  death  breached  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights.  |||    Ministry  of  Defence  lawyers  argued  the  UK-controlled  area  of  southern  Iraq  was  outside  European  jurisdiction.  But  Lord  Justice  Rix  and  Mr  Justice  Forbes  ruled  that  UK  jurisdiction  could  extend  to  a  UK-run  prison,  but  did  not  apply  ""to  the  total  territory  of  another  state"".  They  said  as  Mr  Mousa  was  in  custody  when  he  died,  his  case  came  within  the  UK's  jurisdiction.  The  other  five  Iraqis  did  not  die  in  custody,  so  their  cases  had  to  fail,  they  said.  |||    And  it  was  difficult  to  say  that  the  investigation  which  had  already  occurred  ""has  been  timely,  open  or  effective"",  the  judges  said.  After  the  ruling  Carla  Ferstman,  legal  director  of  the  human  rights  organisation  Redress,  said:  ""It  is  not  enough  for  the  military  to  investigate  behind  closed  doors.  ""There  must  be  an  effective  public  investigation  by  an  independent  official  body.  Only  such  an  investigation  could  reveal  what  really  happened  and  who  might  be  responsible.""  Other  allegations  involving  British  soldiers  included  the  shooting  of  an  Iraqi  police  commissioner  and  the  shooting  of  four  Iraqi  civilians  in  May  2003.  Both  sides  were  granted  permission  to  appeal.  |||    Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair's  official  spokesman  said:  ""Obviously  we  will  need  to  study  this  detailed  judgment.  I  would  point  out,  however,  that  a  separate  criminal  case  is  currently  being  considered  by  the  army  prosecuting  authority.  ""I  can't  say  anything  further  for  obvious  reasons.  The  MoD  are  considering  whether  to  appeal.""  But  former  British  Commander  Colonel  Bob  Stewart  said  :  ""Anyone  at  the  top  [of  the  military]  will  be  saddened  by  the  verdict  that  has  taken  place  but  will  say:  'If  there's  a  case  to  answer,  let's  have  it  out.  Because  we  don't  want  people  thinking  that  British  soldiers  beat  up  civilians  and  get  away  with  it',""  he  said.  ""The  Ministry  of  Defence  does  everything  in  its  power  to  try  to  prove  we  act  ethically  and  properly  under  the  rules  of  war."""

They  have  until  midnight  on  16  December  and  an  IAAF  spokesman  said:  ""We're  sure  their  responses  are  on  their  way.""  If  they  do  not  respond  or  their  explanations  are  rejected,  they  will  be  provisionally  banned  from  competition.  They  will  then  face  a  hearing  in  front  of  the  Greek  Federation,  which  will  ultimately  determine  their  fate.  Their  former  coach  Christos  Tzekos  has  also  been  charged  with  distributing  banned  substances.  Under  IAAF  rules,  the  athletes  could  receive  a  maximum  one-year  suspension.  Kenteris  and  Thanou  already  face  a  criminal  trial  after  being  charged  with  avoiding  a  drug  test  on  the  eve  of  the  Athens  Olympics  and  then  faking  a  motorcyle  crash.  |||    No  date  for  the  trial  has  yet  been  set  and  again  Tzekos  is  also  facing  charges.  The  IAAF  issued  an  official  warning  to  the  trio  last  year  after  they  were  discovered  training  in  Qatar  rather  than  in  Crete,  where  they  had  said  they  would  be.  All  athletes  must  inform  their  national  federations  where  they  are  at  all  times,  so  they  can  be  available  for  out-of-competition  drugs  tests.  But  Kenteris  and  Thanou  then  went  on  to  skip  tests  in  Tel  Aviv  and  Chicago,  when  they  decided  to  fly  back  to  Greece  early.  Then  just  before  the  Olympics,  the  pair  dramatically  missed  another  test  in  Athens  and  withdrew  from  the  Games."

LVMH  said  the  French  designer's  haute  couture  and  ready-to-wear  labels  had  been  purchased  by  the  Falic  Group  for  an  unspecified  sum.  The  Falic  Group  bought  two  cosmetics  labels  from  LVMH  in  2003.  The  sale  of  the  Lacroix  label  comes  as  many  fashion  houses  are  struggling  to  make  money  from  their  expensive  haute  couture  ranges.  The  Florida-based  Falic  group,  which  also  runs  a  chain  of  90  duty  free  stores  in  the  US,  said  it  planned  to  expand  the  brand  by  opening  new  stores.  Mr  Lacroix  said  he  planned  to  stay  at  the  label  he  founded  in  1987  although  exact  details  are  still  to  be  confirmed."

His  wife  Sharon,  who  also  appears  in  the  popular  MTV  show  based  on  the  Osbournes'  family  life,  agreed.  ""Now  everybody's  doing  reality  shows.  He's  done  it,  he's  been  there,  he's  got  to  do  something  else,""  she  said.  |||    Ozzy  Osbourne  said  he  had  had  enough  of  the  work  involved  in  making  the  series.  ""When  you  watch  a  25-minute  episode,  I've  been  filming  all  day,""  he  said.  Sharon  Osbourne  is  currently  appearing  as  a  judge  and  mentor  in  ITV1  talent  show  The  X-Factor  alongside  Simon  Cowell  and  Louis  Walsh.  |||    Earlier  this  year  she  topped  a  poll  of  the  most  important  people  in  rock,  for  her  part  in  guiding  the  career  of  husband  Ozzy  and  her  family.  She  was  the  driving  force  behind  The  Osbournes,  which  ran  for  three  series,  earning  the  family  a  reported  $85m  (£46m).  The  renewed  popularity  for  Ozzy  has  seen  sales  of  his  merchandise  hit  the  $50m  (£27.2m)  mark,  a  record  for  a  heavy  metal  artist.  Sales  of  T-shirts,  accessories  and  action  figures  have  rocketed  since  The  Osbournes  hit  screens.  At  its  peak,  The  Osbournes  had  a  regular  audience  of  eight  million,  with  America's  TV  Guide  magazine  describing  the  series  as  ""a  cross  between  The  Simpsons  and  This  Is  Spinal  Tap"".  Osbourne  himself  was  at  a  loss  to  explain  its  popularity:  ""I  suppose  Americans  get  a  kick  out  of  watching  a  crazy  Brit  family  like  us  make  complete  fools  of  ourselves  every  week."""

2	"CSA  'could  close',  says  minister  |||    Ministers  would  not  rule  out  scrapping  the  Child  Support  Agency  if  it  failed  to  improve,  Work  and  Pensions  Secretary  Alan  Johnson  has  warned.  |||    But  he  said  replacing  the  controversial  CSA  would  be  ""the  nuclear  option"".  A  report  by  the  Commons  work  and  pensions  committee  called  for  the  agency  to  be  wound  up  unless  it  improved  its  service  within  weeks.  Chairman  Sir  Archy  Kirkwood  said:  ""If  the  agency  cannot  be  rescued,  then  it  must  be  replaced.""  |||    The  committee  reached  its  conclusions  after  it  found  that  nearly  250,000  cases  have  yet  to  be  processed.  It  warned  that  it  could  be  five  years  before  the  CSA  was  ""fit  for  purpose"",  describing  it  as  ""a  failing  organisation""  and  ""in  crisis""  with  parents  facing  payment  delays  and  inaccurate  maintenance  calculations.  The  report  urged  the  CSA  to  draw  up  contingency  plans,  including  the  ""abandonment  option"",  to  be  presented  to  Parliament  by  Easter,  in  case  the  CS2  computer  system  could  not  be  made  to  work.  |||    And  responding  to  calls  for  the  agency  to  be  scrapped,  Mr  Johnson  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme:  ""I  certainly  wouldn't  rule  out  the  nuclear  option  of  moving  to  a  completely  new  system.  ""But  I  think  the  select  committee  would  agree  with  me  we  would  only  do  that  when  we  were  absolutely  convinced  that  this  system  just  isn't  going  to  work.""  |||    The  MPs  launched  their  inquiry  into  the  CSA's  performance  after  it  became  clear  that,  despite  the  introduction  of  a  simpler  system  of  calculating  maintenance  payments  for  new  cases  in  2003,  a  backlog  of  claims  was  building  up.  The  MPs  found  the  £456m  system  from  American  IT  giant  EDS  was  ""nowhere  near  being  fully  functional  and  the  number  of  dissatisfied,  disenchanted  and  angry  customers  continues  to  escalate"".  Faced  with  the  committee's  criticism,  the  government  has  suspended  its  plan  to  cut  the  agency's  staff  by  25%.  The  CSA  has  been  surrounded  in  controversy  since  its  introduction  in  1993  to  assess  and  enforce  child  support  payments  by  absent  parents.  |||    It  is  currently  chasing  outstanding  payments  of  more  than  £720m,  while  a  further  £947m  has  been  designated  as  ""unrecoverable"".  |||    Michelle,  a  mother  of  twins,  said  she  had  not  received  a  penny  of  the  £57  a  week  she  should  be  receiving  from  her  ex-partner  and  had  faced  an  ""on-going  battle""  with  the  CSA.  Her  forms  have  twice  been  lost  in  the  post,  she  said.  ""I  don't  receive  correspondence,  I  don't  receive  phone  calls,  I  have  to  chase  them  all  the  time,""  she  said.  Theresa  May,  Tory  shadow  work  and  pensions  secretary,  said:  ""We  have  got  to  find  a  way  that's  going  to  ensure  those  payments  get  through  to  the  people  who  are  due  them.""  The  agency's  former  chief  executive  Doug  Smith  quit  last  autumn  claiming  he  was  ""seriously  disappointed""  with  its  performance.  The  committee  said  the  National  Audit  Office  should  investigate  why  the  EDS  system  had  gone  so  badly  wrong.  It  blamed  the  agency's  senior  management  for  a  ""multitude  of  problems""  within  the  agency,  including  for  an  apparent  lack  of  training  of  frontline  staff."

But  the  annual  awards,  which  were  presented  in  New  York  on  Wednesday,  were  not  without  controversy.  Children's  author  Judy  Blume,  who  was  given  an  honourary  medal,  used  the  ceremony  to  speak  out  over  censorship.  |||    Sales  of  Blume's  books  have  exceeded  75  million,  but  her  work  -  which  features  frank  narratives  about  families,  religion  and  sexuality  -  is  closely  watched  by  the  censors.  Blume  said:  ""The  urge  to  ban  is  contagious.  It  spreads  like  wildfire  from  community  to  community.  Please  speak  out.  Censors  hate  publicity.""  Her  medal  marks  the  second  year  in  a  row  the  honourary  prize  went  to  someone  as  notable  for  popular  success  as  literary  greatness.  Last  year's  honorary  winner,  Stephen  King,  accused  the  industry  during  the  2003  ceremony  of  snobbery  against  popular  writers.  But  his  argument  that  the  award  should  help  sell  books  instead  of  honouring  excellence  is  not  shared  by  everyone.  |||    This  year's  fiction  panel  overlooked  high-profile  works  such  as  Philip  Roth's  The  Plot  Against  America  and  instead  chose  five  little-known  books,  all  by  New  York-based  women.  One  fiction  judge,  Stewart  O'Nan,  carried  around  a  note  written  on  a  napkin  that  said:  ""I  would  hope  that  our  caring  more  for  the  quality  of  a  work  than  its  sales  figures  make  us  a  friend  of  books,  not  an  enemy.""  The  National  Book  Awards  non-fiction  prize  was  awarded  to  Kevin  Boyle's  for  Arc  of  Justice,  which  focuses  on  a  black  family's  fight  to  live  in  a  white  Detroit  neighbourhood  in  the  1920s.  The  award  had  created  a  lot  of  interest  this  year  after  the  surprise  inclusion  of  the  of  the  9-11  Commission  Report  looking  into  the  events  of  the  11  September  terrorist  attacks  on  the  US.

Cuban  citizens,  who  receive  money  from  overseas,  and  foreign  visitors,  who  change  dollars  in  Cuba,  will  be  affected.  Critics  of  the  measure  argue  that  it  is  a  step  backwards,  reflecting  the  Cuban  president's  desire  to  increase  his  control  of  the  economy  and  to  clamp  down  on  private  enterprise.  In  a  live  television  broadcast  announcing  the  measure,  President  Castro's  chief  aide  said  it  was  necessary  because  of  the  United  States'  increasing  ""economic  aggression"".  ""The  ten  percent  obligation  applies  exclusively  to  the  dollar  by  virtue  of  the  situation  created  by  the  new  measures  of  the  US  government  to  suffocate  our  country,""  he  said.  |||    The  Bush  administration  has  taken  an  increasingly  harsh  line  on  Cuba  in  recent  months.  President  Bush's  government,  which  has  been  a  strong  supporter  of  the  40-year-old  trade  embargo  on  Cuba,  introduced  even  tighter  restrictions  on  Cuba  in  May.  |||    Cubans  living  in  the  US  are  now  limited  to  one  visit  to  Cuba  every  three  years  and  they  can  only  send  money  to  their  immediate  relatives.  A  leading  expert  on  the  Cuban  economy  says  that  Castro's  tax  plan  smacks  more  of  a  desperate  economic  measure  than  a  political  gesture.  ""I  think  it  is  primarily  an  effort  to  raise  some  cash,""  says  Jose  Barrionuevo,  head  of  strategy  for  Latin  American  emerging  markets  for  Barclays  Capital.  ""It  underscores  the  fact  that  the  economy  is  in  very  bad  shape  and  the  government  is  looking  for  sources  of  revenue.""  |||    The  tax  will  hit  the  families  of  Cuban  exiles  hardest  as  they  benefit  from  the  money  their  displaced  relatives  send  home.  This  money,  known  as  remittances,  can  amount  to  as  much  as  $1bn  a  year.  Those  remaining  in  Cuba  will  have  to  pay  the  tax.  Their  relatives  abroad  may  choose  to  send  money  in  other  currencies  which  are  not  subject  to  the  tax,  such  as  euros,  or  increase  their  dollar  payments  to  compensate.  However,  many  of  Cuban's  poorest  citizens  could  be  worse  off  as  a  result.  The  tax  will  also  affect  the  two  million  tourists  who  visit  Cuba  every  year,  particularly  those  Americans  who  continue  to  defy  a  ban  on  travel  there.  |||    Cuba's  tourist  industry  has  been  one  of  its  few  economic  success  stories  over  the  last  ten  years  and,  according  to  the  UN  Economic  Commission  for  Latin  America,  is  now  worth  $3bn  to  the  country.  |||    The  tax  is  designed  to  provide  much-needed  revenue  for  Cuba's  cash-strapped  economy.  Cuba  badly  needs  dollars  to  pay  for  essential  items  such  as  food,  fuel  and  medicine.  Much  of  Cuba's  basic  infrastructure  is  in  a  state  of  disrepair.  In  recent  weeks,  Cuba  has  suffered  its  most  serious  power  cuts  in  a  decade  and  there  have  also  been  water  shortages  in  parts  of  the  island.  Cuba's  economy  had  staged  a  modest  recovery  during  the  mid  1990s  as  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union  forced  it  to  embrace  foreign  capital,  decentralise  trade  and  permit  limited  private  enterprise.  However,  a  decline  in  foreign  tourism  since  2002,  periodic  hurricanes  and  the  increasing  costs  of  importing  oil  have  put  a  strain  on  the  economy.  It  has  however  yet  to  be  seen  if  the  tax  will  provide  a  solution  to  the  government's  economic  problems.  The  tax  could  fuel  an  active  black  market  in  currency  trading,  Mr  Barrionuevo  said.  ""The  main  impact  could  be  that  it  will  create  a  black  market  which  you  typically  see  in  countries,  like  Venezuela,  which  have  restrictions  on  capital,""  he  says.  Mr  Barrioneuvo  says  the  measure  could  be  dropped  if  it  has  a  damaging  effect  on  economic  activity.  ""It  is  intended  to  be  a  permanent  measure  but  I  am  not  sure  it  can  last  too  long."""

Ahold  hit  the  headlines  in  February  2003  after  it  emerged  that  there  were  accounting  irregularities  at  its  US  subsidiary  Foodservice.  Three  former  Ahold  top  executives  last  year  agreed  to  settle  fraud  charges.  |||    Ahold  has  admitted  that  it  fraudulently  inflated  promotional  allowances  at  Foodservice,  improperly  consolidated  joint  ventures  and  also  committed  other  accounting  errors  and  irregularities.  |||    The  nine  now  charged,  who  worked  as  suppliers  to  Ahold,  are  accused  of  signing  false  documents  relating  to  the  amount  of  money  they  paid  the  retailer  for  promoting  their  products  in  its  stores.  Food  companies  pay  supermarkets  and  retailers  for  prime  shelf  space.  The  suppliers  in  question  are  said  to  have  inflated  the  amount  of  money  they  paid,  providing  auditors  with  signed  letters  that  allowed  Ahold  to  inflate  its  earnings.  US  Attorney  David  Kelley  said  he  expects  the  nine  vendors  will  plead  guilty  to  the  charges.  He  added  that  there  may  be  more  court  actions  in  the  future.  ""I  don't  want  to  leave  you  with  the  impression  that  these  were  the  only  ones  involved,""  he  said.  Among  those  facing  charges  are  John  Nettle,  a  former  employee  of  General  Mills;  Mark  Bailin  of  Rymer  International  Seafood;  Tim  Daly  of  Michael  Foods  and  Kenneth  Bowman,  who  worked  as  an  independent  contractor  for  Total  Foods.  |||    Others  include  Michael  Hannigan  of  Sugar  Foods;  Peter  Marion  of  Maritime  Seafood  Processors  and  First  Choice  Foods;  Gordon  Redgate  of  Commodity  Manager  and  Private  Label  Distribution;  Bruce  Robinson  of  Basic  American  Foods  and  Michael  Rogers,  formerly  of  Tyson  Foods.  Pasquale  D'Amuro  of  the  FBI  called  the  nine  vendors  the  key  ingredients  in  ""the  process  of  cooking  the  books""  at  Ahold.  At  the  time  of  the  scandal,  Ahold  was  seen  by  many  as  Europe's  Enron.  Ahold  shares  tumbled  on  the  news  and  many  market  observers  predicted  that  the  fall  out  could  damage  investor  confidence  across  Europe.  It  was  less  severe  than  many  had  envisaged,  however,  and  since  then  Ahold  has  worked  hard  at  rebuilding  its  reputation  and  investor  confidence.  Ahold  is  the  world's  fourth-largest  supermarket  chain.  Its  other  US  businesses  include  Stop  &  Shop,  and  Giant  Food."

China's  Baoshan  Iron  and  Steel  Co.  said  it  was  delaying  a  share  sale  because  of  weak  market  conditions,  adding  it  would  raise  steel  prices  to  offset  ore  costs.  The  threat  of  higher  raw  material  costs  also  hit  industries  such  as  carmakers.  France's  Peugeot  warned  that  its  profits  may  decline  this  year  as  a  result  of  the  higher  steel,  plastic  and  commodity  prices.  |||    Steelmakers  have  been  enjoying  record  profits  as  demand  for  steel  has  risen,  driven  by  the  booming  economies  of  countries  such  as  China  and  India.  Steel  prices  rose  by  8%  globally  in  January  alone  and  by  24%  in  China.  |||    The  boom  times  are  far  from  over,  but  analysts  say  that  earnings  growth  may  slow.  The  share  price  fall  was  initially  triggered  by  news  that  two  of  the  world's  biggest  iron  ore  suppliers  had  negotiated  contracts  at  much-higher  prices.  Miners  Rio  Tinto  and  Cia.  Vale  Do  Rio  Dolce  (CVRD)  this  week  managed  to  boost  by  72%  the  price  of  their  iron  ore,  a  key  component  of  steel.  Analysts  had  expected  Japan's  Nippon  to  agree  to  a  price  rise  of  between  40%  and  50%.  Steel  analyst  Peter  Fish,  director  of  Sheffield-based  consulting  group  MEPS,  said  the  extent  of  CVRD's  price  rise  was  ""uncharted  territory"",  adding  that  the  steel  industry  ""hasn't  seen  an  increase  of  this  magnitude  probably  in  50  years"".  Analysts  now  expect  other  iron  ore  producers,  such  as  Australia's  BHP  Billiton,  to  seek  annual  price  rises  of  up  to  70%.  |||    The  news  triggered  the  share  price  weakness.  ""It  sparked  worries  that  steel  makers  might  not  be  able  to  increase  product  prices  further  [  to  cover  rising  ore  costs]""  explained  Kazuhiro  Takahashi  of  Daiwa  Securities  SMBC.  In  Europe,  Arcelor  shed  2.1%  to  17.58  euros  in  Paris,  with  ThyssenKrupp  dropping  1.7%  to  16.87  euros.  In  London,  Corus  fell  2.2%  to  55.57  pence.  Japan's  biggest  steel  company  Nippon  Steel  lost  2.5%  to  270  yen,  with  closest  rival  JFE  Holdings  down  3.4%.  China's  Baoshan,  the  country's  largest  steel  producer,  said  that  the  uncertainty  surrounding  the  industry  has  prompted  it  to  pull  its  planned  share  sale.  The  firm  had  been  expected  to  offer  22.5bn  yuan  ($2.7bn)  worth  of  shares  to  investors.  No  date  has  been  given  for  when  the  5  billion  shares  will  come  to  the  market.  Baoshan  stock  climbed  on  news  of  the  delay  and  its  decision  to  increase  the  price  of  its  steel  by  10%."

The  History  Boys,  set  in  a  grammar  school  in  the  early  1980s  and  partly  based  on  Bennett's  experiences  as  a  teacher,  was  named  best  new  play.  |||    It  also  won  best  actor  for  Richard  Griffiths,  who  beat  his  Harry  Potter  film  co-star  Michael  Gambon,  nominated  for  Endgame,  as  well  as  Jonathan  Pryce  and  Ben  Whishaw.  The  play  also  won  National  Theatre  artistic  director  Nicholas  Hytner  best  director  and  Bennett  got  a  special  award  for  outstanding  contribution  to  British  theatre.  Dame  Judi  Dench,  who  starred  in  All's  Well  That  Ends  Well  at  the  Gielgud,  lost  out  in  the  best  supporting  role  category  to  Amanda  Harris,  who  played  Emilia  in  Othello  for  the  Royal  Shakespeare  Company.

""The  whistle  doesn't  need  to  be  blown.  I  asked  Henry  'do  you  want  a  wall?'.  He  said  'can  I  take  it  please?'  He  was  very  polite.  I  said  'yes',""  said  Poll.  ""I  deal  with  the  laws  of  the  game.  I  deal  with  fact.""  Poll  added:  ""I  gave  the  signal  for  him  to  take  it.  That's  what  he  did.  ""The  same  thing  happened  when  I  refereed  Chelsea  against  West  Ham  in  an  FA  Cup  replay  two  years  ago  -  when  Jimmy  Floyd  Hasselbaink  scored  -  and  I  don't  remember  them  complaining  about  that.""  Henry  explained  why  he  paused  before  striking  the  ball  for  the  goal,  which  put  Arsenal  2-1  ahead.  |||    Henry  told  BBC  Radio  Five  Live:  ""The  ref  asked  me  if  I  wanted  10  yards  or  if  I  wanted  to  take  it  straight  away  and  I  said  that  I  wanted  to  take  it  straight  away.  He  said  to  me,  'go'.  ""It  looks  a  bit  strange  because  I  took  my  time.  I  was  waiting  for  Eidur  Gudjohnsen  to  move  and  give  me  some  space.  ""At  one  point,  he  turned  and  that's  when  I  tried  it.""  Former  referees'  chief  Philip  Don  backed  Poll's  decision  to  allow  the  strike.  ""The  advantage  should  go  to  the  non-offending  team.  On  this  occasion  it  was  Arsenal,""  Don  told  BBC  Radio  Five  Live.  ""Referees  have  been  told  to  ask  the  player  'do  you  want  to  take  the  quick  free-kick?'  or  'do  you  want  me  to  get  the  wall  back  9.15  metres?'  ""If  they  say  'quick',  the  referee  tends  to  move  away  and  allow  the  kick.""

But  Mr  Clarke  accused  him  of  trying  to  score  ""cheap  political  points""  by  muddling  immigration  with  asylum.  |||    London's  Evening  Standard  quoted  Mr  Clarke  telling  Labour  activists  at  a  question  and  answer  session  in  Gateshead  that  he  wanted  Britain  to  offer  refuge  for  those  fleeing  tyranny.  ""That's  not  only  a  moral  duty  and  a  legal  duty,  but  something  which  is  part  of  the  essence  of  this  country,""  he  said.  |||    ""We  want  more  migration,  more  people  come  to  study  and  to  work.

""The  Tories  are  purposely  mixing  together  two  separate  issues  of  immigration  and  asylum.""  |||    Mr  Clarke  said  he  had  made  clear  the  UK  would  welcome  genuine  economic  migrants  for  key  jobs  on  a  strict  points  based  system.  And  only  asylum  seekers  genuinely  fleeing  death  or  persecution  would  be  admitted.  ""Under  our  plans  we  expect  unfounded  applications  to  continue  to  fall,""  he  added.  Earlier,  Dr  Fox  accused  Mr  Blair  and  other  Cabinet  ministers  of  telling  lies  about  Tory  policies  and  then  attacking  the  lies.  He  told  BBC  Radio:  ""If  you  are  willing  to  lie  about  the  reasons  for  going  to  war,  I  guess  you  are  going  to  lie  about  anything  at  all.""

Douglas  added  that  it  had  been  inspired  by  a  Wall  Street  Journal  article  about  India's  'angadias',  who  courier  money  and  diamonds  around  India.  |||    The  actor's  own  production  company,  Further  Films,  is  working  in  partnership  with  two  Indian  film-making  concerns  to  bring  the  picture  to  the  screen.  Shailendra  Singh,  the  founder  of  India's  Percept  Films,  said  there  would  be  ""a  lot  of  India""  in  the  movie  -  and  that  an  Indian  train  would  play  a  big  role.  ""The  train  will  be  a  crucial  part  of  the  film.  The  chase  and  most  of  the  stunts  will  be  on  the  train,""  said  Mr  Singh.  Swashbuckling  adventure  film  Romancing  The  Stone  saw  Douglas's  female  co-star  Kathleen  Turner  win  a  Golden  Globe  award  for  her  performance  in  1985." 

1	"BBC  denies  Blackadder  TV  comeback  |||    The  BBC  has  said  there  are  no  plans  in  the  pipeline  for  a  new  series  of  hit  comedy  Blackadder,  which  ended  in  1989.  |||    Tony  Robinson,  who  played  the  servant  Baldrick,  told  ITV1's  This  Morning  the  show's  star,  Rowan  Atkinson,  was  ""more  keen  than  he  has  been  in  the  past"".  Robinson  added  he  would  ""love""  to  do  another  series,  each  of  which  was  set  in  a  different  era,  ranging  from  the  15th  century  to  World  War  I.  But  the  BBC  said  on  Thursday  there  were  no  plans  for  a  comeback.  |||    In  the  final  series  all  the  main  characters  were  killed  off  charging  towards  German  lines  after  being  ordered  out  of  their  trench.  The  poignant  finale  was  later  voted  the  best  farewell  episode  of  a  TV  series.  A  host  of  other  UK  actors,  including  Hugh  Laurie,  Stephen  Fry  and  Miranda  Richardson,  also  appeared  in  the  show.  Blackadder  returned  for  a  one-off  special  filmed  to  celebrate  the  arrival  of  the  millennium  in  1999.  It  was  shown  at  the  Millennium  Dome  in  Greenwich  before  being  screened  on  BSkyB." 

2	"Stalemate  in  pension  strike  talks  |||    Talks  aimed  at  averting  national  strikes  over  pension  reforms  have  ended  without  agreement  after  90  minutes.  |||    Five  public  sector  unions  met  Deputy  Prime  Minister  John  Prescott  at  the  Labour  spring  conference  in  Gateshead.  They  want  the  government  to  withdraw  regulations  -  due  to  be  introduced  in  weeks  -  which  would  raise  the  pension  age  for  council  workers  from  60  to  65.  Up  to  1.4  million  workers  could  take  part  in  strikes  earmarked  for  23  March.  Discussions  will  resume  next  week.  |||    A  spokesman  for  Unison,  Britain's  biggest  union,  said  after  Saturday's  meeting:  ""At  least  we  are  still  talking.""  All  sides  are  anxious  to  avoid  a  major  confrontation  in  the  run  up  to  the  general  election,  said  BBC  labour  affairs  correspondent  Stephen  Cape.  In  four  days,  Unison  will  start  balloting  800,000  local  government  workers  on  strikes.  Other  public  sector  unions  have  pledged  to  follow.  The  five  unions  which  met  Mr  Prescott  want  the  government  to  withdraw  these  regulations.  This  would  allow  months  of  tough  negotiations  to  follow,  said  our  correspondent.  But  a  spokesman  for  Mr  Prescott  warned  that  the  changes  to  the  local  government  pension  scheme  would  have  to  go  ahead  in  April.  |||    Privately  ministers  believe  this  will  be  the  ""less  painful""  option,  our  correspondent  added.  The  Public  and  Commercial  Services  Union  (PCS)  will  co-ordinate  any  industrial  action  with  up  to  six  other  public  sector  unions.  PCS  leader  Mark  Serwotka  warned  last  week  that  there  could  be  further  walkouts  unless  there  was  a  government  rethink.  ""For  a  government  that  lectures  everyone  on  choice  -  choice  on  public  service,  choice  on  this  and  choice  on  that  -  isn't  it  ironic  that  they're  saying  to  public  sector  workers  there  is  no  choice,""  he  said.  ""If  you  want  the  pension  you  were  promised  when  you  started  you  must  work  for  an  extra  five  years  -  that  is  working  until  people  drop.  ""In  the  20th  century,  it's  completely  unacceptable.""  |||    Unison's  800,000  workers,  the  Transport  and  General  Workers'  Union's  70,000  and  Amicus'  20,000  are  among  those  being  balloted  about  a  23  March  walkout.  Mr  Prescott  held  a  private  meeting  with  senior  union  figures  last  week.  It  is  understood  no  deal  was  offered  in  that  meeting  but  there  was  room  for  further  negotiations." 

2	"Whitehall  cuts  'ahead  of  target'  |||    Thousands  of  civil  service  jobs  have  already  been  cut  or  moved  out  of  London  as  part  of  a  major  cost-cutting  drive.  |||    Chancellor  Gordon  Brown  said  12,500  jobs  had  gone  while  7,800  were  being  moved  out  of  the  South  East.  He  plans  to  axe  104,000  jobs  to  free  up  money  for  education,  health,  defence,  housing  and  overseas  aid.  Unions  oppose  the  plans  but  Mr  Brown  said  £2bn  savings  had  already  been  made  and  more  jobs  had  been  cut  than  had  been  expected  at  this  stage.  A  further  200  jobs  at  the  Department  of  the  Environment,  Food  and  Rural  Affairs  have  been  earmarked  to  be  cut.  At  the  Department  for  Work  and  Pensions,  30,000  jobs  are  to  go,  560  will  be  lost  by  the  end  of  the  month  at  the  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry  and  400  are  to  go  at  the  Inland  Revenue  and  Customs.  |||    In  his  Budget  statement,  the  chancellor  said  the  first  12,500  civil  service  jobs  had  been  cut,  on  target.  About  4,300  civil  servants  will  leave  London  and  the  South  East  by  the  end  of  March  2005  and  there  are  plans  to  relocate  another  3,500.  Of  those  300  Department  of  Health  posts  will  go  to  Yorkshire  while  hundreds  at  the  Department  of  Culture  will  move  to  Birmingham  and  Newcastle.  |||    Mr  Brown  also  announced  plans  to  merge  35  agencies  into  nine  -  described  by  one  civil  service  union  as  a  ""bonfire  of  the  quangos"".  Mark  Serwotka,  the  leader  of  the  Public  and  Commercial  Services  Union  said:  ""In  last  year's  budget  we  had  the  day  of  the  long  knifes  as  the  chancellor  kicked  off  the  crude  game  of  who  could  cut  the  most  civil  service  jobs  between  the  government  and  the  Tories.  ""There  was  a  time  when  the  only  worry  thousands  of  hard  working  civil  and  public  servants  had  on  budget  day  was  whether  petrol  or  taxes  would  go  up,  nowadays  the  worry  is  whether  they  will  have  a  job  by  the  end  of  it.""  He  said  Mr  Brown  had  made  welcome  announcements  on  closing  tax  loopholes  and  extending  the  New  Deal,  while  cutting  ""the  very  people  who  deliver  them.""  The  Treasury  also  announced  plans  to  reduce  the  number  of  public  sector  workers  on  sick  leave  with  a  new  system  of  checks  and  tougher  measures  against  those  suspected  of  abusing  the  system." 

2	"'UK  will  stand  firm  on  EU  rebate'  |||    Britain's  £3bn  EU  rebate  is  not  up  for  renegotiation  at  next  week's  European  Council  summit,  Jack  Straw  said.  |||    The  foreign  secretary  told  MPs  the  rebate,  secured  by  Margaret  Thatcher  in  1984,  was  ""entirely  justified"".  New  European  commission  president  Jose  Manuel  Barroso  has  suggested  the  cash  could  be  shared  out  among  net  contributors  to  the  EU  budget.  Mr  Straw  acknowledged  some  countries  in  the  newly  enlarged  25  nation  EU  still  had  to  ""see  the  light""  on  the  rebate.  |||    But  the  foreign  secretary  told  the  Commons  foreign  affairs  committee:  ""Our  position  is  very  clear:  it  is  entirely  justified  and  it  is  not  for  negotiation.""  He  added  that  he  did  not  think  there  would  be  a  political  price  to  pay  for  the  UK's  stance  -  Britain  contributed  more  and  received  less  than  other  EU  states.  The  two-day  European  Council  summit  in  Brussels  begins  on  16  December  and  is  widely  expected  to  mark  the  beginning  of  a  lengthy  negotiating  period  over  the  EU's  budget  for  2007-13.  The  wrangling  could  stretch  into  2005,  even  2006.  |||    The  UK,  France,  Germany,  Austria,  the  Netherlands  and  Sweden  want  the  EU  budget  to  be  capped  at  1%  of  member  states'  combined  national  incomes  -  the  Commission  wants  it  to  be  1.26%.  Mr  Straw  said  the  EU  commission's  proposal  would  mean  a  35%  hike  in  the  budget.  ""I  don't  know  of  any  national  government  thinking  of  increasing  its  budget  by  that  amount,""  he  added.  The  foreign  secretary  said  he  hoped  the  talks  next  week  could  produce  a  date  in  2005  for  the  beginning  of  negotiations  with  Turkey  about  possible  EU  membership  although  that  there  would  be  no  prospect  of  a  date  for  joining  for  some  time." 

1	"Fantasy  book  wins  Hollywood  deal  |||    A  British  author  has  had  the  film  rights  to  her  children's  bestseller  snapped  up  for  a  seven-figure  sum,  with  Ridley  Scott  set  to  direct.  |||    Michelle  Paver's  Wolf  Brother,  a  fantasy  set  6,000  years  ago,  is  the  first  in  a  planned  series  of  six  books.  Film  studio  Fox  has  bought  the  rights  for  around  $4m  (£2.13m)  for  Scott's  company  Scott  Free  to  develop.  The  director  said  he  was  ""thrilled""  with  the  project.  ""Wolf  Brother  is  an  enchanting  book,""  he  said.  Paver,  who  lives  in  London  and  previously  worked  as  a  lawyer,  began  writing  the  book  in  1982  while  studying  biochemistry  at  Oxford  University.  |||    She  was  an  established  author  of  love  stories  when  she  turned  the  work-in-progress  into  a  children's  novel.  It  was  published  in  2004,  with  Paver  earning  an  advance  of  $5m  (£2.8m)  -  the  highest  sum  ever  paid  for  a  debut  children's  book.  Wolf  Brother  tells  the  story  of  Torak,  a  12-year-old  hunter  who  lives  in  the  forest.  After  his  father  is  killed  he  teams  up  with  a  wolf  cub  and  sets  out  to  rid  the  forest  of  an  evil  force.  Paver  is  currently  writing  the  second  book  in  the  series.  ""Michelle  Paver  lives  and  breathes  the  worlds  she  writes  about,""  said  a  spokesman  for  the  author.  ""I've  told  her  about  the  film  deal  but  at  the  moment  she  is  writing  the  second  book  and  her  mind  is  6000  years  away  deep  in  the  primeval  forest.""" 

3	"Benitez  joy  as  Reds  take  control  |||    Liverpool  boss  Rafael  Benitez  was  satisfied  after  his  team's  3-1  win  over  Bayer  Leverkusen  despite  conceding  a  goal  in  the  last  minute.  |||    ""Before  the  game  if  you  had  said  the  score  will  be  3-1  I  would  have  happily  accepted  that,""  said  Benitez.  ""But  you  must  realise  that  you  have  to  concentrate  right  to  the  very  last  seconds  of  a  game  at  this  level.  ""I  have  confidence  that  we  can  complete  the  task  in  Germany.  I  am  always  confident  and  we  must  be  positive.""  |||    Benitez  defended  goalkeeper  Jerzy  Dudek,  whose  failure  to  hold  on  to  Dimitar  Berbatov's  weak  drive  allowed  Franca  to  score  with  the  last  kick  of  the  game  -  and  give  the  German  team  a  lifeline  for  the  second  leg.  ""For  me  it  was  not  Jerzy  Dudek's  fault,""  added  Benitez.  ""He  had  played  a  very  good  game  -  and  had  we  scored  our  other  chances,  nobody  would  be  talking  about  about  their  goal.  It  would  not  have  mattered.  ""If  we  had  scored  our  other  chances  it  would  not  have  been  worth  remembering  that  last  goal.  ""In  my  opinion  Jerzy  played  well,  made  two  very  fine  saves  -  and  I  am  happy  with  him.  ""If  we  lose  2-0  we  are  out  but  I  think  we  can  score  in  Germany  -  certainly  one,  and  that  will  make  all  the  difference.""  And  the  Liverpool  boss  is  looking  forward  to  having  skipper  Steven  Gerrard,  who  was  suspended  for  the  Anfield  leg,  back  for  the  return  in  Germany.  |||    ""Steven  Gerrard  is  a  key  player  for  us,""  said  Benitez.  ""When  he  is  on  the  pitch  he  makes  everyone  else  play  better  -  and  the  opposition  pay  special  attention  to  him  -  which  gives  space  for  others.  ""Steven  is  one  of  the  best  players  in  the  world,  but  I  need  a  team  that  is  not  about  just  one  player.  There  must  be  11  players  on  the  pitch  all  doing  well.""" 

2	"Civil  servants  in  strike  ballot  |||    The  UK's  biggest  civil  service  union  is  to  ballot  its  290,000  members  on  strikes  in  protest  at  government  plans  to  extend  their  pension  age  to  65.  |||    The  Public  and  Commercial  Services  Union  will  co-ordinate  any  action  with  up  to  six  other  public  sector  unions.  Unions  have  already  earmarked  23  March  for  a  one-day  strike  which  could  involve  up  to  1.4  million  UK  workers.  The  government  says  unions  will  be  consulted  before  any  changes  are  made  to  the  pension  system.  |||    PCS  leader  Mark  Serwotka  warned  there  could  be  further  walkouts  unless  there  was  a  government  rethink.  |||    ""For  a  government  that  lectures  everyone  on  choice  -  choice  on  public  service,  choice  on  this  and  choice  on  that  -  isn't  it  ironic  that  they're  saying  to  public  sector  workers  there  is  no  choice,""  he  said.

""In  the  20th  century,  it's  completely  unacceptable.""  BBC  correspondent  Stephen  Cape  said  the  combined  unions  represented  ""a  formidable  force""  which  could  embarrass  the  government  in  the  run-up  to  the  General  Election.  A  stoppage  involving  civil  servants,  in  particular,  could  seriously  disrupt  or  close  government  departments,  agencies  and  museums,  he  said.  |||    Opposition  to  raising  the  retirement  age  is  ""one  thing  all  the  unions  are  agreed  on"",  our  correspondent  added.  Unison's  800,000  workers,  the  Transport  and  General  Workers'  Union's  70,000  and  Amicus'  20,000  are  among  those  being  balloted  about  a  23  March  walkout.

There  was  ""some  possibility""  of  the  strike  action  being  avoided,  he  added." 

1	"Rapper  films  music  video  in  jail  |||    A  US  rapper  awaiting  trial  for  murder  has  filmed  part  of  a  music  video  in  jail,  angering  a  sheriff  who  says  he  was  tricked  into  letting  TV  crews  in.  |||    C-Murder,  a  former  member  of  rap  group  Tru,  was  filmed  in  his  orange  prison  suit  for  the  video  for  his  Y'all  Heard  of  Me  single  in  a  New  Orleans  jail.  He  is  awaiting  a  second  trial  after  an  original  conviction  was  thrown  out.  ""I'm  not  pleased,""  Jefferson  Parish  Sheriff  Harry  Lee  said.  ""He  will  not  make  another  video  in  my  jail.""  Footage  for  the  video  was  filmed  by  two  crews  who  had  permission  to  interview  C-Murder  -  one  from  Court  TV  and  one  from  a  local  cable  show.  |||    But  Mr  Lee  said  he  did  not  know  the  rapper  had  filmed  the  video  and  made  an  album  behind  bars,  and  said  he  was  fooled  into  letting  the  cameras  in.  The  rapper's  lawyer  Ron  Rakosky  said:  ""The  bottom  line  is,  we  didn't  do  anything  wrong.""  Mr  Rakosky  said  it  was  better  than  C-Murder,  real  name  Corey  Miller,  ""just  sitting  there,  wasting  away"".  ""Here's  a  guy  in  jail,  making  constructive  use  of  his  time  instead  of  withering  away,""  he  said.  ""He's  lost  more  than  three  years  of  his  life,  locked  up  for  a  crime  he  did  not  commit.""  |||    But  local  group  Victims  and  Citizens  Against  Crime  said  he  should  not  be  working  behind  bars.  ""He  is  a  suspect  in  a  murder  case.  I  don't  think  he  should  be  allowed  these  privileges,  especially  earning  money,  until  his  name  is  totally  cleared,""  the  group's  president  Beverly  Siemssen  said.  In  2003,  C-Murder  was  found  guilty  of  killing  a  16-year-old  in  a  nightclub,  but  that  decision  was  thrown  out  last  April.  He  is  now  facing  a  second  trial  on  a  charge  of  second-degree  murder.  With  two  brothers  in  the  group  Tru,  he  had  two  US  top  10  albums  in  the  late  1990s  before  going  solo,  when  he  scored  another  three  top  10  albums." 

1	"US  'afflicted'  with  awards  fatigue  |||    The  film  world  and  media  may  be  wild  about  the  Oscars  but  cinema-goers  and  the  TV-viewing  public  are  sick  of  watching  award  ceremonies,  according  to  some  LA  film  critics.  |||    Bob  Strauss,  from  the  LA  Daily  News,  thinks  there  are  just  too  many  televised  gatherings  of  stars  showering  praise  on  each  other.  He  came  up  with  a  colourful  but  unprintable  description  for  these  glitzy  events,  which  roughly  translates  a  ""celebrity  love-in"".  This  echoed  the  views  of  Oscars  host  and  comedian  Chris  Rock,  who  whipped  up  a  media  storm  for  saying  he  rarely  watched  them,  calling  award  shows  ""idiotic"".  ""As  Chris  Rock  accurately  said,  they're  about  celebrity  and  fashion,""  Mr  Strauss  said.  The  recent  Grammy  music  awards  proved  to  be  a  ratings  loser,  and  it  seems  Oscars  organisers  are  determined  not  to  go  the  same  way.  |||    Recently  announced  changes  to  the  ceremony  include  lining  up  all  five  nominees  on  stage  before  announcing  the  winner.  |||    Unsurprisingly,  this  prompted  press  speculation  that  the  changes  were  aimed  at  boosting  flagging  advertising  revenue.  But  Entertainment  Weekly's  Dave  Karger  maintained  the  Oscars  only  generated  excitement  outside  the  industry  when  a  blockbuster,  such  as  Titanic  or  Lord  of  the  Rings,  was  nominated.  The  near  constant  flow  of  US  film  awards,  representing  directors,  actors  and  producers'  guilds,  also  means  ""few  surprises""  are  left  by  the  time  the  Oscar  ceremony  is  upon  us,  he  said.  A  quick  scan  of  the  Los  Angeles  Times  and  Los  Angeles  Daily  News  bears  this  out  -  speculation  about  who  will  win  seems  to  have  ground  to  a  halt.  |||    On  Thursday,  the  Times  simply  printed  a  picture  of  the  plastic  tents  going  up  outside  the  Kodak  Theatre  to  protect  the  red  carpet  from  rain.  Variety  and  the  Hollywood  Reporter  have  also  kept  their  focus  firmly  on  industry-related  news,  while  in  the  UK  bets  have  closed  on  the  best  actor  category,  with  Ray  star  Jamie  Foxx  a  dead  cert  to  win.  |||    Screen  International's  US  editor  Mike  Goodridge  thinks  2004's  films  have  simply  not  grabbed  the  public's  imagination.  ""Film-makers  haven't  produced  films  that  people  adore  this  year,""  he  said.  ""They  adored  Saving  Private  Ryan  for  example  -  people  loved  it  and  it  made  a  ton  of  money.  ""2004's  films  could  be  a  reaction  to  9/11  -  there  was  a  realisation  in  America  that  things  might  not  be  so  rosy  after  all.  ""Audiences  don't  necessarily  want  to  see  darker  films  such  as  Million  Dollar  Baby,  Aviator  and  Finding  Neverland,  which  end  with  casualty.""  As  to  whether  Rock  could  pep  up  the  awards,  the  critics  were  not  hopeful.  |||    Mr  Strauss  doubted  whether  Rock  would  make  an  impact,  but  added:  ""I'm  all  for  lower  ratings  though  -  there  are  far  more  important  things  going  on  than  the  Oscars.""  Mr  Karger  said  the  comic  might  boost  younger  viewers,  but  Mike  Goodridge  thought  Rock's  humour  could  prompt  America's  conservative  states  to  switch  off.  So  despite  all  this,  did  the  critics  have  any  views  on  who  would  win?  |||    ""Clint  Eastwood's  Million  Dollar  Baby  affected  people  emotionally,  which  is  why  it  will  beat  Aviator,  which  was  about  technical  artistry  not  feelings,""  Mr  Karger  said.  ""Eastwood  has  it  in  the  bag,""  added  Mr  Strauss.  ""Oscar  voters  often  vote  with  their  hearts  not  their  heads.""  And  Mr  Goodridge  said  best  film  and  director  were  between  Martin  Scorsese's  Aviator  and  Million  Dollar  Baby.  Mr  Karger,  whose  favourite  film  of  the  year  was  Mike  Leigh's  abortion  drama  Vera  Drake,  stayed  upbeat  about  the  awards  despite  his  other  comments.  ""I  hope  this  is  the  year  for  small  films  to  triumph,""  he  said.  ""After  all,  it's  still  one  of  the  biggest  TV  events  of  the  year."""

Agent  Brian  Hassell  insists  that  the  31-year-old  Brazilian  midfielder  is  determined  to  win  back  his  place.  ""But,  if  the  manager  is  not  going  to  pick  him,  that's  a  different  ball  game,""  he  told  The  Sun.  ""That's  something  we'd  have  to  look  at.  Juninho  deserves  respect.  He  is  not  a  little  kid.""  Hassell  warns  that  Juninho  could  reconsider  his  future  at  Celtic  unless  he  is  given  a  run  of  games  by  the  end  of  the  January  transfer  window.  |||    Juninho  was  signed  from  Middlesbrough  during  the  summer,  but  he  has  failed  to  live  up  to  high  expectations  and  has  lost  his  place  to  18-year-old  Aiden  McGeady.  ""He  has  50  caps  for  Brazil  and  he's  the  best  signing  Celtic  ever  made,""  insisted  Hassell.  ""He  wants  to  play  for  Martin  O'Neill,  but  does  Martin  O'Neill  want  to  play  him?  ""Juninho  is  not  someone  who  has  come  through  the  Celtic  ranks.  He  deserves  much  more  respect.""  Sanchez  is  bullish  about  his  hopes  of  prising  Juninho  from  the  Scottish  champions,  although  Hassell  believes  Mexico  would  not  be  his  preferred  destination.  ""We  have  already  spoken  with  Juninho  and  he  said,  if  he  has  no  firm  offer  from  a  club  in  Spain,  Veracruz  will  be  his  destination,""  Sanchez  told  his  club's  official  website.  Celtic  manager  O'Neill  is  no  respecter  of  reputations.  ""The  onus  is  on  Juninho  to  force  his  way  into  the  team,""  he  said.  ""Players  get  a  game  on  merit.  That's  the  way  it  has  always  been  and  that  is  certainly  the  case  at  Celtic  Park."""

It  is  the  sixth  time  in  three  years  Standard  Life  has  made  cuts  to  bonus  rates,  despite  an  8.7%  rise  in  the  value  of  the  with-profits  fund  in  2004.  The  insurer  blamed  the  cuts  on  poor  share  returns  and  low  interest  rates.  |||    With-profits  policies  are  designed  to  smooth  out  the  peaks  and  troughs  of  stock  market  volatility.  Profits  made  in  good  years  are  kept  in  reserve  to  pay  investors  an  annual  bonus  even  when  the  stock  market  performs  badly.  Slumping  share  prices  throughout  2001  and  2002  forced  most  firms  to  trim  bonus  rates  on  their  policies.  Standard  Life  came  in  for  criticism  for  sticking  with  stock  market  investments  during  2001  and  2002.  The  insurer  argued  that  shares  outperformed  other  investments  over  the  long  term  and  that  policyholders  would  feel  the  benefit  when  the  stock  market  recovered.  Recently,  Norwich  Union  and  Axa  Sun  Life  both  cut  their  with-profit  bonus  rates.  |||    John  Gill,  managing  director  of  the  insurer's  life  and  pensions  division,  said  that  a  strong  stock  market  recovery  in  the  past  two  years  had  only  ""partly  compensated  for  losses  during  2001  and  2002"".  In  addition,  low  interest  rates  meant  that  ""long-term  investment  returns  are  well  below  historic  levels"",  Mr  Gill  added.  However,  Mr  Gill  maintained  that  with-profits  continued  to  perform  well  over  the  long  term.  ""Our  payouts  continue  to  stand  up  well  against  other  types  of  long-term  investments  over  similar  periods,""  he  said.  Standard  Life  has  an  estimated  2.4  million  with-profits  policyholders.  Last  year,  the  company  announced  that  it  was  looking  to  float  on  the  stock  market  in  2006."

The  sugar  group  had  been  absent  from  the  FTSE  100  for  seven  years  until  Mr  Ferguson  helped  it  return  to  growth.  Tate's  shares  have  leapt  55%  this  year,  boosted  by  firming  sugar  prices  and  sales  of  its  artificial  sweeteners.  |||    ""After  years  of  a  sagging  stock  price  and  a  seven-year  hiatus  from  the  FTSE  100,  one  of  Britain's  venerable  manufacturers  has  returned  to  the  vaunted  index,""  Forbes  said.  Mr  Ferguson  took  the  helm  at  the  company  in  2003,  after  spending  most  of  his  career  at  consumer  goods  giant  Unilever.  Tate  &  Lyle,  which  was  an  original  member  of  the  historic  FT-30  index  in  1935,  operates  more  than  41  factories  and  20  more  additional  production  facilities  in  28  countries.

Recent  data  has  indicated  a  slowdown  in  manufacturing  and  consumer  spending,  as  well  as  in  mortgage  approvals.  And  retail  sales  disappointed  over  Christmas,  with  analysts  putting  the  drop  down  to  less  consumer  confidence.  |||    Rising  interest  rates  and  the  accompanying  slowdown  in  the  housing  market  have  knocked  consumers'  optimism,  causing  a  sharp  fall  in  demand  for  expensive  goods,  according  to  a  report  earlier  this  week  from  the  British  Retail  Consortium.  The  BRC  said  Britain's  retailers  had  endured  their  worst  Christmas  in  a  decade.  |||    ""Today's  no  change  decision  is  correct,""  said  David  Frost,  Director  General  of  the  British  Chambers  of  Commerce  (BCC).  ""But,  if  there  are  clear  signs  that  the  economy  slows,  the  MPC  should  be  ready  to  take  quick  corrective  action  and  cut  rates.  ""Dismal  reports  from  the  retail  trade  about  Christmas  sales  are  worrying,  if  they  indicate  a  more  general  weakening  in  consumer  spending.""  |||    Mr  Frost  added:  ""The  housing  market  outlook  remains  highly  uncertain.  ""It  is  widely  accepted  that,  if  house  prices  start  falling  more  sharply,  the  risks  facing  the  economy  will  worsen  considerably.""  CBI  chief  economist  Ian  McCafferty  said  the  economy  had  ""slowed  in  recent  months  in  response  to  rate  rises""  but  that  it  was  difficult  to  gauge  from  the  Christmas  period  the  likely  pace  of  activity  through  the  summer.  ""The  Bank  is  having  to  juggle  the  emergence  of  inflationary  pressures,  driven  by  a  tight  labour  market  and  buoyant  commodity  prices,  against  the  risk  of  an  over-abrupt  slowdown  in  consumer  activity,""  he  said.  ""Interest  rates  are  likely  to  remain  on  hold  for  some  time.""  |||    On  Thursday  there  was  more  gloomy  news  on  the  manufacturing  front,  as  the  Office  for  National  (ONS)  statistics  revealed  British  manufacturing  output  unexpectedly  fell  in  November  -  for  the  fifth  month  in  the  past  six.  The  ONS  said  manufacturing  output  dropped  0.1%  in  November,  matching  a  similar  unrevised  fall  in  October  and  confounding  economists'  expectations  of  a  0.3%  rise.  Manufacturers'  organisation,  the  EEF,  said  it  expected  the  hold  in  interest  rates  to  continue  in  the  near  future.  It  also  said  there  was  evidence  that  manufacturers'  confidence  may  be  waning  as  the  outlook  for  the  world  economy  becomes  more  uncertain.  |||    ""So  far  the  evidence  suggests  that  last  year's  rate  increases  have  helped  to  rebalance  the  economy  without  damaging  the  recovery  in  manufacturing,""  said  EEF  chief  economist,  Steve  Radley.  ""However,  should  the  business  outlook  start  to  deteriorate,  the  Bank  should  stand  ready  to  cut  rates.""  Some  economists  have  predicted  rates  will  drop  later  in  the  year,  although  others  feel  the  Bank  may  still  think  there  is  a  need  for  a  rise  to  5%  before  that  happens.  The  Bank  remains  concerned  about  the  long-term  risks  posed  by  personal  debt  -  which  is  rising  at  15%  a  year  -  if  economic  conditions  worsen." 

2	"New  drink  limit  'would  cut  toll'  |||    More  lives  than  previously  thought  could  be  saved  by  cutting  drink-drive  limits  by  a  third,  a  report  says.  |||    University  College  London  research  claims  cutting  the  limit  from  80mg  of  alcohol  per  100ml  of  blood  to  50mg  would  save  65  lives  a  year.  The  findings  are  being  published  by  the  Parliamentary  Advisory  Council  for  Transport  Safety  as  MPs  are  due  to  vote  on  the  government's  Road  Safety  Bill.  The  bill  includes  changes  to  speeding  fines  but  not  to  the  drink-drive  limit.  The  research,  carried  out  by  transport  expert  professor  Richard  Allsop,  says  cutting  the  limit  would  also  lead  to  230  fewer  serious  injuries  on  the  UK's  roads  compared  with  2003.  He  estimates  that  this  would  save  the  country  £119m  a  year.  |||    A  previous  estimate,  contained  in  a  1998  Department  of  Transport  Document,  suggested  such  a  move  could  save  50  lives  a  year.  The  findings  are  based  on  the  assumption  that  drivers  who  currently  keep  below  the  legal  limit  would  continue  to  do  so  were  it  to  be  lowered  and  that  those  who  tend  to  exceed  the  limit  slightly  would  also  lower  their  drinking.  Professor  Allsop  said:  ""Reducing  the  limit  from  80mg  to  50mg  can  be  expected  to  save  around  65  lives  a  year  or  around  half  of  those  who  die  in  accidents  where  the  driver's  BAC  [blood  alcohol  content]  is  within  30mg  of  the  current  limit.  ""Only  about  one  in  50  of  those  driving  during  weekend  evenings  and  nights  will  need  to  moderate  their  drinking  to  achieve  this  and  fewer  still  at  other  times.""  |||    Ministers  do  not  support  a  lower  limit,  saying  it  is  not  clear  it  would  have  a  major  impact  on  drink  drive  casualties.  They  believe  educating  drivers  is  more  important.  The  AA  Motoring  Trust  said  it  was  not  sure  what  affect  dropping  the  limit  would  have  on  drivers'  attitudes  to  drink-driving.  Road  safety  head  Andrew  Howard  said:  ""It  remains  to  be  seen  whether  the  social  disapproval  of  the  drinking  driver  will  stay  at  the  current  rate  if  the  alcohol  limit  is  cut.  |||    ""Parliamentarians  need  to  consider  this  carefully.  Britons  police  themselves  by  consensus  much  more  effectively  than  they  do  by  weight  of  enforcement  alone.""  Liberal  Democrat  transport  spokesman  John  Thurso  said  drink-driving  remained  a  ""major  killer"",  with  figures  showing  a  worrying  rise  in  the  number  of  accidents  involving  drivers  who  had  been  drinking.  He  said  there  had  been  a  29%  drop  in  the  number  of  drivers  being  breathalysed  since  1997,  which  he  said  the  government  needed  to  address  if  it  wanted  to  reduce  the  danger  caused  by  drink-driving.  The  Road  Safety  Bill,  which  gets  its  second  reading  on  Tuesday,  would  allow  the  results  of  roadside  breath  tests  to  be  used  in  court  -  currently  a  blood  test  is  needed.  It  also  includes  plans  for  a  staggered  speeding  fines  and  points  system,  penalising  drivers  who  exceed  limits  by  a  wide  margin  more  than  those  who  are  caught  going  just  over.  These  have  been  criticised  by  road  safety  campaigners,  including  Labour  backbencher  Gwyneth  Dunwoody,  who  says  it  will  reduce  the  incentive  for  drivers  to  stay  within  the  limits  in  residential  areas,  leading  to  more  road  casualties.  In  an  article  for  the  Times  newspaper,  Ms  Dunwoody,  who  chairs  the  Transport  Select  Committee,  says:  ""Slight  increases  to  low  car  speeds  increase  hugely  the  risks  to  pedestrians  and  cyclists.  ""It  is  quite  simple:  if  you  hit  someone  at  30mph,  they  have  a  50  per  cent  chance  of  survival.  If  you  are  going  at  40mph,  nine  times  out  of  ten  they  will  die."""

This  is  because  of  possible  malfunctions  with  the  braking  systems.  The  affected  vehicles  in  the  product  recall  are  from  the  2004  and  2005  model  years,  GM  said.  Those  vehicles  with  potential  faults  are  the  Chevrolet  Avalanche,  Express,  Kodiak,  Silverade  and  Suburban;  the  GMC  Savana,  Sierra  and  Yukon.  |||    The  NHTSA  said  a  pressure  accumulator  in  the  braking  system  could  crack  during  normal  driving  and  fragments  could  injure  people  if  the  hood  was  open.  This  could  allow  hydraulic  fluid  to  leak,  which  could  make  it  harder  to  brake  or  steer  and  could  cause  a  crash,  it  warned.  GM  is  also  recalling  19,924  Cadillac  XLR  coupes,  SRX  SUVs  and  Pontiac  Grand  Prix  sedans  from  the  2004  model  year.  This  is  because  the  accelerator  pedal  may  not  work  properly  in  extremely  cold  temperatures,  requiring  more  braking.  In  addition,  the  car  giant  is  calling  back  17,815  Buick  Raniers,  Chevrolet  Trailblazers,  GMC  Envoys  and  Isuzu  Ascenders  from  the  2005  model  years  because  the  windshield  is  not  properly  fitted  and  could  fall  out  in  a  crash.  However,  GM  stressed  that  it  did  not  know  of  any  injuries  related  to  the  problems.  News  of  the  recall  follows  an  announcement  last  month  that  GM  expects  earnings  this  year  be  lower  than  in  2004.  The  world's  biggest  car  maker  is  grappling  with  losses  in  its  European  business,  weak  US  sales  and  now  a  product  recall.  In  January,  GM  said  higher  healthcare  costs  in  North  America,  and  lower  profits  at  its  financial  services  subsidiary  would  hurt  its  performance  in  2005."

Amicus  has  1.2  million  members  and  the  TGWU  has  800,000.  Any  merger  would  have  to  be  approved  by  the  unions'  executives  and  their  membership.

Both  unions  are  remaining  tight-lipped  about  the  merger  rumours,  but  one  insider  pointed  out  to  the  BBC  News  website  that  ""nobody  is  denying  suggestions  a  merger  could  be  on  the  agenda""  when  the  two  unions'  executives  hold  their  meetings  on  Wednesday.

But  on  Friday  he  said:  ""I  have  tendered  my  resignation  as  a  partner  with  immediate  effect.""  Mr  McLetchie  had  received  advice  from  Holyrood  officials  about  what  details  he  needed  to  declare.  Labour  said  he  had  ""cleverly""  not  asked  about  paid  advocacy.  A  Tory  spokesman  ""totally  refuted""  any  wrongdoing.  |||    Mr  McLetchie  received  advice  from  the  clerk  to  the  standards  committee  after  concern  over  him  signing  a  parliamentary  motion  questioning  expansion  plans  for  Edinburgh  Airport.  The  MSP  had  been  a  partner  for  Tods  Murray  which  has  a  client  opposing  the  development.  Mr  McLetchie  did  not  have  a  complaint  made  against  him,  but  when  concerns  were  raised  he  sought  guidance  from  the  standards  committee  to  clarify  his  position.  He  was  advised  to  exercise  judgement  to  avoid  the  perception  of  a  conflict  and  said  he  had  done  nothing  wrong.  |||    Explaining  his  reason  for  quitting  the  post,  Mr  McLetchie  said:  ""I  have  been  greatly  concerned  by  the  recent  publicity  surrounding  my  association  with  Tods  Murray.

""He  was  almost  bound  to  get  the  answer  he  wanted  from  this  enquiry  since  he  stands  accused  of  breaching  section  6,  the  section  on  paid  advocacy,""  she  said.  Section  5  of  the  members  interest  order  legally  obliges  MSPs  to  declare  registrable  interests  before  taking  part  in  related  parliamentary  proceedings  ""where  the  interest  would  prejudice  or  give  the  appearance  of  prejudicing  their  ability  to  participate  in  a  disinterested  manner"".  However,  MSPs'  Code  of  Conduct  ""recognises  a  wider  definition""  of  parliamentary  proceedings,  including  a  non-statutory  requirement  to  make  a  declaration  in  relation  to  written  notices,  such  as  motions.  |||    But  a  letter  from  Holyrood's  Chamber  Office  chief  Ken  Hughes  also  made  clear  that  Mr  McLetchie  did  not  need  to  list  any  of  the  clients  for  whom  he  worked  as  a  solicitor.  Commenting  on  Mr  McLetchie's  decision  to  stand  down,  a  Scottish  Labour  Party  spokesman  said:  ""This  should  mean  Mr  McLetchie  doesn't  breach  the  paid  advocacy  rules  in  future.  ""However  it  doesn't  change  the  fact  that  there  should  be  a  full  investigation  into  whether  he  has  done  this  in  the  past.""  |||    Scottish  National  Party  Holyrood  leader  Nicola  Sturgeon  accused  Mr  McLetchie  of  failing  to  properly  serve  his  constituents.  Ms  Sturgeon  said:  ""I  think  this  whole  episode  has  been  very  damaging  for  Mr  McLetchie  and  I'm  sure  he  will  be  reflecting  on  it.""  She  added  that  she  thought  that  the  Tories  were  an  irrelevant  party  so  she  would  not  ""lose  any  sleep  over  it"".  Peter  Misselbrook,  executive  partner  of  Tods  Murray  said  Mr  McLetchie  had  been  considering  retirement  later  in  the  year.

1	"Johnny  Depp:  The  acting  outlaw  |||    Johnny  Depp,  whose  latest  role  was  Peter  Pan  creator  JM  Barrie  in  Finding  Neverland,  is  celebrated  as  one  of  Hollywood's  most  maverick  talents.  Depp  has  become  an  unlikely  major  star,  given  his  preference  for  taking  dark  and  idiosyncratic  roles  instead  of  surefire  box  office  hits.  He  has  had  a  long-running  working  relationship  with  the  equally  unconventional  director  Tim  Burton.  Depp  was  born  in  Kentucky  in  1963  and  at  first  wanted  to  be  a  rock  star,  playing  in  a  number  of  bands  and  supporting  acts  such  as  Iggy  Pop  and  The  B-52s  in  Florida.  On  a  visit  to  Los  Angeles,  his  former  wife  introduced  him  to  actor  Nicolas  Cage.  |||    In  1984  he  started  his  film  career  playing  a  doomed  teenager  in  horror  film  Nightmare  On  Elm  Street.  Two  years  later  he  played  a  soldier  in  Oliver  Stone's  Vietnam  epic  Platoon.  But  it  was  TV  that  first  made  Depp  a  star.  He  played  undercover  cop  Tommy  Hanson  in  the  US  series  21  Jump  Street  for  three  years  from  1987.  |||    In  1990  he  began  his  partnership  with  Burton  in  the  dark  fairy  tale  Edward  Scissorhands,  about  a  young  man  with  blades  for  hands.  He  won  plaudits  in  1993  for  the  downbeat  film  What's  Eating  Gilbert  Grape,  where  he  played  a  sensitive  youth  looking  after  an  overweight  mother  and  a  retarded  younger  brother,  played  by  Leonardo  DiCaprio.  Another  role  under  Burton,  Ed  Wood,  starred  Depp  as  the  crazed  cult  film-maker  Wood,  in  1994.  He  played  a  much  more  serious,  sensitive  role  in  his  next  major  film,  Donnie  Brasco,  where  he  portrayed  an  undercover  cop  infiltrating  a  mafia  ring.  In  1997  he  directed  his  only  film  to  date  -  The  Brave,  the  story  of  an  Indian  man  offered  money  to  appear  in  a  snuff  film.  |||    Two  years  later  he  played  Hunter  S  Thompson  in  Terry  Gilliam's  ambitious  but  poorly-received  big  screen  adaptation  of  Fear  and  Loathing  in  Las  Vegas.  He  worked  again  with  Tim  Burton  in  the  1999  horror  film  Sleepy  Hollow,  and  appeared  opposite  Dame  Judi  Dench  and  Juliette  Binoche  in  Chocolat.  His  performance  in  Pirates  of  the  Caribbean,  which  earned  him  Golden  Globe  and  Bafta  nominations,  had  many  critics  thinking  he  based  it  upon  the  mannerisms  of  his  friend,  Rolling  Stones  guitarist  Keith  Richards.  His  latest  role  in  Finding  Neverland  explored  JM  Barrie's  relationship  with  Sylvia  (Kate  Winslet)  and  her  children.  Depp's  charismatic  performance  drew  an  audience  of  adults  and  children  alike  into  Barrie's  vivid  imagination,  and  he  was  called  the  ""fifth  child  of  the  group""  by  the  film's  director  Marc  Forster.  |||    He  has  two  children  of  his  own  with  French  singer  Vanessa  Paradis,  having  previously  been  in  a  long-term  relationship  with  British  model  Kate  Moss.  The  theme  of  children's  literature  in  Depp's  career  -  and  his  long  association  with  Tim  Burton  -  are  set  to  continue  in  his  next  role,  playing  Willy  Wonka  in  a  remake  of  Roald  Dahl's  classic  Charlie  and  the  Chocolate  Factory.  British  TV  comedy  fans  might  also  remember  Depp's  guest  role  in  the  final  episode  of  BBC  sketch  programme  The  Fast  Show,  cited  as  his  favourite  show.  It  was  another  surprise  move  in  Depp's  varied  and  intriguing  career."

Springer  helped  launch  the  West  End  show  and  attended  the  opening  night.  ""I  wouldn't  have  written  it.  I  don't  believe  in  making  fun  of  other  religions,""  he  said.  |||    The  TV  host  said  he  understood  how  people  could  have  thought  the  musical  had  gone  too  far.  ""You  know,  on  our  TV  show  if  people  use  inappropriate  language  we  bleep  it  out,  if  there's  nudity  we  cover  it  up,  so  that  viewers  at  home  don't  get  to  see  any  of  this,""  he  said.  |||    Asked  whether  he  thought  the  BBC  should  have  screened  the  controversial  musical  he  said:  ""I  don't  know  if  they  should  have  had  it  on  television  but,  good  Lord,  if  you  don't  like  what's  on  television,  that's  why  God  gave  us  remote  controls.  ""My  show  is  about  dysfunctional  people  and  I  defy  anyone  to  watch  the  show  and  suggest  to  me  the  people  on  it  aren't  to  some  degree  dysfunctional.""  |||    ""If  I  did  a  show  about  the  war  in  Iraq,  it  wouldn't  make  me  a  warmonger,  I  would  just  be  doing  my  job  to  report  on  the  war.  ""In  the  case  of  my  show,  it's  my  job  to  report  on  the  dysfunctions  that  take  place  in  society.""  The  British-born  presenter  is  in  London  to  speak  at  a  fundraising  dinner  for  the  United  Jewish  Israel  Appeal.  The  dinner,  on  Tuesday,  is  expected  to  be  attended  by  more  than  800  guests."

The  Aviator  took  five  prizes  including  best  supporting  actress  for  Cate  Blanchett.  The  biopic  of  Howard  Hughes  led  the  nominations  with  11.  Jamie  Foxx  picked  up  best  actor  for  playing  soul  star  Ray  Charles  in  Ray.  Many  expected  this  to  be  Scorsese's  year  -  but  he  was  unsuccessful  in  the  best  director  category  for  the  fifth  time  in  his  career.  |||    He  has  never  won  despite  being  nominated  for  such  films  as  Raging  Bull  and  Goodfellas.  Instead,  Eastwood  took  his  second  Oscar  for  best  director  after  winning  for  Unforgiven  in  1993.  ""It  was  a  wonderful  adventure,""  Eastwood  said.  ""To  make  a  picture  in  37  days,  it  takes  a  well  oiled  machine.  I  am  lucky  to  be  here  and  lucky  to  be  still  working.  I've  got  a  lot  of  stuff  to  do  yet.""  Hilary  Swank  picked  up  her  second  best  actress  Oscar  for  playing  a  female  boxer  in  Million  Dollar  Baby,  beating  stars  including  Annette  Bening,  Kate  Winslet  and  Imelda  Staunton.  ""I  don't  know  what  I  did  in  this  life  to  deserve  this,""  she  told  the  audience.  ""I'm  just  a  girl  from  a  trailer  park  who  had  a  dream.""  Morgan  Freeman  beat  actors  including  Clive  Owen,  Jamie  Foxx  and  Alan  Alda  to  the  prize  for  best  supporting  actor.  He  thanked  Eastwood  and  described  the  film  as  ""a  labour  of  love"".  This  was  the  fourth  nomination  of  his  career  but  his  first  win.  Backstage,  he  said:  ""A  lot  of  people  say  you're  due  -  maybe  you  are,  maybe  you  aren't  -  it's  an  accolade.""  Million  Dollar  Baby's  success  was  the  night's  biggest  surprise  after  The  Aviator  seemed  to  have  the  advantage  until  the  end  of  the  ceremony.  |||    Cate  Blanchett,  who  won  for  playing  late  screen  legend  Katharine  Hepburn  in  The  Aviator,  said  her  award  was  ""an  indescribable  surprise  and  honour"".  Of  Hepburn,  she  said:  ""The  longevity  of  her  career  is  inspiring  to  everyone.""  Blanchett  also  paid  tribute  to  the  film's  director  Martin  Scorsese,  telling  him:  ""I  hope  my  son  will  marry  your  daughter.""  The  Aviator's  other  awards  came  for  cinematography,  film  editing,  art  direction  and  costume  design.  And  Jamie  Foxx,  who  had  two  nominations  this  year,  paid  tribute  to  the  ""beautiful  legacy""  of  soul  legend  Ray  Charles,  who  died  last  year,  and  thanked  director  Taylor  Hackford.  ""You  took  a  chance,  man,""  he  said.  ""That  love  for  Ray  Charles  was  deep  down  in  the  earth  somewhere  and  you  opened  it  up.  ""Everybody's  drowning  in  this  love.  Thank  you  for  taking  a  chance  and  thank  you  for  waiting  15  years  to  get  me  to  do  it.""  |||    He  broke  down  in  tears  when  speaking  about  being  whipped  by  his  grandmother,  whom  he  described  as  his  first  acting  teacher,  when  he  was  young.  In  other  awards,  cartoon  hit  The  Incredibles  won  best  animated  feature  and  best  sound  editing.  Bittersweet  comedy  Sideways  won  best  adapted  screenplay  while  the  original  screenplay  prize  went  to  Eternal  Sunshine  of  the  Spotless  Mind.  Born  into  Brothels,  about  the  children  of  prostitutes  in  Calcutta,  was  named  best  documentary,  The  Sea  Inside  was  named  best  foreign  language  film  and  Finding  Neverland  got  the  accolade  for  best  musical  score.  Spider-Man  2  triumphed  in  the  visual  effects  category,  Ray  won  best  sound  mixing  and  Lemony  Snicket's  A  Series  of  Unfortunate  Events  picked  up  best  make-up.  Former  British  TV  presenter  Andrea  Arnold,  who  hosted  children's  shows  Motormouth  and  Number  73  in  the  1980s,  won  best  short  film  for  Wasp.  Comedian  Chris  Rock,  who  hosted  the  ceremony  for  the  first  time,  received  a  standing  ovation  before  getting  the  show  under  way." 

2	"Iraq  advice  claim  sparks  new  row  |||    The  Tories  say  ministers  must  respond  in  Parliament  to  claims  that  the  legal  advice  used  to  justify  the  Iraq  war  was  drawn  up  at  Number  10.  |||    Downing  Street  has  denied  the  claims,  made  in  a  new  book  about  the  Attorney  General  Lord  Goldsmith's  advice.  Lord  Goldsmith  also  denied  them,  saying  he  was  not  ""leaned  on""  in  any  way.  But  the  Conservatives  and  Liberal  Democrats  say  they  want  the  publication  of  the  full  legal  advice  given  by  the  Attorney  General.  |||    The  government  has  consistently  refused  to  publish  Lord  Goldsmith's  advice  on  the  legality  of  the  war  -  saying  such  papers  have  always  been  kept  confidential.  |||    But  a  short  statement  about  Lord  Goldsmith's  position  was  presented  in  a  written  parliamentary  answer  on  17  March  2003  -  just  before  a  crucial  Commons  vote  on  the  military  action.  It  said  it  was  ""plain""  Iraq  continued  to  be  in  material  breach  of  UN  resolution  1441.  In  his  new  book,  Lawless  World,  Philippe  Sands,  a  QC  and  international  law  professor,  suggests  the  parliamentary  answer  was  written  in  Downing  Street.  According  to  Mr  Sands,  Lord  Goldsmith  had  warned  Tony  Blair  in  a  document  on  7  March  2003  that  the  use  of  force  against  Iraq  could  be  illegal  and  that  it  would  have  been  safer  to  seek  a  second  UN  resolution  sanctioning  military  action.  |||    Mr  Sands  told  Newsnight  the  government  had  prepared  a  legal  team  to  be  able  to  defend  its  case,  in  case  legal  action  was  taken  against  the  UK  over  the  war.  On  10  March,  military  chiefs  reportedly  asked  for  an  unequivocal  statement  about  the  legality  of  the  war  to  make  sure  troops  could  be  defended  in  a  court  of  law.  The  book,  being  serialised  in  the  Guardian  newspaper,  says  on  13  March  Lord  Goldsmith  met  then  Home  Office  Minister  Lord  Falconer  and  Downing  Street  adviser  Baroness  Morgan.  ""After  that  Downing  Street  proceeded  to  set  out  his  [Lord  Goldsmith's]  view  in  a  parliamentary  answer  which  was  then  published  on  17  March,""  said  Mr  Sands.  |||    Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  reiterated  calls  for  the  publication  of  the  full  legal  advice  given  by  the  Attorney  General,  warning:  ""This  issue  will  not  go  away.""  ""These  revelations  throw  an  intensive  spotlight  on  to  the  cavalier  way  in  which  this  government  operates  -  even  on  an  issue  as  important  as  peace  and  war.  ""The  government  needs  to  act  to  restore  public  confidence  and  trust.""  Liberal  Democrat  foreign  affairs  spokesman  Menzies  Campbell  repeated  his  party's  calls  for  Lord  Goldsmith's  first  piece  of  legal  advice  to  be  made  public.  ""The  public  interest,  which  the  government  claims  justifies  non-publication  of  the  whole  of  the  advice,  can  only  be  served  now  by  the  fullest  disclosure.""  |||    In  a  statement  to  Newsnight,  Lord  Goldsmith  said:  ""In  my  parliamentary  answer  on  March  17  2003,  I  explained  my  genuinely  held  independent  view,  that  military  action  was  lawful  under  the  existing  Security  Council  resolutions.  ""It  was  certainly  not  a  view  that  I  expressed  as  a  result  of  being  leaned  on  in  any  way,  nor  as  I  have  already  made  clear,  was  it  written  by  or  at  Number  10.""  The  prime  minister's  official  spokesman  also  rejected  the  claims,  saying:  ""The  attorney  general  made  it  clear  the  words  and  the  judgement  were  his.""  But  ex-foreign  secretary  Robin  Cook  says  all  the  advice  should  now  be  published.  He  said  the  claims  suggested  Parliament  had  only  received  a  pr&#233;cis  of  Lord  Goldsmith's  second  opinion  -  and  that  it  was  actually  drafted  in  No  10.  This  would  be  wrong  even  if  Lord  Goldsmith  had  signed  the  statement,  Mr  Cook  said,  because  the  attorney  general's  advice  should  be  an  ""independent  legal  opinion"",  not  subject  to  ""political  negotiation  of  this  kind""."

GM,  whose  own  European  operations  are  losing  money,  no  longer  wants  to  own  the  unprofitable  Fiat  unit.  Reports  of  deadlocked  talks  sent  Fiat  shares  down  1.2%  on  Tuesday,  after  Monday's  4%  gain  on  hopes  of  a  payoff.  The  US  firm  is  thought  to  be  offering  about  $2bn  (£1.06bn)  to  extricate  itself  from  the  arrangement.  It  has  argued  the  deal  was  voided  by  Fiat's  decision  to  sell  off  Fiat's  finance  arm  and  halve  GM's  stake  via  a  capital-raising  effort.  |||    The  2000  deal  resulted  from  a  race  between  GM  and  DaimlerChrysler  to  ally  with  Fiat.  The  German  firm  wanted  to  buy  Fiat  outright.  But  Gianni  Agnelli,  the  godfather  of  the  group,  wanted  to  keep  control,  and  preferred  GM's  offer  to  buy  a  20%  stake  and  give  Fiat  the  right  to  sell  in  the  future,  known  as  a  ""put  option"".  Since  then,  however,  Fiat  cars  have  lost  market  share  and  the  firm  has  piled  up  losses,  while  a  plan  to  raise  new  money  in  2003  cut  GM's  stake  in  half  to  10%.  For  its  part,  GM's  European  units  Opel  and  Saab  have  both  had  trouble,  with  Opel  management  threatening  to  cut  12,000  jobs.  ""The  last  thing  they  need  is  additional  production  capacity  in  Europe,""  said  Patrick  Juchemich,  auto  analyst  at  Sal  Oppenheim  Bank."

The  firms  denied  that  they  are  about  to  link  up,  but  said  they  are  examining  ways  of  working  more  closely  together.  SMFG  shares  climbed  by  2.7%  to  717,000,  and  Daiwa  added  5.3%  to  740  yen.  |||    Combining  SMFG,  Japan's  third-biggest  lender,  and  Daiwa,  the  country's  second-largest  brokerage  firm,  would  create  a  company  with  assets  of  more  than  $1,000bn  (£537bn).  SMFG  President  Yoshifumi  Nishikawa  said  that  the  companies  needed  to  bolster  their  businesses.  ""Both  companies  need  to  strengthen  retail  and  other  operations,""  he  said,  adding  that  ""it's  an  issue  we  have  in  common"".  Daiwa  said  that  ""although  it  is  true  that  the  two  groups  have  been  engaging  in  various  discussions  to  enhance  cooperation,  there  are  no  plans  to  enter  into  negotiations  to  consolidate  the  two  businesses"".  Analysts  said  that  consolidation  in  Japan's  financial  sector  was  likely  to  continue  and  that  it  was  likely  to  have  a  positive  impact  on  earnings.  ""Cross-selling  opportunities  between  banks  and  brokers  are  increasing  thanks  to  deregulation,  so  we  can  expect  the  relationship  to  get  even  stronger,""  said  Heronry  Nozaki,  an  analyst  at  NikkoCitigroup.  The  merger  ""would  be  a  good  move,""  he  added." 

2	"Opposition  grows  to  house  arrests  |||    The  Conservatives  have  expressed  ""serious  misgivings""  about  government  plans  for  keeping  UK  and  foreign  terror  suspects  under  house  arrest.  |||    Michael  Howard  said  he  would  not  back  the  Home  Secretary's  plans  for  ""control  orders""  which  include  home  detention.  ""I  do  not  believe  that  anyone  should  be  deprived  of  their  liberty  on  the  say  so  of  a  politician,""  he  said.  The  Lib  Dems  also  oppose  the  proposals,  but  ministers  insist  they  are  proportionate  to  the  terror  threat.  |||    The  government  proposed  the  idea  and  a  range  of  other  new  powers  after  the  laws  lords  said  current  detentions  without  trial  broke  human  rights  laws.  New  Metropolitan  Police  Commissioner  Sir  Ian  Blair  has  backed  the  control  orders,  saying:  ""I'm  sorry.  It  is  a  dilemma,  but  there  is  only  one  choice.""  But  Mr  Howard  said:  ""We  have  serious  misgivings  about  both  their  effectiveness  in  protecting  life  and  their  consequences  for  the  British  way  of  life.""  |||    He  argued  that  people  accused  of  terrorist  offences  should  be  brought  to  trial  and  be  held  in  prison  -  not  at  home  -  while  they  await  trial.  Mr  Howard  said  he  feared  ""internment  without  trial  creates  martyrs""  and  could  be  ""a  very  effective  recruiting  sergeant""  for  terrorists"".  His  party  plans  to  move  an  amendment  to  the  Serious  Organised  Crime  and  Police  Bill  next  week  that  would  give  a  judge  responsibility  for  assessing  evidence  and  ensuring  a  balanced  case  is  presented  to  the  court.  He  called  on  the  prime  minister  to  ""enter  into  constructive  discussions""  with  his  party  to  find  a  ""better  way  forward"".  Controversy  over  the  issue  continues  after  a  foreign  terror  suspect  held  in  the  UK  without  trial  or  charge  since  December  2001  was  freed  from  jail.  |||    Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  said  there  was  not  enough  evidence  to  keep  the  Egyptian  man,  known  only  as  C,  certified  as  a  terrorist  suspect.  On  Monday,  the  legal  team  for  two  Algerian  suspects  being  held  without  trial  told  a  court  the  men  did  not  want  bail  if  it  meant  being  put  under  house  arrest.  Most  of  the  terror  suspects  are  detained  at  Belmarsh  Prison  in  London.  The  Liberal  Democrats  say  they  also  oppose  house  arrests  and  questioned  the  human  rights  implications  of  the  measure.  Home  affairs  spokesman  Mark  Oaten  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme:  ""It's  a  matter  of  principle  for  us  that  we  can't  have  a  situation  where  the  Home  Secretary  is  able  to  impose  house  detention  now  on  UK  nationals  as  well  as  foreign  nationals.""  |||    The  Lib  Dems  believe  the  Home  Secretary  should  allow  phone  tapping  evidence  in  prosecutions.  ""We  think  there  could  be  a  role  for  some  form  of  control  order  -  tagging,  surveillance,  limitation  on  use  of  mobile  phones  -  but  not  with  the  Home  Secretary's  say  so.  That  must  be  done  with  a  proper  judicial  process,  a  judge  involved  in  making  those  decisions,""  said  Mr  Oaten.  Mr  Clarke  has  rejected  that  idea  saying  intercept  evidence  is  only  a  small  part  of  the  case  against  terror  suspects  and  could  put  the  lives  of  intelligence  sources  at  risk.  He  said  prosecutions  were  the  government's  first  preference  and  promised  the  powers  would  only  be  used  in  ""serious""  cases,  with  independent  scrutiny  from  judges."

Airbus  and  Boeing  accuse  each  other  of  benefiting  from  illegal  subsidies.  Mr  Mandelson  said  the  EU  and  US  hoped  to  avoid  having  to  resolve  the  dispute  at  the  World  Trade  Organisation  (WTO).  |||    ""With  this  agreement  the  EU  and  US  have  confirmed  their  willingness  to  resolve  the  dispute  which  has  arisen  between  them,""  Mr  Mandelson  said.  ""I  hope  our  negotiations  in  the  next  three  months  will  lead  to  an  agreement  ending  subsidies  to  development  and  production  of  large  civil  aircraft.""  Last  year,  the  US  terminated  an  agreement  with  the  EU,  reached  in  1992,  which  limits  the  subsidies  countries  can  hand  over  to  civil  aircraft  makers.  The  US  filed  a  complaint  against  Brussels  with  the  WTO  over  state  aid  to  Airbus,  prompting  a  retaliatory  EU  complaint  over  US  support  for  Boeing.  However,  both  sides  agreed  to  suspend  their  requests  for  WTO  arbitration  at  the  beginning  of  December,  to  allow  bilateral  talks  to  continue.  EADS  and  BAE  Systems,  the  European  defence  and  aerospace  firms  which  own  Airbus,  welcomed  Mr  Mandelson's  announcement.  ""It  has  always  been  preferable  that  any  differences  between  the  US  and  Europe  on  this  matter  be  overcome  through  constructive  discussion  rather  than  through  legal  recourse,""  the  companies  said  in  a  joint  statement.  |||    Separately,  the  world's  largest  package  delivery  company,  UPS,  said  it  had  placed  an  order  for  10  Airbus  A380  superjumbo  freight-carrying  jets,  with  an  option  to  buy  10  more  of  the  triple-decker  aircraft.  The  US  company  said  it  needed  to  expand  its  air  freight  capacity  following  strong  international  growth,  and  would  begin  receiving  deliveries  of  the  A380s  from  2009.  However,  UPS  said  it  was  cutting  a  previous  order  for  smaller  Airbus  A300s  from  90  planes  to  53.  So  far,  Airbus  has  delivered  40  A300s  to  UPS.  Airbus  overtook  Boeing  as  the  world's  largest  manufacturer  of  commercial  airliners  in  2003." 

2	"Pakistani  women  'must  not  hide'  |||    Hiding  women  away  in  the  home  hidden  behind  veils  is  a  backward  view  of  Islam,  President  Musharraf  of  Pakistan  has  said  during  a  visit  to  Britain.  |||    He  was  speaking  to  the  BBC's  Newsnight  programme  a  few  hours  before  visiting  the  Pakistani  community  in  Manchester.  ""My  wife  is  travelling  around.  She  is  very  religious  but  she  is  very  moderate,""  said  General  Musharraf.  It  comes  after  Pakistan's  High  Commissioner  to  Britain  said  some  Pakistanis  should  integrate  more.  Dr  Maleeha  Lodhi  said  people  could  not  expect  others  to  listen  to  their  grievances  if  they  isolated  themselves.  |||    Gen  Musharraf  told  the  BBC:  ""Some  people  think  that  the  women  should  be  confined  to  their  houses  and  put  veils  on  and  all  that  and  they  should  not  move  out  -  absolutely  wrong.""  The  Pakistani  president  was  also  asked  whether  he  thought  the  war  on  terror  had  made  the  world  less  safe.  ""Yes,  absolutely.  And  I  would  add  that  unfortunately  we  are  not  addressing  the  core  problems,  so  therefore  we  can  never  address  it  in  its  totality,""  he  said.  ""We  are  fighting  it  in  its  immediate  context  but  we  are  not  fighting  it  in  its  strategic  long-term  context.  |||    ""It  is  the  political  disputes  and  we  need  to  resolve  them,  and  also  the  issue  of  illiteracy  and  poverty.  This  combined  are  breeding  grounds  of  extremism  and  terrorism.""  On  Monday  the  Pakistani  president  met  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  at  10  Downing  Street,  on  his  first  official  visit  to  London.  He  is  due  to  visit  the  Pakistani  community  in  Manchester  on  Tuesday  afternoon.  |||    The  Mirror  newspaper  said  on  Tuesday  it  had  been  handed  a  sensitive  dossier  outling  the  details  of  Gen  Musharraf's  visit  to  Britain.  The  paper  said  the  document  had  been  found  in  a  London  street  by  a  member  of  the  public.  It  said  the  dossier  contained  details  about  his  movements  and  also  confidential  police  radio  channels,  call  signs  and  codes.  Speaking  in  London  on  Monday,  Gen  Musharraf  said  al-Qaeda  was  ""on  the  run""  in  Pakistan.  |||    But  standing  next  to  Mr  Blair  he  added  that  it  was  crucial  to  tackle  the  ""core  of  what  creates  terrorists,  what  creates  an  extremist,  militant  environment  which  then  leads  on  to  terrorism"".  ""That  is  the  resolution  of  political  disputes.""  |||    Mr  Blair  said  the  two  leaders  had  talked  about  Afghanistan,  the  wider  war  on  terror,  the  situation  in  the  Middle  East  and  the  ongoing  dispute  over  Kashmir.  ""We  agreed  that  in  Afghanistan  there  is  some  cause  for  optimism  about  the  progress  that  has  been  made  there,""  said  Mr  Blair.  ""In  respect  of  Iraq,  we  agreed  that  whatever  the  issues  of  the  past,  the  important  thing  now  is  to  see  the  strategy  through  and  ensure  that  Iraq  is  capable  of  becoming  a  stable  and  democratic  state.""" 

0	"Bush  to  outline  'toughest'  budget  |||    President  Bush  is  to  send  his  toughest  budget  proposals  to  date  to  the  US  Congress,  seeking  large  cuts  in  domestic  spending  to  lower  the  deficit.  |||    About  150  federal  programs  could  be  cut  or  axed  altogether  as  part  of  a  $2.5  trillion  (£1.3  trillion)  package  aimed  at  curbing  the  giant  US  budget  deficit.  Defence  spending  will  rise,  however,  while  the  proposals  exclude  the  cost  of  continuing  military  operations  in  Iraq.  Vice-President  Dick  Cheney  said  the  budget  was  the  ""tightest""  so  far.  |||    At  the  heart  of  the  administration's  fifth  budget,  presented  to  Congress  on  Monday,  is  an  austere  package  of  domestic  measures.  These  would  see  discretionary  spending  rise  below  the  projected  level  of  inflation.  |||    Such  belt-tightening  is  designed  to  tackle  the  massive  budget  deficit  increases  of  President  Bush's  first  term.  Mr  Cheney  admitted  that  the  budget  was  the  toughest  of  the  Bush  Presidency  but  argued  it  was  ""fair  and  responsible"".  ""It  is  not  something  we  have  done  with  a  meat  axe,  nor  are  we  suddenly  turning  our  back  on  the  most  needy  people  in  our  society,""  he  said.  The  wars  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan,  increased  expenditure  on  national  security  after  9/11  and  the  2001  recession  wiped  out  the  budget  surplus  inherited  by  President  Bush  in  2001  and  turned  it  into  a  record  deficit.  The  shortfall  is  projected  to  rise  to  $427bn  in  2005.  |||    Education,  environmental  protection  and  transport  initiatives  are  set  to  be  scaled  back  as  a  first  step  towards  reducing  the  deficit  to  $230bn  by  2009.  |||    Most  controversially,  the  government  is  seeking  to  cut  the  Medicaid  budget,  which  provides  health  care  to  the  nation's  poorest,  by  $45bn  and  to  reduce  farm  subsidies  by  $587m.  Spending  on  defence  and  homeland  security  is  set  to  increase,  although  not  by  as  much  as  originally  planned.  President  Bush's  proposals  would  see  the  Pentagon's  budget  rise  by  $19bn  to  $419.3bn  while  homeland  security  would  get  an  extra  $2bn.  |||    The  budget  does  not  include  the  cost  of  running  military  operations  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan,  for  which  the  administration  in  expected  to  seek  an  extra  $80bn  from  Congress  later  this  year.  |||    Also  not  featuring  in  the  proposals  is  the  cost  of  funding  the  administration's  radical  proposed  overhaul  of  social  security  provision.  Some  expects  believe  this  could  require  borrowing  of  up  to  $4.5bn  trillion  over  a  twenty  year  period.  Despite  the  Republicans  holding  a  majority  in  both  houses  of  Congress,  the  proposals  will  be  fiercely  contested  over  the  next  few  months.  |||    John  McCain,  a  Republican  Senator,  said  he  was  pleased  the  administration  was  prepared  to  tackle  the  deficit.  ""With  the  deficits  that  we  are  now  running,  I  am  glad  the  president  is  coming  over  with  a  very  austere  budget,""  he  said.  However,  Democratic  Senator  Kent  Conrad  said  the  proposals  exposed  the  country  to  huge  financial  commitments  beyond  2009.  ""The  cost  of  everything  he  [President  Bush]  advocates  explodes,""  he  said." 

1	"Last  Star  Wars  'not  for  children'  |||    The  sixth  and  final  Star  Wars  movie  may  not  be  suitable  for  young  children,  film-maker  George  Lucas  has  said.  |||    He  told  US  TV  show  60  Minutes  that  Revenge  of  the  Sith  would  be  the  darkest  and  most  violent  of  the  series.  ""I  don't  think  I  would  take  a  five  or  six-year-old  to  this,""  he  told  the  CBS  programme,  to  be  aired  on  Sunday.  Lucas  predicted  the  film  would  get  a  US  rating  advising  parents  some  scenes  may  be  unsuitable  for  under-13s.  It  opens  in  the  UK  and  US  on  19  May.  He  said  he  expected  the  film  would  be  classified  PG-13  -  roughly  equivalent  to  a  British  12A  rating.  |||    The  five  previous  Star  Wars  films  have  all  carried  less  restrictive  PG  -  parental  guidance  -  ratings  in  the  US.  In  the  UK,  they  have  all  been  passed  U  -  suitable  for  all  -  with  the  exception  of  Attack  of  The  Clones,  which  got  a  PG  rating  in  2002.  Revenge  of  the  Sith  -  the  third  prequel  to  the  original  1977  Star  Wars  film  -  chronicles  the  transformation  of  the  heroic  Anakin  Skywalker  into  the  evil  Darth  Vader  as  he  travels  to  a  Hell-like  planet  composed  of  erupting  volcanoes  and  molten  lava.  ""We're  going  to  watch  him  make  a  pact  with  the  devil,""  Lucas  said.  ""The  film  is  much  more  dark,  more  emotional.  It's  much  more  of  a  tragedy.""" 

0	"Business  fears  over  sluggish  EU  economy  |||    As  European  leaders  gather  in  Rome  on  Friday  to  sign  the  new  EU  constitution,  many  companies  will  be  focusing  on  matters  much  closer  to  home  -  namely  how  to  stay  in  business.  |||    Lille  is  a  popular  tourist  destination  for  Britons  who  want  a  taste  of  France  at  the  weekend.  But  how  many  tourists  look  at  the  impressively  grand  Victorian  Chambre  de  Commerce,  which  stands  beside  the  Opera  House,  and  consider  that  it  was  built  -  like  the  town  halls  in  many  northern  English  towns  -  on  the  wealth  created  by  coal,  steel  and  textiles?  Like  northern  England  and  industrial  Scotland,  those  industries  have  been  in  long  term  decline  -  the  last  coal  pit  closed  in  1990.  Beck-Crespel  is  a  specialist  steel  firm  in  Armentieres,  about  20  miles  from  Lille.  The  company  has  not  laid  off  a  worker  since  1945.  It  specialises  in  making  bolts  and  fixings  for  power  stations  and  the  oil  industry,  but  not  many  of  those  are  being  built  in  Europe  these  days.  |||    Director  Hugues  Charbonnier  says  he  is  under  pressure  because  factories  in  the  Far  East  are  able  to  make  some  of  his  output  more  cheaply,  while  his  key  markets  are  now  in  China  and  India.  ""In  our  business  the  market  is  absolutely  global,  you  can  not  imagine  living  with  our  size  (of  business)  even  within  an  enlarged  European  Union,  (if  we  did  that)  we  would  need  not  350  people  but  perhaps  just  150  or  200,""  he  says.  It  isn't  just  globalisation  that  is  hurting;  the  law  in  France  means  workers  are  paid  for  a  39  hour  week  even  though  they  work  just  35  hours.  But  at  least  there  is  still  a  steel  industry.  Coal  has  now  totally  vanished  and  textiles  are  struggling.  New  business  has  been  attracted,  but  not  enough  to  make  up  the  difference.  |||    That  is  one  reason  why  people  here  are  not  great  fans  of  the  EU,  says  Frederic  Sawicki,  a  politics  lecturer  at  the  University  of  Lille.  |||    ""In  the  region  today  the  unemployment  rate  is  12%,  in  some  areas  it  is  15%.  They  don't  see  what  Europe  is  doing  for  them,  so  there  is  a  kind  of  euro  scepticism,  especially  in  the  working  classes,""  he  says.  Which  is  strange  because  Lille  is  at  the  crossroads  of  Europe  -  if  anywhere  should  be  benefiting  from  the  euro  it  is  here.  The  euro  was  designed  to  increase  trade  within  the  eurozone,  but  the  biggest  increase  in  trade  has  been  with  the  rest  of  the  world.  Much  of  that  trade  passes  through  the  world's  largest  port,  Rotterdam,  in  Holland,  home  to  specialist  crane  maker  Huisman  Itrec.  Its  cranes  help  build  oil  rigs  and  lifted  the  sunken  Russian  submarine  Kursk  from  the  sea  bed,  but  Huisman  Itrec  is  now  setting  up  a  factory  in  China,  where  costs  are  cheaper  and  its  main  customers  are  closer.  |||    Boss  Henk  Addink  blames  the  low  growth  rate  in  Europe  for  the  lack  of  orders  closer  to  home.  ""In  the  US  growth  is  something  like  6%,  in  China  they  are  estimating  15%,  and  in  the  EU  it  is  more  or  less  1%,""  he  says.  Mr  Addink  blames  the  euro  for  stifling  demand.  He  much  preferred  the  old  currencies  of  Europe,  which  moved  in  relation  to  each  country's  economic  performance.  In  Germany,  industry  is  exporting  more  these  days,  but  the  economy  as  a  whole  is  once  again  mired  in  slow  growth  and  high  unemployment.  Growth  is  likely  to  peak  this  year  at  just  under  2%.  In  Britain  that  would  be  a  bad  year;  in  Germany  it  is  one  of  the  best  in  recent  years.  With  Germany  making  up  a  third  of  the  eurozone's  economy,  this  is  a  major  problem.  If  Germany  doesn't  once  again  become  the  powerhouse  of  Europe,  growth  across  the  bloc  is  never  going  to  be  as  strong  as  it  could  be.  However,  at  one  factory  near  the  Dutch  border  things  are  changing.  |||    The  Siemens  plant  at  Boscholt  makes  cordless  phones  and  employs  2,000  staff.  Staff  have  started  working  an  extra  four  hours  a  week  for  no  extra  pay,  after  Siemens  threatened  to  take  the  factory  and  their  jobs  to  Hungary.  Factory  manager  Herbert  Stueker  says  that  he  now  hopes  to  increase  productivity  ""by  nearly  30%"".  But  Germany  needs  much  more  reform  if  all  its  industry  is  to  compete  with  places  such  Hungary  or  China.  The  Government  is  reforming  the  labour  market  and  cutting  the  generous  unemployment  system,  but  the  real  solution  is  to  cut  the  wages  of  low  skilled  workers,  says  Helmut  Schneider,  director  of  the  Institute  for  the  Study  of  Labour  at  Bonn  University.  ""Labour  is  too  costly  in  Germany,  especially  for  the  low  skilled  labour  and  this  is  the  main  problem.  If  we  could  solve  that  problem  we  could  cut  unemployment  by  half,""  he  says.  The  EU  set  itself  the  target  of  being  the  most  efficient  economy  in  the  world  by  2010.  Four  years  into  that  process,  and  the  target  seems  further  away  than  ever."

The  Lib  Dems  called  for  Commons  leader  Peter  Hain  to  make  a  statement  and  said  chancellors  had  resigned  over  leaks.  They  were  told  it  would  be  brought  to  Speaker  Michael  Martin's  attention.  In  the  Commons,  Tory  frontbencher  Andrew  Tyrie  MP  demanded  an  immediate  ministerial  statement  about  how  measures  had  been  ""clearly,  or  at  least  apparently,  leaked  to  the  Evening  Standard"".  |||    Raising  a  point  of  order,  he  said  it  was  ""the  latest  in  a  long  line  of  discourtesies  to  this  House"",  as  well  as  a  breach  of  confidentiality.  He  said:  ""I  can  only  hope  it  is  unintentional.  If  it  were  planned  it  would  be  a  very  grave  matter  indeed.  A  previous  Labour  chancellor  resigned  after  he  leaked  the  Budget.""  Hugh  Dalton  resigned  after  leaking  details  of  his  1947  budget  to  journalist  John  Carvel,  who  published  them  in  a  London  newspaper,  just  minutes  before  they  were  announced  to  the  House  of  Commons.

1	"Berlin  hails  European  cinema  |||    Organisers  say  this  year's  Berlin  Film  Festival,  which  opens  on  Thursday  with  period  epic  Man  to  Man,  will  celebrate  a  revitalised  European  cinema.  |||    Of  the  21  films  in  competition  for  the  Golden  and  Silver  Bear  awards,  more  than  half  are  from  Europe  with  France  particularly  well  represented.  Festival  director  Dieter  Kosslick  says  this  strong  showing  signals  ""a  new  consciousness  for  European  films"".  ""They're  on  an  incredible  winning  streak,""  he  told  the  Reuters  agency.  ""This  isn't  to  say  there  aren't  any  good  American  films,""  he  continued.  ""It's  just  that  there  are  more  good  European  films.""  |||    However,  Mr  Kosslick  refused  to  accept  that  widespread  opposition  to  the  Iraq  war  had  turned  audiences  against  Hollywood  imports.  ""There  is  no  anti-American  mood,""  he  said.  Some  350  films  will  be  screened  at  this  year's  festival,  with  a  further  300  shown  at  the  European  Film  Market  that  runs  alongside  it.  More  than  a  dozen  celebrities  are  scheduled  to  attend,  among  them  Will  Smith,  Kevin  Spacey  and  Keanu  Reeves.

""I'm  not  worried  that  we  won't  be  able  to  fill  the  red  carpet  with  stars,""  he  said,  though  he  admitted  the  festival  may  be  moved  to  January  next  year  to  avoid  a  similar  clash.

In  the  fourth  quarter  alone  Ford  reported  net  income  of  $104m,  compared  with  a  loss  of  $793m  a  year  ago.  But  its  auto  unit  made  a  loss.  Fourth  quarter  turnover  was  $44.7bn,  compared  to  $45.9bn  a  year  ago.  |||    Though  car  and  truck  loan  profits  saved  the  day,  Ford's  auto  unit  made  a  pre-tax  loss  of  $470m  in  the  fourth  quarter  (compared  to  a  profit  of  £13m  in  the  year-ago  period)  and  its  US  sales  dipped  3.8%.  |||    Yesterday  General  Motor's  results  also  showed  its  finance  unit  was  a  strong  contributor  to  profits.  However,  Ford  is  working  hard  to  revitalise  its  product  portfolio,  unveiling  the  Fusion  and  Zephyr  models  at  the  International  Motor  Show  in  Detroit.  It  also  brought  out  a  number  of  new  models  in  the  second  half  of  2004.  ""In  2004,  our  company  gained  momentum,  delivering...more  new  products,  and  more  innovative  breakthroughs,  such  as  the  Escape  Hybrid,  the  industry's  first  full-hybrid  sport  utility  vehicle,""  said  chairman  and  chief  executive  officer  Bill  Ford.""  |||    ""We  also  confronted  operating  challenges  with  our  Jaguar  brand  and  high  industry  marketing  costs,""  he  added.  But  Ford  declined  to  provide  guidance  for  first  quarter  2005.  It  will  do  so  at  a  presentation  in  New  York  on  26  January.  In  addition,  the  company  said  2004  net  income  was  affected  by  a  fourth-quarter  pre-tax  charge  taken  to  reduce  the  value  of  a  receivable  owed  to  Ford  by  Visteon,  a  former  subsidiary.  Recent  new  models  introduced  by  Ford  include  the  Ford  Five  Hundred  and  Mercury  Montego  sedans,  the  Ford  Freestyle  crossover,  the  Ford  Mustang,  the  Land  Rover  LR3/Discovery,  and  Volvo  S40  and  V50  in  North  America  and  Europe.

2	"New  'yob'  targets  to  be  unveiled  |||    Fifty  new  areas  getting  special  help  to  fight  anti-social  behaviour  in  England  and  Wales  will  be  named  on  Thursday.  |||    Ten  areas  have  already  had  access  to  special  prosecutors  and  local  experts  and  the  government  is  now  expanding  the  crackdown  to  more  towns  and  cities.  Details  of  how  many  anti-social  behaviour  orders  (Asbos)  were  used  in  the  last  year  are  also  being  published.  Labour  sees  nuisance  behaviour  as  a  key  election  issue  but  critics  claim  the  record  is  at  best  patchy.  A  year  ago,  ministers  launched  their  anti-social  behaviour  plan  and  Thursday's  figures  offer  a  progress  check.  They  will  say  that  in  the  past  year  more  than  2,600  anti-social  behaviour  orders  were  issued  by  the  courts  -  more  than  double  the  total  used  in  the  previous  four  years.  |||    Police  have  also  closed  150  crack  houses  and  issued  more  than  400  dispersal  orders,  breaking  up  groups  of  youths  in  public  places.  The  50  new  pilot  areas  to  get  special  attention  will  also  receive  extra  government  funding.  Exeter  and  Cardiff  are  among  cities  who  have  voiced  interest  in  being  involved.  |||    Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  is  also  expected  to  announce  new  measures  to  strengthen  the  use  of  Asbos  and  fixed  penalty  notices.  There  are  still  concerns  that  some  areas  of  the  country  are  not  using  the  powers  properly.  |||    He  is  expected  to  say  that  the  new  figures  were  heartening  but  he  would  not  rest  until  similar  action  was  taken  in  all  areas  of  the  country  where  it  was  needed.  ""We  have  not  defeated  this  problem  by  any  means,  but  shown  together  what  can  be  done,""  he  will  say.  Mr  Blair  this  week  defended  the  shake-up  of  the  licensing  laws,  saying  it  was  right  to  focus  on  troublemakers  rather  than  treating  everybody  as  a  potential  drunken  nuisance.  |||    Ministers  also  boast  of  record  police  numbers  and  are  speeding  up  plans  to  put  in  place  25,000  community  support  officers  (CSOs).  But  researchers  from  Leeds  University  warned  that  CSOs  could  undermine  traditional  bonds  between  police  officers  and  communities.  More  work  needed  to  be  done  on  clarifying  the  role  of  different  agencies  and  how  they  linked  together  before  CSOs,  they  argued  in  a  the  study.  Critics  of  the  government  say  it  has  announced  more  than  20  initiatives  to  tackle  nuisance  behaviour  when  the  real  focus  should  be  on  good  policing.  Home  Office  Minister  Hazel  Blears  also  revealed  this  week  that  ""about  a  third""  of  Asbos  were  breached  -  with  some  people  jailed  and  others  not."

Mills  could  ""hardly  stand  up,  let  alone  play"",  said  an  REM  spokesman,  who  added  he  is  now  ""resting""  in  hospital.  The  remainder  of  the  band  played  a  short  acoustic  set  on  Monday.  Tuesday's  gig  has  been  rescheduled  for  15  June.  Those  who  had  a  ticket  for  the  show  in  Glasgow  are  being  advised  to  retain  their  ticket  stub  so  they  can  attend  the  new  date.  The  band's  spokesman  said  that  they  would  review  their  remaining  dates  on  a  ""day-to-day  basis"",  based  on  doctors'  advice  to  Mills.  ""Obviously  we  all  want  Mike  to  get  better,  and  clearly  we  all  want  to  play  the  shows.  Rest  assured  we  will  do  so  as  soon  as  possible,""  he  said.  |||    The  band  were  still  hopeful  they  would  be  able  to  make  their  Wednesday  date,  added  the  spokesman.  REM  played  accoustic  versions  of  their  hits  Losing  My  Religion,  I've  Been  High,  Leaving  New  York  and  The  One  I  Love  to  the  Sheffield  Arena  audience  on  Monday.  The  band  had  originally  been  scheduled  to  play  four  dates  in  the  UK  as  part  of  a  world  tour.  In  1995  former  drummer  Bill  Berry  collapsed  in  Switzerland  while  the  band  was  on  tour,  having  suffered  a  ruptured  aneurysm.  He  made  a  full  recovery,  only  to  leave  the  band  two  years  later."

Despite  struggling  since  it  was  opened  in  1992,  EuroDisney  has  recently  made  progress  in  turning  its  business  around  and  ticket  sales  have  picked  up.  However,  analysts  still  question  whether  it  attracts  enough  visitors  to  stay  open,  even  with  the  restructuring.  |||    EuroDisney  remains  Europe's  largest  single  tourist  attraction,  attracting  some  12.4  million  visitors  annually.  A  new  attraction  -  Walt  Disney  Studios  -  has  recently  opened  its  site  near  Paris.  The  company's  currently  traded  stock  tumbled  in  Paris  on  the  latest  news,  shedding  15%  to  22  euro  cents.  EuroDisney  will  sell  the  new  shares  priced  at  9  euros  cents  each.  The  US  Disney  Corporation  and  Saudi  Arabian  prince  Al-Walid  bin  Talal,  the  firm's  two  main  shareholders,  will  buy  the  new  stock.  The  restructuring  deal  is  the  second  in  the  firm's  troubled  financial  history;  its  finances  were  first  reorganised  in  1994."

In  October,  Mr  Straw  and  his  Spanish  counterpart  Miguel  Moratinos  agreed  to  establish  a  body  that  would  give  Gibraltarians  a  voice  in  their  future.  Most  Gibraltarians  said  in  a  referendum  they  wanted  to  remain  British.  |||    Gibraltar's  Chief  Minister  Peter  Caruana  will  represent  the  British  citizens  living  on  the  Rock,  while  Britain's  Europe  Director  Dominick  Chilcott  will  represent  the  UK.  Madrid  is  being  represented  by  Spain's  director  general  for  Europe,  Jose  Maria  Pons.  The  initiative  follows  Spain's  socialist  government's  decision  to  put  its  long-standing  sovereignty  ambitions  on  hold.  Gibraltarians  rejected  plans  for  the  Rock's  sovereignty  to  be  shared  between  Britain  and  Spain  in  a  referendum  organised  by  Gibraltar  government." 

1	"Hobbit  picture  'four  years  away'  |||    Lord  of  the  Rings  director  Peter  Jackson  has  said  that  it  will  be  up  to  four  years  before  he  starts  work  on  a  film  version  of  The  Hobbit.  |||    The  Oscar  winner  said  on  a  visit  to  Sydney  there  was  a  ""desire""  to  make  it,  but  not  before  lengthy  negotiations.  ""I  think  it's  gonna  be  a  lot  of  lawyers  sitting  in  a  room  trying  to  thrash  out  a  deal  before  it  will  ever  happen,""  said  the  New  Zealander.  The  rights  to  JRR  Tolkien's  book  are  split  between  two  major  film  studios.  Jackson,  who  is  currently  filming  a  remake  of  Hollywood  classic  King  Kong,  said  he  thought  that  the  sale  of  MGM  studios  to  the  Sony  Corporation  would  cast  further  uncertainty  on  the  project.  The  43-year-old  was  in  the  Australian  city  to  visit  a  Lord  of  the  Rings  exhibition,  which  has  attracted  140,000  visitors  since  it  opened  in  December.  |||    The  film-maker  recently  sued  film  company  New  Line  Cinema  for  undisclosed  damages  over  alleged  withheld  profits  and  lost  revenue  from  the  first  part  of  the  Middle  Earth  trilogy.  The  Fellowship  of  The  Ring  from  2001  went  on  to  make  worldwide  profits  of  $291  million  (£152  million).  Jackson  is  thought  to  have  secured  the  most  lucrative  film  directing  deal  in  history  to  remake  King  Kong,  which  is  currently  in  production  in  Wellington.  The  picture,  which  stars  Naomi  Watts  and  Oscar  winner  Adrien  Brody,  is  due  to  be  released  in  December.  Jackson  has  also  committed  to  making  a  film  version  of  Lovely  Bones,  based  on  the  best-selling  book  by  Alice  Sebold."

Past  Eurovision  performers  include  Abba,  Celine  Dion,  Bucks  Fizz,  Nana  Mouskouri,  Lulu  and  Julio  Iglesias.  Fans  will  then  vote  as  usual  to  pick  the  all-time  best  Eurovision  song  during  the  show  in  Denmark  in  October.  The  first  contest  was  organised  by  the  European  Broadcasting  Union,  or  EBU,  in  1956,  and  has  become  an  annual  event  pitting  pop  giants  against  musical  minnows  -  with  often  surprising  results.  |||    While  some  regard  it  as  an  essential  celebration  of  continental  talent,  others  see  it  as  an  equally  unmissable  parade  of  the  reasons  some  countries  do  not  normally  produce  international  stars.  The  50th  annual  contest  will  be  held  in  Kiev,  Ukraine,  in  May,  after  Ukrainian  singer  Ruslana  won  last  year.  The  50th  anniversary  special  will  be  held  in  Denmark  later  this  year  because  the  Danish  Broadcasting  Corporation  came  up  with  the  idea  for  the  all-time  contest.  A  plan  to  hold  it  in  London  was  scrapped  because  of  problems  finding  a  suitable  venue.  Ireland  has  been  the  most  successful  country  in  the  show's  history  with  seven  victories,  followed  by  the  UK,  France  and  Luxembourg  with  five  each."

He  was  not  hurt  in  the  mugging  on  Saturday  evening.  Several  people  are  being  questioned  over  the  attack.  He  was  in  Kenya  before  travelling  to  Sudan  with  the  Parliamentary  committee.  Local  police  were  said  to  be  ""surprised""  he  was  in  the  area.  Mr  Davies,  60,  said  the  mugging  occurred  100  yards  from  the  Nairobi  Serena  Hotel  and  equally  close  to  the  Anglican  Cathedral  in  the  centre  of  the  city  at  dusk.  |||    He  said  in  a  statement:  ""It  was  a  frightening  experience.  ""Six  men  managed  to  steal  up  on  me  and  grab  me  from  behind.  ""I  knew  I  had  to  stay  very  calm  and  passive  -  you  cannot  fight  six  men"".  He  had  to  spend  an  extra  24  hours  in  Nairobi  before  rejoining  the  rest  of  the  House  of  Commons  International  Development  Committee  in  Dafur  after  the  mugging.  ""Naturally,  I  was  afraid  they  would  use  a  knife  or  gun,  though  they  never  produced  any  weapon,""  he  said.  ""Two  of  them  held  me  from  behind  and  two  others  held  my  legs  and  another  one  expertly  rifled  all  my  pockets.""" 

2	"'Few  ready'  for  information  act  |||    Thousands  of  public  bodies  are  ill-prepared  for  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act,  due  to  come  into  force  next  month,  because  of  government  failures,  say  MPs.  |||    From  next  month  anyone  will  have  the  power  to  demand  information  from  a  range  of  public  bodies  -  from  Whitehall  departments  to  doctors'  surgeries.  But  an  all-party  committee  said  it  was  ""not  confident""  many  would  be  ready.  It  blamed  the  Department  for  Constitutional  Affairs  for  a  ""lack  of  consistent  leadership"".  |||    The  Act  comes  into  effect  in  England,  Wales  and  Northern  Ireland,  on  1  January  while  similar  measures  are  being  brought  in  at  the  same  time  in  Scotland.  It  provides  the  public  with  a  right  of  access  to  information  held  by  about  100,000  public  bodies,  subject  to  various  exemptions.  |||    But  the  government  department  responsible  for  implementing  the  change  suffered  from  an  ""unusually  high  turnover""  of  staff  within  the  department,  which  had  ""seriously  interfered""  with  its  work,  said  the  Constitutional  Affairs  Select  Committee.  It  said,  despite  four  years  of  preparations,  some  local  authorities  and  parts  of  the  health  sector  were  still  not  ready.  The  DCA  had  ""failed""  to  provide  early  guidance  on  technical  matters  and  shown  a  ""lack  of  consistent  leadership"",  the  MPs  found.  Committee  chairman  Alan  Beith  said:  ""The  DCA  has  had  four  years  to  prepare  for  freedom  of  information,  but  with  less  than  a  month  to  go  it  appears  that  some  bodies  may  not  be  well  enough  prepared.  ""Our  report  shows  that  in  the  past  support  and  guidance  from  the  DCA,  which  has  overall  responsibility  for  guiding  the  public  sector  through  the  process  of  implementation  for  the  freedom  of  information  regime,  has  been  lacking.""  A  spokesman  for  the  DCA  said:  ""The  DCA  has  provided  -  and  will  continue  to  provide  -  strong,  clear  leadership.  ""It  has  delivered  a  simple,  liberal  fees  regime,  guidance  on  the  Act  which  has  been  widely  praised,  and  expert  networks  of  staff  working  on  freedom  of  information  implementation.""" 

2	"Retirement  age  could  be  scrapped  |||    The  ""myth  that  ageing  is  a  barrier""  to  contributing  to  society  needs  to  be  ""exploded"",  the  work  and  pensions  minister  has  said.  |||    This  was  why  the  government  was  considering  scrapping  the  retirement  age  entirely,  Alan  Johnson  said.  It  was  also  committed  to  ""stamping  out""  age  discrimination  and  would  outlaw  it,  he  told  a  conference  on  ageing.  All  three  parties  have  been  wooing  older  voters  with  both  the  Tories  and  Lib  Dems  pledging  higher  pensions.  |||    Mr  Johnson  told  Age  Concern's  Age  Agenda  in  London  the  government  was  ""seriously  considering""  introducing  pensions  based  on  residency  rather  than  national  insurance  contributions.  This  idea  has  been  adopted  by  the  Lib  Dems  as  policy,  while  the  Tories  have  pledged  to  boost  pensions  by  restoring  the  link  between  earnings  and  pensions.  Mr  Johnson's  speech  comes  after  he  last  week  unveiled  plans  to  find  a  consensus  on  how  to  reform  the  country's  pension  system.  This  would  be  based  on  a  series  of  principles  including  tackling  pensioner  poverty  and  fairer  pensions  for  women,  he  said.  Speaking  at  the  London  conference  he  said:  ""Generalised  stereotypes  of  people  past  state  pension  age  as  dependant,  incapable  and  vulnerable  are  a  particularly  pernicious  form  of  age  discrimination"".  |||    The  government  wanted  to  tackle  this  by  moving  to  a  culture  where  retirement  ages  were  ""increasingly  consigned  to  the  past"".  ""We're  sweeping  them  away  entirely  for  people  under  65,  and  we're  giving  those  above  that  age  a  right  to  request  to  work  past  65  which  their  employers  will  have  to  engage  with  seriously.  ""And  the  review  in  2011,  which  will  look  at  whether  it  is  time  to  sweep  retirement  ages  away  entirely,  is  to  be  tied  to  evidence  ...  showing  that  retirement  ages  are  increasingly  outmoded"".  Mr  Johnson  said  his  department  had  a  long-term  aspiration  of  moving  towards  an  80%  employment  rate.  This  would  involve  an  extra  one  million  older  people  joining  the  work  force,  he  said." 

0	"India  widens  access  to  telecoms  |||    India  has  raised  the  limit  for  foreign  direct  investment  in  telecoms  companies  from  49%  to  74%.  |||    Communications  Minister  Dayanidhi  Maran  said  that  there  is  a  need  to  fund  the  fast-growing  mobile  market.  The  government  hopes  to  increase  the  number  of  mobile  users  from  95  million  to  between  200  and  250  million  by  2007.  ""We  need  at  least  $20bn  (£10.6bn)  in  investment  and  part  of  this  has  to  come  as  foreign  direct  investment,""  said  Mr  Maran.  The  decision  to  raise  the  limit  for  foreign  investors  faced  considerable  opposition  from  the  communist  parties,  which  give  crucial  support  to  the  coalition  headed  by  Prime  Minister  Manmohan  Singh.  Potential  foreign  investors  will  however  need  government  approval  before  they  increase  their  stake  beyond  49%,  Mr  Maran  said.  Key  positions,  such  as  those  of  chief  executive,  chief  technology  officer  and  chief  financial  officer  are  to  be  held  by  Indians,  he  added.  |||    Analysts  and  investors  have  welcomed  the  government  decision.  ""It  is  a  positive  development  for  carriers  and  the  investment  community,  looking  to  take  a  longer-term  view  of  the  huge  growth  in  the  Indian  telecoms  market,""  said  Gartner's  principal  analyst  Kobita  Desai.  ""The  FDI  relaxation  coupled  with  rapid  local  market  growth  could  really  ignite  interest  in  the  Indian  telecommunication  industry,""  added  Ernst  and  Young's  Sanjay  Mehta.  Investment  bank  Morgan  Stanley  has  forecast  that  India's  mobile  market  is  likely  to  grow  by  about  40%  a  year  until  2007.  The  Indian  mobile  market  is  currently  dominated  by  four  companies,  Bharti  Televentures  which  has  allied  itself  with  Singapore  Telecom,  Essar  which  is  linked  with  Hong  Kong-based  Hutchison  Whampoa,  the  Sterling  group  and  the  Tata  group." 

2	"Blair  rejects  Iraq  advice  calls  |||    Tony  Blair  has  rejected  calls  for  the  publication  of  advice  on  the  legality  of  the  Iraq  war  amid  growing  calls  for  an  investigation.  |||    The  prime  minister  told  his  monthly  press  conference  the  matter  had  been  dealt  with  by  the  Attorney  General.  Earlier,  Conservative  MP  Michael  Mates  joined  calls  for  a  probe  into  claims  Lord  Goldsmith's  statement  to  Parliament  was  drawn  up  at  Number  10.  Mr  Blair  said  the  statement  was  a  ""fair  summary""  of  Lord  Goldsmith's  opinion.  |||    ""That's  what  he  (Lord  Goldsmith)  said  and  that's  what  I  say.  He  has  dealt  with  this  time  and  time  and  time  again,""  Mr  Blair  told  his  monthly  news  conference  in  Downing  Street.  He  refused  to  answer  further  questions  on  the  issue,  saying  it  had  been  dealt  with  ""literally  scores  of  times  and  the  position  has  not  changed"".  Lord  Goldsmith  has  denied  being  ""leaned  on""  and  says  the  words  written  were  his.  |||    The  government  refuses  to  publish  his  advice  on  the  legality  of  the  war  -  saying  such  papers  have  always  been  kept  confidential.  Mr  Mates,  who  is  a  member  of  the  Commons  intelligence  and  security  committee  and  was  part  of  the  Butler  inquiry  into  pre-war  intelligence,  told  the  BBC  on  Friday:  ""That,  as  a  general  rule,  is  right,  but  it's  not  an  absolute  rule.""  He  said  there  had  been  other  occasions  when  advice  had  been  published,  most  recently  regarding  Prince  Charles's  marriage  plans.  The  government  could  not  pick  and  choose  when  to  use  the  convention,  he  said.  |||    Mr  Mates  added:  ""We  discovered  that  there  were  two  or  three  occasions  in  the  past  when  law  officers'  advice  to  the  government  has  been  published.  ""And  this  may  be  one  of  those  special  occasions...  when  it  would  be  in  the  public  interest  to  see  the  advice  which  the  attorney  general  gave  to  the  prime  minister.""  This  is  argument  was  rejected  by  Mr  Blair,  who  said:  ""Firstly,  we  haven't  broken  the  precedent,  and  secondly  Peter  Goldsmith  has  made  his  statement  and  I  have  got  absolutely  nothing  to  add  to  it.""  In  a  book  published  this  week,  Philippe  Sands  QC,  a  member  of  Cherie  Blair's  Matrix  Chambers,  says  Lord  Goldsmith  warned  Tony  Blair  on  7  March  2003  that  the  Iraq  war  could  be  illegal  without  a  second  UN  resolution  sanctioning  military  action.  |||    But  a  short  statement  about  Lord  Goldsmith's  position  was  presented  in  a  written  parliamentary  answer  on  17  March  2003  -  just  before  a  crucial  Commons  vote  on  the  military  action.  Mr  Sands'  book  suggests  it  was  actually  written  by  Home  Office  Minister  Lord  Falconer  and  Downing  Street  adviser  Baroness  Morgan.  Former  minister  Clare  Short,  who  resigned  from  the  government  over  the  Iraq  war,  said  it  was  the  same  statement  that  was  earlier  shown  to  the  cabinet  as  it  discussed  military  action.  She  told  the  BBC  the  full  advice  should  have  been  attached,  according  to  the  ministerial  code.  |||    ""My  view  is  we  need  the  House  of  Lords  to  set  up  a  special  committee,  summon  the  attorney,  get  all  the  papers  out,  look  at  exactly  what  happened,""  she  said.  The  Conservatives  and  Liberal  Democrats  say  they  want  the  publication  of  the  full  legal  advice  given  by  the  Attorney  General.  On  Thursday,  Lord  Goldsmith  said  his  statement  had  not  been  ""written  by  or  at  Number  10"".  ""In  my  parliamentary  answer  on  March  17  2003,  I  explained  my  genuinely  held  independent  view,  that  military  action  was  lawful  under  the  existing  Security  Council  resolutions,""  he  said." 

0	"Profits  slide  at  India's  Dr  Reddy  |||    Profits  at  Indian  drugmaker  Dr  Reddy's  fell  93%  as  research  costs  rose  and  sales  flagged.  |||    The  firm  said  its  profits  were  40m  rupees  ($915,000;  £486,000)  for  the  three  months  to  December  on  sales  which  fell  8%  to  4.7bn  rupees.  Dr  Reddy's  has  built  its  reputation  on  producing  generic  versions  of  big-name  pharmaceutical  products.  But  competition  has  intensified  and  the  firm  and  the  company  is  short  on  new  product  launches.  The  most  recent  was  the  annoucement  in  December  2000  that  it  had  won  exclusive  marketing  rights  for  a  generic  version  of  the  famous  anti-depressant  Prozac  from  its  maker,  Eli  Lilly.  It  also  lost  a  key  court  case  in  March  2004,  banning  it  from  selling  a  version  of  Pfizer's  popular  hypertension  drug  Norvasc  in  the  US.  Research  and  development  of  new  drugs  is  continuing  apace,  with  R&D  spending  rising  37%  to  705m  rupees  -  a  key  cause  of  the  decrease  in  profits  alongside  the  fall  in  sales.  Patents  on  a  number  of  well-known  products  are  due  to  run  out  in  the  near  future,  representing  an  opportunity  for  Dr  Reddy,  whose  shares  are  listed  in  New  York,  and  other  Indian  generics  manufacturers.  |||    Sales  in  Dr  Reddy's  generics  business  fell  8.6%  to  966m  rupees.  Another  staple  of  the  the  firm's  business,  the  sale  of  ingredients  for  drugs,  also  performed  poorly.  Sales  were  down  more  than  25%  from  the  previous  year  to  1.4bn  rupees  in  the  face  of  strong  competition  both  at  home,  and  in  the  US  and  Europe.  Dr  Reddy's  Indian  competitors  are  gathering  strength  although  they  too  face  heavy  competitive  pressures."

This  year's  festival  -  which  ended  on  Sunday  after  a  11-day  run  -  has  been  dominated  by  the  themes  of  war  and  politics.  In  the  new  world  cinema  drama  category,  the  Angolan  film  The  Hero  triumphed  to  win  the  grand  jury  prize.  The  film  -  an  Angolan/French/Portuguese  production  -  tells  the  story  of  a  veteran  of  the  country's  civil  war  who  returns  home  to  face  a  new  battle  of  survival.  Twelve  films  competing  in  the  new  world  cinema  documentary  category  focused  on  countries  and  people  under  siege.  |||    Finnish  film  The  Three  Rooms  of  Melancholia  looks  at  the  war  in  Chechnya  and  Shake  Hands  With  The  Devil:  The  Journey  of  Romeo  Dallaire  tells  the  story  of  a  UN  mission  to  Rwanda  during  the  1994  genocide.  But  it  was  Dutch  documentary  Shape  of  the  Moon  -  a  study  of  an  extended  family  in  Indonesia  -  which  took  the  top  prize.  Meanwhile,  French-Israeli  production  Wall,  which  looks  at  Israel's  controversial  security  wall  separating  it  from  the  Palestinian  territories,  picked  up  a  world  cinema  special  jury  prize  for  documentaries.  In  the  main  drama  category,  Forty  Shades  of  Blue  was  named  winner  of  the  grand  jury  prize.  The  film  tells  the  tale  of  a  forbidden  tug-of-love  between  a  father,  his  Russian  immigrant  girlfriend  and  his  son.  |||    During  its  24-year  history,  the  Sundance  Film  Festival  has  showcased  successes  such  as  Reservoir  Dogs,  The  Blair  Witch  Project  and  The  Full  Monty.  Last  year's  festival  provided  a  platform  for  hits  such  as  Open  Water,  Napoleon  Dynamite,  Garden  State  and  Super-Size  Me.  The  festival  is  held  in  the  mountain  resort  of  Park  City,  east  of  Salt  Lake  City,  which  sees  its  population  rise  from  7,500  to  45,000  during  the  festival."

The  measure  is  designed  to  legitimise  previously  hidden  economic  activity  and  boost  Georgia's  flagging  economy.  Georgia's  black  market  is  estimated  to  be  twice  the  size  of  its  legal  economy.  |||    Mr  Saakashvili,  elected  president  in  January  after  Mr  Shevardnadze  was  toppled,  has  urged  the  Georgian  Parliament  to  approve  the  amnesty  as  soon  as  possible.  It  is  one  of  a  series  of  proposals  designed  to  tackle  corruption,  which  was  rampant  during  the  Shevardnadze  era,  and  boost  Georgia's  fragile  public  finances.  |||    The  new  government  is  encouraging  companies  to  pay  taxes  by  scrapping  existing  corruption  investigations  and  destroying  all  tax  records  from  before  1  January,  three  days  before  President  Saakashvili  was  elected.  ""There  are  people  who  have  money  but  are  afraid  to  show  it,""  the  president  told  a  government  session.  ""Documentation  about  where  this  money  came  from  doesn't  exist  because  under  the  former,  entirely  warped  regime,  earning  capital  honestly  was  not  possible.""  |||    By  declaring  their  assets  and  paying  the  one-off  tax,  people  would  be  able  to  ""legalise  their  property"",  Mr  Saakashvili  stressed.  |||    ""No  one  will  have  the  right  to  check  this  money's  origin.  This  money  must  go  back  into  the  economy.""  The  amnesty  will  not  extend  to  people  who  made  money  through  drugs  trafficking  or  international  money  laundering.  Criminal  investigations  in  such  cases  -thought  to  involve  about  5%  of  Georgian  businesses  -are  to  continue.  Mr  Saakashvili  has  accused  the  Shevardnadze  regime,  which  was  toppled  by  a  popular  uprising  in  November,  of  allowing  bribery  to  flourish.  Georgia's  economy  is  in  a  desperate  condition.  Half  the  population  are  living  below  the  poverty  line  with  many  surviving  on  income  of  less  than  $4,  or  three  euros,  a  day.  The  unemployment  rate  is  around  20%  while  the  country  has  a  $1.7bn  public  debt." 

1	"Baby  becomes  new  Oscar  favourite  |||    Clint  Eastwood's  boxing  drama  Million  Dollar  Baby  has  become  the  new  favourite  to  win  best  picture  at  the  Oscars  on  Sunday.  |||    According  to  pundits,  the  film  has  overtaken  previous  favourite  The  Aviator,  with  Eastwood  also  tipped  to  take  the  best  director  award.  Its  star  Hilary  Swank  is  favourite  to  win  best  actress  while  Jamie  Foxx  is  tipped  to  win  best  actor  for  Ray.  Million  Dollar  Baby  has  seven  nominations  while  The  Aviator  has  11.  The  Aviator  has  scored  a  best  director  nomination  for  Martin  Scorsese,  who  has  never  won  an  Oscar,  while  stars  Leonardo  DiCaprio  and  Cate  Blanchett  are  both  nominated  for  acting  Oscars.  |||    ""If  you  look  at  the  Oscars  race,  The  Aviator  should  be  ahead,""  said  awards  pundit  Tom  O'Neil.  ""It  is  the  most  nominated  film,  and  the  most  nominated  movie  has  won  best  picture  18  times  out  of  the  last  20  years.  ""But  the  reality  is  Million  Dollar  Baby  is  the  dark  horse.  People  feel  emotionally  about  it  and  Clint  is  a  beloved  Hollywood  chum  of  the  Academy  voters,""  he  said.  Anne  Thompson  of  the  Hollywood  Reporter  said  that  Million  Dollar  Baby  was  ""heart-wrenching"".  ""It's  very  emotional,  it  even  makes  grown  men  cry,""  she  said.  ""The  Aviator  is  a  gorgeous  movie,  but  it's  colder.""  |||    In  the  acting  categories,  Foxx  is  regarded  as  almost  unbeatable  for  his  performance  as  Ray  Charles  in  Ray.  ""The  performance  is  based  on  a  real  person  who  was  a  showbusiness  hero  with  a  handicap,  who  recently  died,""  O'Neil  said.  ""He  has  unstoppable  momentum  among  the  voters.""  Hilary  Swank  is  the  favourite  to  win  best  actress  for  the  second  time  in  six  years.  She  previously  won  in  1999  for  her  performance  in  Boys  Don't  Cry.  In  the  supporting  categories,  Cate  Blanchett  is  tipped  to  win  for  her  performance  as  Katharine  Hepburn  in  The  Aviator,  while  Morgan  Freeman  is  favourite  to  take  home  his  first  ever  Oscar,  for  Million  Dollar  Baby.  The  Oscars  will  take  place  at  Hollywood's  Kodak  Theatre  on  27  February." 

3	"Verdict  delay  for  Greek  sprinters  |||    Greek  athletics'  governing  body  has  postponed  by  two  weeks  the  judgement  on  sprinters  Costas  Kenteris  and  Katerina  Thanou  for  missing  doping  tests.  |||    The  pair  are  facing  lengthy  bans  for  the  missed  tests,  including  one  on  the  eve  of  last  year's  Athens  Olympics.  They  were  set  to  learn  their  fate  by  the  end  of  February,  but  late  evidence  from  them  has  pushed  the  date  back.  ""A  decision  is  now  expected  by  around  mid-March,""  said  one  of  their  lawyers,  Michalis  Dimitrakopoulos.  Kenteris,  31,  who  won  the  men's  200m  title  at  the  2000  Sydney  Games  and  Thanou,  30,  who  won  the  women's  100m  silver  medal  in  Sydney,  face  a  maximum  two-year  ban  if  found  guilty.  The  athletes,  who  spectacularly  withdrew  from  the  Athens  Olympics,  have  been  suspended  by  the  International  Association  of  Athletics  Federations  (IAAF)  for  missing  the  three  tests.  The  IAAF  said  the  sprinters  had  failed  to  provide  samples  for  tests  in  Tel  Aviv,  Chicago  and  Athens  and  ordered  Greek  athletic's  governing  body,  Segas,  to  hold  a  disciplinary  inquiry.  The  athletes  also  face  a  criminal  hearing  in  Greece  over  the  missed  drugs  tests  and  have  been  charged  with  faking  a  motorcycle  accident  on  the  day  of  the  Athens  test,  which  led  to  them  spending  four  days  in  hospital.  Following  the  final  hearing  in  late  January,  the  athletes  sounded  confident  they  would  be  acquitted.  ""I  am  confident  and  optimistic,""  Thanou  had  said  at  the  time.  ""We  presented  new  evidence  to  the  committee  that  they  were  not  aware  of.""  It  was  not  clear  what  this  new  evidence  was."

Japan  is  the  biggest  holder  of  dollar  reserves  in  the  world,  with  South  Korea  the  fourth  largest.  The  dollar  was  buying  104.76  yen  at  0950  GMT,  0.5%  stronger  on  the  day.  It  also  edged  higher  against  both  the  euro  and  the  pound,  with  one  euro  worth  $1.3218,  and  one  pound  buying  $1.9094.  Concerns  over  rising  oil  prices  and  the  outlook  for  the  dollar  pushed  down  US  stock  markets  on  Tuesday;  the  Dow  Jones  industrial  average  closed  down  1.6%,  while  the  Nasdaq  lost  1.3%.  |||    The  dollar's  latest  slide  began  after  a  South  Korean  parliamentary  report  suggested  the  country,  which  has  about  $200bn  in  foreign  reserves,  had  plans  to  boost  holdings  of  currencies  such  as  the  Australian  and  Canadian  dollar.  On  Wednesday,  however,  South  Korea  moved  to  steady  the  financial  markets.  It  issued  a  statement  that  ""The  Bank  of  Korea  will  not  change  the  portfolio  of  currencies  in  its  reserves  due  to  short  term  market  factors"".  Japan,  too,  steadied  nerves.  A  senior  Japanese  Finance  Ministry  official  told  Reuters  ""we  have  no  plans  to  change  the  composition  of  currency  holdings  in  the  foreign  reserves,  and  we  are  not  thinking  about  expanding  our  euro  holdings"".  Japan  has  $850bn  in  foreign  exchange  reserves.  At  the  start  of  the  year,  the  US  currency,  which  had  lost  7%  against  the  euro  in  the  final  three  months  of  2004  and  had  fallen  to  record  lows,  staged  something  of  a  recovery.  Analysts,  however,  pointed  to  the  dollar's  inability  recently  to  extend  that  rally  despite  positive  economic  and  corporate  data,  and  highlighted  the  fact  that  many  of  the  US's  economic  problems  had  not  disappeared.  The  focus  has  been  on  the  country's  massive  trade  and  budget  deficits,  and  analysts  have  predicted  more  dollar  weakness  to  come."

The  firm  avoided  bankruptcy  thanks  to  a  $4.5bn  bail-out  in  January  2004,  which  gave  control  to  the  creditors.  LG  Group  has  said  any  package  should  reflect  the  firm's  new  ownership,  and  it  will  not  accept  an  unfair  burden.  At  least  seven  million  people  in  South  Korea  use  LG  Card's  plastic  for  purchases.  |||    LG  Card's  creditors  have  threatened  parent  group  LG  Group  with  penalties  if  it  fails  to  respond  to  their  demands.  |||    ""Creditors  would  seek  strong  financial  sanctions  against  LG  Group  if  LG  Card  is  liquidated,""  said  Yoo  Ji-chang,  governor  of  Korean  Development  Bank  (KDB)  -  one  of  the  card  firm's  major  creditors.  LG  Group  has  said  providing  further  help  to  the  credit  card  issuer  could  hurt  its  corporate  credibility  and  could  spark  shareholder  lawsuits.  It  says  it  wants  ""fair  and  reasonable  guidelines""  on  splitting  the  financial  burden  with  the  creditors,  who  now  own  99.3%  of  LG  Card.  The  creditors  have  asked  the  government  to  mediate  to  avoid  any  risk  to  the  stability  of  financial  markets,  KDB  said.  Analysts  believe  a  compromise  is  likely.  ""LG  Group  knows  the  impact  on  consumer  demand  and  the  national  economy  from  a  liquidation  of  LG  Card,""  said  Kim  Yungmin,  an  equity  strategist  at  Dongwon  Investment  Trust  Management.  |||    LG  Card  almost  collapsed  in  2003  due  to  an  increase  in  overdue  credit  card  bills  after  the  bursting  of  a  credit  bubble.  The  firm  returned  to  profit  in  September  2004,  but  now  needs  a  capital  injection  to  avoid  being  delisted  from  the  Korea  Stock  Exchange.  The  exchange  can  delist  a  company  if  its  debt  exceeds  its  assets  for  two  years  running.  LG  card's  creditors  fear  that  such  a  move  would  triggered  massive  debt  redemption  requests  that  could  bankrupt  the  firm,  which  owes  about  $12.05bn.  ""Eventually,  LG  Group  will  have  to  participate,  but  they  have  been  stalling  to  try  to  earn  better  concessions,""  said  Mr  Kim." 

1	"Famed  music  director  Viotti  dies  |||    Conductor  Marcello  Viotti,  director  of  Venice's  famous  La  Fenice  Theatre,  has  died  in  Germany  at  50.  |||    Viotti,  director  of  La  Fenice  since  2002,  conducted  at  renowned  opera  houses  worldwide  including  Milan's  La  Scala  and  the  Vienna  State  Opera.  His  time  at  La  Fenice  coincided  with  its  reopening  in  2003  after  it  was  destroyed  by  fire  in  1996.  He  fell  into  a  coma  after  suffering  a  stroke  during  rehearsals  for  Jules  Massenet's  Manon  last  week.  |||    He  conducted  some  of  the  best  orchestras  in  the  world  including  the  Berlin  Philharmonic  and  the  English  Chamber  Orchestra.  Viotti  was  born  in  Switzerland  and  studied  the  piano,  cello  and  singing  at  the  Lausanne  Conservatory.  His  career  breakthrough  came  in  1982  when  he  won  first  prize  at  the  Gino  Marinuzzi  conducting  competition  in  Italy.  Viotti  established  himself  as  chief  conductor  of  the  Turin  Opera  and  went  on  to  become  chief  conductor  of  Munich's  Radio  Orchestra.  At  La  Fenice  Viotti  was  widely  acclaimed  for  his  production  of  the  French  composer  Massenet's  Thais  and  some  of  his  other  productions  included  Giuseppe  Verdi's  La  Traviata  and  Richard  Strauss's  Ariadne  auf  Naxos.  |||    The  last  opera  he  directed  at  La  Fenice  was  Massenet's  Le  Roi  de  Lahore.  Viotti's  debut  at  the  New  York's  Metropolitan  Opera  came  in  2000  with  Giacomo  Puccini's  Madame  Butterfly,  followed  by  La  Boheme,  La  Traviata  and  Fromental  Halevy's  La  Juive.  Giampaolo  Vianello,  superintendent  of  the  Fenice  Theatre  Foundation,  said:  ""I  am  filled  with  extreme  sadness  because,  other  than  a  great  artist,  he  is  missed  as  a  friend  -  a  main  character  in  the  latest  joyous  times,  during  the  rebirth  of  our  theatre.""  Viotti's  last  public  performance  was  on  5  February  when  he  conducted  Vincenzo  Bellini's  Norma  at  the  Vienna  State  Opera."

The  news  surprised  some  analysts  who  had  expected  the  latest  minutes  to  show  another  unanimous  decision.  Worries  over  growth  rates  and  consumer  spending  were  behind  the  decision  to  freeze  rates,  the  minutes  showed.  The  Bank's  latest  inflation  report,  released  last  week,  had  noted  that  the  main  reason  inflation  might  fall  was  weaker  consumer  spending.  |||    However,  MPC  member  Paul  Tucker  voted  for  a  quarter  point  rise  in  interest  rates  to  5%.  He  argued  that  economic  growth  was  picking  up,  and  that  the  equity,  credit  and  housing  markets  had  been  stronger  than  expected.  |||    The  Bank's  minutes  said  that  risks  to  the  inflation  forecast  were  ""sufficiently  to  the  downside""  to  keep  rates  on  hold  at  its  latest  meeting.  However,  the  minutes  added:  ""Some  members  noted  that  an  increase  might  be  warranted  in  due  course  if  the  economy  evolved  in  line  with  the  central  projection"".  Ross  Walker,  UK  economist  at  Royal  Bank  of  Scotland,  said  he  was  surprised  that  a  dissenting  vote  had  been  made  so  soon.  He  said  the  minutes  appeared  to  be  ""trying  to  get  the  market  to  focus  on  the  possibility  of  a  rise  in  rates"".  ""If  the  economy  pans  out  as  they  expect  then  they  are  probably  going  to  have  to  hike  rates.""  However,  he  added,  any  rate  increase  is  not  likely  to  happen  until  later  this  year,  with  MPC  members  likely  to  look  for  a  more  sustainable  pick  up  in  consumer  spending  before  acting." 

0	"German  jobless  rate  at  new  record  |||    More  than  5.2  million  Germans  were  out  of  work  in  February,  new  figures  show.  |||    The  figure  of  5.216  million  people,  or  12.6%  of  the  working-age  population,  is  the  highest  jobless  rate  in  Europe's  biggest  economy  since  the  1930s.  The  news  comes  as  the  head  of  Germany's  panel  of  government  economic  advisers  predicted  growth  would  again  stagnate.  Speaking  on  German  TV,  Bert  Ruerup  said  the  panel's  earlier  forecast  of  1.4%  was  too  optimistic  and  warned  growth  would  be  just  1%  in  2005.  |||    The  German  government  is  trying  to  tackle  the  stubbornly-high  levels  of  joblessness  with  a  range  of  labour  market  reforms.  At  their  centre  is  the  ""Hartz-IV""  programme  introduced  in  January  to  shake  up  welfare  benefits  and  push  people  back  into  work  -  even  if  some  of  the  jobs  are  heavily  subsidised.  The  latest  unemployment  figures  look  set  to  increase  the  pressure  on  the  government.  Widely  leaked  to  the  German  newspapers  a  day  in  advance,  they  produced  screaming  headlines  criticising  Chancellor  Gerhard  Schroeder's  Social  Democrat-Green  Party  administration.  Mr  Schroeder  had  originally  come  into  office  promising  to  halve  unemployment.  |||    Still,  some  measures  suggest  the  picture  is  not  quite  so  bleak.  The  soaring  official  unemployment  figure  follows  a  change  in  the  methodology  which  pushed  up  the  jobless  rate  by  more  than  500,000  in  January.  Adjusted  for  seasonal  changes,  the  overall  unemployment  rate  is  4.875  million  people  or  11.7%,  up  0.3  percentage  points  from  the  previous  month.  Using  the  most  internationally-accepted  methodology  of  the  International  Labour  Organisation  (ILO),  Germany  had  3.97  million  people  out  of  work  in  January.  And  ILO-based  figures  also  suggest  that  14,000  new  net  jobs  were  created  that  month,  taking  the  number  of  people  employed  to  38.9  million.  The  ILO  defines  an  unemployed  person  as  someone  who  in  the  previous  four  weeks  had  actively  looked  for  work  they  could  take  up  immediately." 

1	"Sir  Paul  rocks  Super  Bowl  crowds  |||    Sir  Paul  McCartney  wowed  fans  with  a  live  mini-concert  at  American  football's  Super  Bowl  -  and  avoided  any  Janet  Jackson-style  controversies.  |||    The  62-year-old  sang  Hey  Jude  and  other  Beatles  songs  in  a  12-minute  set  at  half-time  during  the  game  in  Florida.  Last  year,  Jackson  exposed  a  breast  during  a  dance  routine,  causing  outrage  among  millions  of  TV  viewers  and  landing  the  CBS  TV  network  a  fine.  Sir  Paul,  however,  did  nothing  more  racy  than  remove  his  jacket  as  he  sang.  Organisers  were  widely  considered  to  be  playing  it  safe  this  year  by  booking  62-year-old  Sir  Paul  for  his  second  Super  Bowl  show.  |||    Three  years  ago,  he  was  invited  to  perform  at  the  first  Super  Bowl  after  the  September  11  attacks  and  performed  his  specially-written  song  Freedom.  This  time,  he  started  off  the  show,  at  the  Alltel  Stadium  in  Jacksonville,  Florida,  with  the  Beatles  numbers  Drive  My  Car  and  Get  Back.  He  then  performed  a  mellow  version  of  Live  And  Let  Die,  the  James  Bond  theme  he  recorded  with  the  band  Wings.  Finally,  he  closed  the  show  with  a  rousing  version  of  Hey  Jude.  The  former  Beatle  resisted  any  temptation  to  refer  to  Janet  Jackson's  headline-grabbing  performance  last  year,  instead  keeping  banter  between  songs  to  a  minimum  in  order  to  squeeze  as  much  music  as  he  could  into  his  slot.  The  singer  removed  his  black  jacket  halfway  through  the  show  -  but  any  fans  hoping  for  a  second  ""Nipple-gate""  were  to  be  disappointed  as  he  kept  his  red  sweatshirt  on  underneath.  |||    Earlier,  the  Black  Eyed  Peas  and  Alicia  Keys  had  provided  the  night's  other  high-profile  entertainment  by  performing  in  a  pre-game  show.  Black  Eyed  Peas  singer  Fergie  was  dressed  in  a  tight  orange  top  and  purple  hotpants,  but  nothing  in  her  performance  was  likely  to  upset  TV  watchdogs.  After  the  controversy  last  year  -  which  saw  CBS  fined  a  record  $550,000  (£292,000)  by  federal  regulators  -  Super  Bowl  organisers  had  turned  to  producer  Don  Mischer  to  oversee  this  year's  half-time  show.  His  previous  production  credits  included  Olympic  opening  and  closing  ceremonies.  The  Super  Bowl  is  watched  by  an  audience  of  144.4  million  in  the  US,  with  many  of  the  people  watching  are  said  to  tune  in  specifically  to  see  the  entertainment  put  on  around  the  event.  Michael  Jackson,  Aerosmith,  Diana  Ross,  Gloria  Estefan  and  Phil  Collins  are  among  the  stars  who  have  previously  graced  the  Super  Bowl  stage."

The  two  Japanese  companies  will  collaborate  in  research  &  development,  production,  marketing  and  licensing.  They  said  the  agreement  would  enable  the  two  companies  to  expand  the  plasma  display  TV  market  globally.  |||    Plasma  display  panels  are  used  for  large,  thin  TVs  which  are  replacing  old-style  televisions.  The  display  market  for  high-definition  televisions  is  split  between  models  using  plasma  display  panels  and  others  -  manufactured  by  the  likes  of  Sony  and  Samsung  -  using  liquid-crystal  displays  (LCDs).  The  deal  will  enable  Hitachi  and  Matsushita,  which  makes  Panasonic  brand  products,  to  develop  new  technology  and  improve  their  competitiveness.  Hitachi  recently  announced  a  deal  to  buy  plasma  display  technology  from  rival  Fujitsu  in  an  effort  to  strengthen  its  presence  in  the  market.  |||    Separately,  Fujitsu  announced  on  Monday  that  it  is  quitting  the  LCD  panel  market  by  transferring  its  operations  in  the  area  to  Japanese  manufacturer  Sharp.  Sharp  will  inherit  staff,  manufacturing  facilities  and  intellectual  property  from  Fujitsu.  The  plasma  panel  market  has  seen  rapid  consolidation  in  recent  months  as  the  price  of  consumer  electronic  goods  and  components  has  fallen.  Samsung  Electronics  and  Sony  are  among  other  companies  working  together  to  reduce  costs  and  speed  up  new  product  development." 

2	"Tory  expert  denies  defeat  warning  |||    The  Conservatives'  campaign  director  has  denied  a  report  claiming  he  warned  Michael  Howard  the  party  could  not  win  the  next  general  election.  |||    The  Times  on  Monday  said  Australian  Lynton  Crosby  told  the  party  leader  to  focus  on  trying  to  increase  the  Tories'  Commons  presence  by  25  to  30  seats.  But  Mr  Crosby  said  in  a  statement:  ""I  have  never  had  any  such  conversation...  and  I  do  not  hold  that  view.""  Mr  Howard  later  added  there  was  not  ""one  iota""  of  truth  in  the  report.  The  strategist  helped  Australia's  PM,  John  Howard,  win  four  elections.  Mr  Howard  appointed  Mr  Crosby  as  his  elections  chief  last  October.  Mr  Crosby's  statement  said:  ""The  Conservative  Party  has  been  making  an  impact  on  the  issues  of  lower  tax  and  controlled  immigration  over  the  past  week.""  It  added:  ""The  Labour  Party  will  be  wanting  to  do  all  they  can  to  distract  attention  away  from  the  issues  that  really  matter  to  people.""" 

2	"Blair  'pressing  US  on  climate'  |||    Tony  Blair  is  pressing  the  US  to  cut  greenhouse  gases  despite  its  unwillingness  to  sign  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  Downing  Street  has  indicated.  |||    Officials  have  confirmed  climate  change  was  discussed  when  influential  senator  John  McCain  recently  visited  Mr  Blair.  Climate  change  was  an  issue  the  prime  minister  ""wanted  to  progress""  during  the  UK's  presidency  of  the  G8  and  EU  in  2005,  said  a  spokesman.  But  he  played  down  reports  Mr  Blair  was  considering  a  new  US-friendly  treaty.  |||    According  to  the  Times,  the  UK  leader  wants  to  end  US  isolation  with  a  ""Kyoto-lite""  agreement  on  the  scale  and  nature  of  the  threat  from  climate  change.  He  is  said  to  have  discussed  the  idea  with  Mr  McCain  during  his  time  at  Number  10.  The  prime  minister  is  said  to  believe  the  United  States'  refusal  to  sign  the  Kyoto  Protocol  on  emissions  is  undermining  other  countries'  resolve  to  cut  carbon  dioxide  production.  So  far  the  US  has  refused  to  sign  up  to  the  Kyoto  treaty  -  which  aims  to  cut  emissions  -  branding  it  politically  motivated  and  not  based  on  science.  President  Bush's  advisers  have  repeatedly  denied  global  warming  is  taking  place.  |||    Europe,  which  disputes  the  claim,  has  also  signalled  it  wants  to  press  ahead  with  talks  about  longer  term  climate  change  action  in  a  way  which  involves  both  the  United  States  and  developing  countries.  Mr  Blair's  reported  treaty  would  also  establish  an  international  programme  to  develop  technology  needed  for  renewable  energy  and  the  reduction  of  carbon  emissions,  says  the  Times.  But  there  is  still  apparently  ""little  prospect""  of  America  agreeing  to  cut  emissions,  which  could  further  provoke  environmental  campaigners  already  angry  at  the  lack  of  progress.  Mr  Blair  was  left  blushing  on  Wednesday  when  it  emerged  his  manifesto  target  of  a  20%  cut  to  the  1990  greenhouse  gas  level  by  2010  was  set  to  be  missed." 

3	"All  Black  magic:  New  Zealand  rugby  |||    Playing  colours:  |||    All  black  |||    The  Haka  and  more!  |||    The  All  Blacks  |||    Charles  John  Munro  discovered  rugby  at  London's  Christ  College,  and  on  his  return  to  Nelson  he  staged  New  Zealand's  first  game.  Nelson  Town  met  Nelson  College  on  14  May,  1870,  the  Town  triumphing  by  two  goals  to  nil,  instigating  a  game  that  would  become  a  national  obsession  and  come  to  dominate  the  country's  sporting  passions.  The  game  appealed  to  the  Kiwi  psyche  and  quickly  spread,  the  native  Maoris  finding  a  particular  empathy  with  the  sport's  warrior  ethos.  In  1888  a  British  team  led  by  AE  Stoddart  toured  New  Zealand  and  Australia,  and  soon  after  a  Maori  named  Joe  Warbrick  and  an  English  ex-pat  called  Thomas  Eyton  decided  to  gather  a  combined  New  Zealand  team.  |||    Twenty-two  Maori  and  four  'pakiha'  formed  the  'New  Zealand  Native  Team,'  who  played  a  total  of  107  matches  in  New  Zealand,  Australia  and  the  UK.  The  integration  of  white  and  Maori  was  a  reflecion  of  enlightened  New  Zealand  rugby  and  society,  even  if  the  British  press  were  somewhat  mystified  by  the  pre-match  tradition  of  the  Maori  war  dance,  the  Haka!  The  other  great  symbol  of  New  Zealand  rugby,  the  all  black  kit  with  the  silver  fern  on  the  breast,  was  proposed  by  Tom  Ellison  at  the  first  annual  meeting  of  the  New  Zealand  Rugby  Football  Union  in  1893.  New  Zealand  played  their  first  international  against  Australia  in  1903,  the  Kiwis  triumphing  22-3  in  Sydney,  and  the  following  year  an  official  British  touring  team  came  to  New  Zealand  for  the  first  time.  The  tourists  had  gone  through  Australia  undefeated  but  their  captain,  David  Revell  Bedell-Sivright,  created  animosity  in  New  Zealand  with  his  patronising  attitude.  The  Kiwis  shocked  the  rugby  world  with  a  9-3  triumph  in  Wellington,  sparking  great  celebrations  across  the  country,  but  Bedell-Sivright  churlishly  suggested  that  the  victors  would  have  no  chance  when  they  visited  the  UK.  |||    Their  opportunity  to  prove  him  wrong  came  in  1905  with  the  first  official  New  Zealand  tour  to  Europe.  The  tourists  won  their  early  games  with  a  quick-thinking,  inventive  approach,  but  press  criticism  began  to  grow  over  their  2-3-2  scrum  formation  that  left  a  'roving'  forward  free  to  disrupt  opposition  attacks.  The  tactic  was  effective,  two  late  tries  seeing  the  Kiwis  to  a  12-7  win  over  Scotland,  before  Ireland  were  despatched  15-0  in  Dublin.  A  huge  crowd  at  Crystal  Palace  convulsed  with  laughter  at  the  sight  of  the  Haka  -  but  the  smiles  were  soon  wiped  from  their  faces  when  the  tourists  ran  in  five  tries  in  a  15-0  hammering  of  England.  New  Zealand  headed  to  Wales  to  meet  a  country  in  the  midst  of  its  first  'Golden  Age,'  and  the  encounter  would  be  the  first  in  a  series  of  controversial  clashes  between  the  sides.  An  excellent  try  on  the  left  wing  by  Teddy  Morgan  sealed  a  3-0  win  in  a  hard-fought  encounter  at  Cardiff  Arms  Park,  but  post-match  talk  was  dominated  by  a  Bob  Deans  try  that  was  ruled  out  by  Scottish  referee  John  Dallas.  Dallas  said  that  Deans  was  tackled  short,  but  the  Kiwi  said  he  was  dragged  back  into  the  field  of  play  after  grounding  a  try  -  on  his  death-bed  three  years  later  he  exclaimed:  ""I  did  score  that  try  in  Cardiff.""  |||    Four  of  the  1905  All  Blacks  went  over  to  the  newly  formed  'All  Golds'  rugby  league  side  soon  after  the  tour,  but  New  Zealand  were  strong  enough  to  crush  an  Anglo-Welsh  touring  team  in  1908.  The  first  South  Africa  tour  of  New  Zealand  in  1921  saw  honours  shared  in  a  three-Test  series,  starting  the  greatest  rivalry  in  rugby  -  and  the  long-running  controversy  between  the  countries  over  the  All  Blacks'  inclusion  of  Maori  players.  The  awesome  1924-5  All  Black  tourists  became  known  as  'The  Invincibles'  after  winning  all  30  of  their  games  in  France,  Britain  and  Ireland,  including  a  crushing  19-0  victory  over  Wales  at  St  Helen's.  Despite  their  success,  the  All  Blacks'  2-3-2  scrum  formation  left  them  somewhat  short  of  possession  at  times,  and  the  flaws  were  exploited  by  the  Springboks  in  South  Africa  in  1928.  Employing  the  modern  3-4-1  scrum  line-up  against  the  New  Zealand  'rover'  system  for  the  first  time,  South  African  teams  defeated  the  All  Blacks  in  five  games  and  the  Test  series  was  drawn  two-all.  The  controversial  New  Zealand  scrum  method  finally  disappeared  after  the  1930  Lions  tour  (a  series  won  3-1  by  New  Zealand),  the  Lions  manager  describing  the  tactic  as  'cheating,'  prompting  the  International  Rugby  Board  to  rule  that  three  men  had  to  pack  down  in  the  front  row  of  the  scrum.  |||    The  All  Blacks'  1935  European  tour  started  inauspiciously  with  an  11-3  loss  to  a  Swansea  side  inspired  by  teenage,  schoolboy  half-backs  Hayden  Tanner  and  Willie  Davies.  A  thrilling  Test  at  Cardiff  Arms  Park  went  to  Wales  13-12,  although  the  winning  try  from  Geoffrey  Rees-Jones  was  controversial  following  an  illegal  Claude  Davey  tackle  in  the  build-up.  New  Zealand's  next  visit  to  Wales  in  1953  proved  difficult  as  they  lost  8-3  to  Cardiff  and  drew  6-6  at  Swansea.  The  All  Blacks  were  on  top  in  the  Test  with  Wales  at  the  Arms  Park,  but  the  teams  were  locked  at  8-8  when  a  Clem  Thomas  cross  kick  was  gathered  by  Ken  Jones  for  a  famous,  match-winning  try.  The  tourists  made  some  amends  with  wins  over  the  other  home  nations,  before  a  19-5  success  over  the  Barbarians  in  an  Arms  Park  thriller.  New  Zealand  built  from  that  tour,  and  by  the  time  they  returned  in  1963-4  they  were  undoubtedly  the  leading  side  in  the  world.  |||    That  made  the  shock  all  the  greater  when  a  drop  goal  by  student  John  Uzzell  gave  Newport  an  unlikely  3-0  win  over  the  tourists  at  Rodney  Parade.  Wilson  Whinneray's  side  rallied  to  beat  Wales  6-0,  their  first  win  at  the  Arms  Park  in  four  attempts,  and  went  unbeaten  through  the  rest  of  the  tour,  but  when  they  returned  home  the  first  question  put  to  them  was:  ""What  happened  in  Newport?""  The  only  blemish  on  the  record  of  the  awesome  1967  tourists  was  a  draw  with  East  Wales,  as  they  beat  the  full  Wales  team  13-6  in  Cardiff  to  take  the  lead  in  the  series  between  the  countries  for  the  first  time.  That  lead  was  increased  with  two  comfortable  wins  for  the  home  side  in  New  Zealand  in  1969,  the  first  time  Wales  had  toured  the  country  as  an  independent  team.  |||    A  ferocious  game  at  the  Arms  Park  in  1972  was  edged  19-16  by  the  All  Blacks,  a  measure  of  revenge  for  the  defeat  inflicted  on  New  Zealand  by  the  Carwyn  James-inspired  Lions  of  1971.  |||    James  guided  Llanelli  to  a  famous  9-3  win  over  the  tourists  at  Stradey  Park,  though,  and  in  the  final  game  of  the  tour  the  Barbarians  defeated  the  All  Blacks  23-11  in  Cardiff  in  a  game  regarded  by  many  as  the  greatest  ever  played.  New  Zealand  defeated  a  Wales  XV  12-3  at  the  Arms  Park  in  a  non-cap  game  in  1974,  but  it  was  the  1978  game  in  Cardiff  that  would  reignite  the  history  of  controversy  between  the  two  countries.  |||    Wales  were  leading  12-10  with  one  minute  left  when  Andy  Haden  flew  to  the  floor  from  a  line-out.  Television  pictures  clearly  showed  that  he  dived,  but  English  referee  Roger  Quittenton  was  fooled  and  awarded  a  penalty,  duly  converted  by  Brian  McKechnie  for  a  13-12  win.  Since  that  infamous  game,  the  competition  has  largely  left  Wales  v  New  Zealand  fixtures  as  the  men  in  red  have  slipped  from  the  pinnacle  of  the  world  game.  A  crushing  23-3  win  for  New  Zealand  in  Cardiff  in  the  Welsh  Rugby  Union's  1980  centenary  game  was  a  sign  of  things  to  come.  The  new  professionalism  in  the  southern  hemisphere  game  that  had  left  Europe  behind  was  shown  as  the  All  Blacks  swatted  Wales  aside  49-6  in  Brisbane  in  the  semi-final  of  the  inaugural  World  Cup.  The  Kiwis  went  on  to  claim  the  Cup,  and  would  inflict  further  misery  on  Wales  on  their  ill-fated  1988  tour  of  New  Zealand.  |||    A  young,  talented  Wales  side  left  Britain  full  of  confidence  as  Triple  Crown  winners,  but  one  of  the  greatest  ever  New  Zealand  teams  demolished  them  52-3  and  54-9.  After  also  taking  some  fearful  beatings  in  the  provincial  games,  Wales  captain  Jonathan  Davies  returned  home  calling  for  urgent  change  in  the  national  game,  but  as  his  views  were  ignored  he  -  along  with  a  generation  of  Wales'  best  players  -  chose  to  head  north  to  rugby  league.  |||    A  34-9  win  in  Cardiff  followed  for  New  Zealand  in  1989,  and  at  the  1995  World  Cup  Wales'  big  talk  was  made  to  look  embarrassing  as  the  All  Blacks  eased  to  victory  in  Johannesburg.  A  crushing  42-7  Kiwi  triumph  in  Wembley  followed  in  1997,  and  as  Wales'  misery  increased  they  turned  to  New  Zealand  for  their  salvation  in  the  shape  of  coaches  Graham  Henry  and  Steve  Hansen.  There  was  a  temporary  resurgence  in  the  Welsh  game,  but  when  an  experimental  New  Zealand  side  came  to  Cardiff's  new  Millennium  Stadium  in  2002  they  left  with  a  43-17  victory.  |||    A  bruising  55-3  defeat  followed  for  Wales  in  Hamilton  in  2003  as  Hansen  built  towards  the  World  Cup,  but  in  Australia  it  was  a  remarkable  performance  against  the  All  Blacks  that  gave  his  side  renewed  hope.  Wales  were  given  no  chance  going  into  the  game,  but  in  the  course  of  the  match  they  rediscovered  the  value  of  attacking  flair  to  lead  37-33  early  in  the  second  half.  New  Zealand  rallied  to  a  53-37  win,  but  the  style  shown  by  Wales  has  been  used  as  an  inspiration  as  they  look  to  a  better  future.  They  now  face  an  All  Blacks  team  led  by  Henry  and  Hansen,  coming  to  Europe  with  a  weakened  squad  at  the  end  of  a  long  season.  An  encouraging  display  against  South  Africa  has  inspired  a  confident  Wales  camp  to  believe  they  can  claim  their  first  win  over  the  men  in  black  for  over  50  years.  They  have  a  chance,  but  clearly  history  is  not  on  their  side." 

0	"Egypt  to  sell  off  state-owned  bank  |||    The  Egyptian  government  is  reportedly  planning  to  privatise  one  of  the  country's  big  public  banks.  |||    An  Investment  Ministry  official  has  told  the  Reuters  news  agency  that  the  Bank  of  Alexandria  will  be  sold  sometime  in  2005.  The  move  is  seen  as  evidence  of  a  new  commitment  by  the  government  to  reduce  the  size  of  public  sector.  The  official  said  the  government  has  not  yet  decided  whether  the  sale  will  take  the  form  of  a  public  flotation.  ""The  most  important  thing  to  decide  now  is  the  method  -  whether  by  selling  shares  to  the  public  or  to  a  strategic  investor  from  abroad,""  he  said.  |||    Analysts  say  the  public-sector  banks  have  suited  the  government's  monetary,  credit  and  exchange  policies.  Nevertheless,  the  Egyptian  government  has  spoken  for  years  about  privatising  one  of  the  big  four  state  banks  -  Banque  Misr,  National  Bank  of  Egypt,  Banque  du  Caire  and  Bank  of  Alexandria.  It  had  been  expected  one  of  the  smallest  of  the  four  big  public  banks  -  Bank  of  Alexandria  or  Banque  du  Caire  -  would  be  sold  first.  The  announcement  reinforces  the  hopes  of  investors  and  international  financial  bodies  for  a  revival  of  Egypt's  privatisation  programme.  About  190  state-run  companies  and  facilities  were  sold  off  from  the  early  1990s  to  1997.  The  appointment  of  Mahmoud  Mohieldin,  a  reform-minded  technocrat,  to  the  new  post  of  investment  minister  in  July  was  taken  as  a  sign  that  more  sell-offs  were  on  the  way.  Both  the  IMF  and  World  Bank  have  urged  Egypt  to  remove  obstacles  to  the  development  of  the  private  sector  which  they  say  has  a  vital  role  to  play  in  reducing  poverty  by  expanding  the  economy."

The  film  is  the  true  story  of  the  hotel  manager  who  saved  1,200  Tutsis  from  death  during  the  Rwandan  genocide.  The  film,  showing  out  of  competition  in  Berlin,  is  nominated  for  three  Oscars,  including  best  actor  for  Cheadle.  Sophie  Okonedo,  who  plays  Cheadle's  wife  Tatiana,  is  nominated  for  best  supporting  actress.  The  film  is  also  in  the  running  for  best  original  screenplay.  Cheadle,  was  joined  on  stage  at  Berlin  by  Paul  Rusesabagina,  the  hotel  manager  he  plays  in  the  film,  Mr  Rusesabagina's  wife  and  his  extended  family,  who  fled  Rwanda  and  now  live  in  Belgium.  Mr  Rusesabagina  used  his  influence  as  a  prominent  Hutu  businessman  to  shelter  potential  victims  of  the  Rwandan  genocide,  contacting  dignitaries  including  Bill  Clinton,  the  King  of  Belgium  as  well  as  the  French  foreign  ministry.  Hotel  Rwanda  is  one  of  two  films  addressing  the  genocide  at  the  55th  Berlin  Film  Festival,  which  runs  until  20  February.  Sometimes  in  April  is  a  feature  by  Raoul  Peck  competing  for  the  festival's  coveted  Golden  and  Silver  Bear  awards.  The  film  was  made  exclusively  in  Rwanda  whereas  Hotel  Rwanda  was  shot  mostly  in  South  Africa,  with  some  scenes  made  in  Kigali." 

2	"MSPs  hear  renewed  climate  warning  |||    Climate  change  could  be  completely  out  of  control  within  several  decades,  the  Scottish  Environment  Protection  Agency  is  warning  a  committee  of  MSPs.  |||    Experts  are  giving  evidence  on  the  subject  to  the  Scottish  Parliament's  environment  committee.  Officials  believe  nuclear  energy  and  wind  farms  may  be  better  options  than  trying  to  tackle  global  warming.  Solutions  suggested  by  conservationists  include  reducing  internal  UK  air  travel  and  boosting  electric  trains.  The  evidence  is  part  of  the  committee's  inquiry  into  the  impact  of  climate  change  in  Scotland.  Sepa  is  attempting  to  curb  global  warming  gases,  as  pollution  from  transport  emissions  increases.  |||    Ecologists  are  warning  MSPs  that  Scotland  may  have  to  accept  ""significant  intrusion""  from  wind  farms.  It  is  likely  also  that  nuclear  power  will  be  needed  for  possibly  several  decades.  Sepa  predict  that  the  two  methods  will  remain  as  energy  sources  until  climate  change  is  under  control.  Experts  studying  the  seas  off  Scotland's  west  coast  have  already  forecast  more  devastating  weather  of  the  type  which  caused  havoc  across  the  country  last  month.  |||    They  predicted  that  damaging  storms  will  become  more  frequent.  Researchers  from  the  University  of  the  Highlands  and  Islands  and  Southampton  have  been  looking  at  wave  heights  in  the  Atlantic  over  the  last  nine  years.  The  project  was  conducted  jointly  by  the  Environmental  Research  Institute  in  Thurso,  which  is  part  of  the  University  of  the  Highlands  and  Islands  (UHI)  Millennium  Institute  network,  and  the  Southampton  Oceanography  Centre.

He  will  also  write  a  part  for  himself  in  the  episode.  ""I've  got  the  rough  idea  but  this  is  the  most  intimidating  project  of  my  career.  The  Simpsons  is  the  greatest  TV  show  of  all  time,""  he  said.

So  there  is  much  hope  that  an  elected  government  will  break  the  deadlock.  ""First  rule  of  law,  then  the  economy,""  says  Radwan  Hadi,  deputy  managing  director  of  Aberdeen-based  oil  and  gas  consultancy  Blackwatch  Petroleum  Services,  which  entered  Iraq  in  2003.  Mr  Hadi's  view  about  what  the  new  government's  priorities  should  be  is  shared  by  many  Iraqis.  The  economy  has  become  the  second-most  dominant  issue  for  many  political  parties  ahead  of  Sunday's  election,  according  to  Bristol  University  political  scientist  Anne  Alexander,  who  is  working  on  a  project  that  looks  at  governance  and  security  in  post-war  Iraq.  |||    Job  creation  ranks  high  both  on  election  manifestos  and  on  the  Iraqi  people's  wish  list.  Nobody  knows  exactly  how  many  Iraqis  are  out  of  work,  but  it  is  clear  that  the  situation  is  dire.  ""Estimates  of  Iraq's  unemployment  rate  vary,  but  we  estimate  it  to  be  between  30-40%,""  the  Washington-based  independent  think-tank  The  Brookings  Institution  says  in  its  Iraq  Index.  But  some  progress  has  been  made,  largely  thanks  to  the  country's  oil  revenues  which  have  exceeded  $22bn  since  June  2003.  |||    Iraq's  infrastructure  is  on  the  mend,  with  notable  improvements  having  been  made  in  areas  such  as  electricity  supply,  irrigation,  telephone  networks  and  the  re-opening  of  hospitals.  But  serious  problems  remain  and  the  growing  divide  between  haves  and  have-nots  is  angering  voters.  One  Iraqi  woman  told  Ms  Alexander  about  her  frustration  as  she  watched  TV  adverts  for  private  hospitals  soon  after  having  failed  to  track  down  basic  medicines  from  Baghdad's  pharmacies.  Observes  Mr  Hadi:  ""The  economy  at  present  marks  a  big  divide;  the  rich  get  richer,  the  poor  get  poorer.""  An  indication  of  this  can  be  seen  in  the  world  of  finance  where,  in  contrast  with  the  daily  plight  of  ordinary  people,  19  private  banks  operate,  only  one  of  which  is  run  in  accordance  with  Islamic  banking  principles.  Hopes  are  high  for  the  future  of  finance,  so  foreign  banks  have  been  buying  into  the  sector.  National  Bank  of  Kuwait  has  bought  a  majority  stake  in  Credit  Bank  of  Iraq,  the  Jordanian  investment  bank  Export  &  Finance  Bank  has  bought  49%  of  National  Bank  of  Iraq.  |||    Foreign  firms  also  hope  to  cash  in  on  the  reconstruction  effort.  Bechtel's  efforts  to  rebuild  schools  and  restore  power  have  attracted  controversy  as  well  as  boosting  its  bottom  line  while  Halliburton  has  enjoyed  a  wealth  of  military  contracts.  But  the  involvement  of  foreign  firms  in  the  health  and  banking  sectors  and  beyond  sits  uneasily  with  many  Iraqis  who  are  accustomed  to  the  state  taking  responsibility  for  functions  that  are  essential  to  making  society  work,  observes  Ms  Alexander.  ""It  is  seen  as  a  selling  off  of  Iraq's  assets  and  bringing  in  multinationals  at  the  expense  of  Iraqi  businesses  and  Iraqi  workers,""  she  says.  Consequently,  the  transitional  government  has  been  forced  to  backtrack  in  recent  months  over  its  proposal  to  allow  100%  foreign  ownership  of  Iraqi  assets,  she  explains.  In  the  West,  it  is  easy  to  forget  that  the  otherwise  brutal  Baathist  regime  used  to  look  after  the  majority  of  Iraq's  citizens  rather  well  in  terms  of  job  creation,  social  security  and  healthcare.  Opinion  polls  suggest  that  ""people  still  want  the  state  to  take  a  leading  role  in  providing  these  things"",  Ms  Alexander  says.  |||    Yet  in  some  areas  of  the  economy,  investment  from  abroad  is  still  warmly  welcomed,  insists  Mr  Hadi,  an  Iraqi  who  left  the  country  three  decades  ago.  ""I  think  the  private  sector  will  evolve  incredibly  fast,""  Mr  Hadi  says.  ""Iraq's  vast  natural  resources  can  support  any  magnitude  of  economic  growth.""  |||    Many  foreign  companies  say  they  are  keen  to  get  in  on  the  act,  yet  few  are  actually  entering  the  country  in  any  meaningful  way.  But  there  are  exceptions.  Mr  Hadi's  Blackwatch  is  just  one  of  many  small  operators  preparing  for  a  much  bigger  future.  Blackwatch's  Baghdad-based  affiliate  Falcon  Group  has  dozens  of  people  working  for  it  across  the  country  in  Kirkuk  and  Baghdad,  and  its  engineers  and  geo-scientists  work  with  the  Iraqi  oil  ministry  to  hammer  out  technology  transfer  issues,  Mr  Hadi  points  out.  ""These  guys  are  trying  to  work.  The  Iraqi  business  people  will  do  business  at  all  times.  ""Life  goes  on  in  Iraq,  the  people  take  responsibility,  they  want  to  live  normal  lives."""

U2  are  nominated  twice  for  their  recent  single  Vertigo,  including  a  nomination  for  best  rock  song.  This  year  the  Grammys  have  been  dominated  by  rap  star  Kanye  West,  who  is  in  contention  for  10  awards.  US  comedian  Ellen  Degeneres  and  singer  Christine  Milian  will  present  awards  at  the  event.  Last  week  Grammy  producers  announced  the  show  will  be  hosted  by  rap  star  and  Chicago  actress  Queen  Latifah.  It  will  be  held  at  the  Staples  Center.  U2  had  number  one  success  in  the  album  charts  on  both  sides  of  the  Atlantic  in  November  when  their  latest  studio  album,  How  to  Dismantle  an  Atomic  Bomb,  topped  the  US  and  UK  charts.

The  plan  was  put  forward  by  G7  finance  ministers  over  the  weekend.  The  price  of  gold  fell  to  $413.50  an  ounce  in  Asia,  before  rebounding  slightly  in  early  European  trading.  |||    IMF  boss  Rodrigo  Rato  was  asked  by  G7  ministers  to  carry  out  a  study  into  the  feasibility  of  revaluing  and  selling  gold  reserves.  |||    He  is  expected  to  present  his  conclusions  at  an  IMF  meeting  in  Washington  during  April.  ""Whatever  happens  the  market  is  going  to  be  disconcerted  and  on  the  back  foot  until  the  April  IMF  meetings,""  said  John  Reade,  an  analyst  at  UBS.  The  IMF  values  its  gold  reserves  at  between  $40  and  $50  an  ounce,  a  price  that  was  fixed  in  the  1970s  and  is  about  a  tenth  of  the  metal's  current  market  value.  The  IMF  has  3,217  tonnes  of  gold,  or  about  113.5m  ounces.  Bringing  the  book  price  of  the  gold  in  line  with  market  value  would  boost  the  IMF's  balance  sheet,  giving  it  more  money  to  distribute.  |||    This  idea  has  been  put  forward  before,  but  there  now  seems  to  be  a  more  committed  political  drive  to  address  the  issue  of  global  poverty.  ""This  is  the  first  time  there  has  been  a  mention  of  the  use  of  gold  in  a  G7  communiqu&#233;  for  achieving  debt  relief,""  said  UK  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer  Gordon  Brown.  At  their  meeting  in  London,  G7  finance  ministers  backed  plans  to  write  off  up  to  100%  of  the  debts  owed  by  some  of  the  world's  poorest  countries.  Mr  Brown  said  the  meeting  would  be  remembered  as  ""the  100%  debt  relief  summit"".  While  debt  relief  seems  to  have  jumped  to  the  top  of  the  global  agenda,  not  everyone  is  convinced  that  selling  IMF  gold  is  the  best  way  forward.  The  US,  which  can  veto  any  plan  to  sell  IMF  gold  should  it  so  choose,  said  it  is  looking  at  other  ways  of  solving  the  problem.  ""The  US  is  not  convinced  that's  the  necessary  way  to  do  it,""  said  Treasury  Under  Secretary  John  Taylor.  Canada,  a  key  gold  producer,  also  expressed  reservations."

The  collection  was  housed  at  Versace's  six-storey  New  York  townhouse.  The  51-year-old  designer  was  shot  outside  his  Florida  home  in  1997  by  suspected  serial  killer  Andrew  Cunanan,  who  later  killed  himself.  The  auction,  at  Sotheby's,  will  feature  45  contemporary,  impressionist  and  19th  Century  paintings.  One  of  the  highlights  of  the  sale  is  Roy  Lichtenstein's  Blue  Nude  which  has  been  given  an  estimate  of  £1.8m  ($3.4m).  |||    Tobias  Meyer,  Sotheby's  worldwide  head  of  contemporary  art,  said:  ""This  collection  reflects  Mr  Versace's  wide-ranging  taste  and  impeccable  eye,  and  many  of  the  works  were  commissioned  directly  from  the  artists.  ""Outstanding  later  examples  from  champions  of  the  Pop  movement,  such  as  Roy  Lichtenstein,  are  juxtaposed  with  masterpieces  from  the  most  visible  artists  of  the  1980's,  including  Jean-Michel  Basquiat  and  the  collaborative  genius  of  Basquiat  and  Warhol,  as  well  as  Francesco  Clemente.""  Much  of  the  collection  will  be  offered  for  sale  at  three  auctions  in  New  York  in  June,  with  smaller  contemporary  paintings  going  under  the  hammer  in  London  on  22  and  23  June.  A  sale  of  Versace's  furniture  and  artworks  sold  in  2001fetched  £5.5m  ($10.3m)." 

2	"Blair  rejects  Tory  terror  offer  |||    Tony  Blair  has  rejected  a  Conservative  compromise  offer  that  could  have  eased  the  passage  of  anti-terror  legislation.  |||    The  Tories  wanted  a  sunset  clause  inserted  in  the  Anti-Terrorism  Bill  that  would  have  forced  ministers  to  revisit  it  in  November.  Mr  Blair  said  the  bill,  which  brings  in  house  arrest  for  terror  suspects,  had  time  limiting  safeguards  already.  The  Tories  say  they  will  vote  against  it  unless  changes  they  want  are  agreed.  The  Lib  Dems  also  oppose  the  plans.  |||    The  government  has  already  given  way  over  the  role  of  judges  in  house  arrest  cases.  |||    Mr  Blair's  refusal  to  accept  the  Tories'  sunset  clause  proposals  means  that  the  government  faces  concerted  opposition  from  all  sides  in  the  Lords.  Peers  begin  three  days  of  detailed  deliberation  on  the  bill  on  Thursday.  The  bill  proposes  ""control  orders"",  which  as  well  as  placing  terrorism  suspects  under  house  arrest  could  mean  curfews,  tagging  or  bans  on  telephone  and  internet  use.  These  would  replace  current  powers  to  detain  foreign  terror  suspects  without  trial,  which  the  law  lords  have  ruled  against  as  a  breach  of  human  rights.  |||    The  Tories  want  judicial  oversight  of  all  control  orders,  not  just  house  arrest.  Shadow  Home  Secretary  David  Davis  told  BBC  Radio  Four's  the  World  at  One  his  primary  concern  was  potential  miscarriages  of  justice.  He  said  if  someone  was  wrongly  given  a  control  order  it  would  act  as  a  ""recruiting  sergeant""  for  terrorists.  He  went  on  to  say:  ""If  we  don't  get  the  amendments  we  regard  as  essential,  including  the  sunset  clause,  we  will  vote  against  the  bill.""  In  the  Commons,  Mr  Howard  said  it  would  be  ""far  better  if  the  whole  of  the  legislation  was  subject  to  a  sunset  clause  so  Parliament  could  consider  it  all  in  a  proper  way  instead  of  it  being  ramrodded  through"".  Mr  Blair  said  the  house  arrest  powers  were  already  going  to  be  subject  to  a  sunset  clause  because  it  was  annually  renewable.  |||    The  second,  less  stringent,  type  of  control  orders  would  be  subject  to  a  court  appeal  within  14  days  and  there  would  be  a  three-monthly  report  on  their  use  by  ""an  eminent  and  independent  person"".  ""I  believe  (the  new  powers)  are  a  proper  balance  between  the  civil  liberties  of  the  subject  and  the  necessary  national  security  of  this  country  that  I  will  not  put  at  risk,""  said  Mr  Blair.  The  Lib  Dems  plan  to  oppose  the  Bill  in  the  Lords  on  Thursday.  Lib  Dem  home  affairs  spokesman  Mark  Oaten  said:  ""There's  a  lot  of  talking  left.  I  would  be  uneasy  about  supporting  a  very  bad  bill  even  if  it  was  just  for  eight  months.""  A  spokeswoman  for  Human  Rights  Watch  said  it  was  a  ""basic  principle""  that  people  should  only  be  punished  after  a  fair  trial.  She  added:  ""Having  a  judge  impose  those  punishments  without  a  trial  does  not  sanitise  them  either."""

This  week,  we're  hearing  from  Marianne  Petersen,  who  is  planning  to  convert  a  barn  in  Sweden  into  a  base  for  her  freelance  writing  work.  Click  on  the  link  under  her  photograph  to  read  her  story,  and  then  scroll  down  to  see  what  the  panel  have  to  say.  And  if  you  want  to  take  part  in  the  series,  go  to  the  bottom  of  the  story  to  find  out  how  to  get  in  touch.  |||    Working  from  home  presents  a  multitude  of  challenges.  Understanding  your  work  personality  allows  you  to  work  in  terms  of  your  own  style.  Do  you  feel  confident  about  your  work  output  without  conferring  with  others?  Are  you  able  to  retain  discipline  and  self  motivate  to  get  the  job  done?  Do  you  build  on  the  ideas  of  others  -  or  are  you  a  more  introspective  problem  solver?.  In  order  for  a  virtual  office  to  succeed,  keeping  the  boundary  between  work  and  home  life  is  essential.  It  may  be  useful  to  be  quite  rigid  about  who  is  allowed  to  visit,  and  to  keep  strict  office  hours.  Referring  to  the  space  as  work  will  give  those  around  you  a  clear  message  that  this  is  professional  space.  It  is  imperative  to  consider  how  to  bring  the  outside  world  into  yours,  keeping  up  to  date  with  developments  and  maintaining  a  network.  Isolated  work  environments  mean  this  has  to  be  carefully  thought  out,  and  a  strategy  has  to  be  developed  that  suits  both  your  personality  and  your  industry.  Joining  professional  groups  or  forming  a  loose  association  of  like-minded  people  may  assist.  It  is  useful  to  structure  these  meetings  in  advance  as  often  they  get  relegated  to  less  important  status  when  times  are  busy  -  with  the  danger  that  when  the  workload  eases,  they  have  to  be  resurrected.  |||      |||    Prior  to  any  interior  work  being  undertaken  it  is  essential  to  ensure  that  the  roof  and  walls  are  made  water-and-weather-tight,  and  the  structure  is  checked  for  stability.  It  appears  that  the  roof  trusses  may  need  repairs  and  additional  bracing.  |||    Ideally,  the  roof  should  be  replaced  with  an  outer  material  in  keeping  with  the  character  and  location  of  the  barn.  This  would  also  allow  for  a  well-insulated  inner  skin  to  be  provided  which  should  be  light  coloured.  It  is  likely  that  the  most  efficient  way  of  heating  the  building  is  with  electricity.  In  order  to  provide  this  the  owner  will  need  to  have  an  electrical  engineer  calculate  the  potential  heating,  power  and  lighting  load  to  make  sure  the  mains  supply  and  distribution  capacity  are  adequate.  Ideally,  it  would  be  good  to  have  a  mains  water  supply  and  some  means  of  drainage  for  toilet  and  washing  facilities.  The  walls  should  be  dry  lined  with  a  single  skin  of  plasterboard  laid  over  rockwool  slab  which  will  allow  good  wall  insulation  and  the  power  and  lighting  circuits  to  be  concealed,  and  the  walls  should  be  painted  in  a  light  colour.  The  owner  mentions  she  might  lay  a  new  floor  over  the  existing  planks;  this  will  improve  the  insulation  and  offer  a  level  surface.  I  would  suggest  laying  new  oak  veneer  planks  which  can  work  in  with  the  character  of  the  barn.  As  for  lighting,  consider  a  combination  of  floor  mounted  uplights,  wall  lights  (wall  washers)  and  selected  downlights.  Use  a  combination  of  mains  voltage  fluorescent  fittings  and  dimmable  units  which  can  vary  the  light  levels  and  the  feel  of  the  interior.  |||      |||    Please  click  on  the  link  to  the  right  here  to  see  my  ideas  for  Marianne's  barn.  |||    The  layout  of  this  office  reflects  the  need  to  have  a  working  area  and  a  more  relaxed  meeting  space.  Large  desk  space  and  extensive  storage  would  combine  with  tub  chairs  to  maximise  the  space  available.  The  finishes  chosen  for  the  furniture  will  need  to  reflect  the  unusual  setting,  while  the  lighting  and  temperature  control  mechanisms  used  will  further  influence  the  workplace.  |||      |||    Regarding  accessing  the  internet  via  the  connection  in  the  main  house,  your  plan  of  going  wireless  is  sensible.  A  wireless  router/access  point  in  the  house  with  a  wireless  LAN  card  in  the  PC  in  the  renovated  area  may  be  sufficient.  However,  important  points  to  consider  are  the  distance  between  the  two  buildings  and  the  nature  of  the  materials  through  which  the  signals  have  to  pass,  which  could  result  in  a  weak  signal  strength.  You  may  require  an  additional  wireless  access  point  in  the  renovated  area.  Your  local  IT  supplier  will  be  able  to  advise  on  this.  If  you  haven't  already  invested  in  robust  firewall  and  anti-virus  software,  it  is  essential  to  do  so,  to  protect  your  investment.  To  really  take  advantage  of  wireless  technology,  you  might  consider  a  laptop  computer  and  a  docking  station  with  external  mouse  and  monitor.  Or  you  could  use  one  of  the  new  Tablet  computers,  which  allow  you  to  write  directly  on  the  screen  and  convert  into  text  with  built-in  hand  recognition  software.  And  finally,  you  will  save  money  and  space  by  considering  a  multi-function  product  for  print,  scan,  copy  and  fax." 

3	"Murray  to  make  Cup  history  |||    Andrew  Murray  will  become  Britain's  youngest-ever  Davis  Cup  player  after  it  was  confirmed  he  will  play  in  the  doubles  against  Israel  on  Saturday.  |||    The  17-year-old  will  play  alongside  fellow  debutant  David  Sherwood  against  Israel's  Jonathan  Erlich  and  Andy  Ram.  Murray  will  eclipse  the  record  set  by  Roger  Becker  back  in  1952.  Greg  Rusedski  takes  Tim  Henman's  place  as  first  choice  in  the  singles,  while  Alex  Bogdanovic  will  play  in  the  second  singles  clash.  Rusedski  will  take  on  former  world  number  30  Harel  Levy  and  Bogdanovic  -  who  has  previously  played  in  two  singles  rubbers  against  Australia  -  will  face  Noam  Okun.  |||    Murray  is  the  brightest  young  hope  in  British  tennis,  after  winning  the  US  Open  junior  title  last  year  and  the  BBC  Young  Sports  Personality  of  the  Year.  British  number  one  Tim  Henman,  who  announced  his  Davis  Cup  retirement  earlier  this  year,  believes  Britain  can  win  the  tie  in  Tel  Aviv.  ""It's  going  to  be  as  really  tough  match.  Israel  have  some  really  good  players  -  and  their  doubles  pair  of  Andy  Ram  and  Jonathan  Erlich  are  among  the  top  eight  in  the  world  -  but  I  fancy  our  chances,""  he  said.  But  Henman  urged  Bogdanovic,  who  has  had  run-ins  with  British  tennis  officials  in  the  past,  to  seize  his  chance.  ""Alex  is  a  quality  player  -  he's  young  but  he's  got  to  keep  pushing  forward.  ""He's  got  to  be  stronger,  he's  got  a  lot  of  ability  but  he's  got  to  be  more  disciplined  mentally  and  physically  and  if  he  does  that  he's  got  a  good  chance."""

The  French  wine  industry,  the  world's  second  largest,  has  been  hit  by  declining  consumption  at  home  and  the  growing  popularity  of  New  World  wines.  Wine  makers,  however,  claimed  the  support  did  not  go  far  enough.  The  package  was  announced  by  agriculture  minister  Dominique  Bussereau  after  talks  with  vintners'  representatives.  |||    The  bulk  of  the  money  -  about  40m  euros  -  will  be  offered  in  the  form  of  preferential  loans  to  heavily  indebted  producers  to  enable  them  to  reschedule  their  payments.  A  further  15m  euros  will  be  made  available  to  wine  cooperatives,  which  make  up  the  majority  of  French  producers,  in  low  interest  loans.  Efforts  to  promote  French  wine  abroad  are  to  be  boosted  by  an  extra  3.5m  euros  in  funding.  France  fell  behind  the  'New  World'  producers  of  Australia,  Chile  and  the  United  States  for  the  first  time  in  2003  in  terms  of  exports.  |||    Domestic  consumption,  accounting  for  70%  of  sales,  has  suffered  from  strict  restrictions  on  advertising  and  tough  drink-driving  laws.  |||    The  aid  package  would  ""create  a  positive  climate  around  French  viticulture,""  Mr  Bussereau  said.  However,  wine  makers  and  farmers  said  the  support  was  much  less  than  they  had  been  hoping  for.  ""I  am  afraid  the  resources  are  not  up  to  the  ambitions,""  Jean-Michel  Lemetayer,  from  the  FNSEA  agricultural  union,  told  the  Associated  Press  news  agency.  In  an  effort  to  tackle  overcapacity,  the  government  will  agree  that  vines  can  be  destroyed  in  areas  where  growers  give  their  unanimous  consent,  while  500  vintners  will  be  helped  to  take  early  retirement.  The  government  will  also  seek  European  Union  approval  to  distil  about  250  million  litres  of  excess  wine  into  alcohol,  with  vintners  receiving  compensation.  Production  is  currently  outstripping  demand  by  about  30%.  The  support  is  designed  to  make  French  producers  more  competitive  in  the  face  of  increasing  global  consolidation  across  the  wine  industry.  Wine  makers  in  France's  best-known  regions,  such  as  Burgundy,  have  found  it  hard  to  invest  in  new  technology  and  to  create  recognisable  brands  to  appeal  to  overseas  buyers." 

2	"'Hitler'  row  over  Welsh  arts  cash  |||    An  artist  critical  of  Welsh  arts  funding  being  brought  under  assembly  government  control  has  denied  comparing  the  idea  with  dictatorships  in  Russia  and  Germany.  |||    Shani  Rhys  James  is  worried  that  the  Arts  Council  of  Wales  may  be  taken  over  by  the  Welsh  Assembly  Government.  Culture  Minister  Alun  Pugh  said  it  would  be  ""crass  and  ignorant""  to  liken  a  quango  review  to  Hitler's  Germany.  But  Ms  James  emphasised  she  had  actually  said  artists  needed  freedom.  The  future  of  the  Arts  Council  of  Wales  has  been  in  question  since  it  was  announced  that  most  Welsh  quangos  would  eventually  be  abolished.  |||    It  was  announced  last  July  that  three  Welsh  quangos,  education  and  training  body  Elwa,  the  Wales  Tourist  Board  and  the  Welsh  Development  Agency,  would  be  brought  under  assembly  government  control.  The  Arts  Council  of  Wales  may  be  among  the  next  to  come  under  the  assembly  government's  umbrella.  But  Ms  James,  who  won  the  £30,000  Jerwood  painting  prize  in  2003,  said  arts  funding  should  be  separate  from  government.  Ms  James  told  BBC  Radio  Wales:  ""It's  quite  dangerous  when  you  involve  politicians  because  it's  not  like  the  health  service  and  it's  not  like  the  railways.  ""Free  expression  is  absolutely  vital  in  a  democratic  society.  You  need  distance,  you  do  not  need  government  interference  because  it  could  be  taken  the  wrong  way.""  |||    But  she  said  reports  that  she  had  likened  the  assembly  government  to  totalitarian  regimes  were  inaccurate.  |||    She  told  Good  Morning  Wales:  ""Just  to  put  the  record  straight,  that  business  in  the  paper  where  it  said  I  likened  the  government  to  Bolshevik  Russia  or  Hitler's  Germany,  the  actual  quote  I  gave  was:  'It  is  vital  to  a  civilised  society  that  we  allow  artists  to  express  themselves  without  government  control'.  ""As  we  know  from  past  European  history,  i.e.  Russia  and  Germany  in  the  early  20th  Century,  artists  will  go  underground  or  leave  the  country  or  rather  than  compromise  their  expression'.  ""Artists  need  a  free  voice  to  express  themselves  -  they  reflect  a  truth  through  their  own  art  forms.'""  She  said  the  assembly  government  was  not  best  placed  to  run  the  arts  in  Wales.  |||    She  added:  ""It  would  be  a  momentous  change  and  devastating  to  the  arts.  It  would  set  the  arts  scene  back  60  years,  because  I  really  don't  think  the  government  has  the  expertise.  ""If  you  have  the  National  Assembly  taking  control,  I  fear  you  are  going  to  be  going  back  to  the  dragons  and  leeks  and  the  choirs.  |||    ""Wales  has  moved  on.  It  is  international  now.  It  is  not  set  back  in  How  Green  Was  My  Valley?""  Responding  to  Ms  James'  criticisms,  Mr  Pugh  said:  ""The  structure  of  unelected  quangos  is  under  review  and  we  have  made  it  clear  that  further  announcements  are  due  shortly.  ""Comparing  the  Welsh  Assembly  Government  to  Hitler's  Germany  is  a  crass  and  ignorant  response  to  a  real  issue  about  democratic  accountability.""  Ms  James,  whose  father  was  Welsh,  was  born  in  Melbourne  where  her  parents  worked  in  the  theatre.  She  moved  to  Powys  nearly  20  years  ago  where  she  works  from  her  studio  near  Llangadfan.  She  has  won  a  number  of  arts  prizes  including  the  Wales  Open  in  1989  and  the  Mostyn  Open  in  1991." 

2	"Blunkett  hints  at  election  call  |||    Ex-Home  Secretary  David  Blunkett  has  given  fresh  clues  that  the  general  election  will  be  announced  on  Monday.  |||    He  told  BBC  Radio  Five  Live:  ""I'm  out  in  my  constituency  getting  ready  for  what  we  presume  will  be  an  announcement  very  shortly  at  the  weekend.""  He  clarified  that  he  meant  he  would  be  in  his  Sheffield  seat  this  weekend,  not  that  he  expected  an  election  call  then.  Tony  Blair  is  tipped  to  ask  the  Queen  on  Monday  to  dissolve  Parliament  ready  for  a  5  May  poll."

A  reading  above  50  indicates  a  level  of  growth.  The  result  for  December  was  slightly  better  than  analysts'  expectations  and  the  19th  consecutive  expansion.  The  ISM  said  the  growth  was  driven  by  a  ""significant""  rise  in  the  new  orders.  ""This  completes  a  strong  year  for  manufacturing  based  on  the  ISM  data,""  said  chairman  of  the  ISM's  survey  committee.  ""While  there  is  continuing  upward  pressure  on  prices,  the  rate  of  increase  is  slowing  and  definitely  trending  in  the  right  direction.""  |||    The  ISM's  index  of  national  manufacturing  activity  is  compiled  from  monthly  responses  of  purchasing  executives  at  more  than  400  industrial  companies,  ranging  from  textiles  to  chemicals  to  paper,  and  has  now  been  above  50  since  June  2003.  Analysts  expected  December's  figure  to  come  in  at  58.1.  The  ISM  manufacturing  index's  main  sister  survey  -  the  employment  index  -  eased  to  52.7  in  December  from  57.6  in  November,  while  its  ""prices  paid""  index,  measuring  the  cost  to  businesses  of  their  inputs,  also  eased  to  72.0  from  74.0.  The  ISM's  ""new  orders""  index  rose  to  67.4  from  61.5." 

2	"UK  plan  to  deport  terror  suspects  |||    Deals  are  being  sought  to  allow  the  UK  to  deport  terror  suspects  to  their  home  countries  without  risk  of  them  being  tortured  or  sentenced  to  death.  |||    Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  told  the  Times  he  hoped  agreement  with  several  countries  could  be  reached.  The  move  follows  a  Law  Lords  judgement  that  the  detention  of  12  men  at  Belmarsh  prison,  London,  and  Woodhill,  Milton  Keynes,  was  unlawful.  The  12  affected  by  the  ruling  are  from  Algeria,  Tunisia,  Egypt  and  Jordan.  The  government  was  told  that  using  anti-terror  legislation  brought  in  after  11  September  to  hold  the  men  indefinitely  without  charge  broke  human  rights  laws.  |||    Mr  Clarke  told  The  Times:  ""I  think  we  should  be  prosecuting  much  more  energetically  our  ability  to  deport  the  individuals  concerned  to  the  countries  from  which  they  come.""  He  said  it  was  a  route  that  was  being  pursued  in  collaboration  with  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw  ""in  a  very  positive  way"".  Mr  Clarke  said  that  he  was  seeking  ""memorandums  of  understanding""  between  overseas  governments  and  Britain  to  ensure  suspects  would  not  be  subjected  to  the  death  penalty  on  their  return.  However,  he  added:  ""I  do  not  think  the  solution  to  the  Law  Lords'  judgement  for  this  government  is  in  deportations,  but  they  will  help.  ""There  are  other  strands  that  we  have  to  do.""  But  the  Liberal  Democrat's  shadow  home  secretary,  Mark  Oaten,  accused  Mr  Clarke  of  avoiding  the  main  issue  with  the  Belmarsh  detainees.  |||    ""The  critical  issue  that  the  home  secretary  is  dodging  at  this  stage  is  to  deal  with  the  very  principle,  to  deal  with  how  we  tackle  this  problem  in  the  future,""  he  told  BBC  News.  ""And  I  do  want  him  to  grasp  those  issues  and  that  means  looking  at  how  we  can  actually  secure  convictions  in  this  country  allowing,  for  example,  intercept  communications,  telephone  tapping  to  be  included,""  Mr  Oaten  said.  ""Deportation  may  tackle  this  initial  problem  but  I  want  to  see  a  wider  debate  urgently  about  how  we  can  actually  get  trials  and  convictions  in  this  country.""  ""Unless  we  get  that,  the  Liberal  Democrats  will  vote  against  this  measure  when  it  comes  for  renewal  in  March.""  |||    The  BBC's  home  affairs  correspondent,  Daniel  Sandford,  said  it  appeared  Mr  Clarke  was  putting  more  emphasis  on  the  possibility  of  deportation  than  his  predecessor,  David  Blunkett.  But  he  said  reaching  an  understanding  with  some  of  the  detainees'  home  countries  could  be  difficult.  ""Some  of  these  people  are  accused  of  very,  very  serious  crimes  in  their  home  countries  so  it's  not  an  easy  agreement  to  get  and  I  think  for  some  of  these  suspects  it  won't  be  the  solution.""  Daniel  Sandford  said  ministers  may  try  to  put  forward  other  solutions  -  such  as  allowing  more  secret  evidence  to  be  put  into  normal  criminal  trials  or  developing  a  more  secret  trials  process  -  in  the  next  few  weeks.  ""The  government  may  try  and  deport  some  of  them  and  then  those  that  are  left  see  if  they  can  work  out  some  way  of  putting  them  on  trial,""  he  said." 

3	"Yachvili  savours  France  comeback  |||    France  scrum-half  Dimitri  Yachvili  praised  his  team  after  they  fought  back  to  beat  England  18-17  in  the  Six  Nations  clash  at  Twickenham.  |||    Yachvili  kicked  all  of  France's  points  as  they  staged  a  second-half  revival.  ""We  didn't  play  last  week  against  Scotland  and  we  didn't  play  in  the  first  half  against  England,""  he  said.  ""But  we're  very  proud  to  beat  England  at  Twickenham.  We  were  just  defending  in  the  first  half  and  we  said  we  had  to  put  them  under  pressure.  We  did  well.""  Yachvili  admitted  erratic  kicking  from  England's  Charlie  Hodgson  and  Olly  Barkley,  who  missed  six  penalties  and  a  drop  goal  chance  between  them,  had  been  decisive.  ""I  know  what  it's  like  with  kicking.  When  you  miss  some  it's  very  hard  mentally,  but  it  went  well  for  us,""  he  said.  France  captain  Fabien  Pelous  insisted  his  side  never  doubted  they  could  secure  their  first  win  against  England  at  Twickenham  since  1997.  France  were  17-6  down  at  half-time,  but  Pelous  said:  ""No-one  was  down  at  half-time,  we  were  still  confident.  ""We  said  we  only  had  11  points  against  us,  which  was  not  much.  ""The  plan  was  to  keep  hold  of  possession  and  pressure  England  to  losing  their  composure.""  France  coach  Bernard  Laporte  accepted  his  side  had  not  played  well.  ""We  know  we  have  to  play  better  to  defend  the  title,""  he  said.  ""I'm  not  happy  we  didn't  score  a  try  but  we're  happy  because  we  won."""

The  Malagasy  franc,  which  lost  almost  half  its  value  in  2004,  is  no  longer  legal  tender  but  will  remain  exchangeable  at  banks  until  2009.  The  phasing  out  of  the  franc,  begun  in  July  2003,  was  intended  to  distance  the  country  from  its  past  under  French  colonial  rule  and  address  the  problem  of  the  large  amount  of  counterfeit  francs  in  circulation.  ""It's  above  all  a  question  of  sovereignty,""  Reuters  quoted  a  central  bank  official  as  saying.  ""It  is  symbolic  of  our  independence  from  the  old  colonial  ways.  Since  we  left  the  French  monetary  zone  in  1973  we  should  have  our  own  currency  with  its  own  name.""  The  ariary  was  the  name  of  a  pre-colonial  currency  in  the  Indian  Ocean  island  state." 

2	"McConnell  in  'drunk'  remark  row  |||    Scotland's  first  minister  has  told  a  group  of  high  school  pupils  that  it  is  okay  to  get  drunk  ""once  in  a  while"".  |||    Jack  McConnell  was  speaking  to  more  than  100  secondary  pupils  from  schools  in  the  Highlands  about  the  problems  of  binge  drinking  and  drink  promotions.  He  has  been  criticised  by  the  SNP  for  encouraging  young  people  to  get  drunk.  But  the  Scottish  Executive  has  insisted  Mr  McConnell  was  speaking  about  adults  and  his  comments  were  ""a  recognition  that  people  will  get  drunk"".  The  first  minister's  comments  came  in  a  question  and  answer  session  at  Glenurquhart  High  School  in  Inverness,  attended  by  pupils  from  a  number  of  secondary  schools.  A  Highland  councillor  who  was  at  the  event  has  also  defended  Mr  McConnell.  Margaret  Davidson,  the  independent  member  for  the  Loch  Ness  West,  said  the  first  minister  was  speaking  in  a  very  general  way  and  she  was  sure  he  was  speaking  about  adults  at  the  time.  |||    When  one  pupil  asked  Mr  McConnell  how  the  executive  proposed  to  tackle  under-age  drinking,  began  his  response  with  the  quip:  ""I'm  sure  there's  no  under-age  drinking  in  the  Highlands.""  He  went  on  to  speak  about  the  evils  of  binge  drinking  and  railed  against  irresponsible  drinks  promotions.  He  said:  ""I  hope  I'm  not  going  to  be  seen  as  preaching  to  anybody  here  but  the  really  serious  problem  at  the  moment  is  binge  drinking  and  the  impact  it  has  on  people's  health  and  their  ability  to  control  what's  happening  round  about  them.""  Mr  McConnell  said  he  regularly  saw  reports  on  the  effects  of  binge  drinking  sprees  which  ended  in  assaults  or  even  rapes,  and  on  the  health  consequences  of  binge  drinking.  ""The  one  thing  we  are  going  to  do  something  really  serious  about  is  binge  drinking  and  irresponsible  drinks  promotions  that  can  help  lead  to  that,""  he  said.  ""Far  too  many  pub  chains  in  particular  are  selling  far  too  much  booze  far  too  cheaply  and  encouraging  people  to  drink  it  far  too  quickly.  ""We  are  go  to  clamp  down  on  that  and  make  those  promotions  illegal  in  the  hope  that  people  can  enjoy  a  drink  sensibly  over  the  course  of  an  evening.""  |||    He  added:  ""By  all  means  get  drunk  once  in  a  while  -  but  do  not  get  into  a  situation  where  people  are  being  encouraged  to  get  completely  incapable  just  to  save  some  money  and  drink  more  quickly.""  SNP  Holyrood  leader  Nicola  Sturgeon  said:  ""This  is  an  incredible  gaffe  by  Jack  McConnell.  ""We  all  know  that  under-age  drinking  is  an  issue  in  Scotland  but  it  is  quite  staggering  that  any  politician,  particularly  the  First  Minister,  should  encourage  young  people  to  get  drunk.  ""The  first  minister  should  withdraw  these  remarks  immediately.""  But  an  executive  spokeswoman  insisted  Mr  McConnell  had  made  the  remark  with  adults,  not  youngsters,  in  mind.  ""He  was  talking  in  the  context  of  adults  binge  drinking  and  irresponsible  drinks  promotions  -  which  are  for  the  over-18s,""  she  said.  ""It  was  just  a  recognition  that  people  will  get  drunk,  but  that  binge  drinking  and  drinks  promotions  that  encourage  it  are  not  acceptable."""

Green  Day,  the  Foo  Fighters  and  Keane  are  among  the  acts  that  had  already  been  lined  up  to  appear  at  the  event.  However,  the  organisers  have  revealed  Scots  favourites  Travis  as  well  as  soulman  James  Brown  will  also  appear.  |||    Last  year  tickets  sold  out  10  weeks  before  the  festival  but  organisers  confirmed  that  all  130,000  for  the  two-day  event  had  been  sold.  Geoff  Ellis,  CEO  of  festival  organisers  Big  Day  Out  Ltd,  said  this  year's  event  promises  to  be  the  best  yet.

1	"Box  office  blow  for  Alexander  |||    Director  Oliver  Stone's  historical  epic  Alexander  has  failed  in  its  bid  to  conquer  the  box  office,  entering  the  US  film  charts  at  number  six.  |||    The  swords  and  sandals  blockbuster,  rumoured  to  have  cost  more  than  $150m  (£79m)  to  make,  earned  just  $13.5  (£7m)  over  three  days  at  the  US  box  office.  Due  to  the  Thanksgiving  holiday,  the  film  opened  on  Wednesday,  bringing  its  total  takings  to  $21.6m  (£11.4m).  Top  of  the  box  office  for  a  second  week  was  action  movie  National  Treasure.  The  family  adventure,  starring  Nicolas  Cage,  took  $33.1m  (£17.m),  ahead  of  animated  comedy  The  Incredibles  -  now  in  its  fourth  week  in  the  charts  -  which  took  $24.1m  (£12.7m).  |||    Last  week  Oliver  Stone's  film  met  with  scathing  reviews  from  US  critics.  The  film  stars  Irish  actor  Colin  Farrell  as  one  of  history's  most  celebrated  leaders  -  a  relentless  and  arrogant  warrior  who  conquered  much  of  the  known  world  by  the  age  of  25.  In  particular,  its  portrayal  of  Alexander  as  a  bisexual  has  met  with  a  hostile  reception  and  the  threat  of  legal  action  from  Greek  lawyers.  ""Though  the  battles  have  the  blood-and-sinew  bravado  you  expect  from  Oliver  Stone,  this  three-hour  buttnumbathon  is  hamstrung  by  a  hectoring  grandiosity,""  wrote  one  reviewer  in  Rolling  Stone  magazine.  Others  poured  scorn  on  Farrell's  bleached  hair  and  Angelina  Jolie's  unwieldy  accent,  which  Variety  called  ""a  combination  of  Mata  Hari  and  Count  Dracula""  .  But  novelist  Gore  Vidal  defended  the  film,  saying  it  was  ""barrier-breaking""  for  its  frank  depiction  of  bisexuality.  |||    In  Sweden  last  Thursday,  to  pick  up  a  lifetime  achievement  award  at  the  Stockholm  International  Film  Festival,  Stone  expressed  the  hope  that  Alexander  might  be  better  appreciated  in  Europe.  ""One  of  the  reasons  I  am  being  honoured  here  is  Europeans  tend  to  see  me  a  little  differently  than  they  do  in  the  US,""  said  the  director  behind  JFK,  Platoon  and  Born  on  the  Fourth  of  July.  He  added  Alexander  ""was  not  an  easy  movie,  but  then  I've  never  made  easy  movies""." 

1	"Halloween  writer  Debra  Hill  dies  |||    Screenwriter  and  producer  Debra  Hill,  best  known  for  her  work  on  the  70s  horror  classic  Halloween,  has  died  in  Los  Angeles  aged  54.  |||    Hill,  who  had  been  suffering  from  cancer,  co-wrote  the  1978  film,  which  starred  Jamie  Lee  Curtis  as  a  babysitter  terrorised  by  a  psychopath.  Directed  by  John  Carpenter,  it  made  over  $60m  (£31.3m)  worldwide  -  a  record  for  independent  film  at  that  time.  Hill  also  worked  with  Carpenter  on  Escape  From  New  York  and  The  Fog.  Born  in  New  Jersey,  Hill  began  her  career  as  a  production  assistant  and  worked  her  way  through  the  ranks,  becoming  an  assistant  director  and  second-unit  director  before  she  began  collaborating  with  Carpenter.  |||    She  was  regarded  by  many  as  a  pioneering  woman  in  film,  taking  on  jobs  in  the  70s  that  were  more  commonly  taken  by  men.  ""Back  when  I  started  in  1974,  there  were  very  few  women  in  the  industry,""  she  said  in  2003.  ""I  was  assumed  to  be  the  make-up  and  hair  person,  or  the  script  person.  I  was  never  assumed  to  be  the  writer  or  producer.""  ""I  took  a  look  around  and  realised  there  weren't  that  many  women,  so  I  had  to  carve  a  niche  for  myself.""  Carpenter  said  that  working  with  Hill  was  ""one  of  the  greatest  experiences  of  my  life"".  ""The  ground  that  she  trailblazed  in  the  beginning  can  now  be  followed  by  anyone.  She  was  incredibly  capable  and  talented,""  he  said.  Carpenter  and  Hill  collaborated  on  a  number  of  Halloween  sequels,  including  Halloween  II,  Halloween:  Resurrection  and  Halloween:  The  Curse  of  Michael  Myers.  |||    Later  in  her  career,  Hill  formed  a  production  company  with  her  friend  Lynda  Obst,  making  a  string  of  hit  films  including  Oscar  nominee  The  Fisher  King  and  teen  comedy  Adventures  In  Babysitting.  Other  films  included  the  Stephen  King  adaptation  The  Dead  Zone  in  1983  and  1985's  Clue,  a  comedy  based  on  the  board  game  Cluedo.  In  the  90s  she  pursued  work  in  TV,  although  she  was  reunited  with  Carpenter  in  1996  for  Escape  From  LA,  the  sequel  to  Escape  From  New  York.

Second  favourite  is  a  biography  of  Mary  Queen  of  Scots,  by  John  Guy.

Small  Island,  Levy's  fourth  novel,  is  set  in  post-war  London  and  centres  on  a  landlady  and  her  lodgers.  One  is  a  Jamaican  who  joined  British  troops  to  fight  Hitler  but  finds  life  difficult  out  of  uniform  when  he  settles  in  the  UK.  ""What  could  have  been  a  didactic  or  preachy  prospect  turns  out  to  hilarious,  moving  humane  and  eye-popping.

The  judges  called  Guy's  My  Heart  is  My  Own:  The  Life  of  Mary  Queen  of  Scots  ""an  impressive  and  readable  piece  of  scholarship,  which  cannot  fail  but  leave  the  reader  moved  and  intrigued  by  this  most  tragic  and  likeable  of  queens"".  Guy  has  published  many  histories,  including  one  of  Tudor  England.  He  is  a  fellow  at  Clare  College,  Cambridge  and  became  a  honorary  research  professor  of  the  University  of  St  Andrews  in  2003.  |||    The  other  contenders  include  Susan  Fletcher  for  Eve  Green,  which  won  the  first  novel  prize.

As  a  relatively  unknown  author  this  award  will  give  her  exposure  to  a  wider  and  mass  audience  that  she  may  not  have  reached  and  is  a  perfect  example  of  the  influence  of  the  Whitbread.

Dirty  War  -  screened  uncut  on  BBC  One  last  September  -  depicts  a  dirty  bomb  attack  on  the  City  of  London.  It  is  also  being  screened  uncut  on  US  cable  channel  HBO  on  24  January.  PBS  said  it  will  use  extra  footage  for  its  broadcast,  showing  the  woman  ""from  a  more  discreet  angle""  instead.  |||    The  US  Federal  Communications  Commission  fined  CBS  $550,000  (£306,814)  last  autumn  for  singer  Janet  Jackson's  ""wardrobe  malfunction"",  during  which  her  breast  was  exposed  during  a  dance  routine  with  Justin  Timberlake.  Many  US  networks  and  broadcasters  are  now  more  nervous  about  airing  nudity,  violence  or  bad  language.  Ms  Atlas  said  PBS  could  put  itself  financially  at  risk  if  it  showed  the  uncut  version  of  Dirty  War,  and  it  could  also  deter  many  of  its  170  individual  stations  from  airing  ""an  important  film"".  ""You  want  to  pick  your  battles,""  she  said.  She  added  that  PBS,  which  is  a  private,  non-profit  media  enterprise  owned  and  operated  by  the  nation's  349  public  television  stations,  is  bolder  about  screening  non-fiction  or  historical  programming.  PBS  is  seen  in  virtually  all  US  homes  with  TV,  and  describes  itself  as  a  ""trusted  community  resource""  serving  nearly  100  million  people  each  week."

Yukos  argued  that  since  it  had  a  US  subsidiary  and  local  bank  accounts,  the  US  court  could  declare  it  bankrupt  and  stop  the  auction  of  Yugansk.  But  Deutsche  Bank  -  itself  a  target  of  a  Yukos  lawsuit  -  said  documents  had  been  backdated  to  strengthen  the  case.  |||    Deutsche  Bank's  evidence  came  on  the  first  day  of  a  two-day  hearing  in  Houston.  Its  lawyer,  Hugh  Ray,  told  the  court  that  Yukos  had  claimed  it  had  transferred  $27m  into  two  Texas  bank  accounts  opened  by  its  new  US  subsidiary.  By  doing  so,  he  said,  the  firm  had  intended  to  reinforce  its  US  presence  -  and  thus  its  chances  of  getting  its  case  heard  in  US  courts.  But  he  said  that  the  papers  documenting  the  transaction  were  not  drawn  up  till  weeks  after  Yukos  made  its  bankruptcy  application  on  14  December,  and  then  backdated.  |||    Yukos  chief  financial  officer  Bruce  Misamore,  who  had  moved  to  the  US  in  early  December  to  set  up  Yukos  USA,  acknowledged  the  point.  He  said  the  discrepancy  was  only  in  the  paperwork,  but  that  money  had  indeed  been  transferred  on  14  December.  Even  so,  he  told  the  court  that  only  $480,000  had  been  in  the  accounts  that  day,  with  the  rest  arriving  a  day  later.  |||    Deutsche  Bank  is  involved  in  the  case  because  it  is  itself  being  sued  by  Yukos.  It  had  agreed  to  loan  to  an  arm  of  Russian  state  gas  firm  Gazprom  the  money  to  bid  for  Yuganskneftegaz,  as  the  Yukos  unit  is  formally  known.  The  sale  went  ahead,  despite  an  order  from  the  US  bankruptcy  court  ordered  that  it  should  be  stopped.  In  the  end,  the  auction  was  won  by  an  unknown  shell  company  for  $9.4bn  -  much  less  than  most  assessments  of  its  value  -  before  ending  up  in  the  hands  of  state-controlled  oil  firm  Rosneft.  Rosneft,  meanwhile,  has  agreed  to  merge  with  Gazprom,  bringing  a  large  chunk  of  Russia's  very  profitable  oil  business  back  under  state  control.  |||    Yukos  maintains  that  it  filed  for  bankruptcy  in  the  US  because  it  feared  it  would  not  be  able  to  do  so  in  Russia.  It  also  said  that  in  the  event  of  going  bust,  it  could  offer  the  chance  of  restructuring.  ""It  gives  us  a  kind  of  life  after  death  alternative,""  said  Yukos  chief  executive  Steven  Theede.  Yukos  is  currently  suing  four  companies  -  Gazprom,  its  unit  Gazpromneft,  Rosneft  and  the  shell  company  which  won  the  bidding  -  for  their  part  in  Yugansk's  disposal.  It  has  also  threatened  to  sue  the  Russian  government  for  $28bn.  Analysts  have  questioned  whether  a  US  court  has  any  jurisdiction  over  Russian  companies,  while  Moscow  officials  have  dismissed  Yukos'  legal  wrangling  as  meaningless.  Yukos  claims  that  the  rights  of  its  shareholders  have  been  ignored  and  that  is  has  been  punished  for  the  political  ambitions  of  its  founder  Mikhail  Khodorkovsky.  Mr  Khodorkovsky,  once  Russia's  richest  man,  is  in  prison,  having  been  charged  with  fraud  and  tax  evasion  and  repeatedly  denied  bail."

Mortgage  lending  rose  by  £7.1bn  in  December,  up  from  a  £6.4bn  rise  in  November.  The  figures  contradict  a  survey  from  the  British  Bankers'  Association,  which  said  approvals  were  at  a  five-year  low.  |||    Analysts  say  the  figures  show  the  market  may  be  stabilising  but  still  point  to  further  house  price  softness.  ""The  modest  rise  in  mortgage  approvals  and  lending  in  December  reinforces  the  impression  that  the  housing  market  is  currently  slowing  steadily  rather  than  sharply,""  said  Global  Insight  analyst  Howard  Archer,  commenting  on  the  BoE's  figures.  The  BBA  believes  that  the  property  market  is  continuing  to  cool  down.  Changes  to  mortgage  regulation  may  have  artificially  depressed  figures  in  November,  thus  flattering  the  December  figures,  analysts  said.  In  October  last  year,  new  rules  came  into  force,  which  meant  some  lenders  were  forced  to  withdraw  mortgage  products  temporarily  in  November  and  defer  some  lending  until  they  had  made  sure  they  had  complied  with  the  rules  properly.  Separately,  the  Bank  of  England  said  that  consumer  credit  rose  by  £1.5bn  in  December,  more  than  the  £1.4bn  expected  and  above  the  £1.4bn  reported  in  the  previous  month."

Lord  Archer  spent  two  years  in  prison  after  being  convicted  of  perjury  and  perverting  the  course  of  justice.  The  former  Tory  deputy  chairman's  five-year  suspension  from  the  party  has  just  elapsed.  |||    A  jury  ruled  that  Lord  Archer  lied  during  a  libel  trial  against  the  Daily  Star  at  the  High  Court  in  London  in  1987.  |||    He  won  damages  after  the  newspaper  printed  allegations  about  involvement  with  a  prostitute.  Dr  Fox  was  asked  if  he  would  say  yes  or  no  if  Lord  Archer  applied  to  rejoin.  ""I'm  sure  that  in  line  with  people  having  served  their  sentence  and  having  done  some  reparations  for  what  they  did  wrong,  we  would  look  at  that  sympathetically.  ""I  don't  believe  in  vindictiveness,  I  don't  think  that  has  any  place  in  politics,  unlike  the  prime  minister  and  Alastair  Campbell.""  |||    Tory  peer  Lord  Tebbit  said  he  agreed  with  Dr  Fox's  view,  and  said  the  case  should  be  looked  at  on  its  merits.  ""After  all,  he  is  far  from  being  the  worst  perjurer  in  the  world,""  he  added.  Meanwhile,  senior  Conservative  MP  Sir  Teddy  Taylor  warned  that  moves  bring  Lord  Archer  back  into  the  fold  could  be  controversial.  He  said:  ""I  suppose,  on  a  Sunday  in  particular,  we  should  always  make  provision  for  forgiving  sinners.  But  there  is  no  doubt  it  would  be  controversial.""  Lord  Archer,  who  was  not  available  for  comment,  remains  a  popular  figure  among  constituency  Tory  parties  and  is  a  successful  fundraiser.  He  has  not  been  seen  in  the  House  of  Lords  since  his  release  from  prison  in  July  2003,  although  there  is  nothing  in  the  rules  to  prevent  him  from  attending."

The  economy  contracted  in  2003.  Foreign  sales  increased  by  8.2%  last  year,  compared  with  a  0.3%  slide  in  private  consumption.  Concerns  remain,  however,  over  the  strength  of  the  euro,  weak  domestic  demand  and  a  sluggish  labour  market.  The  European  Central  Bank  (ECB)  left  its  benchmark  interest  rate  unchanged  at  2%  on  Thursday.  It  is  the  nineteenth  month  in  a  row  that  the  ECB  has  not  moved  borrowing  costs.  Economists  predict  that  an  increase  is  unlikely  to  come  until  the  second  half  of  2005,  with  growth  set  to  sputter  rather  than  ignite.  |||    ""During  2004  we  profited  from  the  fact  that  the  world  economy  was  strong,""  said  Stefan  Schilbe,  analyst  at  HSBC  Trinkaus  &  Burkhardt.  ""If  exports  weaken  and  domestic  growth  remains  poor,  we  cannot  expect  much  from  2005.""  Many  German  consumers  have  been  spooked  and  unsettled  by  government  attempts  to  reform  the  welfare  state  and  corporate  environment.  Major  companies  including  Volkswagen,  DaimlerChrysler  and  Siemens  have  spent  much  of  2004  in  tough  talks  with  unions  about  trimming  jobs  and  costs.  They  have  also  warned  there  are  more  cost  cutting  measures  on  the  horizon."

They  use  ""pester  power""  to  get  their  parents  to  stump  up  nearly  a  third  of  this  income,  the  report  said.  As  for  how  they  spend  their  cash,  the  bulk  goes  on  personal  care,  soft  drinks  and  food,  Datamonitor  said.  |||    Datamonitor  adds  that  British  teenagers  are  keen  on  personal  care  because  it  helps  them  combine  two  seemingly  contradictory  emotional  needs  -  the  desire  to  fit  in  and  the  desire  to  express  their  individuality.  |||    British  teenage  girls,  compared  to  their  counterparts  in  seven  European  countries,  are  the  most  keen  to  use  make-up  products.  Nearly  three  out  of  four  girls  said  they  used  make-up.  According  to  the  Datamonitor  report  the  trend  marked  British  teenagers  out  as  ""particularly  important  to  cosmetics  manufacturers  as  they  are  likely  to  experiment  more  with  brands  and  products  and  form  long-term  beauty  routines"".  And  the  good  times  are  likely  to  keep  rolling  for  British  children,  as  the  report  predicts  that  they  will  still  be  topping  the  earnings  table  in  2008."

The  unit  was  however  sold  for  $9.4bn  to  state  oil  firm  Rosneft  but  only  after  the  state  auction  had  been  disrupted.  |||    Yukos  lawyers  now  say  the  auction  violated  US  bankruptcy  law.  The  company  and  its  main  shareholders  have  vowed  to  go  after  any  company  that  buys  its  assets,  using  all  and  every  legal  means.  The  company  wants  damages  of  $20bn,  claiming  Yuganskneftegas  was  sold  at  less  than  market  value.  Judge  Letitia  Clark  will  hear  different  motions,  including  one  from  Deutsche  Bank  to  throw  out  the  Chapter  11  bankruptcy  filing.  The  German  lender  is  one  of  six  banks  that  were  barred  from  providing  financing  to  Gazprom,  the  Russian  state-owned  company  that  was  expected  to  win  the  auction  for  Yuganskneftegas.  Deutsche  Bank,  which  is  also  an  advisor  to  Gazprom,  has  called  on  the  US  court  to  overturn  its  decision  to  provide  Yukos  with  bankruptcy  protection.  |||    Lifting  the  injunction  would  remove  the  uncertainty  that  surrounds  the  court  case  and  clarify  Deutsche  Bank's  business  position,  analysts  said.  |||    Analysts  are  not  optimistic  about  Yukos'  chances  in  court.  Russian  President  Vladimir  Putin  and  the  country's  legal  authorities  have  repeatedly  said  that  the  US  has  no  jurisdiction  over  Yukos  and  its  legal  wranglings.  On  top  of  that,  the  firm  only  has  limited  assets  in  the  US.  Yukos  has  won  small  victories,  however,  and  is  bullish  about  its  chances  in  court.  ""Do  we  have  an  ability  to  influence  what  happens?  We  think  we  do,""  said  Mike  Lake,  a  Yukos  spokesman.  ""The  litigation  risks  are  real,""  said  Credit  Suisse  First  Boston  analyst  Vadim  Mitroshin  The  dispute  with  the  Russian  authorities  is  partly  driven  by  President  Putin's  clampdown  on  the  political  ambitions  of  ex-Yukos  boss  Mikhail  Khodorkovsky.  Mr  Khodorkovsky  is  in  jail  on  charges  of  fraud  and  tax  evasion."

The  German  exchange  said  it  had  held  ""constructive,  professional  and  friendly""  talks  with  the  LSE.  But  Euronext  declined  to  comment  after  the  talks  ended  on  Friday.  Speculation  is  mounting  that  the  Germans  may  raise  their  bid  to  £1.5bn.  Deutsche  Boerse  previously  offered  £1.3bn,  which  was  rejected  by  the  LSE,  while  Euronext  is  rumoured  to  have  facilities  in  place  to  fund  a  £1.4bn  cash  bid.  So  far,  however,  neither  have  tabled  a  formal  bid.  But  a  deal  with  either  bidder  would  create  the  biggest  stock  market  operator  in  Europe  and  the  second  biggest  in  the  world  after  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange.  |||    There  was  speculation  Euronext  would  use  Friday's  meeting  as  an  opportunity  to  take  advantage  of  growing  disquiet  over  Deutsche  Boerse's  own  plans  for  dominance  over  the  London  market.  Unions  for  Deutsche  Boerse  staff  in  Frankfurt  has  reportedly  expressed  fears  that  up  to  300  jobs  would  be  moved  to  London  if  the  takeover  is  successful.  ""The  works  council  has  expressed  concerns  that  the  equities  and  derivatives  trade  could  be  managed  from  London  in  the  future,""  Reuters  news  agency  reports  a  union  source  as  saying.  German  politicians  are  also  said  to  be  angry  over  the  market  operator's  promise  to  move  its  headquarters  to  London  if  a  bid  were  successful.  |||    Meanwhile,  LSE  shareholders  fear  that  Deutsche  Boerse's  control  over  its  Clearstream  unit  -  the  clearing  house  that  processes  securities  transactions  -  would  create  a  monopoly  situation.  This  would  weaken  the  position  of  shareholders  when  negotiating  lower  transaction  fees  for  share  dealings.  LSE  and  Euronext  do  not  have  control  over  their  clearing  and  settlement  operations,  a  situation  which  critics  say  is  more  transparent  and  competitive.  The  German  group's  ownership  of  Clearstream  has  been  seen  as  the  main  stumbling  block  to  a  London-Frankfurt  merger.  Commentators  believe  Deutsche  Boerse,  which  has  now  formally  asked  German  authorities  to  approve  its  plan  to  buy  the  LSE,  may  offer  to  sell  Clearstream  to  gain  shareholder  approval.  Euronext,  so  far,  has  given  little  away  as  to  what  sweeteners  it  will  offer  the  LSE  -  Europe's  biggest  equity  market  -  into  a  deal." 

2	"Blair  stresses  prosperity  goals  |||    Tony  Blair  says  his  party's  next  manifesto  will  be  ""unremittingly  New  Labour""  and  aimed  at  producing  ""personal  prosperity  for  all"".  |||    The  prime  minister  is  trying  to  draw  a  line  under  speculation  over  the  state  of  his  relationship  with  Gordon  Brown  with  the  speech  in  Chatham,  Kent.  He  is  saying  that  prosperity  means  both  individual  wealth  and  ensuring  ""radically  improved""  public  services.  He  is  also  claiming  Labour  is  more  ideologically  united  than  ever.  Mr  Brown  is  currently  touring  Africa  after  a  week  of  facing  questions  about  reports  of  his  splits  with  Downing  Street.  |||    With  the  election  widely  predicted  for  May,  angry  Labour  MPs  this  week  warned  Mr  Blair  and  Mr  Brown  about  the  dangers  of  disunity.  Now  Mr  Blair  is  trying  to  put  the  focus  on  the  substance  of  Labour's  platform  for  a  third  term  in  government.  Labour  made  low  inflation,  unemployment  and  mortgage  rates  the  centrepiece  of  a  new  poster  campaign  this  week.  |||    And  on  Thursday  Mr  Blair  is  saying:  ""I  want  to  talk  about  the  central  purpose  ofNew  Labour  -  which  is  to  increase  personal  prosperity  and  well-being,  not  justfor  a  few  but  for  all.  ""By  prosperity  I  mean  both  the  income  and  wealth  of  individuals  and  theirfamilies,  and  the  opportunity  and  security  available  to  them  through  radicallyimproved  public  services  and  a  reformed  welfare  state.""  |||    The  Tories  are  trying  to  capitalise  on  the  apparent  feud  at  the  top  of  government.  On  Wednesday  they  unveiled  a  poster  which  pictured  the  prime  minister  and  Mr  Brown  under  the  words  ""How  can  they  fight  crime  when  they  are  fighting  each  other?""  Michael  Howard  and  frontbencher  John  Redwood  on  Thursday  launched  new  plans  to  abolish  hundreds  of  quangos.  They  say  government  is  spending  too  much  and  lower  taxes  are  needed  to  make  Britain  more  competitive.  |||    The  Liberal  Democrats  have  also  claimed  infighting  its  obstructing  good  government.  The  latest  speculation  about  relations  between  New  Labour's  two  most  powerful  figures  came  after  the  publication  of  a  new  book,  Brown's  Britain  by  Robert  Preston.  In  it  he  alleges  that  Mr  Blair  told  Mr  Brown  in  2003  he  would  step  down  as  prime  minister  before  the  coming  general  election.  The  book  claims  the  premier  went  back  on  his  pledge  after  support  from  Cabinet  allies  and  suspicion  that  Mr  Brown  was  manoeuvring  against  him.  Mr  Peston's  book  claimed  that  Mr  Brown  told  Mr  Blair:  ""There  is  nothing  you  could  ever  say  to  me  now  that  I  could  ever  believe.""  On  Wednesday  Mr  Blair  directly  denied  Mr  Brown  made  that  quote,  and  before  he  left  for  Africa  on  Tuesday  the  chancellor  told  reporters:  ""Of  course  I  trust  the  prime  minister.""" 

2	"NHS  waiting  time  target  is  cut  |||    Hospital  waiting  times  for  patients  in  Wales  are  to  be  cut,  but  not  to  the  same  extent  as  those  in  England.  |||    Welsh  Health  Minister  Jane  Hutt  said  no  patient  would  wait  more  than  12  months  for  an  outpatient  appointment  by  March  2006,  against  a  current  target  of  18  months.  But  she  said  the  target  for  an  inpatient  appointment  would  remain  at  12  months  for  March  2006.  The  announcement  came  as  new  monthly  waiting  figures  showed  a  drop.  This  current  inpatient  target  was  set  when  the  assembly  government  extended  its  second  offer  guarantee  scheme,  which  gives  patients  the  option  of  having  their  treatment  outside  Wales.  |||    Details  about  funding  to  resource  the  new  targets  are  expected  in  the  New  Year.  In  England,  the  current  target  for  inpatients  -  seeing  a  consultant  to  having  an  operation  -  is  six  months.  Dr  Richard  Lewis,  Welsh  secretary  of  the  British  Medical  Association  (BMA),  welcomed  the  new  targets  ""to  make  further  and  faster  progress  on  waiting  lists"".  ""However,  much  remains  to  be  done  on  waiting  lists  and  waiting  times  because  Wales  still  lags  a  long  way  behind  England,""  he  said.  ""Capacity  must  be  built  into  the  system  with  sustained  investment  to  ensure  that  Welsh  patients  don't  receive  a  worse  service  than  patients  over  the  border.""  Health  analyst  Tony  Beddow,  from  the  Welsh  Institute  for  Health  and  Social  Care,  called  the  new  targets  ""reasonably  impressive"".  |||    On  Wednesday,  Ms  Hutt  also  announced  £264m  for  health  services  will  be  spent  reducing  waiting  times,  improving  key  areas  and  modernising  staff  pay  structures  in  Wales.  |||    Ms  Hutt  said  major  achievements  had  been  made  in  cutting  ""unacceptably  long  waits  for  treatment  over  the  past  year"".  ""We  are  turning  the  corner  on  long  waits  in  Wales.  Now  we  need  to  see  those  reductions  in  long  waiters  being  improved  again,""  she  said.  She  added  the  targets  intended  to  ensure  no-one  waits  more  than  a  year  for  treatment  or  to  see  a  consultant.  ""But  let  us  not  forget  two  thirds  of  those  waiting  for  treatment  now  are  waiting  less  than  six  months,  and  these  targets  affect  the  small  minority  of  patients  in  Wales  that  are  waiting  far  too  long.""  Rhodri  Glyn  Thomas,  Plaid  Cymru  health  spokesman  said:  ""It's  exactly  the  same  target  she  set  in  1999,  with  the  qualification  that  it's  dependent  on  a  second  offer.  It's  a  failed  target,  from  a  failed  minister..with  a  failed  policy.""  For  the  Welsh  Liberal  Democrats,  Kirsty  Williams  called  the  new  target  ""hugely  unambitious"".  ""It  leaves  patients  in  Wales  still  waiting  two  years  before  they're  treated.""  Conservative  health  spokesman  Jonathan  Morgan  said:  ""We're  spending  more  money  but  waiting  lists  have  gone  through  the  roof.  ""The  Audit  Commission  has  said  that  the  money  is  not  being  spent  efficiently  or  effectively,  and  that's  quite  a  criticism.""  Meanwhile,  the  latest  monthly  waiting  list  figures  showed  the  total  number  of  people  waiting  more  than  18  months  as  an  inpatient  in  Wales  has  fallen  by  9.8%.  Statistics  to  the  end  of  November  showed  a  decline  since  October  from  785  to  708.  The  number  waiting  over  12  months  also  fell  from  7,613  to  6,630,  or  12.9%.  Ms  Hutt  said  they  were  ""excellent  figures"".  There  are  305,775  people  on  a  waiting  list  of  some  kind,  down  from  311,764  last  month." 

0	"Orange  colour  clash  set  for  court  |||    A  row  over  the  colour  orange  could  hit  the  courts  after  mobile  phone  giant  Orange  launched  action  against  a  new  mobile  venture  from  Easyjet's  founder.  |||    Orange  said  it  was  starting  proceedings  against  the  Easymobile  service  for  trademark  infringement.  Easymobile  uses  Easygroup's  orange  branding.  Founder  Stelios  Haji-Ioannou  has  pledged  to  contest  the  action.  The  move  comes  after  the  two  sides  failed  to  come  to  an  agreement  after  six  months  of  talks.  Orange  claims  the  new  low-cost  mobile  service  has  infringed  its  rights  regarding  the  use  of  the  colour  orange  and  could  confuse  customers  -  known  as  ""passing  off"".  |||    ""Our  brand,  and  the  rights  associated  with  it  are  extremely  important  to  us,""  Orange  said  in  a  statement.  ""In  the  absence  of  any  firm  commitment  from  Easy,  we  have  been  left  with  no  choice  but  to  start  an  action  for  trademark  infringement  and  passing  off.""  However,  Mr  Haji-Ioannou,  who  plans  to  launch  Easymobile  next  month,  vowed  to  fight  back,  saying:  ""We  have  nothing  to  be  afraid  of  in  this  court  case.  ""It  is  our  right  to  use  our  own  corporate  colour  for  which  we  have  become  famous  during  the  last  10  years.""  The  Easyjet  founder  also  said  he  planned  to  add  a  disclaimer  to  the  Easygroup  website  to  ensure  customers  are  aware  the  Easymobile  brand  has  no  connection  to  Orange.  The  new  service  is  the  latest  venture  from  Easygroup,  which  includes  a  chain  of  internet  cafes,  budget  car  rentals  and  an  intercity  bus  service.  Easymobile  will  allow  customers  to  go  online  to  order  SIM  cards  and  airtime  -  which  will  be  rented  from  T-Mobile  -  for  their  existing  handsets." 

2	"UK  firms  'embracing  e-commerce'  |||    UK  firms  are  embracing  internet  trading  opportunities  as  never  before,  e-commerce  minister  Mike  O'Brien  says.  |||    A  government-commissioned  study  ranked  the  UK  third  in  its  world  index  of  use  of  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT).  The  report  suggests  69%  of  UK  firms  are  now  using  broadband  and  that  30%  of  micro  businesses  are  trading  online.  Mr  O'Brien  said  UK  businesses  were  sprinting  forward  in  ICT  use,  but  that  there  were  more  challenges  ahead.  The  report,  carried  out  independently  by  consultants  Booz  Allen  Hamilton  and  HI  Europe,  placed  the  UK  third  behind  Sweden  and  Ireland  for  business  use  of  ICT.  |||    It  showed  British  business  brought  greater  maturity  to  their  ICT  use,  by  using  broadband  in  increased  numbers,  bringing  ICT  into  their  business  plans  and  using  new  technologies  such  as  voice  activated  programmes  and  desktop  video  conferences.  Mr  O'Brien  said:  ""The  increase  in  the  proportion  of  business  connected  by  broadband  shows  that  UK  companies  are  embracing  the  opportunities  that  ICT  can  bring.  ""It  is  particularly  encouraging  to  see  that  small  businesses  are  beginning  to  narrow  the  digital  divide  that  appeared  to  have  opened  up  in  recent  years.""  The  government  would  play  its  part  in  ""cultivating  an  environment  where  information  and  communication  technologies  can  flourish"",  Mr  O'Brien  said.  The  ""clear  message""  the  report  sends  is  that  effective  use  of  ICT  can  bring  real  improvements  in  business  performance  for  all  business.  |||    ""However,  we  are  not  at  the  finishing  line  yet  and  many  challenges  remain  if  the  UK  is  to  reach  its  aim  of  becoming  a  world-leading  e-economy,""  he  added.  The  International  Benchmarking  Study  was  based  on  8,000  telephone  interviews  with  businesses,  of  which  more  than  2,700  were  UK  businesses.  It  is  the  eighth  in  a  series  of  examining  the  adoption  and  deployment  of  ICT  in  the  world's  most  industrialised  nations." 

0	"Crude  oil  prices  back  above  $50  |||    Cold  weather  across  parts  of  the  United  States  and  much  of  Europe  has  pushed  US  crude  oil  prices  above  $50  a  barrel  for  the  first  time  in  almost  three  months.  |||    Freezing  temperatures  and  heavy  snowfall  have  increased  demand  for  heating  fuel  in  the  US,  where  stocks  are  low.  Fresh  falls  in  the  value  of  the  dollar  helped  carry  prices  above  the  $50  mark  for  the  first  time  since  November.  A  barrel  of  US  crude  oil  closed  up  $2.80  to  $51.15  in  New  York  on  Tuesday.  Opec  members  said  on  Tuesday  that  it  saw  no  reason  to  cut  its  output.  |||    Although  below  last  year's  peak  of  $55.67  a  barrel,  which  was  reached  in  October,  prices  are  now  well  above  2004's  average  of  $41.48.  |||    Brent  crude  also  rose  in  London  trading,  adding  $1.89  to  $48.62  at  the  close.  Much  of  western  Europe  and  the  north  east  of  America  has  been  shivering  under  unseasonably  low  temperatures  in  recent  days.  The  decline  in  the  US  dollar  to  a  five-week  low  against  the  euro  has  also  served  to  inflate  prices.  ""The  dollar  moved  sharply  overnight  and  oil  is  following  it,""  said  Chris  Furness,  senior  market  strategist  at  4Cast.  ""If  the  dollar  continues  to  weaken,  oil  will  be  obviously  higher.""  |||    Several  Opec  members  said  a  cut  in  production  was  unlikely,  citing  rising  prices  and  strong  demand  for  oil  from  Asia.  ""I  agree  that  we  do  not  need  to  cut  supply  if  the  prices  are  as  much  as  this,""  Fathi  Bin  Shatwan,  Libya's  oil  minister,  told  Reuters.  ""I  do  not  think  we  need  to  cut  unless  the  prices  are  falling  below  $35  a  barrel,""  he  added.  Opec  closely  watches  global  stocks  to  ensure  that  there  is  not  an  excessive  supply  in  the  market.  The  arrival  of  spring  in  the  northern  hemisphere  will  focus  attention  on  stockpiles  of  US  crude  and  gasoline,  which  are  up  to  9%  higher  than  at  this  time  last  year.  Heavy  stockpiles  could  help  force  prices  lower  when  demand  eases." 

0	"Trial  begins  of  Spain's  top  banker  |||    The  trial  of  Emilio  Botin,  the  chairman  of  Spain's  most  powerful  bank,  Santander  Central  Hispano,  has  started  in  Madrid.  |||    Mr  Botin  is  accused  of  misusing  the  bank's  funds  after  he  approved  the  payment  of  160m  euros  ($208m;  £111m)  in  bonus  and  pension  payouts  to  two  former  executives.  However,  the  trial  was  suspended  when  Mr  Botin's  lawyer  introduced  a  new  set  of  documents  on  the  day  testimony  was  set  to  begin.  A  three-judge  panel  gave  prosecution  lawyers  until  Monday  to  study  the  documents,  when  the  trial  will  be  reconvened.  |||    The  high-profile  case  began  after  two  Santander  shareholders  filed  a  criminal  complaint  about  the  payments  to  Jose  Maria  Amusategui  and  Angel  Corcostegui,  who  stepped  down  in  2001.  Both  executives  helped  Mr  Botin  orchestrate  Spain's  biggest  bank  merger,  between  Santander  and  Banco  Central  Hispano,  in  1999.  As  he  arrived  at  Spain's  High  Court  earlier  on  Wednesday,  Mr  Botin  greeted  the  waiting  media,  saying:  ""I  have  full  faith  in  justice.""  Santander's  board  of  governors  strongly  reject  the  charges  against  their  chairman,  saying  the  payouts  were  legal  and  made  with  their  unanimous  support.  But  if  convicted,  Mr  Botin  could  face  a  prison  term  of  up  to  six  years.  Mr  Corcostegui,  a  former  CEO  at  Santander,  also  asked  the  court  for  new  evidence  to  be  admitted.  In  spite  of  the  allegations  against  him,  Mr  Botin  continues  to  lead  Santander,  and  was  instrumental  in  the  £8.5bn  takeover  last  November  of  the  British  bank  Abbey  National.  Since  taking  over  the  chairmanship  in  1986,  he  has  turned  Santander  into  one  of  the  top  ten  biggest  banks  in  the  world." 

1	"Ethnic  producers  'face  barriers'  |||    Minority  ethnic  led  (Mel)  production  companies  face  barriers  in  succeeding  in  the  film  and  television  industries,  research  has  suggested.  |||    The  study,  commissioned  by  Pact  and  the  UK  Film  Council,  included  interviews  with  industry  experts  and  individuals.  They  indicated  that  career  progression  and  a  lack  of  role  models  are  among  the  main  problems  within  such  companies.  The  research  indicated  that  about  10%  of  independent  production  companies  in  the  UK  are  minority  ethnic  led.  |||    A  minority  ethnic  led  company  is  defined  as  one  in  which  the  majority  of  decision-making  power  rests  with  an  individual  or  individuals  from  a  minority  ethnic  group.  The  report  also  explored  the  problems  faced  by  such  companies  when  attempting  to  compete  within  the  film  and  TV  industries.  It  said  they  are  often  smaller  than  other  companies  and  lack  the  resources,  so  are  often  squeezed  out  of  the  market  by  bigger  firms.  The  research  recommended  that  minority  ethnic  led  companies  could  benefit  from  such  positive  actions  as  career  training  and  business  advice,  plus  improved  communication  within  the  film  and  TV  sectors.  ""The  UK  has  a  rich  and  diverse  culture  and  it  is  essential  that  it  is  reflected  on  film  and  television,""  said  Arts  minister  Estelle  Morris  of  the  findings.  ""I  welcome  this  report  which  I  hope  will  lead  to  more  doors  being  opened  and  all  businesses  in  our  film  and  television  industries  being  given  the  same  opportunities.""" 

2	"Ministers  deny  care  sums  'wrong'  |||    Ministers  have  insisted  they  are  committed  to  free  personal  care  for  the  elderly  despite  research  suggesting  the  cost  of  the  policy  was  under-estimated.  |||    A  report  by  the  Fraser  of  Allander  Institute  says  the  decision  to  push  ahead  with  the  flagship  policy  was  based  on  flawed  research.  Deputy  Health  Minister  Rhona  Brankin  has  pledged  to  study  the  research.  SNP  Holyrood  leader  Nicola  Sturgeon  said  the  public  needed  reassurance  that  the  care  programme  was  secure.  |||    The  rise  in  costs  stems  from  a  series  of  mistakes  in  the  research  used  by  the  ""care  development  group""  of  Scottish  Executive  experts  who  prepared  the  original  costings,  according  to  findings  published  in  the  Quarterly  Economic  Commentary  of  Strathclyde  University's  Fraser  of  Allander  Institute.  ""Dubious""  assumptions  about  improving  health  expectancy  could  drive  the  cost  of  the  policy  up  by  another  £130m  by  2022,  the  report  warned.  |||    It  was  carried  out  by  husband  and  wife  economist  team  Jim  and  Margaret  Cuthbert.  But  Ms  Brankin  told  BBC  Radio  Scotland:  ""We  don't  think  we  got  our  sums  wrong.  ""Obviously  we  will  examine  the  findings  of  this  new  report,  along  with  figures  from  our  own  research  that  we  have  already  commissioned.  ""We  will  look  in  great  detail  at  any  contribution  to  this,  because  we  need  to  be  sure  we  can  provide  free  personal  care  and  nursing  care  for  our  older  people  into  the  future.  ""And  we  are  absolutely  committed  to  doing  that.""  |||    But  the  Scottish  National  Party  called  on  ministers  to  reassure  people  that  enough  funding  is  in  place  to  support  the  free  personal  care  policy.  Ms  Sturgeon  said  that  while  she  had  no  reason  to  doubt  the  executive's  support  for  the  policy,  there  were  questions  which  needed  to  be  answered  and,  if  necessary,  sums  redone.  She  said:  ""Serious  concerns  have  been  raised  and  there  are  questions  which  need  to  be  answered  by  the  Scottish  Executive.  ""We  need  to  know  that  the  money  is  there,  not  just  for  this  year  or  next  year,  but  into  the  future  so  that  older  people,  and  those  who  are  looking  forward  to  older  age,  can  rest  assured  that  their  personal  care  needs  will  be  met."""

It  was  also  agreed  that  a  programme  to  ""de-mystify""  the  issue  to  athletes,  the  public  and  the  media  was  a  priority.  ""Nothing  was  decided  to  change  things  -  it  was  more  to  have  a  forum  of  the  stakeholders  allowing  them  to  express  themselves,""  said  an  IAAF  spokesman.  ""Getting  everyone  together  gave  us  a  lot  of  food  for  thought.""  About  60  people  attended  Sunday's  meeting  in  Monaco,  including  IAAF  chief  Lamine  Diack  and  Namibian  athlete  Frankie  Fredericks,  now  a  member  of  the  Athletes'  Commission.  ""I  am  very  happy  to  see  you  all,  members  of  the  athletics  family,  respond  positively  to  the  IAAF  call  to  sit  together  and  discuss  what  more  we  can  do  in  the  fight  against  doping,""  said  Diack.  ""We  are  the  leading  Federation  in  this  field  and  it  is  our  duty  to  keep  our  sport  clean.""  The  two  task  forces  will  report  back  to  the  IAAF  Council,  at  its  April  meeting  in  Qatar." 

2	"School  sport  'is  back',  says  PM  |||    Tony  Blair  has  promised  that  ""sport  is  back""  as  a  priority  for  schools.  |||    The  prime  minister  launched  a  £500m  initiative  to  allow  school  sports  clubs  in  England  to  provide  up  to  three  hours  of  extra  activity  a  week  by  2010.  ""It's  an  important  part  of  education  and  it's  an  important  part  of  health,""  Mr  Blair  said.  But  the  Conservatives  say  government  proposals  -  which  include  two  hours'  PE  within  school  for  75%  of  pupils  by  2006  -  are  unrealistic.  |||    The  latest  move  is  aimed  at  encouraging  more  diversity  in  sport,  with  activities  such  as  yoga  and  Tai  Chi  being  options.  Launching  the  initiative,  Mr  Blair  completed  an  agility  course  and  shot  basketball  hoops  with  students  from  the  all-girl  Waverley  Sports  College  in  Southwark,  south  London.  He  said:  ""You've  got  to  bring  back  school  sport.  It's  got  to  be  done  differently  than  it  was  30  or  40  years  ago.  It's  still  very,  very  important.""  |||    Earlier,  Education  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  told  BBC  News  there  were  at  least  three  areas  which  needed  ""a  coherent  framework""  and  ""dedicated  funding"".  These  were  training  for  PE  teachers,  establishing  more  specialist  schools  and  the  development  of  partnerships  for  activities  such  as  inter-school  competitions.  He  added  the  government  had  originally  pledged  ""for  every  pupil  to  get  at  least  two  hours  of  high-quality  physical  education""  a  week.  The  proportion  was  currently  at  62%,  and  the  government  was  hoping  this  would  rise  to  85%  by  2008  and  100%  by  2010.  The  money  for  the  initiative  will  come  from  a  new  £500m  fund.  |||    The  £500m  move  will  also  increase  the  number  of  specialist  sport  colleges  from  350  to  400.  But  the  Conservatives  warned  of  rising  obesity  levels  and  said  that  since  only  a  third  of  children  do  two  hours  of  sport  a  week  currently,  the  government  is  promising  something  it  cannot  guarantee.  Shadow  spokesman  for  sport  Hugh  Robertson  said:  ""I  suspect  the  correct  way  to  tackle  it  is  to  look  at  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum  and  try  to  enable  the  clubs  -  which  is  where  the  real  passion  for  sport  exists  -  to  deliver  the  school  sport  offer.""  He  said  more  emphasis  should  be  put  on  traditional  sports,  saying  that  an  ""anti-competitive  sport  agenda""  had  been  pursued  in  recent  years.  Martin  Ward,  of  the  Secondary  Heads  Association,  said  members  did  not  like  ""ring-fenced  funds""  and  that  it  should  be  up  to  the  schools  themselves  to  decide  how  to  spend  their  money." 

0	"Lesotho  textile  workers  lose  jobs  |||    Six  foreign-owned  textile  factories  have  closed  in  Lesotho,  leaving  6,650  garment  workers  jobless,  union  officers  told  the  AP  news  agency.  |||    Factory  Workers  Union  secretary  general  Billy  Macaefa  blamed  the  closures  on  the  end  of  worldwide  textile  quotas.  The  quotas  for  developing  nations,  ended  on  1  January,  gave  them  a  set  share  of  the  rich  countries'  markets.  They  also  limited  the  amount  countries  like  China  could  export  to  the  big  markets  of  the  United  States  and  EU.  |||    ""We  understand  that  some  (owners)...  were  complaining  that  the  South  African  rand  was  strong  against  the  US  dollar,  and  they  were  losing  when  exporting  textiles  and  clothing  to  the  United  States,""  Mr  Macaefa  said  at  a  news  briefing  in  the  capital,  Maseru.  Lesotho's  currency,  the  maloti,  is  fixed  to  the  rand.  ""But  we  suspect  that  they  left  the  country  unceremoniously  because  of  the  end  of  quotas  introduced  by  the  World  Trade  Organization.""  He  said  the  six  factories  were  Leisure  Garments,  Modern  Garments,  Precious  Six  Garments,  TW  Garments,  Lesotho  Hats  and  Vogue  Landmark.  The  owners  -  two  from  Taiwan,  two  from  China,  one  from  Mauritius  and  one  from  Malaysia  -  left  over  the  December  holiday  period  without  informing  or  paying  their  employees,  he  said.  |||    Union  leaders  and  trade  campaigners  have  been  warning  that  developing  nations  such  as  Lesotho,  Sri  Lanka,  and  Bangaldesh  could  lose  thousands  of  jobs  once  the  quotas  were  lifted.  In  the  mountainous  country  surrounded  by  South  Africa,  it  is  feared  as  many  as  50,000  textile  workers  could  lose  their  jobs,  and  Mr  Mafeca  said  he  expected  more  companies  to  leave.  The  assistance  of  a  US  law  had  given  Lesotho's  textiles  duty-free  access  to  North  American  markets.  The  African  Growth  and  Opportunity  Act  (AGOA),  gave  sub-Saharan  countries  preferential  access  to  the  US  market  for  apparel  and  textile  products  as  well  as  a  wide  range  of  other  goods.  A  Lesotho  government  news  briefing  is  expected  on  Wednesday."

""It's  a  lifetime  achievement  award,  which  is  completely  and  utterly  surreal,  given  I'm  only  30  years  old,""  DiCaprio  said.  ""But  what  has  it  been?  Almost  17  years  now.  I've  done  quite  a  few  films.""  A  retrospective  of  his  movies  was  shown.  |||    ""What's  really  exciting,  for  me,  is  that  this  is  what  I  really  love  doing,""  he  added.  ""It's  what  I  want  to  do  for  the  rest  of  my  life.""  DiCaprio  began  his  movie  career  in  horror  film  Critters  3,  before  moving  onto  roles  in  The  Basketball  Diaries,  Romeo  and  Juliet,  Titanic  and  Gangs  of  New  York.  The  achievement  award  was  created  to  commemorate  the  California  festival's  20th  anniversary  and  coincided  with  DiCaprio's  portrayal  of  millionaire  Howard  Hughes  in  The  Aviator.  |||    Veteran  actress  Jane  Russell,  who  starred  in  Hughes'  1943  film  The  Outlaw,  said  was  impressed  by  DiCaprio's  quest  for  authenticity  when  he  previously  discussed  the  role  with  her.  ""I  was  very  happy  that  (DiCaprio)  came  and  cared  to  come  up  and  find  out  what  (Hughes)  was  really  like,""  she  said.  The  Aviator  has  taken  pole  position  in  this  year's  Oscars  race  with  11  nominations,  including  nominations  for  best  film,  best  actor  for  DiCaprio  and  best  director  for  Scorsese." 

1	"DVD  review:  Harry  Potter  and  the  Prisoner  of  Azkaban  |||    This  third  Harry  Potter  film  brought  a  change  of  director  and  a  dramatic  visual  shake-up  that  really  shines  on  DVD.  |||    Gone  are  the  warm,  bright  colours  found  in  the  two  earlier  films,  Alfonso  Cuaron  brings  in  a  bleak  and  cold  feel  that  is  simply  gorgeous  -  and  looks  even  better  here  than  in  the  cinema.  It  is  all  part  of  the  progression  of  Harry's  story  into  darker  areas,  but  you'll  spend  time  just  marvelling  at  the  beautiful  Hogwarts  landscape.  |||    This  is  the  first  Potter  film  where  you  get  so  lost  in  the  screen  adaptation  that  you  forget  the  book.  It  is  the  third  year  at  Hogwarts  and  studies  are  interrupted,  as  they  always  are,  by  a  calamity  that  only  Harry,  Ron  and  Hermione  can  put  right.  |||    It  sounds  corny.  But  Harry  is  no  longer  the  winsome  hero,  he  is  a  moody  teenager  and  Daniel  Radcliffe  pulls  it  off  very  well.  Emma  Watson  is  ever  better  as  Hermione,  and  the  young  stars  are  joined  by  the  usual  myriad  famous  actors  including  Gary  Oldman  and  Emma  Thompson.  The  film  itself  is  the  reason  to  buy  this  DVD.  But  it  is  laden  with  behind-the-scenes  extras,  including  funny,  if  shallow,  interviews  with  all  the  main  cast.  But  what  seems  like  a  long  list  of  features  can  be  swiftly  whittled  down  to  the  few  that  you  are  going  to  watch.  Younger  viewers  will  go  for  the  games  which  include  a  Magic  You  May  Have  Missed  memory  test,  and  Crookshanks  chasing  off  after  Scabbers.  Adult  viewers  will  ignore  those  and  go  straight  to  the  deleted  scenes.  You  will  understand  why  they  were  deleted  but  it  is  fun  to  see  more  footage  -  and  not  have  to  hunt  through  endless  menus  to  find  it,  as  we  did  on  the  first  Harry  Potter  DVD.  The  most  interesting  pieces  are  an  interview  with  JK  Rowling  in  Creating  The  Vision  and  Conjuring  A  Scene,  a  short  featurette  about  the  making  of  the  film's  big  moments."

Hide  And  Seek,  which  was  knocked  off  the  top  of  the  US  box  office  by  Boogeyman  last  month,  fell  one  place.  Oscar  nominee  Hotel  Rwanda  was  also  a  new  entry  in  the  chart,  at  number  five.  The  film,  which  scored  Oscar  nominations  for  Don  Cheadle  and  British  actress  Sophie  Okonedo,  made  £507,  596  in  its  first  week  of  nationwide  release.  |||    Comedy  sequel  Meet  The  Fockers  and  Shall  We  Dance?,  starring  Jennifer  Lopez  and  Richard  Gere,  completed  the  top  five.  Clint  Eastwood's  Million  Dollar  Baby  re-entered  the  charts  at  number  eight,  following  its  recent  success  at  the  Oscars.  The  boxing  drama,  which  won  four  awards  including  best  film  and  best  director,  has  made  £4.4m  to  date.  Two  other  new  entries,  a  remake  of  the  1965  film  Flight  of  the  Phoenix,  and  the  teen  comedy  Harold  and  Kumar  Get  The  Munchies,  debuted  outside  the  top  10." 

2	"Labour's  four  little  words  |||    Labour  has  unveiled  the  four  little  words  that  will  form  the  heart  of  its  general  election  campaign  which,  for  those  just  returned  from  the  planet  Galifray,  is  ""looming"".  |||    The  slogan  ""Britain  forward  not  back""  (no,  it's  not  an  instruction  from  one  of  those  inter-planetary  Time  Lords)  is  to  become  as  much  a  part  of  our  daily  lives  as  the  sky  -  it's  always  there  but  we  mostly  stop  noticing.  The  word  ""Britain""  is  cast  on  a  red  background  -  a  nod  to  Old  Labour.  ""Forward""  is  in  italics  and  cunningly  slopes  forward  and,  along  with  ""not  back"",  is  set  against  a  mushy  pea  green  background.  As  one  of  the  journalists  assembled  at  the  unveiling  declared,  it  was  all  very  post  modern,  or  something.  Great  use  of  colour.  Those  ad  men  really  do  earn  their  money.  And,  coincidentally,  the  ad  men  who  came  up  with  the  abandoned  flying  pigs  and  so-called  ""Fagin""  posters  which  caused  Tory  protests  have  not  been  sacked  but,  as  election  supremo  Alan  Milburn  declared,  ""are  doing  a  very  good  job"".  |||    Mr  Milburn,  in  the  latest  in  his  series  of  pre-election-campaign  campaigning,  explained  the  slogan  was  the  reaction  to  polling  which  suggests  the  public  believe  Labour  and  Tony  Blair  are  the  future  while  Michael  Howard  and  the  Tories  would  take  the  country  backwards.  ""Not  many  people  talk  about  the  years  before  1997  as  the  good  old  days,""  he  declared.  It  would  be  an  aggressive  campaign  because  things  would  inevitably  boil  down  to  a  choice  between  Labour  and  the  Tories.  |||    Nobody,  he  claimed,  could  picture  Liberal  Democrat  leader  Charles  Kennedy  walking  up  Downing  Street  the  day  after  polling.  They  could,  however,  picture  Michael  Howard  or,  of  course,  Tony  Blair  doing  it.  So  it  was  only  right  that  the  campaign  concentrated  on  rigorously  examining  the  opposition's  policies  and  past  record.  And  Tony  Blair  would  be  in  the  very  front  line  of  that  campaign,  he  said.  ""Between  now  and  the  election  the  prime  minister  will  be  spending  more  time  out  of  London  than  in  it  but  in  Britain,  not  overseas,""  he  promised.  ""He  will  be  leading  the  domestic  debate  from  the  front,  listening,  taking  the  flak.""  So,  let's  get  on  with  it  then."

Vieira  also  clashed  with  opposing  skipper  Roy  Keane  and  referee  Graham  Poll  had  to  separate  them.  ""The  referee  has  confirmed  that  he  is  satisfied  he  dealt  with  the  incident  at  the  time,""  said  an  FA  statement.  It  means  United's  win  will  pass  off  without  further  intervention  from  the  governing  body,  whose  new  chief  executive  Brian  Barwick  was  in  the  Highbury  stands.  |||    ""I  didn't  threaten  anybody.  They  are  big  enough  players  to  handle  themselves,""  said  Vieira.  ""I  had  a  talk  with  Roy  Keane  and  that's  it.  Gary  Neville  is  a  big  lad,  he  can  handle  himself.  ""They  just  played  better  than  us  and  deserved  to  win.""  Neville  admitted  there  had  been  incidents  before  the  game,  but  insisted  it  had  not  distracted  his  focus.  ""There  were  a  couple  of  things  that  did  happen  before  the  game  which  disappoint  you,""  he  said.  ""Especially  from  players  of  that  calibre,  but  it's  a  tough  game  and  we've  been  around  a  long  time.""  Neville  admitted  that  he  had  not  enjoyed  the  match,  which  was  punctuated  by  fouls  and  the  sending  off  of  Mikael  Silvestre  for  head-butting  Freddie  Ljungberg  .  ""I  thought  it  was  a  horrible  game  in  the  first  half,  and  it  was  not  much  better  in  the  second,""  he  said.  ""There  is  no  way  that  should  have  happened  in  a  football  match.""  |||    After  the  match,  Keane  accused  Vieira  of  starting  the  row.  ""Patrick  Vieira  is  6ft  4in  and  having  a  go  at  Gary  Neville.  So  I  said,  'have  a  go  at  me',""  he  said.

Manchester  United  manager  Sir  Alex  Ferguson  added:  ""Vieira  was  well  wound  up  for  it.  ""I've  heard  different  stories.  Patrick  Vieira  has  apparently  threatened  some  of  our  players  and  things  like  that."""

This  will  boost  the  annual  production  capacity  of  the  company  -  India's  second-largest  car  manufacturer  -  to  400,000  units.  Hyundai  expects  its  sales  in  India  to  grow  16%  to  250,000  in  2005.  By  2010,  it  expects  to  nearly  double  sales  to  400,000  cars.

Demand  in  India  has  been  driven  by  the  poor  state  of  public  transport  and  the  very  low  level  of  car  ownership,  analysts  said.  Figures  show  that  currently  only  eight  people  per  thousand  are  car  owners.  ""We  desperately  need  to  expand  our  production  in  order  to  meet  growing  demand  in  the  Indian  auto  market,  which  is  growing  over  12  percent  every  year,  and  to  top  our  competitors,""  chairman  Chung  Mong-koo  said  in  the  statement.

In  return  for  the  funding,  Turkey  would  be  expected  to  keep  inflation  under  control  and  introduce  market  reforms.  Turkey's  economy  has  steadily  recovered  from  a  severe  crisis  in  2001.  |||    Economic  growth  has  average  6-7%  in  the  past  three  years,  ahead  of  IMF  forecasts,  while  inflation  fell  below  10%  this  year  for  the  first  time  in  30  years.  However,  Turkey  has  a  huge  debt  burden  -  already  owing  $23bn  to  the  IMF  -  while  its  current  account  deficit  has  swelled  to  $10.7bn  this  year.  |||    The  Turkish  economics  minister,  Ali  Babacan,  said  the  two  sides  had  reached  general  agreement  on  a  new  three  year  funding  program.  Rodrigo  de  Rato,  the  IMF's  managing  director,  said  the  loan  agreement  would  help  to  improve  Turkish  economic  prospects  by  cutting  its  debt  and  stimulating  growth.  ""I  believe  the  new  programme,  if  implemented  successfully,  will  help  Turkey  create  the  conditions  for  sustained  growth  and  employment  creation,  reduce  inflation  toward  European  level  and  enhance  the  economy's  resilience,""  he  said.  The  agreement  must  still  be  ratified  by  IMF  directors  at  a  meeting  expected  to  take  place  next  month.  |||    The  agreement  would  also  enable  Turkey  to  defer  payments  on  previous  loans  worth  $3.7m  until  2006.  |||    As  part  of  the  draft  agreement,  Turkey  has  signed  a  ""letter  of  intent""  stating  its  determination  to  push  through  far-reaching  reforms  to  its  tax  and  benefits  system  and  its  banking  sector.  Such  reforms  are  considered  vital  for  Turkey  if  it  is  to  fulfil  its  ambition  of  joining  the  European  Union.  The  EU  will  decide  on  17  December  whether  to  begin  entry  talks  with  Turkey.  The  US,  the  largest  of  the  IMF's  184  members,  is  a  strong  supporter  of  continued  financial  support  for  Turkey."

Tautou  will  play  Hanks'  code-cracking  partner,  according  to  various  newspapers.  She  is  currently  starring  in  A  Very  Long  Engagement,  directed  by  Jean-Pierre  Jeunet.  Jeunet  was  also  responsible  for  directing  Tautou  in  Amelie  in  2001,  which  launched  the  actress  into  the  mainstream.  |||    She  also  starred  as  the  lead  role  in  critically-acclaimed  film  Dirty  Pretty  Things  in  2002.  Oscar-winning  director  Ron  Howard  chose  Tautou  for  the  part,  preferring  a  French  actress  to  a  big  name  Hollywood  star.  UK  actress  Kate  Beckinsale  had  been  widely  tipped  as  a  possibility  for  the  role  alongside  Vanessa  Paradis  and  Juliette  Binoche.  The  thriller  upon  which  the  movie  is  based  has  sold  more  than  17  million  copies  and  is  centred  on  a  global  conspiracy  surrounding  the  Holy  Grail  mythology.  The  Louvre  Museum,  scene  of  the  gruesome  murder  at  the  beginning  of  the  novel,  recently  gave  permission  for  filming  to  take  place  there,  showbusiness  newspaper  Variety  reported.  The  $100m  movie  will  be  produced  by  Columbia/Sony  Pictures  and  is  due  for  release  on  May  19,  2006  in  the  United  States  and  France."

The  Inter-American  Development  Bank  (IADB)  said  regional  exports  reached  $445.1bn  (£227bn;331bn  euros)  in  2004.  Doubts  about  the  strength  of  the  US  recovery  and  overheating  of  the  Chinese  economy  do  however  pose  risks  for  2005.  Both  organisations  also  warned  that  high  oil  prices  raise  the  risk  of  either  inflation  or  recession.  |||    Nevertheless,  the  Economic  Commission  for  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean  (ECLAC)  still  forecasts  growth  of  4%  for  2005.  Strong  recovery  in  some  countries,  such  as  Venezuela  and  Uruguay,  boosted  the  overall  performance  of  the  region.  ECLAC  also  said  that  the  six  largest  Latin  American  economies  (Argentina,  Brazil,  Chile,  Colombia,  Mexico  and  Venezuela)  grew  by  more  than  3%  for  only  the  second  time  in  20  years.  Chinese  and  US  economic  strength  helped  boost  exports,  as  did  strong  demand  for  agricultural  and  mining  products.  In  fact,  Latin  American  exports  to  China  grew  34%,  to  $14bn.  Higher  oil  prices  also  helped  boost  exports,  as  Mexico  and  Venezuela  are  important  oil  exporters.  Regional  blocs  as  well  as  free  trade  agreements  with  the  US  contributed  to  the  region's  strong  performance,  the  IADB  said."

""We  want  to  ensure  that  independent  repertoire  is  as  successful  in  the  download  world  as  it  is  in  the  physical  world,""  said  BPI  chief  Peter  Jamieson.  Downloaded  singles  have  now  overtaken  physical  singles  in  the  UK.  Mr  Jamieson  said  his  organisation  was  lobbying  music  service  providers,  which  include  iTunes  and  Napster,  to  urge  them  to  promote  independent  releases.  Download  sales  are  due  to  be  incorporated  into  the  UK  singles  chart  later  this  year.  ""With  downloads  shortly  to  be  eligible  for  the  singles  chart,  this  is  a  key  commercial  issue  on  which  the  BPI  committed  to  assisting  its  members,""  added  Mr  Jamieson.  As  part  of  the  campaign  the  BPI  is  running  a  series  of  seminars  entitled  Getting  Your  Music  Online,  focusing  on  how  independent  labels  can  embrace  digital  music.  The  US  has  already  begun  incorporating  download  sales  in  the  Billboard's  Hot  100  chart."

Internationally  recognized  regulation  is  now  a  key  part  of  China's  plans  for  developing  its  economy,  analysts  said.  Beijing  also  has  been  threatened  with  sanctions  if  it  fails  to  clamp  down.  |||    Chinese  firms  copy  products  ranging  from  computer  software  and  spark  plugs  to  baby  milk  and  compact  discs.  Despite  the  fact  that  product  piracy  is  a  major  problem,  foreign  companies  have  only  occasionally  won  cases  and  the  compensation  awarded  has  usually  been  small.  Still,  recent  rulings  and  announcements  will  have  boosted  optimism  that  attitudes  are  changing.  Earlier  this  week  China  said  that  in  future  it  will  punish  violators  of  intellectual  property  rights  with  up  to  seven  years  in  jail.  And  on  Tuesday,  Paws  Incorporated  -  the  owner  of  the  rights  to  Garfield  the  cat  -  won  a  court  battle  against  a  publishing  house  that  violated  its  copyright.  Other  firms  that  have  taken  legal  action  in  China,  with  varying  degrees  of  success,  include  Yamaha,  General  Motors  and  Toyota.  |||    The  problem  of  piracy  is  not  limited  to  China,  however,  and  the  potential  for  profit  is  huge.  The  European  Union  estimates  that  the  global  trade  in  pirated  wares  is  worth  more  than  200bn  euros  a  year  (£140bn;  $258bn),  or  about  5%  of  total  world  trade.  And  it  is  growing.  Between  1998  and  2002,  the  number  of  counterfeit  or  pirated  goods  intercepted  at  the  EU's  external  borders  increased  by  more  than  800%,  it  said.  Last  month  the  EU  said  it  will  start  monitoring  China,  Ukraine  and  Russia  to  ensure  they  are  going  after  pirated  goods.  Other  countries  on  the  EU's  hit  list  include  Thailand,  Brazil,  South  Korea  and  Indonesia.  Any  countries  that  are  not  making  enough  of  an  effort  could  be  dragged  to  the  World  Trade  Organisation  (WTO),  a  step  that  could  trigger  economic  sanctions,  the  EU  warned."

The  pair  have  been  together  for  more  than  two  years.  ""No  wedding  plans  have  been  set  yet,""  said  Aguilera's  agent  Meghan  Prophet.  Aguilera  burst  onto  the  pop  scene  in  1999,  winning  a  best  new  artist  Grammy  in  2000.  Her  hits  include  What  a  Girl  Wants,  Dirrty  and  Beautiful.  Bratman  presented  his  fiancee  with  a  diamond  ring  designed  by  jeweller  Stephen  Webster  on  Friday,  said  Ms  Prophet.  New  York-born  Aguilera  reached  number  one  in  the  UK  with  her  debut  hit  Genie  in  a  Bottle  in  October  1999.  Her  early  success  was  cemented  by  two  further  Grammys  in  subsequent  years.  In  2002,  Aguilera  won  best  pop  collaboration  for  the  hit  track  Lady  Marmalade  with  Lil'  Kim,  Maya  and  Pink,  and  last  year  she  picked  up  the  award  for  best  female  pop  vocal  performance  for  Beautiful.  Her  most  recent  single,  Car  Wash,  featuring  Missy  Elliott,  reached  number  four  in  the  UK  charts  last  November." 

1	"No  jail  for  singer  Courtney  Love  |||    Singer  Courtney  Love  has  been  spared  jail  for  assault  and  drug  offences,  but  must  serve  three  years  probation.  |||    She  had  back-to-back  court  appearances  in  two  separate  cases  in  Los  Angeles,  first  pleading  no  contest  to  attacking  a  woman  with  a  whisky  bottle.  In  the  second,  Ms  Love,  40,  pleaded  guilty  to  possessing  a  forged  prescription  and  painkiller  oxycodone.  She  must  also  do  100  hours  community  service,  have  drug  treatment,  attend  Narcotics  Anonymous  and  pay  a  fine.  The  ex-Hole  singer's  lawyer  Howard  Weitzman  said  Ms  Love  had  ""turned  her  life  around""  and  she  was  ""clean  and  sober"".  |||    The  assault  charge  stemmed  from  April  2004,  when  Ms  Love  found  musician  Kristin  King  in  her  boyfriend's  home.  Ms  King  said  the  singer  ""threw  the  bottle  at  the  left  side  of  my  face""  in  an  ""angry,  vicious  and  erratic""  attack.  Ms  Love  was  originally  charged  with  the  more  serious  offence  of  assault  with  a  deadly  weapon,  but  that  was  reduced  to  assault.  Judge  Rand  Rubin  said  she  must:  |||    -  Spend  three  years  on  probation      -  Have  one  year's  anger  management  counselling      -  Have  one  year's  drug  rehabilitation      -  Do  100  hours  community  service      -  Pay  $1,000  (£535)  fine      -  Have  random  drug  tests      -  Go  to  three  Narcotics  Anonymous  meetings  per  week  |||    In  the  drugs  case,  she  was  sentenced  to  18  months  probation,  to  run  concurrently  with  the  probation  for  the  assault.  That  offence  stemmed  from  October  2003,  when  she  suffered  an  overdose  after  breaking  a  window  at  her  boyfriend's  home.  In  a  separate  case  relating  to  the  same  incident,  Ms  Love  was  sentenced  to  18  months  in  drug  rehabilitation  for  being  under  the  influence  of  cocaine  and  opiates.  In  another  case  last  October,  she  pleaded  guilty  to  disorderly  conduct  for  hitting  a  man  on  the  head  with  a  microphone  stand  at  a  New  York  City  nightclub.  Last  month  her  lawyers  said  she  had  won  back  custody  of  Frances  Bean,  her  12-year-old  daughter  with  former  Nirvana  frontman  Kurt  Cobain.  The  girl  was  removed  from  her  care  following  her  double  arrest  in  October  2003.  Cobain  committed  suicide  in  1994." 

2	"Howard  rebuts  asylum  criticisms  |||    Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  has  gone  on  the  offensive  in  response  to  people  questioning  how  a  son  of  immigrants  can  propose  asylum  quotas.  |||    Mr  Howard,  whose  parents  fled  the  Nazi  threat  to  come  to  the  UK,  says  the  claim  would  mean  no-one  from  an  immigrant  family  could  become  premier.  His  comments  come  in  a  BBC  documentary  called  'No  More  Mr  Nasty'.  TV  presenter  Anne  Robinson  said  as  home  secretary  he  gave  the  impression  he  would  ""like  to  kick  your  cat"".  Ms  Robinson,  a  friend  of  the  Tory  leader,  also  revealed  that  as  a  Cambridge  student  Mr  Howard  was  ""much  loved  by  women  and  he  was  a  courteous  and  kind  and  rather  dashing  lover""  -  although  she  denied  having  personal  experience.  ""I  wasn't  at  Cambridge  -  and  it's  not  personal  experience  -  but  I  know  people  who  were.""  |||    Documentary  maker  Michael  Cockerell  was  given  behind-the-scenes  access  to  Mr  Howard  for  his  film  portrait.  The  Tory  leader  was  asked  about  to  respond  to  people  who  said  that  if  there  had  there  been  a  quota  on  immigration  and  asylum  in  the  1930s,  his  parents  might  not  have  been  allowed  into  the  country.  |||    He  replies:  ""What  is  the  inference  of  that?  ""That  if  you  reach  the  view  that  you  need  to  control  immigration  in  the  interests  of  the  country  you're  not  allowed  to  put  a  view  forward  if  you  happen  to  be  descended  from  immigrants?  ""That  seems  to  me  an  absolutely  extraordinary  proposition?  It  would  certainly  mean  no  one  from  immigrant  parents  could  be  prime  minister.""  |||    Ms  Robinson,  who  presents  The  Weakest  Link  tells  Cockerell  that  she  despaired  at  his  hardline  image  when  he  was  home  secretary  in  John  Major's  government.  ""I  used  to  have  to  sit  on  my  hands  because  he'd  get  on  television  and  give  a  passable  impression  of  someone  who'd  like  to  kick  your  cat  or  would  put  your  baby  in  prison  if  he  cried.  I  mean  it  was  very,  very  Draconian.""  The  film  shows  Mr  Howard  laughing  at  Rory  Bremner's  impression  of  him  as  Dracula,  which  he  calls  ""good  fun"",  apart  from  the  serious  falsehood  of  a  comment  suggesting  he  wants  fewer  black  people  in  the  UK.  The  film  shows  the  private  side  of  the  Tory  leader  watching  television  at  home  or  playing  table  tennis  with  his  wife,  ex-model  Sandra.  Asked  if  she  enjoys  a  game  of  ping  pong  she  confesses:  ""Yeah,  it  would  be  more  enjoyable  if  I  could  win  occasionally  too,  but  otherwise  it's  quite  fun.""  |||    Former  Downing  Street  communications  chief  Alastair  Campbell,  now  working  on  Labour's  election  campaign,  says  a  ""touchy-feely""  image  does  not  fit  Mr  Howard.  He  says  Tony  Blair  was  not  worried  by  his  opponents'  early  performance  in  their  Commons  clashes  because  Mr  Howard  lacked  a  ""big  strategy"",  including  on  issues  like  Iraq.  The  Tory  leader  brands  such  criticisms  as  ""absolutely  rubbish"",  arguing  that  he  has  been  consistent  on  his  support  for  the  war  but  critical  of  Mr  Blair's  failure  to  tell  the  truth  on  intelligence.  Former  Tory  chancellor  Ken  Clarke  says  Mr  Howard  has  a  bigger  problem  changing  perceptions  of  the  Tory  party  than  his  personal  image.  Mr  Clarke  says  the  party  is  improving  and  it  is  ""conceivable""  it  could  win  the  next  election.  But  he  adds:  ""It  has  got  to  change  itself  a  bit  and  broaden  its  appeal.""  |||    -  Michael  Howard:  No  More  Mr  Nasty  is  being  shown  on  BBC2  on  Saturday  12  February  at  2005  GMT."

Victory  would  have  given  Spain  the  title  but  they  were  outclassed.  In  Sunday's  reverse  singles,  Carlos  Moya  takes  on  Andy  Roddick  before  Rafael  Nadal  faces  Mardy  Fish.  ""It  feels  good,  but  it's  not  going  to  be  as  good  if  we  don't  win  two  tomorrow,""  said  Mike  Bryan.  ""It  feels  good  to  give  those  guys  another  shot,  and  Spain  has  to  go  to  sleep  on  that.""  Bob  Bryan  added:  ""I'm  really  confident  in  Andy  winning  that  first  match,  and  then  anything  can  happen.""  Spain  coach  Jordi  Arrese  chose  to  rest  18-year-old  Nadal  in  the  doubles  after  his  epic  singles  win  over  Roddick  on  Friday.  He  was  replaced  by  former  world  number  one  Ferrero,  but  the  Spanish  pair  were  out  of  their  depth  against  one  of  the  world's  best  doubles  teams.  |||    The  26-year-old  Bryan  twins  have  won  all  four  of  their  Davis  Cup  matches  this  year.  And  they  quickly  silenced  the  huge  crowd  at  the  Olympic  Stadium,  racing  through  the  opening  set  to  love.  The  Spaniards  then  twice  surrendered  breaks  of  serve  at  the  start  of  the  second  before  the  Bryans  broke  to  go  5-3  ahead  and  served  out.  When  Robredo  dropped  serve  in  the  opening  game  of  the  third  set  the  match  was  all  but  over,  and  the  unflappable  Bryan  brothers  powered  on  to  an  impressive  win.  Ferrero,  who  was  upset  to  be  dropped  for  Friday's  singles,  hinted  at  further  dissatisfaction  after  the  defeat.  ""It  was  a  difficult  game  against  the  best  doubles  players,""  he  said.  ""They  have  everything  calculated  and  we  had  very  little  to  do.  ""I  was  a  bit  surprised  that  I  was  named  to  play  the  doubles  match  because  I  hardly  play  doubles.""  Arrese  said:  ""Juan  Carlos  hasn't  played  at  all  badly.  He  played  the  right  way  but  the  Bryans  are  great  doubles  players.""" 

0	"US  to  probe  airline  travel  chaos  |||    The  US  government  is  to  investigate  two  airlines-  US  Airways  and  Delta  Air  Lines'  Comair  subsidiary  -  after  travel  chaos  over  the  Christmas  weekend.  |||    Staff  calling  in  sick  at  US  Airways  and  computer  failures  at  Comair  left  30,000  passengers  stranded  and  10,000  pieces  of  baggage  undelivered.  US  Airways  is  in  Chapter  11  bankruptcy  protection  for  the  second  time  in  two  years,  and  battling  to  cut  costs.  It  is  currently  trying  to  negotiate  pay  cuts  with  flight  and  baggage  staff.  |||    Transportation  Secretary  Norman  Mineta  said  he  was  ""deeply  concerned""  at  the  disruption  to  passengers,  and  ordered  a  thorough  investigation.  Comair's  computer  breakdown  plunged  its  flight-crew  scheduling  system  into  disarray.  Altogether,  some  1,100  flights  were  cancelled  over  the  holiday  long  weekend.  Mr  Mineta  said  it  was  important  to  understand  ""what  happened,  why  it  happened  and  whether  the  carriers  properly  planned  for  the  holiday  travel  period  and  responded  appropriately  to  consumer  needs  in  the  aftermath"".  |||    Adding  to  the  atmosphere  of  chaos  were  mountains  of  luggage  left  to  pile  up  when  a  third  of  US  Airways'  baggage  handling  staff  called  in  sick.  There  was  also  a  shortage  of  US  Airways  flight  attendants,  with  nearly  a  fifth  saying  they  were  too  sick  to  work,  leading  to  many  flight  cancellations.  However,  union  officials  denied  there  had  been  a  deliberate  ""sickout"".  They  said  that  many  people  have  flu  at  this  time  of  year  and  that  the  airline  is  chronically  understaffed.  |||    US  Airways  ended  up  cancelling  over  100  flights  on  Christmas  Day,  stranding  passengers  in  as  many  as  119  airports.  Ground  crews  at  US  Airways,  the  seventh-largest  US  airline,  which  is  now  in  Chapter  11  bankruptcy  protection,  face  a  court-imposed  pay  cut  next  month.  The  airline  needs  to  negotiate  other  paycuts  if  it  is  to  find  a  route  out  of  bankruptcy.  It  is  looking  for  paycuts  totalling  $800m.  |||    ""US  Airways  has  a  full-scale  employee  mutiny  on  its  hands,""  commented  Michael  Boyd,  an  industry  consultant.  Disruptions  to  flight  schedules  could  discourage  customers  from  flying  with  US  Airways,  reducing  revenues.  US  Airways  had  to  cancel  approximately  65  flights  on  Thursday,  180  on  Friday,  140  on  Saturday,  43  on  Sunday  and  15  on  Monday,  said  industry  officials.  The  airline  said  it  was  ""embarrassed  by  the  situation""  and  ""deeply  regrets  any  inconvenience  caused  to  customers,""  The  probe  will  focus  on  the  industry's  compliance  with  a  1999  agreement  aimed  at  improving  the  quality  of  passenger  service  that  has  so  far  allowed  airlines  to  avoid  congressionally-mandated  standards.  Analysts  said  the  Christmas  chaos  cast  doubt  on  US  Airway's  ability  to  emerge  from  bankruptcy  -  and  was  likely  to  worsen  the  finances  of  troubled  Delta,  parent  of  Comair.  Comair  ""deeply  regrets  the  inconvenience  to  all  of  our  customers  caused  by  the  severe  winter  storm  in  the  Ohio  River  Valley  during  the  busy  holiday  season,  exacerbated  by  problems  with  the  airline's  crew  scheduling  system,  causing  additional  flight  delays  and  cancellations,""  the  Delta  subsidiary  said  in  a  statement."

Mr  Bush  indicated  there  would  be  ""strict  discipline""  on  non-defence  spending  in  the  budget.  The  vow  to  cut  the  deficit  had  been  one  of  his  re-election  declarations.  The  federal  budget  deficit  hit  a  record  $412bn  (£211.6bn)  in  the  12  months  to  30  September  and  $377bn  in  the  previous  year.  |||    ""We  will  submit  a  budget  that  fits  the  times,""  Mr  Bush  said.  ""It  will  provide  every  tool  and  resource  to  the  military,  will  protect  the  homeland,  and  meet  other  priorities  of  the  government.""  The  US  has  said  it  is  committed  to  a  strong  dollar.  But  the  dollar's  weakness  has  hit  European  and  Asian  exporters  and  lead  to  calls  for  US  intervention  to  boost  the  currency.  Mr  Bush,  however,  has  said  the  best  way  to  halt  the  dollar's  slide  is  to  deal  with  the  US  deficit.  ""It's  a  budget  that  I  think  will  send  the  right  signal  to  the  financial  markets  and  to  those  concerned  about  our  short-term  deficits,""  Mr  Bush  added.  ""As  well,  we've  got  to  deal  with  the  long-term  deficit  issues.""" 

1	"Berlin  cheers  for  anti-Nazi  film  |||    A  German  movie  about  an  anti-Nazi  resistance  heroine  has  drawn  loud  applause  at  Berlin  Film  Festival.  |||    Sophie  Scholl  -  The  Final  Days  portrays  the  final  days  of  the  member  of  the  White  Rose  movement.  Scholl,  21,  was  arrested  and  beheaded  with  her  brother,  Hans,  in  1943  for  distributing  leaflets  condemning  the  ""abhorrent  tyranny""  of  Adolf  Hitler.  Director  Marc  Rothemund  said:  ""I  have  a  feeling  of  responsibility  to  keep  the  legacy  of  the  Scholls  going.""  ""We  must  somehow  keep  their  ideas  alive,""  he  added.  |||    The  film  drew  on  transcripts  of  Gestapo  interrogations  and  Scholl's  trial  preserved  in  the  archive  of  communist  East  Germany's  secret  police.  Their  discovery  was  the  inspiration  behind  the  film  for  Rothemund,  who  worked  closely  with  surviving  relatives,  including  one  of  Scholl's  sisters,  to  ensure  historical  accuracy  on  the  film.  Scholl  and  other  members  of  the  White  Rose  resistance  group  first  started  distributing  anti-Nazi  leaflets  in  the  summer  of  1942.  They  were  arrested  as  they  dropped  leaflets  at  Munich  University  calling  for  a  ""day  of  reckoning""  with  Adolf  Hitler's  regime.  The  film  focuses  on  the  six  days  from  Scholl's  arrest  to  the  intense  trial  which  saw  Scholl  initially  deny  the  charges  and  ended  with  a  defiant  appearance.  It  is  one  of  three  German  films  vying  for  a  top  prize  at  the  Festival.  |||    A  South  African  film  version  of  Bizet's  tragic  opera  Carmen  shot  in  Cape  Town  in  the  Xhosa  language  has  also  premiered  at  the  Berlin  Festival.  The  film  is  entitled  U-Carmen  eKhayelitsha  or  Carmen  in  Khayelitsha  after  the  township  in  which  the  story  is  set.  It  is  performed  by  a  40-strong  music  and  theatre  troupe  in  their  debut  film  performance.  The  film  is  the  first  South  African  feature  in  25  years  and  only  the  second  to  be  nominated  for  a  Golden  Bear  Award." 

2	"Ban  on  hunting  comes  into  force  |||    Fox  hunting  with  dogs  is  now  illegal  in  England  and  Wales  after  a  ban  on  the  activity  came  into  force  overnight.  |||    The  law  faces  a  stiff  test  this  weekend,  with  the  Countryside  Alliance  saying  many  hunts  will  be  out  in  force.  Chief  police  officers  spokesman  Nigel  Yeo  said  he  expected  most  people  would  obey  the  law  -  by  drag  hunting  or  chasing  foxes  then  shooting  them.  He  said  police  would  challenge  the  ""one  of  two  isolated  hunts""  which  are  threatening  to  break  the  law.  |||    But  Simon  Hart  of  the  Countryside  Alliance  has  questioned  how  police  will  ensure  there  are  no  violations.  ""The  definitions  of  legal  and  illegal  hunting  are  so  blurred  that  the  police  are  being  asked  to  make  impossible  judgements.  ""You  can  hunt  a  rat,  but  not  a  mouse,  a  rabbit  but  not  a  hare,  an  artificial  scent,  but  not  a  real  one,""  he  said.  |||    The  Attorney  General,  Lord  Goldsmith,  has  so  far  issued  no  instructions  to  police  on  how  they  should  deal  with  hunters  who  violate  the  law.  He  said  he  will  consult  the  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions  and  the  police  ""in  the  near  future""  to  decide  what  measures  to  take  with  regards  to  hunting  prosecutions.  He  has  rejected  a  ""blanket  policy""  of  not  enforcing  the  ban  until  the  House  of  Lords  has  considered  its  legality.  John  Cooper,  a  barrister  and  chairman  of  the  League  Against  Cruel  Sports,  said  the  anti-hunting  lobby  expects  the  authorities  to  prosecute  wherever  there  is  clear  evidence  of  illegal  hunting  practices.  He  said  police  had  ""acknowledged  their  duty  to  investigate  allegations  of  hunting  offences"".  |||    The  Beaufort  Hunt  had  one  pack  out  on  Thursday  and  has  promised  a  hunt  this  weekend.  Under  the  new  law  hunters  have  a  number  of  legal  options  available  to  them.  |||    As  well  as  being  able  to  mount  a  hunt  for  an  artificial  scent,  it  will  still  be  legal  for  the  hunts  to  ""flush  out""  foxes,  as  long  as  they  shoot  their  quarry  rather  than  set  the  hounds  on  them.  ""We  are  not  going  away.  We  will  keep  these  hounds  going,  we  will  keep  this  community  going  and  in  the  end  we  will  come  back  and  hunt  when  hunting  is  legal  again,""  hunt  master,  Captain  Ian  Farquhar,  said.  But  Tony  Banks,  Labour  MP  for  West  Ham,  said  the  issue  would  soon  disappear,  and  that  ""people  in  a  few  years  time  will  be  wondering  what  it  was  all  about"".  He  said  had  the  government  not  prevaricated  since  1997  in  introducing  the  ban,  hunting  with  dogs  would  have  passed  into  history  like  other  former  country  pursuits  such  as  otter  hunting  and  badger  baiting.  ""Let  the  election  decide  this  because  the  Conservatives  have  made  clear  that  if  they  get  elected  into  government  they  will  restore  hunting,""  he  said."

Jet  Airways  and  Air  Sahara  are  the  two  companies  that  will  benefit  initially.  India  is  looking  to  develop  its  airline  industry  as  booming  economic  growth  drives  demand  for  travel.  |||    Monica  Chadha,  BBC  Delhi  reporter,  said  air  travel  in  India  had  increased  by  almost  20%  from  the  previous  year  and  was  expected  to  rise  even  further.  Infrastructure  development  is  lagging  demand,  however,  and  will  have  to  improve.  ""Most  international  airports  in  the  country  are  shabby  and  ill-equipped  to  handle  heavy  air  traffic,""  Ms  Chada  said,  adding  that  while  the  Civil  Aviation  minister  has  promised  to  modernise  and  privatise  airports  little  progress  has  been  made.  Steps  have  been  take  to  move  things  forward  and  the  government  recently  changed  legislation  that  limited  foreign  investment  in  domestic  airlines.  It  raised  the  maximum  stake  holding  allowed  to  49%  from  40%.  Local  press,  meanwhile,  have  reported  that  the  US  and  India  will  start  negotiations  about  adding  more  routes  in  January.  Jet  Airways  is  India's  premier  private  domestic  carrier;  Air  Sahara  is  ranked  third  in  the  category."

For  five  days,  they  will  discuss  issues  ranging  from  China's  economic  power  to  Iraq's  future  after  this  Sunday's  elections.  UK  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  and  South  African  President  Thabo  Mbeki  are  among  the  more  than  20  government  leaders  and  heads  of  state  leaders  attending  the  meeting.  Unlike  previous  years,  protests  against  the  WEF  are  expected  to  be  muted.  Anti-globalisation  campaigners  have  called  off  a  demonstration  planned  for  the  weekend.  |||    The  Brazilian  city  of  Porto  Alegre  will  host  the  rival  World  Social  Forum,  timed  to  run  in  parallel  with  the  WEF's  ritzier  event  in  Davos.  |||    The  organisers  of  the  Brazilian  gathering,  which  brings  together  thousands  of  campaigners  against  globalisation,  for  fair  trade,  and  many  other  causes,  have  promised  to  set  an  alternative  agenda  to  that  of  the  Swiss  summit.  However,  many  of  the  issues  discussed  in  Porto  Alegre  are  Davos  talking  points  as  well.  ""Global  warming""  features  particularly  high.  WEF  participants  are  being  asked  to  offset  the  carbon  emissions  they  cause  by  travelling  to  the  event.  Davos  itself  is  in  deep  frost.  The  snow  is  piled  high  across  the  mountain  village,  and  at  night  the  wind  chill  takes  temperatures  down  to  minus  20C  and  less.  |||    Ultimately,  the  forum  will  be  dominated  by  business  issues  -  from  outsourcing  to  corporate  leadership  -  with  bosses  of  more  than  a  fifth  of  the  world's  500  largest  companies  scheduled  to  attend.  |||    But  much  of  the  media  focus  will  be  on  the  political  leaders  coming  to  Davos,  not  least  because  the  agenda  of  this  year's  forum  seems  to  lack  an  overarching  theme.  ""Taking  responsibility  for  tough  choices""  is  this  year's  official  talking  point,  hinting  at  a  welter  of  knotty  problems.  One  thing  seems  sure,  though:  transatlantic  disagreements  over  how  to  deal  with  Iran,  Iraq  and  China  are  set  to  dominate  discussions.  Pointedly,  only  one  senior  official  from  President  Bush's  new  administration  is  scheduled  to  attend.  The  US  government  may  still  make  a  conciliatory  gesture,  just  as  happened  a  year  ago  when  Vice  President  Dick  Cheney  made  a  surprise  appearance  in  Davos.  |||    Ukraine's  new  president,  Viktor  Yushchenko,  is  to  speak,  just  days  after  his  inauguration,  an  event  that  crowned  the  civil  protests  against  the  rigged  first  election  that  had  tried  to  keep  him  from  power.  |||    The  European  Union's  top  leaders,  among  them  German  Chancellor  Gerhard  Schroeder  and  European  Commission  President  Manuel  Barosso,  will  be  here  too.  Mr  Blair  will  formally  open  the  proceedings,  although  his  speech  will  be  pre-empted  by  French  President  Jacques  Chirac,  who  announced  his  attendance  at  the  last  minute  and  secured  a  slot  for  a  ""special  message""  two  hours  before  Mr  Blair  speaks.  The  organisers  also  hope  that  the  new  Palestinian  leader,  Mahmoud  Abbas,  will  use  the  opportunity  for  talks  with  at  least  one  of  the  three  Israeli  deputy  prime  ministers  coming  to  the  event,  a  list  that  includes  Shimon  Peres.  Davos  fans  still  hark  back  to  1994,  when  talks  between  Yassir  Arafat  and  Mr  Peres  came  close  to  a  peace  deal.  Mr  Blair's  appearance  will  be  keenly  watched  too,  as  political  observers  in  the  UK  claim  it  is  a  calculated  snub  against  political  rival  Chancellor  Gordon  Brown,  who  was  supposed  to  lead  the  UK  government  delegation.  |||    Microsoft  founder  Bill  Gates,  the  world's  richest  man  and  a  regular  at  Davos,  will  focus  on  campaigning  for  good  causes,  though  business  interests  will  not  be  wholly  absent  either.  Having  already  donated  billions  of  dollars  to  the  fight  against  Aids  and  Malaria,  Mr  Gates  will  call  on  world  leaders  to  support  a  global  vaccination  campaign  to  protect  children  in  developing  countries  from  easily  preventable  diseases.  On  Tuesday,  Mr  Gates  pledged  $750m  (£400m)  of  his  own  money  to  support  the  cause.  Mr  Gates'  company,  software  giant  Microsoft,  also  hopes  to  use  Davos  to  shore  up  its  defences  against  open  source  software  like  Linux,  which  threaten  Microsoft's  near  monopoly  on  computer  desktops.  Mr  Gates  is  said  to  be  trying  to  arrange  a  meeting  with  Brazil's  President  Lula  da  Silva.  The  Brazilian  government  has  plans  to  switch  all  government  computers  from  Microsoft  to  Linux.  At  Davos,  global  problem  solving  and  networking  are  never  far  apart." 

2	"Kennedy  predicts  bigger  turnout  |||    Voters'  ""pent  up  passion""  could  confound  predictions  of  a  low  turnout  in  the  coming  general  election,  Charles  Kennedy  has  said.  |||    The  Liberal  Democrat  leader  predicted  concerns  over  Iraq  and  other  international  and  domestic  issue  would  express  themselves  during  the  campaign.  His  comments  come  as  an  inquiry  looks  at  how  best  to  boost  voter  turnouts.  Ex-foreign  secretary  Robin  Cook  said  people  were  not  apathetic  but  fed  up  of  ""pager  politics""  and  not  being  heard.  He,  like  Mr  Kennedy,  pointed  to  the  hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  who  demonstrated  against  plans  for  the  Iraq  war.  |||    Mr  Cook,  who  is  giving  evidence  to  the  Power  inquiry  into  voter  turnout  rates,  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  Programme  it  was  not  fair  to  blame  the  public  who  were  ""more  interested  in  politics  than  ever  before"".  ""They  are  turned  off  by  the  way  we  do  politics  in  Britain.  There's  a  message  there  for  politicians.""  He  urged  politicians  to  avoid  negative  campaigning  and  to  ""speak  more  from  the  heart"".  ""We  should  be  not  so  afraid  to  say  what  we  stand  for.""  He  also  criticised  the  cult  of  personality  politics:  ""There's  far  too  much  interest  in  celebrities.  ""Politics  are  in  danger  of  becoming  another  branch  of  the  celebrity  industry.""  The  government  has  tried  a  number  of  things  in  an  attempt  to  boost  voter  turnout,  which  fell  to  59%  in  the  last  general  election  in  2001.  This  has  included  bringing  in  directly  elected  mayors  to  head  local  authorities  and  trialling  postal  voting."

Scotland  Yard  said  the  policing  operation  had  been  reviewed.  A  spokesman  said  President  Musharraf's  safety  had  not  been  compromised,  as  the  papers  had  been  handed  in  promptly.  ""We  cannot  discuss  who  was  responsible  for  the  documents,  only  that  they  contained  the  policing  arrangements  for  the  official  visit,""  said  the  spokesman.  |||    The  papers  are  believed  to  have  been  found  by  a  member  of  the  public  in  a  street  in  Mayfair  and  given  to  the  Mirror  newspaper.  The  police  spokesman  said  the  newspaper  handed  the  report  over  on  Monday.  The  force's  Directorate  of  Professional  Standards  is  investigating  the  circumstances  surrounding  the  loss  of  the  documents,  he  said.  Gen  Musharraf  held  talks  with  Tony  Blair  on  Monday.  He  arrived  in  Britain  on  Sunday  night  after  flying  from  the  United  States,  where  he  met  President  George  W  Bush.  He  is  due  to  visit  the  Pakistani  community  in  Manchester  on  Tuesday  afternoon."

The  album  follows  single  Black  and  White  Town,  which  reached  number  six.  R&B  star  Nelly  has  the  new  number  one  single  with  Over  and  Over,  which  sees  him  team  up  with  Tim  McGraw.

The  messages  will  be  ""unwrapped""  by  sculptor  Richard  Wentworth,  who  is  responsible  for  decorating  the  tree  with  broken  plates  and  light  bulbs.  It  is  the  17th  year  that  the  gallery  has  invited  an  artist  to  dress  their  Christmas  tree.  Artists  who  have  decorated  the  Tate  tree  in  previous  years  include  Tracey  Emin  in  2002.  |||    The  plain  green  Norway  spruce  is  displayed  in  the  gallery's  foyer.

0	"Yukos  owner  sues  Russia  for  $28bn  |||    The  majority  owner  of  embattled  Russian  oil  firm  Yukos  has  sued  the  Russian  government  for  $28.3bn  (£15.2bn).  |||    The  Kremlin  last  year  seized  and  sold  Yukos'  main  production  arm,  Yugansk,  to  state-run  oil  group  Rosneft  for  $9.3bn  to  offset  a  massive  back  tax  bill.  Group  Menatep,  the  Gibraltar-based  holding  company  which  controls  51%  of  Yukos,  says  this  was  illegal.  Menatep  has  already  asked  Rosneft  to  repay  a  $900m  loan  that  Yugansk  had  secured  on  its  assets.  |||    The  Russian  government's  argument  for  selling  Yuganskneftegaz  -  the  unit's  full  name  -  was  that  Yukos  owed  more  than  $27bn  in  back  taxes  for  the  years  from  2000  onwards.  It  accused  the  firm  of  using  a  web  of  offshore  firms  to  avoid  its  tax  liabilities,  and  the  courts  sent  in  bailiffs  to  freeze  Yukos  accounts  and  seize  Yugansk.  |||    But  critics  say  the  sell-off,  and  the  assault  on  Yukos'  finances,  are  part  of  an  attempt  to  bring  the  energy  industry  back  under  state  control.  According  to  Menatep,  the  government's  actions  were  contrary  to  the  1994  Energy  Charter  Treaty,  which  was  designed  to  regulate  disagreements  over  energy  investments.  ""We  have  warned  the  Russian  government  about  their  continuing  attacks  against  Yukos,  its  personnel  and  its  shareholders  and  we  have  warned  any  buyer  of  Yuganskneftegaz  that  they  would  face  a  lifetime  of  litigation,""  said  Tim  Osborne,  a  director  of  Group  Menatep.  ""The  time  for  warning  is  over  and  actions  to  recover  the  value  of  our  losses  begin  in  earnest  today.""  |||    Menatep  said  the  value  of  its  Yukos  shareholding  had  gone  from  $17.8bn  to  ""virtually  nothing""  since  2003  as  a  result  of  the  Russian  government's  action,  as  its  shares  have  fallen  97%.  According  to  its  Paris  lawyer,  Emmanuel  Gaillard  of  Shearman  and  Sterling,  the  overall  claim  is  based  on  that  figure,  with  a  60%  addition  for  the  share  gains  that  could  have  accrued  since  then.  Arbitration  of  the  lawsuit  could  take  place  in  Stockholm  or  The  Hague,  Mr  Gaillard  said.  While  Russia  has  signed  the  Charter,  it  has  never  ratified  it  -  which  some  experts  say  could  make  it  difficult  for  Menatep  to  press  its  case.  But  Mr  Gaillard  told  BBC  News  that  the  Charter  came  into  effect  on  signature,  not  ratification.  ""Russia  has  said  in  the  past  that  it  is  bound  by  it,  so  as  to  attract  foreign  investors,""  he  said.  |||    Yukos  is  still  waiting  to  see  what  will  happen  to  its  filing  in  a  US  court  for  bankruptcy  protection.  It  took  the  action  to  try  to  prevent  the  forced  sale  of  Yugansk  -  first  to  a  little-known  shell  company,  which  in  turn  was  bought  by  Rosneft.  Yukos  claims  its  downfall  was  punishment  for  the  political  ambitions  of  its  founder  Mikhail  Khodorkovsky.  Mr  Khodorkovsky,  currently  facing  fraud  and  tax  evasion  charges  of  his  own,  was  one  of  the  founders  of  Menatep.  He  has  since  signed  over  his  shareholding  to  one  of  his  fellow  investors."

Mr  Ghosn  is  to  become  chairman  and  chief  executive  of  Renault,  which  owns  44%  of  the  Japanese  carmaker,  in  April.  Mr  Ghosn  transformed  Nissan  into  a  fast-growing  and  profitable  business.  |||    Mr  Shiga  will  nominally  serve  as  Mr  Ghosn's  deputy.  However,  he  will  be  Nissan's  most  senior  Japan-based  executive  and  will  be  in  charge  of  the  firm's  global  sales  and  marketing.  |||    He  is  currently  in  charge  of  Nissan's  operations  across  Asia  and  Australasia  and  is  credited  with  significantly  improving  its  sales  in  China.  He  will  inherit  a  strong  legacy  from  Mr  Ghosn,  who  has  overseen  a  dramatic  turnaround  in  Nissan's  fortunes  in  the  past  five  years.  Dubbed  'le  cost  killer'  for  pushing  through  huge  cost  cuts  in  previous  jobs,  Mr  Ghosn  reduced  Nissan's  overheads  by  20%  and  trimmed  its  workforce  by  about  200,000  after  taking  charge  in  1999.  These  actions  helped  Nissan  turn  a  684bn  yen  ($6.4bn)  loss  in  2000  into  a  331bn  yen  ($2.7bn)  profit  the  following  year.  During  his  tenure,  Nissan  has  increased  its  market  share  and  made  significant  strides  in  key  export  markets.  Nissan  aims  to  increase  vehicle  sales  to  more  than  four  million  by  2008,  launching  28  new  models  in  the  process.  |||    In  his  new  job  as  Renault  chief  executive,  Mr  Ghosn  will  devote  40%  of  his  time  to  Renault,  40%  to  Nissan  and  the  rest  to  the  group's  activities  in  North  America  and  other  key  markets.  |||    Mr  Ghosn  said  Mr  Shiga's  appointment  would  ensure  a  ""seamless""  transition  in  management.  ""I  need  a  leadership  team  capable  of  accelerating  the  performance  and  delivery  of  results  that  has  characterized  Nissan  over  the  past  six  years,""  Mr  Ghosn  said.  ""I  have  full  confidence  in  Toshiyuki  Shiga  and  the  new  leadership  team  to  help  me  implement  the  next  chapter  of  Nissan's  growth.""  Nissan  also  announced  a  number  of  other  management  appointments  with  promotions  for  several  younger  executives." 

2	"Tories  unveil  quango  blitz  plans  |||    Plans  to  abolish  162  quangos  have  been  unveiled  by  the  Conservatives  as  part  of  their  effort  to  show  how  government  red  tape  can  be  cut.  |||    Six  government  units  would  also  be  scrapped  under  proposals  which  the  Tories  say  would  save  more  than  £4.3bn.  Among  the  targets  are  strategic  health  authorities  and  the  new  fair  access  regulator  for  universities.  Tory  frontbencher  John  Redwood  said  Britain  needed  a  slimmer  government  and  lower  taxes  to  be  competitive.  |||    The  plans  would  abolish  regional  assemblies  and  other  regional  bodies,  such  as  boards  tackling  industrial  development  and  housing.  Their  powers  would  be  returned  to  elected  local  councils  or  national  government.  The  Tories  say  the  strategic  health  authorities  are  not  needed  as  it  is  better  that  local  people,  rather  than  officials,  run  hospitals  and  surgeries.  |||    Announcing  the  plans,  Mr  Redwood  said:  ""Mr  Blair  has  forgotten  the  interests  of  taxpayers,  and  has  broken  the  pledges  he  made.  ""Far  from  improving  public  services,  spending  taxpayers'  money  on  quangos  has  led  only  to  more  bureaucrats,  more  regulation  and  higher  taxes.""  His  party  leader,  Michael  Howard,  argued  a  change  in  direction  was  needed  to  get  a  grip  on  spending.  ""Labour  are  creating  Two  Britains:  the  Britain  of  the  forgotten  majority  and  bureaucratic  Britain,""  he  said.  ""In  the  real  world,  people  are  working  harder  just  to  stand  still.  They've  seen  their  pensions  knocked  for  six.  ""They're  being  squeezed  by  extra  taxes.  The  forgotten  majority  are  paying  the  price  of  bureaucratic  Britain.""  The  government  has  announced  plans  to  cut  100,000  civil  servants  as  part  of  its  efficiency  drive.  The  Liberal  Democrats  have  said  they  would  cut  the  number  of  Whitehall  departments  to  make  sure  money  reaches  frontline  services."

IBGE  also  said  that  average  monthly  salaries  grew  1.9%  in  December  2004  from  December  2003.  However,  average  monthly  wages  fell  1.8%  in  December  to  895.4  reais  ($332;  £179.3)  from  November.  Tuesday's  figures  represent  the  first  time  that  the  unemployment  rate  has  fallen  to  a  single  digit  since  new  measurement  rules  were  introduced  in  2001.  The  unemployment  rate  has  been  falling  gradually  since  April  2004  when  it  reached  a  peak  of  13.1%.  The  jobless  rate  average  for  the  whole  of  2004  was  11.5%,  down  from  12.3%  in  2003,  the  IBGE  said.  |||    This  improvement  can  be  attributed  to  the  country's  strong  economic  growth,  with  the  economy  registering  growth  of  5.2%  in  2004,  the  government  said.  The  economy  is  expected  to  grow  by  about  4%  this  year.  President  Luiz  Inacio  Lula  da  Silva  promised  to  reduce  unemployment  when  he  was  elected  two  years  ago.  Nevertheless,  some  analysts  say  that  unemployment  could  increase  in  the  next  months.  ""The  data  is  favourable,  but  a  lot  of  jobs  are  temporary  for  the  (Christmas)  holiday  season,  so  we  may  see  slightly  higher  joblessness  in  January  and  February,""  Julio  Hegedus,  chief  economist  with  Lopes  Filho  &  Associates  consultancy  in  Rio  de  Janeir,  told  Reuters  news  agency.  Despite  his  leftist  background,  President  Lula  has  pursued  a  surprisingly  conservative  economic  policy,  arguing  that  in  order  to  meet  its  social  promises,  the  government  needs  to  first  reach  a  sustained  economic  growth.  The  unemployment  rate  is  measured  in  the  six  main  metropolitan  areas  of  Brazil  (Sao  Paolo,  Rio  de  Janeiro,  Belo  Horizonte,  Recife,  Salvador  and  Porto  Alegre),  where  most  of  the  population  is  concentrated." 

0	"Winn-Dixie  files  for  bankruptcy  |||    US  supermarket  group  Winn-Dixie  has  filed  for  bankruptcy  protection  after  succumbing  to  stiff  competition  in  a  market  dominated  by  Wal-Mart.  |||    Winn-Dixie,  once  among  the  most  profitable  of  US  grocers,  said  Chapter  11  protection  would  enable  it  to  successfully  restructure.  It  said  its  920  stores  would  remain  open,  but  analysts  said  it  would  most  likely  off-load  a  number  of  sites.  The  Jacksonville,  Florida-based  firm  has  total  debts  of  $1.87bn  (£980m).  In  its  bankruptcy  petition  it  listed  its  biggest  creditor  as  US  foods  giant  Kraft  Foods,  which  it  owes  $15.1m.  |||    Analysts  say  Winn-Dixie  had  not  kept  up  with  consumers'  demands  and  had  also  been  burdened  by  a  number  of  stores  in  need  of  upgrading.  A  10-month  restructuring  plan  was  deemed  a  failure,  and  following  a  larger-than-expected  quarterly  loss  earlier  this  month,  Winn-Dixie's  slide  into  bankruptcy  was  widely  expected.  The  company's  new  chief  executive  Peter  Lynch  said  Winn-Dixie  would  use  the  Chapter  11  breathing  space  to  take  the  necessary  action  to  turn  itself  around.  ""This  includes  achieving  significant  cost  reductions,  improving  the  merchandising  and  customer  service  in  all  locations  and  generating  a  sense  of  excitement  in  the  stores,""  he  said.  Yet  Evan  Mann,  a  senior  bond  analyst  at  Gimme  Credit,  said  Mr  Lynch's  job  would  not  be  easy,  as  the  bankruptcy  would  inevitably  put  off  some  customers.  ""The  real  big  issue  is  what's  going  to  happen  over  the  next  one  or  two  quarters  now  that  they  are  in  bankruptcy  and  all  their  customers  see  this  in  their  local  newspapers,""  he  said."

The  review  will  cover  production  of  gold,  aluminium  and  iron  ore  although  it  excludes  the  country's  oil  sector.  Chavez  has  sought  to  extend  the  state's  role  in  all  sectors  of  the  economy.  |||    The  left-wing  president  is  conducting  a  controversial  review  of  land  ownership  in  the  country  while  also  seeking  to  create  a  state-run  telecoms  firm  to  compete  with  foreign-owned  businesses.  |||    He  has  argued  that  major  economic  reforms  are  vital  to  improve  the  lives  of  Venezuela's  poorest  citizens.  Announcing  the  review  of  raw  material  production,  minister  Victor  Alvarez  said  the  government  would  seek  to  transfer  technology,  training  capability  and  content  from  projects  with  foreign  partners.  ""We  are  defending  our  national  sovereignty  over  the  use  of  our  national  resources  which  must  serve  the  endogenous  development  of  the  nation,""  Mr  Alvarez  said.  ""For  this  reason  we  are  reviewing  all  memorandums  of  understanding,  all  letters  of  intent,  all  agreements  that  have  been  signed,  all  contracts,  to  check  which  of  these  comply  with  these  directives.  ""Everything,  absolutely  everything,  has  to  be  reviewed.""  |||    Venezuela  has  previously  assured  foreign  companies  with  operations  in  the  mineral  rich  country  that  it  respects  existing  contracts.  However,  the  government  insisted  that  it  needed  to  develop  its  own  industrial  infrastructure  in  order  to  create  new  jobs  and  lessen  its  reliance  on  foreign  partners.  ""If  we  don't  do  this,  we  are  just  going  to  carry  on  being  slaves,  suppliers  of  raw  materials,  all  our  lives  and  we  will  never  develop  our  own  productive  capacity,""  Mr  Alvarez  added.  Companies  from  the  United  States,  Canada,  France  and  Switzerland  all  have  substantial  investments  in  Venezuela's  mining  sector." 

0	"Ad  sales  boost  Time  Warner  profit  |||    Quarterly  profits  at  US  media  giant  TimeWarner  jumped  76%  to  $1.13bn  (£600m)  for  the  three  months  to  December,  from  $639m  year-earlier.  |||    The  firm,  which  is  now  one  of  the  biggest  investors  in  Google,  benefited  from  sales  of  high-speed  internet  connections  and  higher  advert  sales.  TimeWarner  said  fourth  quarter  sales  rose  2%  to  $11.1bn  from  $10.9bn.  Its  profits  were  buoyed  by  one-off  gains  which  offset  a  profit  dip  at  Warner  Bros,  and  less  users  for  AOL.  |||    Time  Warner  said  on  Friday  that  it  now  owns  8%  of  search-engine  Google.  But  its  own  internet  business,  AOL,  had  has  mixed  fortunes.  It  lost  464,000  subscribers  in  the  fourth  quarter  profits  were  lower  than  in  the  preceding  three  quarters.  However,  the  company  said  AOL's  underlying  profit  before  exceptional  items  rose  8%  on  the  back  of  stronger  internet  advertising  revenues.  It  hopes  to  increase  subscribers  by  offering  the  online  service  free  to  TimeWarner  internet  customers  and  will  try  to  sign  up  AOL's  existing  customers  for  high-speed  broadband.  TimeWarner  also  has  to  restate  2000  and  2003  results  following  a  probe  by  the  US  Securities  Exchange  Commission  (SEC),  which  is  close  to  concluding.  |||    Time  Warner's  fourth  quarter  profits  were  slightly  better  than  analysts'  expectations.  But  its  film  division  saw  profits  slump  27%  to  $284m,  helped  by  box-office  flops  Alexander  and  Catwoman,  a  sharp  contrast  to  year-earlier,  when  the  third  and  final  film  in  the  Lord  of  the  Rings  trilogy  boosted  results.  For  the  full-year,  TimeWarner  posted  a  profit  of  $3.36bn,  up  27%  from  its  2003  performance,  while  revenues  grew  6.4%  to  $42.09bn.  ""Our  financial  performance  was  strong,  meeting  or  exceeding  all  of  our  full-year  objectives  and  greatly  enhancing  our  flexibility,""  chairman  and  chief  executive  Richard  Parsons  said.  For  2005,  TimeWarner  is  projecting  operating  earnings  growth  of  around  5%,  and  also  expects  higher  revenue  and  wider  profit  margins.  |||    TimeWarner  is  to  restate  its  accounts  as  part  of  efforts  to  resolve  an  inquiry  into  AOL  by  US  market  regulators.  It  has  already  offered  to  pay  $300m  to  settle  charges,  in  a  deal  that  is  under  review  by  the  SEC.  The  company  said  it  was  unable  to  estimate  the  amount  it  needed  to  set  aside  for  legal  reserves,  which  it  previously  set  at  $500m.  It  intends  to  adjust  the  way  it  accounts  for  a  deal  with  German  music  publisher  Bertelsmann's  purchase  of  a  stake  in  AOL  Europe,  which  it  had  reported  as  advertising  revenue.  It  will  now  book  the  sale  of  its  stake  in  AOL  Europe  as  a  loss  on  the  value  of  that  stake." 

0	"Russian  oil  merger  excludes  Yukos  |||    The  merger  of  Russian  gas  giant  Gazprom  and  oil  firm  Rosneft  is  to  go  ahead,  but  will  not  include  Yugansk,  which  was  controversially  bought  last  year.  |||    The  merger,  backed  by  Russian  authorities,  will  allow  foreigners  to  trade  in  Gazprom  shares.  Gazprom  chief  Alexei  Miller  confirmed  Rosneft-owned  Yugansk  was  not  part  of  the  deal  and  will  instead  be  spun  off.  Under  the  agreement,  the  state  will  get  a  controlling  share  of  Gazprom  in  exchange  for  Rosneft.  The  state  wanted  to  control  Gazprom  before  allowing  foreigners  to  trade.  Speaking  on  NTV  television,  which  is  controlled  by  Gazprom,  Mr  Miller  added  that  Yugansk,  which  was  swallowed  up  by  Rosneft  late  last  year,  will  operate  as  a  separate,  state-owned  oil  firm  headed  by  current  Rosneft  chief  Sergei  Bogdanchikov.  According  to  reports  from  Russian  News  Agency  Interfax,  the  deal  should  go  through  in  the  next  two  to  three  months.  |||    ""Obtaining  majority  control  over  Gazprom  is  the  beginning  of  the  liberalisation  of  the  market  in  Gazprom  shares,""  Mr  Miller  added.  By  opening  up  trading  in  Gazprom  to  foreigners,  the  firm  will  become  a  top  emerging  market  play  for  traders.  Currently,  foreigners  can  only  trade  in  Gazprom  via  a  small  issue  of  London-listed  proxy  shares.  ""This  is  positive  news  for  the  international  investment  community,""  Global  Asset  Management  investment  chief  David  Smith  said.  ""The  majority  of  investors  are  going  to  be  happy,""  he  added.  |||    However,  analysts  were  disappointed  that  Yugansk  would  not  be  included  in  the  deal.  ""Yugansk  is  a  heavy  cashflow  generator  and  would  have  been  a  much  better  asset  for  Gazprom,""  Renaissance  Capital  energy  analyst  Adam  Landes  told  Reuters  news  agency.  But  he  said  the  latest  development  was  simply  an  interim  step  to  allow  foreigners  to  trade  in  Gazprom.  ""Ultimately  and  industrially,  Gazprom  needs  Yugansk,""  he  added.  Analysts  said  the  deal  would  give  Gazprom  control  of  8%  of  Russia's  total  oil  production,  an  improvement  on  its  current  2.5%,  but  still  far  less  than  the  20%  share  it  would  have  gained  had  it  also  taken  over  Yugansk.  However,  the  merged  group  will  still  remain  outside  Russia's  top  five  oil  producers  -  led  by  Lukoil  with  11%  of  the  market  ,  followed  by  TNK-BP  which  is  half  owned  by  BP,  and  Surgutneftegaz.  Instead,  the  merged  Gazprom-Rosneft  group  will  rank  alongside  Sibneft  with  7%  of  the  market.  Yugansk  was  sold  to  a  little-known  shell  company  in  a  disputed  auction  in  December,  following  what  many  thought  was  a  politically-motivated  attack  on  Yukos.  The  shell  company  was  then  snapped  up  by  Rosneft.  Yukos  unsuccessfully  sought  to  halt  the  auction  by  applying  for  bankruptcy  through  the  US  courts.  The  unit  was  auctioned  by  Russian  authorities  to  help  pay  off  a  $27.5bn  back-tax  bill." 

2	"Brown  comes  out  shooting  |||    Labour  may  have  abolished  hunting  -  but  that  didn't  stop  Chancellor  Gordon  Brown  using  his  Budget  to  fire  both  barrels  at  some  of  the  opposition  parties'  core  election  foxes.  |||    Specifically,  it  saw  him  attempting  to  slaughter  the  council  tax  as  an  election  issue  and  to  tear  limb  from  limb  their  wider  policies  for  pensioners  and  families.  In  a  relatively  short  speech  he  kept  the  best  for  last  and  was  clearly  out  to  give  exactly  that  pre-election  boost  everyone  had  been  predicting.  So  if  you  are  a  couple  with  children,  a  pensioner,  a  patient  or  a  youngster,  there  was  something  pulled  from  Mr  Brown's  red  box  in  an  attempt  to  persuade  you  to  stick  with  or  switch  to  a  New  Labour  government.  Like  a  surgeon,  he  attempted  to  target  his  handouts  with  absolute  precision  onto  exactly  the  groups  the  government  needs  to  appeal  to  in  the  election  campaign.  |||    The  announcements  brought  great  cheers  from  his  own  MPs  who  are  now  in  full-on  election  mode  and  had  been  looking  to  their  man  to  give  them  ammunition  for  the  doorsteps.  They  obviously  believed  he  had  done  that  for  them  and,  coincidentally,  given  his  own  image  as  a  prime  minister-in-waiting  another  little  boost.  |||    Labour  MPs,  for  example,  will  undoubtedly  now  engage  in  a  debate  over  exactly  how  redistributive  -  a  lovely  Old  Labour  word  -  this  chancellor  really  is.  But  Gordon  Brown  is  never  going  to  put  on  a  show  and  even  as  he  was  out  to  cast  himself  as  the  man  who  will  win  Labour  an  historic  third  term,  his  demeanour  remained  quiet,  confident  and  reassuring.  Prudence  made  an  appearance,  albeit  towards  the  end  of  his  address,  as  he  assured  voters  he  would  do  nothing  to  mess  up  the  economic  stability  he  had  brought  to  Britain  and  which,  he  claimed,  would  be  thrown  away  by  anyone  else.  According  to  the  opposition  parties,  however,  it  is  all  one  big  con  trick.  |||    As  always,  they  accused  him  of  glossing  over  the  facts  of  the  ""black  hole""  at  the  centre  of  his  finances  which,  they  claim,  would  ensure  tax  increases  after  the  election.  He  did  it  most  obviously  with  his  increase  in  national  insurance  contributions  after  the  2001  election  campaign  during  which  he  had  pledged  not  to  increase  income  tax.  As  Liberal  Democrat  leader  Charles  Kennedy  claimed,  for  most  families  the  distinction  between  income  tax  and  a  tax  on  income  is  meaningless.  |||    Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  said  the  chancellor  was  up  to  his  old  trick  of  deliberately  re-casting  his  forecasts  to  give  the  illusion  that  everything  in  the  Treasury  larder  is  as  fresh  as  the  day  it  was  first  stored  away  for  future  use.  He  branded  it  a  dodgy  ""vote  now  pay  later""  budget  based  on  dodgy  figures  from  a  dodgy  government  that  gave  Britain  the  dodgy  dossier.  Where  the  chancellor  mostly  avoided  direct  electioneering,  Mr  Howard  felt  no  such  constraint  with  attacks  like  comparing  Mr  Brown's  forecasts  to  the  prime  minister's  forecasts  on  Iraq's  weapons  of  mass  destruction.  As  ever,  there  will  now  be  a  period  of  frantic  activity  by  the  opposition  parties'  treasury  specialists  as  they  pore  over  the  chancellor's  red  book,  which  sets  out  the  fine  detail  of  his  budget,  in  an  attempt  to  spot  the  flaws.  In  particular  there  will  be  an  argument  over  precisely  whose  policies  on  the  council  tax  will  offer  people  the  best  deal.  And  in  Labour  circles  there  will  undoubtedly  be  an  argument  over  just  how  good  a  prime  minister  Gordon  Brown  will  make  at  some  point  after  the  next  election." 

2	"'Debate  needed'  on  donations  cap  |||    A  cap  on  donations  to  political  parties  should  not  be  introduced  yet,  the  elections  watchdog  has  said.  |||    Fears  that  big  donors  can  buy  political  favours  have  sparked  calls  for  a  limit.  In  a  new  report,  the  Electoral  Commission  says  it  is  worth  debating  a  £10,000  cap  for  the  future  but  now  is  not  the  right  time  to  introduce  it.  It  also  says  there  should  be  more  state  funding  for  political  parties  and  candidates  should  be  able  to  spend  more  on  election  campaigning.  |||    There  were  almost  £68m  in  reported  donations  to  political  parties  in  2001,  2002  and  2003,  with  nearly  £12m  of  them  from  individual  gifts  worth  more  than  £1m.  The  rules  have  already  been  changed  so  the  public  can  see  who  gives  how  much  to  the  parties  but  the  report  says  there  are  still  public  suspicions.  The  commission  says  capping  donations  would  mean  taxpayers  giving  parties  more  cash  -  something  which  would  first  have  to  be  acceptable  to  the  public  and  shown  to  work.  ""While  we  are  not  in  principle  opposed  to  the  introduction  of  a  donation  cap,  we  do  not  believe  that  such  a  major  departure  from  the  existing  system  now  would  be  sensible,""  says  its  report.  If  there  was  to  be  a  cap,  it  should  be  £10,000  -  a  small  enough  amount  to  make  a  difference  but  which  would  have  banned  £56m  in  donations  between  2001  and  2003.  |||    Even  without  changes  the  commission  does  urge  political  parties  to  seek  out  more  small-scale  donations  and  suggests  there  should  be  income  tax  relief  for  gifts  under  £200.  It  also  suggests  increasing  state  funding  for  parties  to  £3m  so  help  can  be  extended  to  all  parties  with  at  least  two  members  in  the  House  of  Commons,  European  Parliament,  Scottish  Parliament,  Welsh  Assembly  or  Northern  Ireland  Assembly.  And  it  suggests  new  ways  of  boosting  election  campaigning,  seen  as  a  way  of  improving  voter  turnout.  All  local  election  candidates  should  be  entitled  to  a  free  mailshot  for  campaign  leaflets,  says  the  watchdog.  And  there  should  be  a  shift  in  the  amount  of  money  allowed  to  be  spent  at  elections  from  a  national  level  to  a  local  level  to  help  politicians  engage  better  with  voters.  |||    The  report  suggests  doubling  the  money  which  can  be  spent  by  candidates,  while  cutting  national  spending  limits  from  £20m  to  £15m.  The  commission  also  says  the  spending  limits  for  general  elections  should  cover  the  four  months  before  the  poll  -  as  happens  with  other  elections.  Electoral  Commission  chairman  Sam  Younger  said:  ""There  is  no  doubt  that  political  parties  have  a  vital  role  to  play  in  maintaining  the  health  of  our  democracy  and  for  this  they  need  to  be  adequately  resourced.  ""Our  research  has  shown  that  people  want  to  be  more  informed  about  party  politics  and  that  they  want  politicians  to  be  more  visible  and  accessible.  ""The  public  are  reluctant  for  the  state  to  fund  parties  but  at  the  same  time  are  unhappy  with  large  private  donations.""  He  called  for  a  wider  public  debate  on  party  funding  to  find  the  consensus  needed  for  radical  changes  to  the  current  system." 

0	"Cactus  diet  deal  for  Phytopharm  |||    A  slimming  aid  made  from  a  southern  African  cactus  is  set  to  be  developed  by  UK  firm  Phytopharm  and  Unilever.  |||    Anglo-Dutch  food  giant  Unilever  will  help  the  pharmaceutical  firm  develop  the  snacks  containing  Hoodia  extract.  Phytopharm  shares  jumped  10.7%  on  the  news,  with  analysts  saying  sales  of  $600m  (£309m)  a  year  were  possible.  The  plant,  licensed  to  Phytopharm  in  1997,  has  been  used  for  thousands  of  years  by  the  Sans  bushmen  of  the  Kalahari  desert  to  stave  off  hunger.  Studies  have  reportedly  shown  the  plant  curbs  appetite  instead  of  reducing  calorific  intake  like  many  existing  products.  |||    Phytopharm  will  receive  an  initial  fee  of  £6.5m  from  Unilever  -  out  of  a  potential  total  of  £21m  -  as  well  as  future  royalties  on  product  sales.  Under  the  deal,  production  of  the  Hoodia  cactus  at  Phytopharm's  nursery  in  South  Africa  will  also  rise  from  eight  million  plants  to  potentially  hundreds  of  millions,  said  Phytopharm  chief  executive  Richard  Dixey.  The  firm  had  initially  hoped  to  market  a  slimming  drug  from  Hoodia  with  Pfizer.  But  the  research  collaboration  came  to  an  end  in  2003.  Analysts  said  Unilever  could  launch  the  new  products  in  2007.  ""This  deal  goes  a  long  way  to  restoring  the  market  faith  in  Phytopharm's  pipeline  after  the  Pfizer  exit,""  said  analyst  Erling  Refsum  at  Nomura."

Friends  and  family,  including  actress  Ruby  Dee  his  wife  of  56  years,  gathered  at  the  Riverside  Church  on  Saturday.  Also  present  at  the  service  was  former  US  president  Bill  Clinton  and  singer  Harry  Belafonte,  who  gave  the  eulogy.  ""He  would  have  been  a  very  good  president  of  the  United  States,""  said  Mr  Clinton.  ""Like  most  of  you  here,  he  gave  more  to  me  than  I  gave  to  him.""  |||    The  87-year-old  was  found  dead  last  weekend  in  his  hotel  room  in  Florida,  where  he  was  making  a  film.  Police  said  that  he  appeared  to  have  died  of  natural  causes.  Davis  made  his  acting  debut  in  1950  in  No  Way  Out  starring  Sidney  Poiter.  He  frequently  collaborated  with  director  Spike  Lee,  starring  in  seven  Lee  films  including  Jungle  Fever,  Do  The  Right  Thing  and  Malcolm  X.  Attallah  Shabazz,  the  daughter  of  activist  Malcolm  X,  recalled  the  famous  eulogy  delivered  by  Davis  at  her  father's  funeral.  ""Harlem  has  come  to  bid  farewell  to  one  of  its  finest  hopes,""  she  said,  quoting  the  man  she  knew  as  Uncle  Ossie.  ""Ditto.""  ""Ossie  was  my  hero,  and  he  still  is,""  said  Aviator  star  Alan  Alda,  a  family  friend  for  over  forty  years.  ""Ossie  was  a  thing  of  beauty.""  |||    ""I  want  so  badly  someday  to  have  his  dignity  -  a  little  of  it  anyway,""  added  Burt  Reynolds,  Davis's  co-star  in  the  90s  TV  comedy  Evening  Shade.  Before  the  midday  funeral,  scores  of  Harlem  residents  formed  a  queue  outside  the  church  to  pay  their  respects  to  Davis.  ""It  is  hard  to  fathom  that  we  will  no  longer  be  able  to  call  on  his  wisdom,  his  humour,  his  loyalty  and  his  moral  strength  to  guide  us  in  the  choices  that  are  yet  to  be  made  and  the  battles  that  are  yet  to  be  fought,""  said  Belafonte,  himself  an  ardent  civil  rights  activist  who  had  been  friends  with  Davis  for  over  60  years.  ""But  how  fortunate  we  were  to  have  him  as  long  as  we  did."""

""This  is  Leicester  Square  like  you've  never  seen  it  before,""  said  Hanks,  who  plays  five  roles  in  the  movie.  Polar  Express  is  based  on  a  children's  book  which  tells  the  story  of  a  young  boy's  journey  to  meet  Santa  Claus.  The  48-year-old  actor  crossed  a  three-metre  high  bridge  built  in  the  square,  which  he  said  was  ""almost  impossible  to  get  across"".  Hundreds  of  fans  greeted  the  star,  all  wearing  Santa  hats,  and  mince  pies  were  on  offer.  Hanks  said  that  the  new  film  has  an  ""elegant  message"".  ""Christmas  is  a  special  time  of  the  year  and  you  get  out  of  it  what  you  put  into  it,""  added  the  two-time  Academy  Award  winner.  |||    ""I  believe  in  the  spirit  of  Christmas  and  I  think  that's  embodied  in  Santa  Claus,""  he  said.  Polar  Express  uses  technology  similar  to  that  used  in  Lord  of  the  Rings  to  bring  Gollum  to  life.  The  ""performance  capture""  technique  enables  Hanks  to  play  a  number  of  roles,  including  the  eight-year-old  boy  who  is  at  the  centre  of  the  story,  and  Father  Christmas.  It  is  directed  by  Robert  Zemeckis,  who  has  previously  worked  with  Hanks  on  Forrest  Gump  and  Castaway."

Green  Day's  Boulevard  of  Broken  Dreams  is  currently  number  two  in  Billboard's  pop  chart,  and  tops  its  digital  chart.  Download  sales  are  due  to  be  incorporated  into  the  UK  singles  chart  later  this  year.  |||    Digital  sales  in  the  US  are  already  used  to  compile  Billboard's  Hot  Digital  Sales  chart.  They  will  now  be  tallied  with  sales  of  physical  singles  and  airplay  information  to  make  up  its  new  Hot  100  chart.  Its  second  new  chart  -  the  Pop  100  -  also  combines  airplay,  digital  and  physical  sales  but  confines  its  airplay  information  to  US  radio  stations  which  play  chart  music.  In  addition  to  Green  Day,  other  artists  in  the  current  US  digital  sales  top  10  include  Kelly  Clarkson,  The  Game  and  the  Killers.  |||    Sales  of  legally  downloaded  songs  shot  up  more  than  tenfold  in  2004,  with  200  million  track  purchased  online  in  the  US  and  Europe  in  12  months,  the  International  Federation  of  the  Phonographic  Industry  (IFPI)  reported  last  month.  In  the  UK  sales  of  song  downloads  overtook  those  for  physical  singles  for  the  first  time  at  the  end  of  last  year.  The  last  week  of  December  2004  saw  download  sales  of  312,000  compared  with  282,000  physical  singles,  according  to  the  British  Phonographic  Industry.  The  UK's  first  official  music  download  chart  was  launched  last  September,  compiling  the  most  popular  tracks  downloaded  from  legal  UK  sites  -  including  iTunes,  OD2,  mycokemusic.com  and  Napster.  Westlife's  Flying  Without  Wings  -  a  1999  track  reissued  for  the  occasion  -  was  the  first  number  one  of  the  UK  download  chart.  |||    A  spokesman  for  the  British  Phonographic  Industry  (BPI)  said  the  first  combined  UK  download  and  sales  chart  was  due  to  be  compiled  ""within  the  first  half  of  this  year"".  ""Work  is  going  on  across  the  music  business  right  now  to  make  sure  the  new  chart  works  to  plan,""  he  said.  The  BPI  spokesman  described  the  UK  music  download  chart,  compiled  by  the  Official  Charts  Company,  as  having  been  ""a  great  success""  since  its  launch.  ""It  has  provided  a  focus  for  the  industry  and  has  really  driven  interest  in  downloads  among  music  fans,""  he  said."

Reports  say  Standard  Life,  which  owns  a  1%  stake  in  Deutsche  Boerse,  may  seek  a  shareholder  vote  on  the  issue.  Fellow  shareholders  US-based  hedge  fund  Atticus  Capital  and  UK-based  TCI  Fund  Management  have  also  expressed  doubts.  |||    Deutsche  Boerse's  supervisory  board  has  approved  the  possible  takeover  of  the  LSE  despite  the  signs  of  opposition  from  investors.  ""The  onus  is  on  Deutsche  Boerse's  management  to  demonstrate  why  the  purchase  of  the  LSE  creates  more  value  for  shareholders  than  other  strategies,  such  as  a  buyback,""  said  Richard  Moffat,  investment  director  of  UK  Equities  at  Standard  Life  Investments.  Atticus  Capital,  holding  2%  of  Deutsche  Boerse,  wants  it  to  buy  back  its  own  shares  rather  than  buy  the  LSE.  And  TCI  which  holds  about  5%,  has  made  a  request  for  an  extraordinary  shareholders  meeting  to  be  held  to  vote  on  replacing  the  company's  entire  supervisory  board.  It  has  also  demanded  that  shareholders  be  consulted  about  the  proposed  acquisition,  and  whether  the  operator  of  the  Frankfurt  stock  exchange  should  return  $500m  (£266m)  to  shareholders  instead.  |||    In  December,  Deutsche  Boerse,  which  also  owns  the  derivatives  market  Eurex  and  the  clearing  firm  Clearstream,  put  an  informal  offer  of  530  pence  per  LSE  share  on  the  table.  However,  the  LSE  said  the  cash  offer  ""undervalued""  both  its  own  business  and  the  benefits  of  such  a  tie-up.  Since  then  an  improved  offer  from  Deutsche  Boerse  has  been  anticipated  as  its  management  has  continued  talks  with  LSE  chief  executive  Clara  Furse.  But  the  London  exchange  is  also  holding  talks  with  Deutsche  Boerse's  rival  Euronext,  which  operates  the  Amsterdam,  Brussels,  Lisbon  and  Paris  exchanges,  as  well  as  London-based  international  derivatives  market  Liffe." 

1	"Farrell  due  to  make  US  TV  debut  |||    Actor  Colin  Farrell  is  to  make  his  debut  on  US  television  in  medical  sitcom  Scrubs,  according  to  Hollywood  newspaper  Daily  Variety.  |||    The  film  star,  who  recently  played  the  title  role  in  historical  blockbuster  Alexander,  will  make  a  cameo  appearance  as  an  unruly  Irishman.  The  episode  featuring  the  28-year-old  will  be  screened  on  25  January.  Farrell's  appearance  is  said  to  be  a  result  of  his  friendship  with  Zach  Braff,  who  stars  in  the  programme.  It  will  be  the  actor's  first  appearance  on  the  small  screen  since  he  appeared  in  BBC  series  Ballykissangel  in  1999.  The  gentle  Sunday  night  drama  came  to  an  end  in  2001.  |||    He  has  since  become  one  of  Hollywood's  fastest-rising  stars,  with  a  string  roles  in  major  league  films  such  as  Minority  Report,  Phone  Booth  and  Daredevil.  Farrell  is  pencilled  in  to  play  the  role  of  Crockett  in  a  film  version  of  1980s  police  drama  Miami  Vice.  Scrubs,  which  appears  on  the  NBC  network  in  the  US  and  has  been  shown  on  Channel  4  on  British  television,  is  an  off-beat  comedy  about  a  group  of  hospital  doctors.  Other  film  stars  to  have  appeared  in  Scrubs  include  Heather  Graham,  while  Friends  actor  Matthew  Perry  has  guest-starred  and  directed  an  episode  of  the  show.  Its  leading  star,  Zach  Braff,  has  recently  been  seen  on  the  big  screen  in  Garden  State,  which  he  also  directed."

Green  groups  say  putting  pressure  on  supply  chains  is  a  major  way  companies  can  reduce  their  environmental  impact.  The  survey  is  published  by  corporate  social  responsibility  firm  Context  and  branding  firm  SalterBaxter.  |||    Blake  Lee-Harwood,  campaigns  director  at  Greenpeace  in  the  UK,  said:  ""It's  fairly  meaningless  to  talk  about  your  company's  direction  in  terms  of  sustainability  without  having  detailed  knowledge  of  your  supply  chain.  ""It's  also  important  to  get  some  kind  of  independent  assessment  of  your  reporting.""  |||    Less  than  a  quarter  of  companies  (24%)  get  their  corporate  social  responsibility  (CSR)  reports  independently  verified  to  provide  assurances  they  are  accurate  and  complete,  says  the  survey.  To  date  there  are  no  set  standards  for  non-financial  reporting,  although  the  Global  Reporting  Initiative,  an  independent  pro-sustainability  institution,  is  planning  to  establish  some.  The  reports  surveyed  by  Directions  are  published  voluntarily.  They  are  usually  called  corporate  social  responsibility  (CSR)  reports,  sustainability  reports,  or  social  and  environmental  reports.  |||    Peter  Knight,  director  of  Context,  says  24  UK  top  250  companies  reported  for  the  first  time  this  year  and,  in  general,  the  quality  of  reports  has  improved.  ""The  corporate  lexicon  of  homilies,  generalities  and  soft  assurances  -  fluff  -  is  on  its  way  out.  There  are  less  pictures  of  smiling  children  and  butterflies.""  The  UK  government  will  soon  require  all  quoted  companies  to  report  their  social  and  environmental  risks  in  a  chapter  in  their  annual  reports,  called  the  Operating  and  Financial  Review.  The  regulation  is  not  expected  until  2005  and  the  first  reports  under  this  scheme  will  not  be  published  before  2006.  The  US  seems  to  lag  Europe  in  producing  corporate  social  responsibility  reports.  The  majority  of  European  top  50  companies  (44)  publish  them  and  only  27  of  the  US  top  50." 

2	"Defection  timed  to  hit  tax  pledge  |||    With  impeccable  and  precisely-calculated  timing,  Tory  defector  Robert  Jackson  and  his  new  Labour  bosses  have  attempted  to  overshadow  Michael  Howard's  latest  announcement  on  taxation  and  spending.  |||    With  just  about  everyone  in  Westminster  now  working  towards  a  May  general  election,  Mr  Howard  is  eager  to  map  out  some  clear  and  distinctive  policies  aimed  at  finally  shifting  the  Tories'  resolutely  depressing  poll  showings.  The  big  idea  is  his  £35bn  savings  on  waste  and  bureaucracy  which  Mr  Howard  has  pledged  to  plough  back  into  public  services  and  tax  cuts.  And  it  was  virtually  certain  his  pledge  on  tax  cuts  was  meant  to  be  the  core  message  from  his  interview  on  the  BBC  One's  Breakfast  with  Frost  programme.  He  and  his  shadow  Chancellor  Oliver  Letwin  have  been  edging  towards  an  announcement  on  this  front  for  some  months  now,  but  without  any  concrete  pledges.  But  Mr  Howard  announced  that,  of  the  £35bn  he  has  earmarked  from  savings,  £12bn  will  be  used  to  plug  Labour's  claimed  financial  black  hole  with  any  left  over  going  to  tax  cuts  in  Mr  Letwin's  first  budget.  He  would  not  be  precise,  but  there  are  already  suggestions  he  is  set  to  announce  lifting  the  threshold  on  income  tax  and  reforming  or  abolishing  inheritance  tax.  But  he  did,  for  the  first  time,  say  there  would  be  such  tax  cuts.  |||    ""At  this  election,  people  will  have  a  clear  choice  between  Mr  Blair  who  will  waste  more  and  tax  more  and  the  Conservative  party  which  will  give  value  for  money  and  tax  less"".  It  is  the  Tories'  attempt  to  open  that  famed  ""clear  blue  water""  between  them  and  the  Labour  party  and  return  to  a  traditional  Tory  agenda  that  will  both  reassure  the  middle  England  voters  who  have  abandoned  him  and  appeal  to  core  Conservative  voters.  So  it  is  a  pretty  safe  bet  to  assume  that,  when  Robert  Jackson  finally  decided  to  jump  ship  and  swim  over  to  the  Labour  benches,  his  new  masters  decided  to  time  the  announcement  for  the  greatest  possible  impact.  Mr  Howard,  however,  was  dismissive.  ""These  things  happen  from  time  to  time.  There  are  disagreements  between  Robert  Jackson  and  me.  |||    ""The  election  is  not  going  to  be  decided  on  what  Robert  Jackson  did,""  he  added.  And  that  is  certainly  true.  The  election  will  be  decided  on  ""the  economy  stupid"".  Other  issues  like  the  Iraq  war  and  the  ""trust""  thing  will  also  play  a  major  part.  But  it  is  the  economy  that  will  probably  be  the  greatest  influence  over  the  way  people  finally  vote.  And  many  on  the  Tory  benches  have  been  crying  out  for  Mr  Howard  to  get  back  onto  the  old  Tory  tax  cuts  agenda.  Mr  Howard  knows  that  risks  accusations  that,  as  a  result,  he  would  slash  public  services,  so  he  has  attempted  to  shoot  that  fox  first.  With  polls  suggesting  voters  would  rather  any  government  cash  surpluses  were  spent  on  schools  and  hospitals  before  tax  cuts,  he  has  suggested  that  is  exactly  what  he  will  do.  Whether  this  will  finally  be  enough  to  shift  those  polls  remains  to  be  seen." 

2	"Election  deal  faltered  over  Heath  role  |||    The  Tories  failed  to  hold  onto  power  in  1974  after  Liberals  demanded  Sir  Edward  Heath  quit  in  return  for  co-operation.  |||    Documents  released  after  30  years  reveal  the  failed  negotiations  by  the  then  prime  minister  following  the  dramatic  February  general  election.  Liberal  leader  Jeremy  Thorpe  appeared  willing  to  form  a  coalition  government.  But  it  partly  collapsed  over  the  Conservative  leader's  own  role,  prompting  the  Queen  to  ask  Harold  Wilson  to  form  a  Labour  government.  The  February  1974  general  election  surprised  the  nation  when  it  created  a  hung  parliament  with  no  party  in  overall  control.  Sir  Edward  had  gone  to  the  country  for  a  fresh  mandate  amid  the  spiralling  economic  crisis,  a  miners'  strike  and  the  subsequent  three-day  week.  Labour  emerged  with  the  most  seats  -  but  its  301  MPs  were  17  short  of  the  number  Mr  Wilson  needed  to  form  a  majority.  |||    Sir  Edward,  who  had  received  more  votes  but  had  fewer  MPs,  believed  he  had  the  authority  to  remain  at  Number  10  providing  the  14  Liberal  MPs  would  support  his  government.  He  said  the  Liberals  could  keep  out  Labour  in  three  ways:  lend  ad  hoc  support  to  his  minority  government,  help  draw  up  the  government's  programme,  or  have  up  to  three  Cabinet  members  in  a  coalition  with  the  Conservatives.  According  to  the  documents  released  at  the  National  Archives,  the  ""friendly  and  easy""  first  meeting  indicated  that  both  Sir  Edward  and  Mr  Thorpe  thought  they  had  the  makings  of  a  deal.  Mr  Thorpe  was  in  high  spirits,  having  just  led  his  party  to  a  historic  jump  in  support.  He  also  argued  for  a  grand  coalition  of  all  three  main  parties.  But  Sir  Edward  said  that  was  impossible  because  the  Labour  left  was  set  against  it  and  the  pair  settled  on  trying  for  a  Conservative-Liberal  pact.  |||    Hours  later  Sir  Edward's  hopes  of  a  deal  unravelled  as  Mr  Thorpe's  colleagues  refused  to  support  him.  ""Jeremy  said  he  was  encountering  a  rather  embarrassing  problem  with  his  colleagues  about  the  prime  minister  personally,""  reads  a  telephone  memo  for  Mr  Heath.  |||    ""They  feel  they  could  not  agree  to  serve  as  long  as  he  is  the  prime  minister.  ""Asked  if  this  was  his  own  view  he  said  -  no  it  was  not,  I  am  very  close  to  Ted  and  thought  he  was  by  far  the  most  able  man  we  had  and  he  would  be  perfectly  happy  to  serve  -  it  was  only  some  of  his  colleagues  who  were  being  difficult.""  The  following  day,  the  stickling  points  had  clearly  become  two-fold:  Mr  Thorpe's  colleagues  wanted  electoral  reform  and  Sir  Edward's  resignation.  Mr  Thorpe  told  Sir  Edward:  ""I  am  sorry  this  is  obviously  hell  -  a  nightmare  on  stilts  for  you.  ""Somehow  I  personally  hope  that  we  can  work  something  out.""  |||    Four  hours  later,  Sir  Edward  called  the  Liberal  leader  back  to  Downing  Street  in  a  last  attempt  at  a  deal.  The  minutes  of  the  meeting  show  how  the  chance  of  a  coalition  government  quickly  evaporated.  ""The  PM  said  he  was  bound  to  tell  Mr  Thorpe  that  his  colleagues  had  told  him  that  they  would  not  agree  to  serve  under  any  other  prime  minister.  Mr  Thorpe  was  at  liberty  to  verify  this  by  talking  to  one  or  two  of  the  prime  minister's  colleagues.""  Documents  show  that  Sir  Edward  mulled  over  resigning  and  perhaps  returning  to  coalition  government  in  a  Labour-led  coalition.  But  he  already  knew  Mr  Wilson  would  not  form  a  coalition  with  either  the  Liberals  or  the  Conservatives  because  of  the  opposition  of  the  Labour  left.  Within  hours  of  his  final  talks  with  Mr  Thorpe,  Sir  Edward  told  the  nation  he  was  resigning  and  the  Queen  invited  Mr  Wilson  to  form  a  new  minority  government." 

0	"Mixed  Christmas  for  US  retailers  |||    US  retailers  posted  mixed  results  for  December  -  with  luxury  retailers  faring  well  while  many  others  were  forced  to  slash  prices  to  lift  sales.  |||    Upscale  department  store  Nordstrom  said  same  store  sales  were  9.3%  higher  than  during  the  same  period  last  year.  Trendy  youth  labels  also  sold  well,  with  sales  jumping  28%  at  young  women's  clothing  retailer  Bebe  Stores  and  32.2%  at  American  Eagle  Outfitters.  But  Wal-Mart  only  saw  its  sales  rise  after  it  cut  prices.  The  company  saw  a  3%  rise  in  December  sales,  less  than  the  4.3%  rise  seen  a  year  earlier.  |||    Customers  at  the  world's  biggest  retailer  are  generally  seen  to  be  the  most  vulnerable  to  America's  economic  woes.  |||    Commentators  claim  many  have  cut  back  on  spending  amid  uncertainty  over  job  security,  while  low  and  middle-income  Americans  have  reined  in  spending  in  the  face  of  higher  gasoline  prices.  Analysts  said  Wal-Mart  faced  a  ""stand-off""  with  shoppers,  stepping  up  its  discounts  as  the  festive  season  wore  on,  as  consumers  waited  longer  to  get  the  best  bargains.  However,  experts  added  that  if  prices  had  not  been  cut  across  the  sector,  Christmas  sales  -  which  account  for  nearly  23%  of  annual  retail  sales  -  would  have  been  far  worse.  ""So  far,  we  are  faring  better  than  expected,  but  the  results  are  still  split,""  Ken  Perkins,  an  analyst  at  research  firm  RetailMetrics  LLC,  told  Associated  Press.  ""Stores  that  have  been  struggling  over  the  last  couple  of  months  appear  to  be  continuing  that  trend.  And  for  stores  that  have  been  doing  well  over  the  last  several  months,  December  was  a  good  month.""  Overall,  December  sales  are  forecast  to  rise  by  4.5%  to  $220bn  -  less  than  the  5.1%  increase  seen  a  year  earlier.  |||    One  discount  retailer  to  fare  well  in  December  was  Costco  Wholesale,  which  continued  a  recent  run  of  upbeat  results  with  a  better-than-expected  8%  jump  in  same  store  sales.  However,  the  losers  were  many  and  varied.  Home  furnishings  store  Pier  1  Imports  saw  its  same  store  sales  sink  by  a  larger-than-forecast  8.8%  as  it  battled  fierce  competition.  Leading  electronics  chain  Best  Buy,  meanwhile,  missed  its  sales  target  of  a  3-5%  rise  in  sales,  turning  in  a  2.5%  increase  over  the  Christmas  period.  Accessory  vendor  Claire's  Stores  also  suffered  as  an  expected  last  minute  shopping  rush  never  materialised,  leaving  its  same  store  sales  5%  higher,  compared  to  a  6%  rise  last  year.  Jeweller  Zale  also  felt  little  Christmas  cheer  with  December  sales  down  0.7%  on  the  same  month  last  year.  ""This  was  not  a  good  period  for  retailers  or  shoppers.  We  saw  a  dearth  of  exciting,  new  items,""  Kurt  Barnard,  president  of  industry  forecaster  Retail  Consulting  Group,  said.  However,  one  beneficiary  of  the  desertion  of  the  High  Street  is  expected  to  be  online  stores.  According  to  a  survey  by  Goldman  Sachs  &  Co,  Harris  Interactive  and  Neilsen/Net  Ratings  sales  surged  25%  over  the  holiday  season  to  $23.2bn."

But,  the  EC  did  warn  the  two  were  under  close  scrutiny  and  it  would  act  if  their  fiscal  situations  deteriorated.  Under  EU  rules,  member  countries  must  keep  their  deficits  below  3%.  France  and  Germany  will  breach  that  this  year.  It  will  be  the  third  year  in  a  row  that  the  two  countries  have  broken  the  European  Union's  Stability  and  Growth  Pact  rules.  |||    The  eurozone's  two  biggest  economies  left  the  pact  in  tatters  in  November  2003  when  they  persuaded  fellow  EU  members  to  put  the  threat  of  penalties  for  deficit  breaches  on  hold.  |||    The  commission  then  took  the  pair  to  the  European  Court  of  Human  Justice  -  which  ruled  EU  countries  could  not  put  the  pact  ""in  abeyance"",  and  confirmed  the  EC's  right  to  launch  ""excessive  debt  procedures"".  After  announcing  its  decision  to  erase  France  and  Germany  from  its  list  of  deficit  rule  breakers,  the  EU  said  that  the  time  lag  created  by  the  ruling  meant  that  2005  should  be  the  target  year  for  the  pair  to  bring  their  budget's  below  3%.  ""The  commission  concludes  that  the  two  countries  appear  to  be  on  track  to  correct  their  excessive  deficits  by  2005,""  it  said  in  a  statement.  The  EU  expects  the  German  deficit  to  fall  to  fall  to  2.9%  of  GDP  next  year  from  3.9%  this  year,  while  France's  is  forecast  to  drop  to  3%  from  an  expected  3.7%  this  year.  The  forecasts  are  based  on  EC  predictions  of  GDP  growth  of  1.5%  in  Germany  next  year  and  2.2%  in  France.  |||    Berlin  welcomed  the  decision,  with  finance  minister  Hans  Eichel  saying  it  showed  that  the  EC  recognised  Germany's  fiscal  policy  was  ""on  the  right  track  even  amid  very  difficult  economic  conditions"".  However  Paris  was  more  subdued,  with  finance  minister  Herve  Gaymard  telling  parliament:  ""We  must  continue  along  this  path  of  saving  money.""  However,  the  move  still  had  its  critics,  with  the  European  People's  Party  (EPP)  attacking  the  EC  for  backing  down  from  punitive  action.  ""The  Commission  is  buckling  under  the  pressure  from  Germany  and  France,  ""  EPP  spokesman  Alexander  Radwan  said.  ""The  scary  fact  is  that  budget  sinners,  despite  having  repeatedly  exceeded  the  3%  deficit  limit,  do  not  have  to  fear  any  sanctions.""  Despite  the  commission  delivering  its  decision  on  the  two  biggest  eurozone  economies,  it  refused  to  comment  on  similar  action  against  Greece  which  has  also  broken  the  3%  deficit  ceiling.  Monetary  Affairs  Commissioner  Joaquin  Almunia  said  that  it  was  a  matter  for  next  week." 

3	"Pearce  keen  on  succeeding  Keegan  |||    Joint  assistant  boss  Stuart  Pearce  has  admitted  he  would  like  to  succeed  Kevin  Keegan  as  manager  at  Manchester  City.  |||    Keegan  has  decided  to  step  down  as  City  manager  when  his  contract  comes  to  an  end  in  18  months.  ""You  don't  have  to  be  Einstein  to  realise  there  will  be  a  manager's  job  available  at  a  really  good  club,""  Pearce  told  BBC  GMR.  ""I  will  certainly  be  applying  for  it,  although  whether  the  board  deem  me  good  enough  to  take  it,  I  do  not  know.""  Pearce  initially  joined  City  as  a  player  under  Keegan  in  2001  before  becoming  part  of  the  coaching  staff.  He  was  promoted  to  joint  assistant-manager  following  the  departure  of  Arthur  Cox  last  summer.  |||    The  former  England  defender  had  a  year  as  player-boss  with  Nottingham  Forest  eight  seasons  ago  but  has  made  no  secret  of  his  desire  to  have  another  crack  at  the  job.  He  was  linked  with  the  manager's  job  at  Oldham  and  Keegan  has  stated  he  would  not  get  in  the  way  if  Pearce  wanted  to  leave.  But  it  now  appears  Pearce  is  keen  to  wait  for  his  chance  at  City.  He  added:  ""By  that  time,  I  will  have  been  here  for  five  years  so  at  least  they  will  have  had  a  good  look  at  me  and  they  are  aware  of  my  feelings  with  regard  to  being  Kevin's  successor.  ""Obviously,  the  issue  is  out  of  my  hands  but  it  is  a  fantastic  job  for  anybody  -  I  just  hope  it  will  be  me.""" 

2	"EU  fraud  clampdown  urged  |||    EU  member  states  are  failing  to  report  fraud  and  irregularities  in  EU  funds  on  a  consistent  basis,  the  UK's  public  spending  watchdog  has  said.  |||    The  National  Audit  Office  said  although  the  latest  figures  showed  reported  fraud  was  falling,  the  EU  still  had  no  common  definition  of  fraud.  It  also  expressed  concern  that,  for  the  10th  year,  the  European  Court  of  Auditors  had  qualified  the  EU  accounts.  The  NAO  urged  the  government  to  push  for  improvements  in  reporting  fraud.  It  said  member  states  needed  to  be  more  accountable  on  how  money  was  spent.  The  report  said:  ""Member  states  still  do  not  report  fraud  and  other  irregularities  to  the  European  Anti-Fraud  Office  on  a  consistent  basis.  |||    ""As  the  court  has  now  qualified  its  opinion  on  the  Community  accounts  for  a  decade,  it  is  essential  for  all  the  authorities  involved  to  contribute  to  the  strengthening  of  the  audit  of  EU  revenue  and  expenditure  and  improving  accountability  for  the  financial  management  and  use  of  EU  resources.""  It  said  there  were  922  cases  of  reported  fraud  or  irregularities  in  EU  funds  in  the  UK  in  2003,  worth  £38.5m  (52m  euros),  up  from  831  cases  worth  £35.7m  in  2002.  At  the  same  time,  reported  fraud  throughout  the  EU  dropped  from  10,276  cases  worth  £808m  to  8,177  cases  worth  £644m.  Edward  Leigh,  chairman  of  the  Commons  public  accounts  committee,  said  Britain  had  to  set  an  example  when  it  assumed  the  EU  presidency.  |||    ""Any  fraud  in  other  member  states  is  potentially  fraud  against  the  UK  taxpayer,  given  that  we  are  the  second  largest  net  contributor  to  the  Community,""  he  said.  ""Departments  responsible  for  administering  EU  funds  need  to  make  sure  that  they're  doing  everything  possible  to  weed  out  improper  spending.  ""The  government  must  take  the  opportunity  afforded  by  the  UK  presidency  of  the  EU  to  press  the  Commission  and  other  member  states  to  take  an  equally  robust  stance  against  fraud  and  irregularity,  and  raise  overall  standards  of  financial  management.""  A  spokesman  for  the  European  Anti-Fraud  Office  said  the  organisation  agreed  with  the  NAO's  assessment  of  fraud  reporting.  ""The  quality  of  reporting  does  differ  from  member  state  to  member  state,  and  there  is  room  for  improvement,""  spokesman  Jorg  Wojahn  said.  He  added  that  there  is  generally  good  co-operation  with  member  states  and  the  anti-fraud  office  on  specific  cases  of  fraud,  with  the  statistics  studied  by  NAO  providing  a  ""good  overview  for  planning  strategic  ways  of  detecting  fraud""." 

0	"US  budget  deficit  to  reach  $368bn  |||    The  US  budget  deficit  is  set  to  hit  a  worse-than-expected  $368bn  (£197bn)  this  year,  officials  said  on  Tuesday.  |||    The  cost  of  military  operations  still  needs  to  be  factored  in,  with  analysts  saying  the  deficit  could  end  up  a  further  $100bn  in  the  red.  Past  Congressional  Budget  Office  (CBO)  forecasts  said  there  would  be  a  $348bn  shortfall  in  the  2005  fiscal  year.  In  recent  months,  the  dollar  has  weakened  amid  market  jitters  about  the  size  of  the  budget  and  trade  deficits.  In  November,  the  gap  between  US  exports  and  imports  widened  to  more  than  $60bn,  a  record  figure.  The  CBO  says  it  envisages  a  further  ""orderly""  decline  in  the  greenback  over  the  next  two  years  as  the  twin  deficit  drives  dollar  investors  away.  But  the  non-partisan  fiscal  watchdog  notes  the  declines  will  help  exporters  and  boost  US  economic  growth.  |||    The  budget  deficit  hit  a  record  $412bn  in  the  12  months  to  30  September  2004,  after  reaching  $377bn  in  the  previous  fiscal  year.  The  CBO  also  forecast  a  total  shortfall  of  $855bn  for  the  years  from  2006  to  2015,  an  improvement  on  previous  projections.  However,  analysts  say  the  new  figures  fail  to  take  into  account  the  potential  $2-$3.8  trillion  costs  of  the  president's  plan  to  revamp  state  pensions  and  extend  tax  cuts.  The  figure  could  also  be  worsened  by  any  further  military  costs.  Republicans  have  blamed  the  size  of  the  deficit  on  slow  economic  conditions  after  the  11  September  attacks  and  ongoing  military  operations  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan.  One  of  President  George  W  Bush's  election  pledges  was  to  halve  the  budget  deficit  within  five  years.  But  Democrats  have  accused  the  president  of  excluding  Iraq-related  costs  from  previous  budgets  to  meet  the  aim  of  reducing  the  deficit,  a  charge  which  the  administration  denies.  On  Tuesday,  the  US  administration  asked  Congress  for  additional  funds  for  military  operations." 

0	"Optimism  remains  over  UK  housing  |||    The  UK  property  market  remains  robust  despite  the  recent  slowdown,  according  to  mortgage  lender  Bradford  &  Bingley  and  housebuilder  George  Wimpey.  |||    B&B  said  the  buy-to-let  market  -  in  which  the  bank  is  a  major  player  -  would  continue  to  grow  much  faster  than  the  wider  mortgage  market.  The  comments  came  as  it  reported  a  6%  rise  in  profits  to  £280.2m  ($532m).  Wimpey  reported  a  19%  rise  in  profits  to  £450.7m  and  said  recent  new  home  reservations  were  better  than  expected.  |||    Recent  housing  market  surveys  have  indicated  that  the  UK  property  market  has  cooled  in  recent  months  after  several  years  of  rapid  growth.  Last  week,  figures  from  the  Council  of  Mortgage  Lenders  (CML)  indicated  that  the  popularity  of  buy-to-let  mortgages  -  a  key  phenomenon  of  the  housing  boom  -  could  be  waning.  |||    But  B&B  -  which  has  a  22%  share  of  the  UK  buy-to-let  mortgage  market  -  said  that  while  rates  of  growth  were  moderating,  the  sector  ""continues  to  grow  at  a  rate  considerably  above  that  of  the  whole  mortgage  market"".  Overall,  B&B  said  that  ""housing  market  fundamentals  remain  strong"".  ""Interest  rates  and  unemployment  are  both  likely  to  remain  at  historically  low  levels,  real  household  incomes  should  continue  to  grow  and  housing  demand  is  likely  to  outstrip  supply  into  the  medium-term.""  Despite  the  upbeat  tone,  shares  in  B&B  were  down  more  than  4%  at  325.5p  in  morning  trade  as  analysts  worried  over  future  earnings  growth.  |||    Wimpey's  profit  figures  came  in  at  the  top  of  expectations,  with  the  numbers  helped  by  buoyant  sales  in  the  US  offsetting  a  slight  slowdown  in  the  UK.  Wimpey  said  the  UK  housing  market  had  proved  ""challenging""  last  year.  ""By  late  summer,  the  market  in  general  had  slowed  sharply  across  the  country  and  showed  no  real  improvement  during  the  autumn,""  it  added.  However,  the  first  seven  weeks  of  this  year  had  produced  promising  signs,  Wimpey  said.  ""Visitor  levels  and  interest  in  this  period  have  been  encouraging  and  reservations  have  been  at  the  stronger  end  of  our  expectations.""  Shares  in  Wimpey  were  up  6%  at  458.5p  in  morning  trade." 

0	"Battered  dollar  hits  another  low  |||    The  dollar  has  fallen  to  a  new  record  low  against  the  euro  after  data  fuelled  fresh  concerns  about  the  US  economy.  |||    The  greenback  hit  $1.3516  in  thin  New  York  trade,  before  rallying  to  $1.3509.  The  dollar  has  weakened  sharply  since  September  when  it  traded  about  $1.20,  amid  continuing  worries  over  the  levels  of  the  US  trade  and  budget  deficits.  Meanwhile,  France's  finance  minister  has  said  the  world  faced  ""economic  catastrophe""  unless  the  US  worked  with  Europe  and  Asia  on  currency  controls.  Herve  Gaymard  said  he  would  seek  action  on  the  issue  at  the  next  meeting  of  G7  countries  in  February.  Ministers  from  European  and  Asian  governments  have  recently  called  on  the  US  to  strengthen  the  dollar,  saying  the  excessively  high  value  of  the  euro  was  starting  to  hurt  their  export-driven  economies.  ""It's  absolutely  essential  that  at  the  meeting  of  the  G7  our  American  friends  understand  that  we  need  coordinated  management  at  the  world  level,""  said  Mr  Gaymard.  |||    Thursday's  new  low  for  the  dollar  came  after  data  was  released  showing  year-on-year  sales  of  new  homes  in  the  US  had  fallen  12%  in  November  -  with  some  analysts  saying  this  could  indicate  problems  ahead  for  consumer  activity.  |||    Commerce  Department  data  also  showed  consumer  spending  -  which  drives  two  thirds  of  the  US  economy  -  grew  just  0.2%  last  month.  The  figure  was  weaker  than  forecast  -  and  fell  short  of  the  0.8%  rise  in  October.  The  official  US  policy  is  that  it  supports  a  strong  dollar  but  many  market  observers  believe  it  is  happy  to  let  the  dollar  fall  because  of  the  boost  to  its  exporters.  |||    The  US  government  has  faced  pressure  from  exporter  organisations  which  have  publicly  stated  the  currency  still  has  further  to  fall  from  ""abnormal  and  dangerous  heights""  set  in  2002.  The  US  says  it  will  let  market  forces  determine  the  dollar's  strength  rather  than  intervene  directly.  Statements  from  President  Bush  in  recent  weeks  highlighting  his  aim  to  cut  the  twin  US  deficits  have  prompted  slight  upturns  in  the  currency.  But  while  some  observers  said  the  quiet  trade  on  Thursday  had  exacerbated  small  moves  in  the  market,  most  agree  the  underlying  trend  remains  downwards.  The  dollar  has  now  fallen  for  a  third  consecutive  year  and  analysts  are  forecasting  a  further,  albeit  less  dramatic  weakening,  in  2005.  ""I  can  see  it  finishing  the  year  around  $1.35  and  we  can  see  that  it's  going  to  be  a  steady  track  upward  for  the  euro/dollar  in  2005,  finishing  the  year  around  $1.40,""  said  Adrian  Hughes,  currency  strategist  with  HSBC  in  London." 

2	"Blair  says  UK  tsunami  aid  to  soar  |||    Tony  Blair  has  predicted  the  British  Government  will  eventually  give  ""hundreds  of  millions""  of  pounds  in  aid  to  countries  hit  by  the  tsunami.  |||    The  prime  minister  was  speaking  publicly  for  the  first  time  since  returning  from  his  holiday  in  Egypt.  Mr  Blair  insisted  he  had  been  ""intimately  involved""  in  ""all  decisions  at  all  times""  despite  being  abroad.  He  was  speaking  before  the  UK  joins  a  three-minute  silence  at  noon  across  the  EU  for  the  estimated  150,000  dead.  |||    The  Foreign  Office  says  41  Britons  are  now  confirmed  to  have  died  in  the  Tsunami  which  struck  south  Asia  on  Boxing  Day,  with  158  others  missing.  Asked  about  criticism  that  he  did  not  cut  short  his  holiday,  Mr  Blair  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme:  ""I  don't  think  this  is  a  situation  in  which  the  British  people  need  me  to  articulate  what  they  feel.  |||    ""I  think  they  feel  -  as  we  all  do  -  shock,  horror,  and  absolute  solidarity  with  those  people  who  have  lost  their  lives.""  The  important  thing  was  action  and  not  words,  he  said,  adding  that  of  the  £50m  given  by  the  government  so  far  only  ""six  or  seven  million""  had  been  spent.  It  would  become  easier  in  the  coming  weeks  to  assess  just  how  much  money  would  have  to  be  put  in.  ""My  estimate  is  we  will  need  to  spend  from  government  several  hundred  million  pounds.  So  we  will  far  and  away  more  than  match  the  generosity  of  the  British  people,""  he  said.  Asked  whether  he  had  not  returned  to  work  immediately  because  he  was  under  doctors  orders  to  rest,  Mr  Blair  said  there  was  also  a  story  he  had  been  away  for  plastic  surgery.  ""As  you  can  see  unfortunately  I  am  still  looking  the  same  as  I  always  did,""  he  joked.  |||    The  prime  minister  took  personal  charge  of  the  UK's  response  on  Tuesday,  chairing  a  meeting  of  the  emergency  committee  of  ministers  that  has  convened  daily  since  Boxing  Day.  He  also  spoke  on  the  telephone  to  US  President  George  Bush,  and  the  presidents  of  Sri  Lanka  and  Indonesia.  Chancellor  Gordon  Brown  earlier  backed  a  plan  to  freeze  the  foreign  debts  of  all  the  affected  nations.  |||    Mr  Brown,  who  was  not  at  the  Downing  Street  meeting,  says  he  has  been  in  ""intensive  talks""  with  other  G8  finance  ministers.  Germany  proposed  a  freeze  last  week  and  Canada  has  begun  its  own  moratorium.  The  chancellor  said  the  plan  would  initially  save  the  most  affected  countries  about  $3bn  (£1.58bn)  in  repayments.  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  also  backed  the  proposals  but  said  ministers  had  been  ""playing  catch-up""  with  public  donations.  |||    Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw  is  to  visit  Thailand  and  Indonesia  this  week.  During  his  trip,  Mr  Straw  will  represent  the  G8  at  the  international  conference  called  in  Jakarta,  Indonesia  on  Thursday.  On  Friday,  he  will  visit  the  Thai  beach  resort  of  Phuket,  where  British  families  are  still  searching  for  relatives.  |||    International  Development  Secretary  Hilary  Benn  will  also  visit  Aceh  in  Indonesia,  as  well  as  Sri  Lanka.  The  British  public  has  now  pledged  £76m  in  aid  with  emergency  supplies  from  the  British  government  starting  to  arrive  in  the  region  on  three  RAF  flights  in  a  joint  operation  with  Scandinavian  countries.  Two  ships  -  the  Royal  Fleet  Auxiliary  ship  Diligence  and  frigate  HMS  Chatham  -  have  arrived  in  the  disaster  area.  A  second  Royal  Fleet  Auxiliary  vessel,  the  Bayleaf,  is  also  being  sent.  UK  charities  have  also  begun  chartering  planes  to  deliver  aid.  |||        -  A  BBC  News  Special:  Asia  Remembered,  including  the  three-minutes  silence,  will  be  shown  on  BBC  One  and  BBC  News  24  from  1130  to  1215  GMT  on  Wednesday." 

2	"Blair  pledges  unity  to  Labour  MPs  |||    Tony  Blair  has  sought  to  reassure  Labour  backbenchers  that  nothing  will  stand  in  the  way  of  the  party's  bid  for  a  third  term  in  power.  |||    Mr  Blair  was  speaking  to  MPs  amid  fresh  rumours  of  a  rift  with  Gordon  Brown.  A  new  book  says  the  prime  minister  went  back  on  a  pledge  to  Mr  Brown  to  stand  down  before  the  next  general  election.  The  chancellor  has  said  he  is  focused  on  winning  the  poll  and  is  due  to  join  election  supremo  Alan  Milburn  for  a  Labour  poster  launch  this  week.  Mr  Blair  told  the  Parliamentary  Labour  Party  (PLP)  on  Monday:  ""I  know  from  everyone  here,  in  Cabinet  and  government,  nothing  is  going  to  get  in  the  way  of  a  unified  Labour  Party  with  a  unified  position  and  winning  the  third  term  people  desperately  need.""  The  prime  minister  and  his  chancellor  arrived  within  seconds  of  each  other  and  seemingly  in  good  spirits  at  the  start  of  the  meeting  which  lasted  around  an  hour.  A  new  book,  Brown's  Britain  by  Sunday  Telegraph  journalist  Robert  Peston,  says  Mr  Blair  went  back  on  a  pledge  to  make  way  for  Mr  Brown  after  Cabinet  allies  intervened  in  June  2004.  |||    It  has  caused  a  new  wave  of  concern  among  Labour  MPs  gearing  up  to  defend  their  seats  in  an  election,  widely  expected  to  be  held  in  May,  and  several  members  are  understood  to  have  lined  up  to  express  their  discontent  at  the  PLP  meeting.  Health  Secretary  John  Reid  earlier  warned  that  Labour  members  would  not  easily  forgive  anybody  fuelling  damaging  speculation.  He  told  BBC  News:  ""Those  who  co-operate  or  inspire  these  books,  in  my  view,  have  to  know  that,  whatever  the  short-term  political  or  personal  advantage  that  they  think  they  might  secure,  they  always  do  it  by  damaging  the  record,  the  unity  and  the  re-election  chances  of  the  Labour  Party  and  the  government.""  Mr  Blair  on  Sunday  dismissed  claims  of  broken  promises,  saying:  ""I've  dealt  with  this  six  months  ago.  I  said  then  you  don't  do  deals  over  jobs  like  this  -  you  don't.""  |||    In  a  separate  BBC  interview,  Mr  Brown  said  he  and  the  prime  minister  would  not  be  distracted  by  ""gossip"".  ""It's  very  important  that  we  all  do  what  we  can  in  a  unified  way  to  ensure  the  election  of  a  Labour  government,""  he  said.  |||    On  Monday,  Mr  Blair's  spokesman  said:  ""The  prime  minister  is  determined  that  he  will  get  on  with  the  business  of  government  because  he  believes  that  what  people  want.""  Mr  Brown  says  he  discussed  the  election  campaign  with  Mr  Blair  on  Saturday  and  promised  to  play  his  part.  |||    Mr  Peston  said  the  pair  had  ""mutual  animosity  and  contempt"".  Mr  Blair  had  decided  in  November  2003  he  would  quit  because  he  felt  he  had  lost  voters'  trust  because  of  the  Iraq  war.  |||    He  had  then  changed  his  mind  in  June  2004,  following  intervention  from  Cabinet  allies  and  suspicion  that  the  chancellor  was  manoeuvring  against  him.  Mr  Brown  allegedly  said  he  could  no  longer  believe  anything  Mr  Blair  told  him.  Conservative  co-chairman  Liam  Fox  likened  the  two  men  to  ""self-obsessed  schoolboys"".  Liberal  Democrat  parliamentary  chairman  Matthew  Taylor  said  their  personal  ambition  was  ""getting  in  the  way  of  good  government"".  Ex-Labour  leader  Neil  Kinnock  said  Mr  Blair  and  Mr  Brown  could  only  deal  with  the  media  frenzy  by  continuing  to  say  they  would  not  allow  a  row  to  damage  Labour  or  British  interests.  He  told  BBC  Radio  Five  Live  that  Mr  Brown  would  never  encourage  any  kind  of  insurrection  or  coup." 

1	"Actor  Scott  is  new  Bond  favourite  |||    Bookmaker  William  Hill  has  stopped  taking  bets  on  who  will  be  the  next  James  Bond,  following  a  succession  of  large  wagers  on  actor  Dougray  Scott.  |||    The  firm  closed  the  book  on  Friday,  saying  ""insider  information""  could  have  contributed  to  the  number  of  bets.  ""In  the  past  gambles  like  this  have  often  been  right,""  William  Hill  spokesman  Rupert  Adams  said.  The  closing  list  gave  Scott  odds  of  6-9,  followed  by  Oscar  nominee  Clive  Owen  at  5-2.  Scott  first  found  fame  in  the  TV  series  Soldier  Soldier  and  has  since  then  starred  in  such  films  as  Mission  Impossible  II  and  the  wartime  drama  Enigma.  |||    Mr  Adams  said  one  punter  had  placed  a  bet  of  £870  on  the  39-year-old  actor  at  odds  of  8-1.  ""She  told  us  she  had  some  inside  information,  perhaps  she  knew  he  had  been  to  a  casting,  but  she  wouldn't  say,""  he  said.  Others  thought  to  be  in  the  running  include  Star  Wars  actor  Ewan  McGregor  and  Australian  star  Hugh  Jackman,  both  of  whom  have  odds  of  4-1.  Colin  Farrell,  Jude  Law  and  Troy  star  Eric  Bana  have  also  been  tipped  for  the  role  in  the  past.  |||    A  large  number  of  bets  on  actor  Colin  Salmon  to  become  the  first  black  James  Bond  were  dismissed  as  a  publicity  stunt  a  month  ago.  The  next  Bond  film,  originally  due  for  release  in  2005,  has  been  delayed  until  2006  due  to  Sony's  takeover  of  the  MGM  studio.  The  most  recent,  Die  Another  Day,  was  released  in  late  2002  and  saw  Pierce  Brosnan  make  his  final  appearance  as  the  secret  agent.  The  actor  was  originally  due  to  make  a  fifth  appearance  as  Bond,  but  was  released  from  his  contract  in  2004." 

2	"No  to  Royal  succession  shake-up  |||    A  Labour  peer  has  withdrawn  proposals  to  give  female  members  of  the  Royal  Family  the  same  rights  as  males.  |||    The  legislation  would  have  ended  the  right  of  male  heirs  with  older  sisters  to  succeed  to  the  Crown.  It  would  also  have  torn  up  ancient  legislation  banning  heirs  to  the  throne  marrying  Roman  Catholics.  But  the  government  refused  to  back  Lord  Dubs'  Succession  to  the  Crown  Bill,  saying  it  was  too  complex  and  raised  too  many  constitutional  issues.  |||    The  Lord  Chancellor,  Lord  Falconer,  agreed  the  1701  Act  of  Settlement,  which  governs  the  succession,  was  discriminatory  but  added  that  ""for  all  practical  purposes  its  effects  are  limited"".  |||    The  changes  proposed  by  Lord  Dubs  were  a  ""complex  and  controversial  undertaking  raising  major  constitutional  issues"",  he  said.  Lord  Falconer  said  there  were  22  members  of  the  Royal  Family  in  the  line  of  succession  after  the  Prince  of  Wales  -  all  of  who  were  eligible  to  succeed  and  had  been  unaffected  by  the  act.  ""It  is  not  a  simple  matter  that  can  be  tinkered  with  lightly.  While  we  wish  to  remove  all  forms  of  discrimination...  this  isn't  the  proper  form,""  he  added.  |||    He  did  not  rule  out  change  in  the  future  but  said  if  Lord  Dubs'  private  member's  bill  was  passed  by  peers,  he  would  urge  MPs  to  oppose  it  in  the  Commons.  Lord  Dubs  agreed  to  withdraw  his  bill  after  its  second  reading  in  the  House  of  Lords,  but  urged  the  government  to  think  again  at  a  later  stage.  ""We  cannot  forever  say  we  don't  want  to  change  things  because  it  is  too  difficult,""  he  told  peers.  During  the  debate,  the  Labour  peer  and  former  minister  said:  ""The  monarchy  should  symbolise  the  values  of  this  country.  ""What  we  don't  want  is  a  situation  where  the  values  of  the  country  have  moved  on  and  the  monarchy  is  centuries  behind  the  times.  ""We  are  surely  all  opposed  to  discrimination  on  the  grounds  of  gender  and  we  are  surely  also  opposed  to  discrimination  against  Catholics.""  But  opponents  of  the  bill,  including  Tory  Lord  Campbell  of  Alloway  and  the  Bishop  of  Winchester,  the  Rt  Rev  Michael  Scott-Joynt,  said  it  would  separate  the  state  from  both  the  Church  of  England  and  the  Christian  faith.  Such  a  ""secular""  state  would  be  markedly  ""less  tolerant"",  Rt  Rev  Scott-Joynt  argued."

0	"Egypt  and  Israel  seal  trade  deal  |||    In  a  sign  of  a  thaw  in  relations  between  Egypt  and  Israel,  the  two  countries  have  signed  a  trade  protocol  with  the  US,  allowing  Egyptian  goods  made  in  partnership  with  Israeli  firms  free  access  to  American  markets.  |||    The  protocol,  signed  in  Cairo,  will  establish  what  are  called  ""qualified  industrial  zones""  in  Egypt.  Products  from  these  zones  will  enjoy  duty  free  access  to  the  US,  provided  that  35%  of  their  components  are  the  product  of  Israeli-Egyptian  cooperation.  The  US  describes  this  as  the  most  important  economic  agreement  between  Egypt  and  Israel  in  two  decades.  |||    The  protocol  establishing  the  zones  has  been  stalled  for  years.  There  has  been  deep  sensitivity  in  Egypt  about  any  form  of  co-operation  with  Israel  as  long  as  its  peace  process  with  the  Palestinians  remains  blocked.  But  in  recent  weeks  an  unusual  warmth  has  crept  into  relations  between  the  two  countries.  Both  exchanged  prisoners  earlier  this  month,  with  Egypt  handing  back  an  Israeli  who  has  served  eight  years  in  prison  after  being  convicted  for  spying.  |||    Egyptian  President  Hosni  Mubarak  has  described  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  as  the  best  chance  for  the  Palestinians  to  achieve  peace.  The  government  in  Cairo  now  believes  Mr  Sharon  is  moving  towards  the  centre  and  away  from  the  positions  of  right  wing  groups.  It  also  believes  the  US,  pressed  by  Europe,  is  now  more  willing  to  engage  seriously  in  the  search  for  a  settlement.  But  there  are  also  pressing  economic  reasons  for  Egypt's  decision  to  enter  into  the  trade  agreement.  It  will  give  a  huge  boost  to  Egyptian  textile  exports,  which  are  about  to  suffer  a  drop  after  new  regulations  come  into  force  in  the  US  at  the  beginning  of  the  year." 

0	"'Golden  economic  period'  to  end  |||    Ten  years  of  ""golden""  economic  performance  may  come  to  an  end  in  2005  with  growth  slowing  markedly,  City  consultancy  Deloitte  has  warned.  |||    The  UK  economy  could  suffer  a  backlash  from  the  slowdown  in  the  housing  market,  triggering  a  fall  in  consumer  spending  and  a  rise  in  unemployment.  Deloitte  is  forecasting  economic  growth  of  2%  this  year,  below  Chancellor  Gordon  Brown's  forecast  of  3%  to  3.5%.  It  also  believes  that  interest  rates  will  fall  to  4%  by  the  end  of  the  year.  |||    In  its  quarterly  economic  review,  Deloitte  said  the  UK  economy  had  enjoyed  a  ""golden  period""  during  the  past  decade  with  unemployment  falling  to  a  near  30  year  low  and  inflation  at  its  lowest  since  the  1960s.  |||    But  it  warned  that  this  growth  had  been  achieved  at  the  expense  of  creating  major  ""imbalances""  in  the  economy.  Deloitte's  chief  economic  advisor  Roger  Bootle  said:  ""The  biggest  hit  of  all  is  set  to  come  from  the  housing  market  which  has  already  embarked  on  a  major  slowdown.  ""Whereas  the  main  driver  of  the  economy  in  recent  years  has  been  robust  household  spending  growth,  this  is  likely  to  suffer  as  the  housing  market  slowdown  gathers  pace.""  |||    Economic  growth  is  likely  to  be  constrained  during  the  next  few  years  by  increased  pressure  on  household  budgets  and  rising  taxes,  Deloitte  believes.  Gordon  Brown  will  need  to  raise  about  $10bn  a  year  in  order  to  sustain  the  public  finances  in  the  short  term,  the  firm  claims.  This  will  result  in  a  marked  slowdown  in  growth  in  2005  and  2006  compared  to  last  year,  when  the  economy  expanded  by  3.25%.  However,  Deloitte  stressed  that  the  slowdown  was  unlikely  to  have  any  major  impact  on  retail  prices  while  it  expected  the  Bank  of  England  to  respond  quickly  to  signs  of  the  economy  faltering.  It  expects  a  series  of  ""aggressive""  interest  rate  cuts  over  the  next  two  years,  with  the  cost  of  borrowing  falling  from  its  current  4.75%  mark  to  3.5%  by  the  end  of  2006.  ""Although  2005  may  not  be  the  year  when  things  go  completely  wrong,  it  will  probably  mark  the  start  of  a  more  difficult  period  for  the  UK  economy,""  Mr  Bootle."

Meanwhile,  Asian  carmakers  fared  well  -  Toyota  sales  jumped  11%  while  rival  Nissan  notched  up  a  10%  increase.  Overall.  sales  across  the  industry  also  fell  to  1.25  million  vehicles  from  1.27  million  a  year  earlier.  |||    GM  and  Ford  blamed  high  fuel  prices  for  low  sales  of  big  trucks  and  gas-guzzling  sports  utility  vehicles  (SUVs)  -  the  vehicles  that  provide  the  biggest  profits.  |||    GM  added  that  US  truck  sales  fell  9%  in  February  while  car  business  tumbled  17%,  however  it  did  acknowledge  that  some  new  products  -  such  as  the  Pontiac  G6  and  Chevrolet  Cobalt  -  had  put  in  solid  performances.  ""The  calendar  year  is  starting  off  slower  than  expected,  both  for  GM  and  the  industry,""  said  Mark  LaNeve,  GM's  vice  president  for  North  American  sales,  service  and  marketing.  The  slump  in  sales  prompted  the  group  to  cut  production  in  North  America  by  3%  -  it  has  already  reduced  output  by  around  9%  in  the  face  of  growing  stockpiles.  Meanwhile,  Ford  which  posted  its  ninth  consecutive  drop  in  monthly  US  sales,  said  it  was  cutting  first-quarter  North  American  production  by  another  10,000  vehicles,  or  1.2%.  Chrysler,  the  US  unit  of  Germany's  DaimlerChrysler,  was  the  only  Detroit  based  automaker  to  boast  an  increase  in  market  share  during  the  month  -  with  sales  rising  8%.  |||    But  America's  loss  was  its  foreign  rivals'  gain  as  they  continued  to  nibble  away  at  the  US  market.  While  Japan's  top  car  maker  Toyota  and  Nissan  saw  sales  accelerate,  even  the  smaller  Suzuki  Motor  Corp  snapped  up  a  more  business  with  sales  improving  17.6%  on  a  year  ago.  In  2003,  the  firm  launched  an  ambitious  plan  to  triple  US  sales  by  2007  as  it  seeks  to  become  a  bigger  player  in  the  Asian  assault  on  the  US  market.  Korea's  Hyundai  was  another  big  gainer,  turning  in  a  19%  surge  in  February  sales.  Toyota  put  its  rise  in  sales  down  to  strong  results  for  its  redesigned  Avalon  sedan  and  a  120%  surge  in  sales  of  its  gas-electric  Prius  hybrid  mid-size  sedan  as  petrol-price  conscious  consumers  looked  to  vehicles  that  were  cheaper  to  run.  ""As  gas  prices  continue  their  upward  march,  fuel  efficiency  catches  the  public  eye,""  Jim  Press,  vice  president  and  chief  operating  officer  of  Toyota's  US  sales  arm,  said  in  a  statement."

In  1997  a  debate  between  Mr  Blair  and  John  Major  was  also  cancelled  when  a  format  could  not  be  agreed.

0	"Troubled  Marsh  under  SEC  scrutiny  |||    The  US  stock  market  regulator  is  investigating  troubled  insurance  broker  Marsh  &  McLennan's  shareholder  transactions,  the  firm  has  said.  |||    The  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  has  asked  for  information  about  transactions  involving  holders  of  5%  or  more  of  the  firm's  shares.  Marsh  has  said  it  is  co-operating  fully  with  the  SEC  investigation.  Marsh  is  also  the  focus  of  an  inquiry  the  New  York  attorney-general  into  whether  insurers  rigged  the  market.  Since  that  inquiry  was  launched  in  October,  Marsh  has  replaced  its  chief  executive  and  held  a  boardroom  shake-out  to  meet  criticism  by  lessening  the  number  of  company  executives  on  the  board.  Prosecutors  allege  that  Marsh  -  the  world's  biggest  insurance  broker  -  and  other  US  insurance  firms  may  have  fixed  bids  for  corporate  cover.  This  is  the  issue  at  the  heart  of  the  inquiry  by  New  York's  top  law  officer,  Eliot  Spitzer,  and  a  separate  prosecution  of  five  insurers  by  the  State  of  California.  The  SEC's  investigation  into  so-called  related  party  transactions  includes  dealings  in  the  Trident  Funds,  managed  by  MMC  Capital,  the  company's  private  equity  firm.  Marsh's  new  chief  executive,  Michael  Cherkasky,  is  trying  to  negotiate  a  settlement  with  Mr  Spitzer.  Mr  Spitzer  has  built  up  a  reputation  as  a  fierce  critic  and  campaigner  against  corporate  America's  misdeeds.  |||    The  uncertainty  unleashed  by  the  scandal  has  prompted  three  credit  rating  agencies  -  Standard  &  Poor's,  Moody's  and  Fitch  -  to  downgrade  Marsh  in  recent  weeks.  According  to  the  Financial  Times,  insurance  analysts  are  now  questioning  whether  Marsh  will  be  able  to  maintain  its  strong  record  of  earning  growth  as  they  draw  up  forecasts  for  the  first  quarter  of  next  year.  Doubts  also  exist  over  how  much  the  company  may  have  to  pay  regulators  and  lawyers  to  put  the  scandal  behind." 

0	"AstraZeneca  hit  by  drug  failure  |||    Shares  in  Anglo-Swedish  drug  have  closed  down  8%  in  UK  trade  after  the  failure  of  its  Iressa  drug  in  a  major  clinical  trial.  |||    The  lung  cancer  drug  did  not  significantly  prolong  survival  in  patients  with  the  disease.  This  setback  for  the  group  follows  the  rejection  by  the  US  in  October  of  its  anti-coagulant  pill  Exanta.  Meanwhile,  another  of  its  major  money  spinners  -  cholesterol  drug  Crestor  -  is  facing  mounting  safety  concerns.  ""This  would  be  two  of  the  three  blockbuster  drugs  that  were  meant  to  power  the  company  forward  failing...  and  we've  got  risks  on  Crestor,""  said  Nick  Turner,  analyst  at  brokers  Jefferies.  |||    AstraZeneca  had  hoped  to  pitch  its  Iressa  drug  against  rival  medicine  Tarceva.  But  Iressa  proved  no  better  than  a  placebo  in  extending  lives  in  the  trial  involving  1,692  patients.  Tarceva  -  made  by  OSI  Pharmaceuticals,  Genentech  and  Roche  -  has  already  proved  to  be  successful  in  helping  prolong  the  life  of  lung  cancer  patients.  AztraZeneca  has  now  appointed  a  new  executive  director  to  the  board.  John  Patterson  will  be  in  charge  of  drug  development.  The  company  said  Mr  Patterson  would  make  ""substantial  changes  to  the  clinical  organisation  and  its  processes"".  ""I  am  determined  to  improve  our  development  and  regulatory  performance,  restore  confidence  in  the  company  and  value  to  shareholders,""  said  chief  executive  Tom  McKillop." 

1	"BBC  to  pour  £9m  into  new  comedy  |||    The  BBC  is  to  invest  £9m  in  developing  new  comedy  and  entertainment  programmes  outside  London.  |||    The  changes  come  as  part  of  a  shake-up  of  several  departments  to  create  shows  that  appeal  to  a  wider  range  of  people.  Changes  are  also  being  made  to  teams  in  the  factual  and  daytime  departments  outside  London.  Director  of  television  Jana  Bennett  said  the  changes  were  about  ""getting  the  best  ideas  on  screen  as  efficiently  and  effectively  as  we  can"".  ""The  new  structure  in  each  genre  is  designed  to  ensure  that  happens,""  she  said.  |||    A  number  of  new  roles  are  being  created  in  each  department,  including  a  head  of  comedy  commissioning  based  in  Glasgow.  The  new  person  will  be  in  charge  of  the  £9m  budget  and  their  role  will  be  to  develop  shows  outside  the  capital,  both  within  the  BBC  and  with  independent  production  companies.  Jane  Lush,  controller  of  entertainment  commissioning,  said,  ""Entertainment  and  comedy  are  incredibly  important  to  our  audiences;  I'm  confident  these  changes  will  help  us  get  the  very  best  programmes  on  screen.""  Similar  positions  will  also  be  created  in  the  other  departments,  with  the  new  commissioning  editor  for  documentaries  based  in  Bristol  and  the  daytime  commissioning  editor  in  Birmingham.  Ms  Bennett  said  the  new  roles  would  benefit  those  making  programmes  within  the  BBC  as  well  as  those  making  shows  for  the  channel  independently.  ""A  strong  independent  sector  and  a  flourishing  in-house  production  base  are  not  mutually  exclusive  and  will  stimulate  the  competition  that  will  deliver  the  best  ideas  to  the  audience,""  she  said."

Argentina  defaulted  on  its  debt  three  years  ago,  the  biggest  sovereign  default  in  modern  history.  Yesterday  Argentina's  economy  minister,  Roberto  Lavagna,  said  that  he  estimated  that  the  results  of  the  restructuring  would  be  ready  around  next  Thursday  (3  March).  Argentina's  President,  Nestor  Kirchner,  said  on  Friday:  ""A  year  ago  when  we  started  the  swap  (negotiations),  they  told  us  we  were  crazy,  that  we  were  irrational.""  But  he  added  that  his  government  was  close  to  achieving:  ""The  best  debt  renegotiation  in  history.""  The  country  has  been  in  default  on  the  $102.6bn  -  based  on  an  original  debt  of  $81.8bn  plus  interest  -  for  the  past  three  years.  If  the  offer  does  not  go  ahead,  international  lawsuits  on  behalf  of  aggrieved  investors  could  follow  but  analysts  are  optimistic  that  it  will  go  through,  despite  the  tough  terms  for  bondholders.  About  70%  to  80%  of  bondholders  are  expected  to  accept  the  terms  of  the  offer.  By  18  February,  creditors  holding  $41bn  -  or  40%  of  the  total  debt  -  had  accepted  the  offer.  Sorting  out  its  debt  would  enhance  the  country's  credibility  on  international  markets  and  enable  it  to  attract  more  foreign  investment.  Of  Argentina's  bondholders,  38.4%  reside  in  Argentina,  15.6%  in  Italy,  10.3%  in  Switzerland,  9.1%  in  the  United  States,  5.1%  in  Germany  and  3.1%  in  Japan.  Investors  in  the  UK,  Holland  and  Luxembourg  have  about  1%  each  and  the  remainder  were  not  broken  down  by  country.  The  deal  is  likely  to  be  taken  up  most  enthusiastically  by  domestic  investors,  who  will  benefit  if  Argentina's  economy  becomes  more  stable."

The  court  in  Washington  found  the  case  -  filed  by  the  Clinton  administration  in  1999  -  could  not  be  brought  under  federal  anti-racketeering  laws.  Anti-smoking  groups  urge  the  government  to  fight  on,  but  the  Justice  Department  has  not  said  if  it  will  appeal.  Among  the  accused  were  Altria  Group,  RJ  Reynolds  Tobacco,  Lorillard  Tobacco,  Liggett  Group  and  Brown  and  Williamson.  They  were  delighted  by  the  decision,  which  sent  Reynolds  shares  up  4.5%  and  Altria  shares  up  5.11%.  |||    Charles  A  Blixt,  executive  vice-president  of  RJ  Reynolds  Tobacco,  said  the  ruling  ""dramatically  transforms""  the  government's  lawsuit.  Altria  Group  said,  in  a  statement,  the  government  now  ""must  not  only  prove  that  the  companies  have  engaged  in  fraudulent  behaviour  in  the  past,  but  that  they  are  likely  to  do  so  in  the  future.""  |||    The  government  had  claimed  tobacco  firms  |||        -  manipulated  nicotine  levels  to  increase  addiction      -  targeted  teenagers  with  multi-billion  dollar  advertising  campaigns      -  lied  about  the  dangers  of  smoking  and  ignored  research  to  the  contrary.        |||    Prosecutors  wanted  the  cigarette  firms  to  ""disgorge""  $280bn  in  profits  accumulated  over  the  past  50  years  and  impose  tougher  rules  on  marketing  their  products.  They  brought  the  case  under  racketeering  laws,  which  were  passed  to  deny  mafia  gangs  the  profits  of  their  crimes.  But  the  tobacco  companies  denied  that  they  illegally  conspired  to  promote  smoking  and  defraud  the  public.  They  also  said  they  had  already  met  many  of  the  government's  demands  in  a  landmark  $206bn  settlement  reached  with  46  states  in  1998.  The  three-judge  panel  in  the  District  of  Columbia's  Court  of  Appeals  ruled  on  Friday  that  the  US  government  could  not  sue  the  firms  under  the  anti-racketeering  laws.  Judge  David  Sentelle,  in  his  ruling,  said  such  laws  were  aimed  at  putting  an  end  to  illegal  conduct  going  forward.  ""We  hold  that  the  language  of  (the  law)  and  the  comprehensive  remedial  scheme  of  (the  law)  preclude  disgorgement  as  a  possible  remedy  in  this  case,""  he  wrote.  The  Justice  Department  refused  to  say  if  it  would  appeal.  ""All  we're  saying  today  is  that  we  have  received  the  ruling  and  are  reviewing  it,""  a  spokeswoman  said  on  Friday.  But  William  Corr  of  the  Campaign  for  Tobacco-Free  Kids  urged  the  government  to  continue  pressing  its  case.  ""Today's  ruling  should  not  be  an  excuse  for  this  administration  to  seek  a  weak  settlement  that  lets  the  tobacco  industry  off  the  hook,""  he  said." 

1	"Pete  Doherty  misses  bail  deadline  |||    Singer  Pete  Doherty  will  have  to  spend  the  weekend  in  jail  because  he  could  not  come  up  with  £150,000  bond  money  for  his  bail  on  time.  |||    The  former  Libertines  singer  had  been  granted  bail  with  curfew  restrictions  at  Highbury  Corner  Magistrates  Court  on  charges  of  robbery  and  blackmail.  But  his  lawyer  said  the  money  could  not  be  raised  on  time.  Mr  Doherty,  25,  was  arrested  following  an  alleged  incident  in  a  London  hotel  on  Wednesday  evening.  Musician  Alan  Wass,  23,  also  of  north  London,  appeared  in  court  accused  of  the  same  offences.  |||    Magistrates  imposed  a  range  of  bail  conditions  on  Mr  Doherty  including  a  curfew  between  2200  and  0700,  except  when  he  attends  a  drug  rehabilitation  centre.  He  was  told  he  would  not  be  able  to  leave  his  home  without  being  accompanied  by  a  security  firm.  He  must  also  surrender  his  passport  and  report  daily  to  a  local  police  station.  Mr  Wass  was  also  given  a  curfew  and  told  to  surrender  his  passport.  Mr  Doherty  left  The  Libertines  at  the  end  of  June  2004,  but  continued  performing  with  his  band  Babyshambles.  The  singer,  who  has  been  linked  to  supermodel  Kate  Moss,  was  arrested  after  police  were  called  to  the  Islington  hotel  in  response  to  claims  that  a  man  had  been  assaulted.  A  man  in  his  30s  was  later  taken  to  University  College  Hospital,  London,  with  facial  injuries,  before  being  discharged.  A  lawyer  representing  Mr  Doherty  and  Mr  Wass  said  outside  court  the  pair  strenuously  denied  the  charges."

The  winner  will  work  in  partnership  with  the  Iraqi  Telecommunications  and  Post  Company  (ITPC).  The  firms  will  install  and  operate  a  fixed  phone  network,  providing  voice,  fax  and  internet  services.  |||    The  ministry  said  that  it  wanted  to  increase  Iraq's  ""very  low  telephone  service  penetration  rate  from  about  4.5%  today  to  about  25%  within  10  years.""  It  also  hopes  to  develop  a  ""highly  visible  and  changeable  telecommunication  sector"".  Details  of  the  bidding  and  tender  process  will  be  published  on  the  ministry's  website  on  9  February.  It  also  is  planning  a  road-show  for  investors  in  Amman,  Jordan.

3	"Calder  fears  for  Scottish  rugby  |||    Former  Scotland  international  Finlay  Calder  fears  civil  war  at  the  SRU  could  seriously  hamper  his  country's  RBS  Six  Nations  campaign.  |||    Four  members  of  the  executive  board,  including  the  chairman,  David  Mackay,  have  resigned  after  a  simmering  row.  And  Calder  said:  ""This  is  terrible  news  for  every  level  of  Scottish  rugby.  ""David  is  a  successful  businessman  and  I  thought  that  if  anybody  could  transform  the  negative  atmosphere  and  rising  debt  level,  it  was  him.""  Mackay's  executive  board  has  been  in  a  power  struggle  with  the  general  committee,  which  contains  members  elected  by  Scotland's  club  sides.  ""He  has  been  driven  out  by  people  who  seem  happier  waging  civil  war  than  addressing  the  central  issue  that  professional  rugby  can't  be  run  by  amateurs,""  said  Calder.  |||    ""In  fact,  I  don't  understand  why  we  are  still  having  this  argument  10  years  after  professionalism  arrived.  ""But  I  don't  believe  the  rest  of  the  SRU  will  take  this  lying  down.  ""I  think  the  banks  will  be  dismayed  at  this  decision  and,  ultimately,  it  is  them  who  pull  the  strings.  ""So  I  wouldn't  be  surprised  if  they  reviewed  their  position.  But,  in  the  wider  picture,  what  message  does  this  send  out?""  He  thought  the  work  of  Scotland's  coaches,  who  have  been  attempting  to  arrest  the  decline  of  the  national  side,  would  be  made  much  more  difficult.  ""Matt  Williams  and  Willie  Anderson  must  be  wondering,  'what  have  we  walked  into  here?'""  said  Calder.  ""And  we  can  now  expect  weeks  of  arguments  and  acrimony  just  at  a  time  when  we  should  be  looking  forward  to  the  Six  Nations  Championship.

1	"TV  show  unites  Angolan  families  |||    Angolan  families  who  are  attempting  to  track  each  other  down,  after  being  separated  by  nearly  30  years  of  war,  are  succeeding  thanks  to  a  hugely  popular  TV  show.  |||    Meeting  Point  has  become  one  of  TV  Angola's  most  watched  programmes,  and  has  reunited  hundreds  of  families.  It  runs  daily,  not  only  on  the  television  but  also  on  the  radio.  Every  Friday,  hundreds  of  people  gather  in  Luanda's  Independence  Square  to  record  a  message  in  front  of  the  TV  cameras,  in  the  hope  that  a  lost  relative  will  see  it.  Many  relatives  have  been  reunited  on  air.  ""At  the  beginning  there  was  an  absolute  explosion  -  huge,  huge  crowds,""  Sergio  Gera,  the  programme's  chief  co-ordinator,  told  BBC  World  Service's  Assignment  programme.  ""Now  things  are  a  little  calmer,  there  are  slightly  less  people  -  but,  after  two  and  a  half  years  of  broadcasting,  there  are  still  a  lot  of  people  going.""  |||    The  media  in  the  southern  African  country,  twice  the  size  of  France,  has  been  gripped  by  the  quest  of  so  many  people  to  find  their  relatives.  Hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  died  in  Angola's  30-year  civil  war,  which  finally  ended  in  2002,  and  tens  of  thousands  of  people  are  still  missing.  Many  have  not  heard  anything  for  10  or  more  years  -  in  all,  90%  of  Angolan  families  have  lost  someone.  |||    The  idea  of  recording  in  Independence  Square  was  modelled  on  a  square  in  the  Argentine  capital  Buenos  Aries,  where  mothers  go  to  talk  about  the  dead  and  the  missing,  and  to  exchange  news.  One  woman,  Victoria  Lapete,  found  her  sister  -  the  only  remaining  member  of  her  family  -  in  Independence  Square  live  on  Meeting  Point.  She  had  not  seen  her  sibling  for  28  years.  ""When  we  saw  each  other,  we  threw  ourselves  into  each  other's  arms,""  she  told  Assignment.  ""We  started  to  cry.  I  felt  very,  very  happy,  because  I'd  spent  so  long  without  any  family.  Suddenly  I  had  a  sister  again.""  However,  Angola  is  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in  Africa,  and  the  number  of  people  with  access  to  either  a  television  or  radio  is  comparatively  few.  This  means  that  elsewhere  in  the  country,  the  task  of  reuniting  families  lies  primarily  with  the  International  Committee  of  the  Red  Cross  (ICRC).  In  the  city  of  Wambo,  the  ICRC  runs  the  Gazetta  -  a  200-page,  tabloid-size  book  which  contains  13,000  names  of  missing  or  displaced.  |||    Their  task  is  made  much  harder  by  the  huge  number  of  landmines  dotted  around  the  country.  ""It's  very  difficult  -  there  are  many  displaced,""  stated  Joaquim  Sahundi,  head  of  tracing  in  Wambo.  |||    ""As  they  try  to  go  back  [home],  others  are  trying  to  relocate  their  relatives.  Many  people  are  getting  injured  because  of  that  -  in  the  villages,  in  the  bush,  there  has  been  no  clearance  of  mines.  ""When  people  are  crossing  these  areas,  they  step  on  mines.""  The  ICRC  also  uses  the  media  where  it  can,  running  four  daily  broadcasts  of  their  lists  of  the  missing  on  Radio  Angola.  Meanwhile,  there  remain  massive  challenges  to  Angolan  families  even  once  they  are  reunited.  ""The  programme  of  family  reunification  is  extremely  important,  but  for  these  families  to  remain  reunified,  there  has  to  be  social  integration,  job  access,  education,  healthcare,""  said  Rafael  Marques  of  the  pro-democracy  George  Soros  Foundation  for  Southern  Africa.  ""Essentially  the  government  is  waiting  for  the  international  community  to  pay  for  the  reconstruction  -  that's  why  it  has  been  persistently  calling  for  a  donor's  conference.  That  is  just  a  way  of  detaching  itself  from  its  political  responsibilities.""" 

0	"Tsunami  slows  Sri  Lanka's  growth  |||    Sri  Lanka's  president  has  launched  a  reconstruction  drive  worth  $3.5bn  (£1.8bn)  by  appealing  for  peace  and  national  unity.  |||    President  Kumaratunga  said  it  was  now  important  to  find  a  peaceful  solution  to  years  of  internal  conflict.  Meanwhile,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  said  damage  from  the  tsunami  would  cut  one  percentage  point  from  Sri  Lanka's  economic  growth  this  year.  It  estimated  the  wave  left  physical  damage  equal  to  6.5%  of  the  economy.  |||    Separately,  the  International  Labour  Organisation  (ILO)  said  that  at  least  one  million  people  have  lost  their  livelihoods  in  Sri  Lanka  and  Indonesia  alone.  It  called  for  action  to  create  jobs.  President  Kumaratunga  attended  a  ceremony  in  the  southern  town  of  Hambantota.  She  was  joined  by  government  and  opposition  politicians,  together  with  Buddhist,  Hindu,  Muslim  and  Christian  clergy.  |||    Prime  Minister  Mahinda  Rajapakse  laid  the  foundation  stone  on  a  new  housing  project  intended  to  provide  6,000  homes  for  survivors  of  the  tsunami.  Mrs  Kumaratunga  called  for  the  tragedy  to  be  ""the  start  of  a  new  beginning  to  rebuild  our  nation"".  ""We  are  a  country  blessed  with  so  many  natural  resources  and  we  have  not  made  use  of  them  fully.  Instead  we  have  been  squabbling,  fighting,""  she  added.  Norway's  peace  negotiator  Erik  Solheim  is  due  to  arrive  on  Wednesday  to  try  to  revive  peace  talks  in  the  decades-long  conflict  between  government  forces  and  the  Tamil  Tigers,  who  want  a  separate  state  in  the  north  east  of  the  country.  Reconstruction  efforts  in  eastern  Sri  Lanka  have  been  hampered  by  tensions  between  the  two  sides.  |||    The  IMF  said  that  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities'  initial  estimates  have  put  the  physical  damage  at  $1.3  to  $1.5bn,  but  added  that  the  implications  for  the  economy  were  much  wider  than  this.  ""The  broader  macroeconomic  impact  will  clearly  be  substantial  but  the  details  are  difficult  to  assess  at  this  early  stage,""  the  IMF  said.  Growth,  inflation,  the  balance  of  payments  and  foreign  exchange  reserves  are  all  expected  to  show  the  effects  of  lost  businesses  and  reconstruction  costs.  ""The  fishing  industry  has  been  devastated,  agricultural  production  may  be  affected  and  tourism  will  suffer,  especially  in  the  short  term,""  the  report  said.  The  ILO  estimated  that  400,000  Sri  Lankans  have  lost  their  jobs,  mostly  in  these  three  industries.  Earnings  from  tourism  this  year  are  expected  to  be  15%  lower  than  last  year.  Economic  growth  this  year  is  expected  to  be  4%,  which  is  about  1%  less  than  previously  forecast.  Inflation  could  climb  to  14%  compared  to  a  previous  estimate  of  12%.  Although  major  exports  have  not  suffered,  the  IMF  expects  the  reconstruction  effort  will  require  higher  imports  which  could  damage  the  balance  of  payments.  Foreign  exchange  reserves  may  become  strained  as  ""Sri  Lanka  will  be  hard  pressed  to  keep  international  reserves  at  the  pre-tsunami  level""  which  totalled  more  than  two  months  worth  of  imports.  Last  week,  the  IMF  approved  Sri  Lanka's  request  for  a  freeze  on  loan  repayments." 

2	"Could  rivalry  overshadow  election?  |||    Tony  Blair  and  Gordon  Brown  are  desperately  trying  to  stuff  the  genie  of  their  rivalry  back  into  the  bottle.  |||    Along  with  any  number  of  senior  cabinet  colleagues,  they  are  insisting  their  only  job  is  to  win  the  next  election  and  govern  in  the  best  interests  of  Britain.  It  is  a  message  they  are  aiming  directly  at  their  backbenchers  who  are  becoming  irritated  and  even  unnerved  by  the  continuing  claims  and  counter  claims  surrounding  this  alleged  rift.  Ian  Gibson,  for  example,  urged  the  two  men  to  stop  squabbling,  declaring:  ""For  goodness  sake,  sometimes  you  have  to  rise  above  petulance  and  make  sure  that  you  do  your  job  as  effectively  as  you  can.""  Those  with  slim  majorities  are  particularly  fearful  that  the  rift  could  hit  their  own  hopes  of  re-election.  Tony  Blair  will  seek  to  reassure  Labour  MPs  on  Monday  evening  at  their  first  meeting  of  the  new  year  at  Westminster  -  a  behind-closed  doors  meeting  which  Gordon  Brown  is  thought  likely  to  also  attend  to  show  unity.  |||    Meanwhile  the  likes  of  Health  Secretary  John  Reid  and  Labour  peer  Lord  Haskins  are  warning  of  the  electoral  dangers  of  allowing  this  soap  opera  to  continue.  And  they  have  both  warned  the  rival  camps  to  stop  spreading  the  poison.  Lord  Haskins  even  suggested  Mr  Blair  should  reinstate  Mr  Brown  as  the  central  figure  in  the  election  planning.  |||    But  this  particular  genie  is  unusually  reluctant  to  return  to  captivity  and  many  fear  it  is  simply  too  late  to  repair  the  damage.  They  believe  they  will  be  fighting  the  next  election  with  the  sounds  of  open  warfare  between  the  two  men  ringing  in  their  ears.  And  it  matters  little  whether  the  rift  is  real  or,  as  some  try  to  suggest,  simply  the  product  of  newspaper  headlines  and  Westminster  gossip.  Few  in  Westminster  actually  believe  that,  simply  because  the  evidence  appears  to  contradict  it.  |||    For  example,  the  weekend's  attempts  by  both  men  to  play  down  the  divisions  failed  to  do  the  trick.  Even  as  they  were  both  insisting  on  their  unity  of  purpose  and  claiming  they  would  not  be  swayed  by  newspaper  stories,  they  still  managed  to  stir  the  speculation  with  their  comments.  |||    Mr  Blair  talked  about  the  ""New""  Labour  manifesto  -  a  move  which  seemed  calculated  to  irritate  the  chancellor,  who  has  long  rejected  the  label.  And  Mr  Brown  pointedly  refused  to  deny  claims  the  prime  minister  had  reneged  on  a  deal  to  hand  him  the  premiership  last  year.  That  claim  was  repeated  in  Robert  Peston's  book,  a  book  which  amply  demonstrates  this  corrosive  Downing  Street  soap  opera  is  nowhere  near  its  final  act.  |||    For  his  part,  Mr  Brown  insists  his  only  motivation  was  to  get  Labour  re-elected.  |||    The  trouble  is,  both  men  have  fallen  short  of  offering  simple,  straightforward  denials  of  the  central  claims.  So  they  have  both  been  accused  of  actually  making  matters  worse  by  feeding  the  speculation  with  their  own  behaviour.  The  first  thing  to  be  said  is  that  these  suggestions  have  not  come  from  nowhere.  They  started  with  and  are  sustained  by  ""friends""  of  the  two  men.  One  only  had  to  listen  to  the  chancellor's  friend  and  former  spin  chief  Charlie  Whelan  last  week  to  understand  that  there  is  a  real  anger  from  this  camp  at  the  prime  minister's  apparent  attempts  to  confound  Mr  Brown's  leadership  ambitions.  But  it  is  not  just  public  pronouncements  from  ex-aides.  |||    There  are  whispered  briefings  to  selected  journalists  from  both  sides.  It  is  no  secret  in  Westminster,  for  example,  that  Downing  Street  believes  the  chancellor  is  indulging  in  a  mammoth  sulk  and  acting  in  a  petty  and  deliberately  provocative  manner.  |||    Then  there  are  the  actions  of  the  men  themselves.  Gordon  Brown  sets  out  what  is  seen  as  a  rival  manifesto  then  appears  to  embark  on  his  own  personal  campaign.  The  prime  minister  responds  by  scheduling  his  monthly  press  conference  to  clash  with  a  keynote  speech  by  the  chancellor.  Meanwhile  large  numbers  of  backbench  MPs  insist  voters  are  either  entirely  uninterested  in  the  chatter,  which  they  believe  is  a  media-only  obsession,  or  that  they  fear  for  the  efficient  running  of  a  government  beset  by  such  rivalry.  Either  way,  there  is  universal  agreement  that  if  this  goes  on  through  the  general  election  it  can  only  do  the  Labour  party  serious  damage.  There  are  signs  that  the  two  men  appreciate  the  dangers  and  both  want  to  put  a  lid  on  all  the  speculation.  But  with  probably  only  four  months  to  the  next  election,  that  looks  like  being  a  particularly  difficult  trick  to  pull  off." 

2	"Blair  says  mayor  should  apologise  |||    Tony  Blair  has  urged  London  mayor  Ken  Livingstone  to  apologise  for  his  ""Nazi""  comment  to  a  Jewish  reporter.  |||    Labour's  Mr  Livingstone,  who  says  he  is  ""standing  by""  his  remarks,  had  accused  an  Evening  Standard  journalist  of  being  like  a  ""concentration  camp  guard"".  Mr  Blair  told  Five's  Wright  Stuff  show:  ""Let's  just  apologise  and  move  on.""  Mr  Livingstone  has  said  the  remarks  may  have  been  offensive  but  were  not  racist,  and  said  he  would  not  apologise  even  if  the  prime  minister  asked.  |||    Mr  Blair,  who  was  instrumental  in  returning  Mr  Livingstone  to  the  Labour  Party,  insisted  on  Wednesday  it  was  time  for  the  London  mayor  to  say  sorry.  |||    ""A  lot  of  us  in  politics  get  angry  with  journalists  from  time  to  time,  but  in  the  circumstances,  and  to  the  journalist  because  he  was  a  Jewish  journalist,  yes,  he  should  apologise,""  he  said.  ""Let's  just  apologise  and  move  on  -  that's  the  sensible  thing.""  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard,  asked  about  Mr  Livingstone's  remark  by  reporters,  said  it  was  important  for  politicians  to  be  mindful  about  the  language  they  use.  ""It's  particularly  important  that  as  we  get  close  to  the  election  that  politicians  talk  with  civility  and  courtesy  about  issues  that  we  all  face,""  he  said.  ""I  think  it's  a  matter  of  sadness  that  we  are  not  seeing  that  from  the  Labour  Party.  We  had  what  Ken  Livingstone  said,  we  had  what  Alastair  Campbell  has  said  and  we  have  what  others  have  said.  I  think  that's  a  matter  of  great  regret.""  |||    The  row  blew  up  after  Mr  Livingstone  was  approached  by  Evening  Standard  reporter  Oliver  Finegold  following  a  party  marking  the  20th  anniversary  of  former  Culture  Secretary  Chris  Smith  coming  out  as  Britain's  first  gay  MP.  On  tape,  Mr  Livingstone,  who  once  worked  as  a  freelance  restaurant  critic  on  the  paper,  is  heard  asking  Mr  Finegold  if  he  is  a  ""German  war  criminal"".  |||    Mr  Finegold  replies:  ""No,  I'm  Jewish,  I  wasn't  a  German  war  criminal.  I'm  quite  offended  by  that.""  The  mayor  then  says:  ""Ah  right,  well  you  might  be,  but  actually  you  are  like  a  concentration  camp  guard,  you  are  just  doing  it  because  you  are  paid  to,  aren't  you?""  At  his  weekly  press  conference  on  Tuesday,  Mr  Livingstone  said  his  comments  were  not  racist  and  refused  to  apologise.  ""If  you  think  they  are  racist,  I  think  you  are  wrong,""  he  told  reporters.  The  dispute  comes  as  an  inspection  team  from  the  International  Olympic  committee  began  a  four-day  tour  to  assess  London's  bid  for  the  2012  Games.  An  official  complaint  has  been  made  to  local  government  watchdogs  by  the  British  Jews,  demanding  an  investigation  by  the  Standards  Board  of  England.  It  has  the  power  to  suspend  or  bar  Mr  Livingstone  from  public  office."

Miyazaki  won  an  Oscar  earlier  this  year  for  Spirited  Away,  Japan's  first  Academy  Award  for  nearly  50  years.  Howl's  Moving  Castle  is  based  on  a  children's  fantasy  novel  by  UK  author  Diana  Wynne  Jones.  It  tells  the  story  of  an  18-year-old  woman  who  ages  dramatically  after  falling  under  a  witch's  spell.  She  heads  to  a  moving  castle  kept  by  Howl,  a  wizard,  and  searches  for  a  way  to  become  normal  again.  A  spokesman  for  distributor  Toho  said  the  film  ""has  received  strong  interest  from  domestic  audiences  and  foreign  media  and  viewers  alike"".  ""We  have  a  good  feeling  about  this  film.  We  saw  very  good  viewer  response,""  he  added.

""Jonesboro  is  a  wonderful  city  because  of  what  does  not  come  here,""  said  the  Reverend  Adrian  Rodgers.  But  a  venue  spokesman  said  more  than  5,500  tickets  had  been  sold  so  far.  |||    Mr  Rodgers,  of  the  Fullness  of  Joy  Church,  said  he  was  concerned  about  the  rapper's  lyrics  that  include  references  to  drugs,  sex  and  violence,  and  songs  that  the  minister  said  were  demeaning  to  women.  Ministers  were  worried  that  bringing  such  acts  to  Jonesboro  would  lead  to  problems.  ""Tear  the  tickets  up,""  Mr  Rodgers  said.  ""Do  not  go  and  do  not  allow  your  children  to  go.""  |||    Tim  Dean,  director  of  the  Arkansas  State  University  venue,  said  ticket  sales  had  been  brisk.  ""It  would  appear  that  with  ticket  sales  over  5,000,  many  others  have  expressed  their  right  to  find  Nelly's  music  entertaining  and  worth  spending  their  time  and  money  on,""  he  said.  Nelly  has  sold  more  than  30  million  singles  and  albums  worldwide,  and  in  September  2004  simultaneously  occupied  the  number  one  and  two  positions  in  the  US  albums  chart.  He  has  had  12  UK  hit  singles,  including  Hot  in  Herre,  Dilemma  and  recent  number  one  Over  and  Over." 

2	"Muslim  police  stops  'more  likely'  |||    UK  Muslims  should  accept  that  people  of  Islamic  appearance  are  more  likely  to  be  stopped  and  searched  by  police,  a  Home  Office  minister  has  said.  |||    Hazel  Blears  said  innocent  Muslims  would  be  targeted  because  of  the  search  for  Islamic  extremists.  Qualifications  for  religious  leaders  to  enter  the  UK  could  also  be  made  tougher,  she  told  a  Commons  inquiry.  Her  comments  have  been  described  as  ""irresponsible""  and  ""outrageous""  by  the  Islamic  Human  Rights  Commission  (IHRC).  |||    ""The  threat  is  most  likely  to  come  from  those  people  associated  with  an  extreme  form  of  Islam,  or  who  are  falsely  hiding  behind  Islam,""  the  Salford  MP  told  the  Commons  home  affairs  committee.  |||    ""It  means  that  some  of  our  counter-terrorism  powers  will  be  disproportionately  experienced  by  the  Muslim  community.""  It  was  a  reality  that  should  be  recognised,  she  said.  ""If  a  threat  is  from  a  particular  place  then  our  action  is  going  to  be  targeted  at  that  area,""  she  added.  On  ministers  of  religions,  such  as  imams,  she  said  faith  groups  would  be  asked  what  other  qualifications  and  skills,  such  as  civic  knowledge  and  ability  to  engage  the  community,  should  be  demanded.  Last  year,  ministers  introduced  a  requirement  that  ministers  should  speak  English  to  a  certain  level.  |||    IHRC  chairman  Massoud  Shadjareh  accused  Ms  Blears  of  ""playing  an  Islamophobia  card""  in  the  run-up  to  a  general  election.  |||    ""She  is  demonising  and  alienating  our  community,""  he  said.  ""It  is  a  legitimisation  for  a  backlash  and  for  racists  to  have  an  onslaught  on  our  community.  ""This  sort  of  comment  is  just  music  to  the  ears  of  racists.""  Later,  the  prime  minister's  official  spokesman  urged  people  to  put  Ms  Blears'  comments  into  context.  The  minister  had  been  saying  she  understood  there  was  a  perception  that  stop  and  search  was  aimed  at  one  community,  but  that  was  not  what  was  happening,  the  spokesman  said.  |||    ""What  is  happening  is  that  those  powers  are  aimed  at  those  who  are  suspected  of  carrying  out  or  planning  certain  activity  who  happen  to  come  from  one  community.  ""It  is  not  aimed  at  a  particular  community,  it  is  not  police  policy  to  aim  these  powers  at  a  particular  community,""  he  added.  Statistics  showed  that  of  the  17  people  found  guilty  of  terrorist  acts  in  the  UK  since  the  11  September  attacks,  only  four  of  the  12  whose  ethnic  backgrounds  were  known  were  Muslim,  he  added  Figures  published  last  week  showed  that  people  from  ethnic  minorities  were  increasingly  likely  to  be  targeted  by  police  stop  and  search  tactics.  |||    Figures  showed  that,  for  2003/2004,  Asians  were  1.9  times  more  likely  to  be  stopped  and  searched,  compared  with  1.7  times  more  likely  in  the  previous  year.  Separate  figures  on  police  searches  in  England  and  Wales  carried  out  under  the  Terrorism  Act  2000  showed  that  ethnic  minorities  were  more  likely  to  be  targeted.  Muslim  groups  have  repeatedly  claimed  that  their  communities  are  being  victimised  under  terror  laws.  In  2003/2004,  12.5%  searches  under  the  laws  were  on  Asian  people,  even  though  they  make  up  4.7%  of  the  population.  Last  July,  the  police  were  accused  of  Islamophobia  by  Muslim  groups  after  stop  and  search  figures  showed  the  numbers  of  Asians  targeted  had  risen  by  300%  since  the  introduction  of  anti-terror  laws." 

2	"Tory  leader  urges  Harry  apology  |||    Prince  Harry  should  personally  make  clear  how  sorry  he  is  about  wearing  a  Nazi  uniform  to  a  friend's  fancy  dress  party,  says  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard.  |||    Mr  Howard,  whose  grandmother  died  in  Auschwitz,  said  many  people  would  be  offended  by  the  prince's  actions  Clarence  House  has  issued  a  statement  saying  the  prince  has  apologised  and  realised  it  had  been  a  poor  costume.  Number  10  said  an  error  was  made  but  now  Harry  had  apologised  the  matter  should  be  left  to  the  palace.  That  was  a  message  repeated  by  Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  who  said  the  matter  should  now  be  left  to  lie.  |||    But  Lib  Dem  leader  Charles  Kennedy  said  Harry  was  in  a  privileged  position  and  said  he  should  apologise  in  person.  ""There  is  a  reservoir  of  goodwill  for  Prince  Harry,  and  Prince  William  with  him,  in  this  country,  but  I  think  he  needs  to  remember  that  it  can't  last  forever.""  He  added  that  Sandhurst  would  probably  be  good  for  Harry  as  it  would  teach  him  some  self  discipline.  Former  Labour  MP  Lord  Janner,  who  is  a  high  profile  member  of  Britain's  Jewish  community,  branded  Harry's  action's  ""stupid  and  evil"".  He  told  ITV:  ""The  time  has  come  for  him  to  make  a  public  apology.  It  is  about  common  decency,  of  respect  to  the  people  who  fought  the  Nazis,  to  the  families  of  those  who  were  killed  by  the  Nazis  and  to  people  who  suffered  during  the  Holocaust.""  He  added:  ""I  would  send  him  in  the  army  as  fast  as  possible.  I  hope  that  would  teach  him  not  to  behave  like  that.""  |||    A  photograph  of  Prince  Harry  wearing  a  swastika  armband  and  German  desert  uniform  at  the  party  appears  in  Thursday's  Sun  newspaper  under  the  headline:  ""Harry  the  Nazi.""  Mr  Howard  acknowledged  the  prince's  apology  and  said  he  had  no  doubt  the  prince's  father  and  family  would  have  much  to  say  to  him  privately  about  the  incident.  But  he  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme:  ""It  might  be  appropriate  to  tell  us  himself  just  how  contrite  he  is.""  Mr  Howard  declined  to  say  what  form  the  statement  should  take.  But  former  Buckingham  Palace  press  spokesman  Dicky  Arbiter  said  the  prince  should  make  a  personal,  broadcast  apology.  Mr  Clarke  said  he  recognised  people's  concerns  about  the  costume  but  argued:  ""He  has  apologised  and  I  think  we  should  leave  the  matter  there.""" 

2	"Chancellor  rallies  Labour  voters  |||    Gordon  Brown  has  issued  a  rallying  cry,  telling  supporters  the  ""stakes  are  too  high""  to  stay  at  home  or  protest  vote  in  the  forthcoming  general  election.  |||    The  chancellor  said  the  vote  -  expected  to  fall  on  5  May  -  will  give  a  ""clear  and  fundamental""  choice  between  Labour  investment  and  Conservative  cuts.  Speaking  at  Labour's  spring  conference  in  Gateshead,  Mr  Brown  claimed  the  NHS  was  not  safe  in  Conservative  hands.  He  said  Tory  plans  to  cut  £35bn  tax  would  ""cut  deep  into  public  service"".  |||    To  a  packed  audience  at  Gateshead's  Sage  Centre,  the  chancellor  said  the  cuts  proposed  by  shadow  chancellor  Oliver  Letwin  were  the  equivalent  of  sacking  every  teacher,  GP  and  nurse  in  the  country,  he  told  activists.  Laying  into  the  Conservative's  record  in  government  he  said:  ""I  give  you  this  promise  -  with  Labour,  Britain  will  never  return  to  the  mistakes  of  ERM  and  10%  inflation,  15%  interest  rates,  £3bn  in  lost  reserves,  250,000  repossessed,  one  million  in  negative  equity  and  three  million  unemployed.  ""Never  again  Tory  boom  and  bust.  |||    ""This  will  be  the  central  dividing  line  at  the  election,  between  a  Conservative  Party  taking  Britain  back  and  planning  deep  cuts  of  £35bn  in  our  services,  and  a  Labour  government  taking  Britain  forward,  which  on  a  platform  of  stability  will  reform  and  renew  our  hospitals,  schools  and  public  services  and,  I  am  proud  to  say,  spend  by  2008  £60bn  more.""  Turning  to  the  economy,  the  chancellor  pledged  to  continue  economic  stability  and  growth  in  a  third  term  in  power.  |||    He  said  after  seven  years  Labour  had  transformed  from  a  party  not  trusted  with  the  economy  to  ""the  only  party  trusted  with  the  economy"".  It  was  now  a  ""party  not  just  of  employees,  but  of  employers  and  managers"",  he  said.  In  the  speech  -  which  prompted  a  standing  ovation  from  an  audience  clearly  ""warm""  to  Mr  Brown  -  he  also  promised  to  end  teenage  unemployment  within  the  next  five  years.  He  also  highlighted  plans  for  100%  debt  relief  for  the  world's  poorest  countries,  a  national  minimum  wage  for  16  and  17-year-olds  and  the  creation  of  a  network  of  children's  centres  and  flexibility  in  maternity  leave.  The  prime  minister  is  to  take  part  later  on  Saturday  in  an  interactive  question  and  answer  session,  fielding  queries  sent  in  by  e-mail,  text  message  and  telephone  as  part  of  Labour's  attempt  to  engage  the  public  in  their  campaign." 

2	"Tories  'would  cut  number  of  MPs'  |||    The  Conservative  Party  would  cut  the  number  of  MPs  by  about  one-fifth  if  they  were  elected,  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  has  said.  |||    The  plan  forms  part  of  the  party's  ""smaller  government  bill"",  to  be  unveiled  later  this  week.  Mr  Howard  told  the  Sunday  Times  the  party  would  also  reduce  the  number  of  government  special  advisers.  And  he  said  a  referendum  would  be  held  in  Wales  to  decide  whether  or  not  to  scrap  the  Welsh  Assembly.  |||    The  changes  would  all  take  place  within  five  years  of  the  Conservatives  winning  a  general  election,  Mr  Howard  told  the  paper.  |||    The  precise  number  of  MPs  to  go  would  depend  on  the  result  of  the  Welsh  referendum,  but  it  would  probably  mean  a  reduction  of  around  120  from  the  current  total  of  659.  If  Wales  decided  to  keep  its  assembly  it  would  stand  to  lose  more  MPs.  Mr  Howard  said  as  both  parties  planned  to  cut  the  number  of  civil  servants  at  Whitehall  -  Labour  by  more  than  80,000  and  the  Tories  by  almost  100,000  -  they  should  accept  a  similar  drop  in  their  own  numbers.  ""It  is  all  very  well  saying  government  departments  should  be  reduced,  but  what  about  ministers,  Parliament  and  special  advisers?""  he  said.  Shadow  leader  of  the  Commons  Oliver  Heald  said:  ""This  will  be  part  of  our  aim  to  reduce  unnecessary  and  costly  interference  in  people's  lives  by  reducing  the  size  and  role  of  the  State"".  |||    Mr  Howard  said  the  plan  would  also  even  out  the  ""great  unfairness""  of  there  being  proportionately  more  Scottish  and  Welsh  MPs  at  Westminster  than  those  from  England.  The  average  size  of  an  English  constituency  was  70,000  people,  Mr  Howard  said.  In  Northern  Ireland  it  was  just  over  66,000,  in  Wales  just  over  59,000  and  in  Scotland  53,000.  The  number  of  Welsh  MPs  would  be  set  at  an  amount  that  was  ""consistent  and  fair  in  terms  of  representation  with  the  rest  of  the  United  Kingdom""  if  the  assembly  was  scrapped.  Mr  Howard  said  the  changes  should  be  carried  out  quickly  and  could  even  be  implemented  by  the  election  after  next.  ""You  have  got  to  have  a  big  bang.  We  don't  want  this  like  the  House  of  Lords  reform,  getting  to  one  stage  and  then  not  having  the  next  stage."""

And  with  their  price  tags  reflecting  the  heavy  investment  by  development  companies,  video  games  are  proving  almost  as  profitable  as  they  are  fun.  |||    Mr  Chernin,  however,  told  the  FT  that  News  Corp  was  finding  it  difficult  to  identify  a  suitable  target.  ""We  are  struggling  with  the  gap  between  companies  like  Electronic  Arts  (EA),  which  comes  with  a  high  price  tag,  and  the  next  tier  of  companies,""  he  explained  during  a  conference  in  Phoenix,  Arizona.  ""These  may  be  too  focused  on  one  or  two  product  lines.""  Activision  has  a  stock  market  capitalisation  of  about  $2.95bn  (£1.57bn),  compared  to  EA's  $17.8bn.  Some  of  the  games  industry's  main  players  have  recently  been  looking  to  consolidate  their  position  by  making  acquisitions.  France's  Ubisoft,  one  of  Europe's  biggest  video  game  publishers,  has  been  trying  to  remain  independent  since  Electronic  Arts  announced  plans  to  buy  19.9%  of  the  firm.  Analysts  have  said  that  industry  mergers  are  likely  in  the  future." 

2	"Wales  'must  learn  health  lessons'  |||    The  new  health  minister  for  Wales  says  there  are  lessons  to  learn  from  England  in  tackling  waiting  lists.  |||    Dr  Brian  Gibbons,  on  his  first  full  day  in  the  job  after  Jane  Hutt  was  sacked,  admitted  ""big  challenges""  but  insisted  the  ""essentials""  were  in  place.  But  both  Plaid  Cymru  and  the  Liberal  Democrats  said  Dr  Gibbons  needed  to  change  policy.  Meanwhile  Ms  Hutt  defended  her  record,  saying  waiting  times  and  lists  were  ""only  10%  of  the  health  agenda.  Dr  Gibbons,  who  was  a  GP  in  Blaengwynfi,  in  the  Upper  Afan  Valley,  before  becoming  AM  for  Aberavon,  said  NHS  staff  wanted  a  period  of  consolidation  after  ""tremendous  change  and  reform"".  One  of  the  biggest  problems  which  had  faced  Ms  Hutt  during  her  five-and-a-half  years  as  the  assembly's  first  health  minister  was  the  length  of  waiting  lists  in  Wales.  |||    In  November  the  British  Medical  Association  said  NHS  staff  were  ""weeping  with  despair""  as  figures  showed  311,000  people  were  waiting  for  treatment  in  Wales,  up  by  2,400  on  the  previous  month.  In  the  same  month  lists  in  England  were  at  their  lowest  for  17  years,  with  856,600  people  waiting  for  treatment.  Dr  Gibbons  told  Radio  Wales:  ""There  is  no  doubt  that,  in  managing  waiting  lists,  England  has  done  a  lot  of  very  very  useful  work,  and  we  do  need  to  learn  from  that.""  |||    But  he  said  the  NHS  in  Wales  also  needed  to  create  a  healthier  population  rather  than  respond  only  to  ill  health,  and  a  balanced  view  of  priorities  was  important.  ""We  do  need  a  consistent  across-the-board  approach,  recognising  the  patients'  experience  of  how  they  use  the  service  is  going  to  be,  at  the  end  of  the  day,  the  main  test  of  how  the  service  is  working.""  He  said  NHS  staff  wanted  a  period  of  consolidation  after  ""tremendous  change  and  reform"".  Later,  Dr  Gibbons  praised  the  work  of  Ms  Hutt,  saying  he  ""agreed  with  everything  she's  done""  to  change  the  health  service  in  Wales.  Dr  Gibbons  said  he  accepted  there  was  a  problem,  but  his  job  now  was  to  build  on  the  foundations  put  in  place  by  his  predecessor.  He  also  acknowledged  that  until  the  waiting  list  issue  was  sorted  out,  the  rest  of  the  assembly  government's  health  policy  would  be  overshadowed.  |||    Opposition  members  and  some  Labour  MPs  had  long  called  for  Ms  Hutt's  removal  after  sustained  criticism  over  extended  hospital  waiting  times.  First  Minister  Rhodri  Morgan  told  BBC  Wales  he  had  agreed  with  Ms  Hutt  in  2003  that  she  would  not  be  health  minister  in  the  run-up  to  the  2007  elections.  ""She's  been  doing  the  job  for  five  years  and  eight  months  and,  apart  from  Nye  Bevan  himself,  (architect  of  the  NHS),  I  don't  think  anybody  has  ever  done  the  job  for  so  long.""  Mr  Morgan  said  he  had  only  told  Ms  Hutt  of  the  reshuffle  on  Monday  morning,  and  said  the  NHS  in  Wales  was  Dr  Gibbons'  ""baby""  now.  In  response  to  Dr  Gibbons'  comments,  Ieuan  Wyn  Jones,  leader  of  the  Plaid  Cymru  group  in  the  assembly,  said:  ""It  is  apparent  that  this  reshuffle  by  the  first  minister  was  just  changing  the  deckchairs  on  a  sinking  Titanic.""  Kisrty  Williams,  for  the  Lib  Dems,  added:  ""If  the  underlying  policy  is  going  to  continue,  then  changing  the  minister  will  serve  no  purpose,  other  than  to  deflect  flak  from  Labour's  MPs,""  she  said.  Meanwhile  Ms  Hutt  said  she  hoped  ""that  the  people  of  Wales  would  benefit  from  my  investment  of  the  past  five  years  and  eight  months""  Asked  about  waiting  lists,  she  said  that  waiting  times  and  lists  were  ""only  10%  of  the  health  agenda""  and  that  the  Welsh  Assembly  Government  had  ""turned  the  corner""  on  the  issue." 

0	"Wal-Mart  fights  back  at  accusers  |||    Two  big  US  names  have  launched  advertising  campaigns  to  ""set  the  record  straight""  about  their  products  and  corporate  behaviour.  |||    The  world's  biggest  retailer  Wal-Mart  took  out  more  than  100  full  page  adverts  in  national  newspapers.  The  group  is  trying  to  see  off  criticism  over  it  pay  deals,  benefits  package  and  promotion  strategy.  Meanwhile,  drugs  group  Eli  Lilly  is  planning  a  campaign  against  ""false""  claims  about  its  product  Prozac.  Wal-Mart  kicked  off  the  battle  with  adverts  in  newspapers  like  the  Wall  Street  Journal,  using  an  open  letter  from  company  president  Lee  Scott  saying  it  was  time  for  the  public  to  hear  the  ""unfiltered  truth"".  |||    ""There  are  lots  of  'urban  legends'  going  around  these  days  about  Wal-Mart,  but  facts  are  facts.  Wal-Mart  is  good  for  consumers,  good  for  communities  and  good  for  the  US  economy,""  Mr  Scott  said  in  a  separate  statement.  |||    Its  adverts  -  and  a  new  website  -  outlined  the  group's  plans  to  create  more  than  10,000  US  jobs  in  2005.  Wal-Mart's  average  pay  is  almost  twice  the  national  minimum  wage  of  $5.15  (£3.90)  an  hour,  while  employees  are  offered  health  and  life  insurance,  company  stock  and  a  retirement  plan,  the  adverts  say.  Unions  accuse  Wal-Mart  of  paying  staff  less  than  its  rivals  do,  with  fewer  benefits.  In  California,  the  company  is  fighting  opposition  to  new  stores  amid  allegations  it  forces  local  competitors  out  of  business.  Lawmakers  in  the  state  are  also  examining  allegations  that  the  firm  burdens  the  state  with  an  unfair  proportion  of  employee  health  care  costs.  ""I  think  they  are  going  to  have  a  tough  time  suddenly  overcoming  the  perceptions  of  some  people,""  said  Larry  Bevington,  chairman  of  Save  Our  Community  -  a  group  fighting  to  prevent  Wal-Mart  opening  a  store  in  Rosemead,  California.  Wal-Mart  is  also  fighting  two  lawsuits  -  one  accusing  it  of  discriminating  against  women  and  another  alleging  it  discriminates  against  black  employees.  |||    Meanwhile  Eli  Lilly  is  launching  a  series  of  adverts  in  a  dozen  major  newspapers,  to  present  what  is  says  are  the  true  facts  about  its  anti-depressant  drug  Prozac.  |||    The  move  is  in  response  to  a  British  Medical  Journal  article  that  claimed  ""missing""  Lilly  documents  linked  Prozac  to  suicide  and  violent  behaviour.  In  the  averts,  entitled  An  Open  Letter  from  chief  executive  Sidney  Taurel,  the  company  says  the  article  continues  to  ""needlessly  spread  fear  among  patients  who  take  Prozac"".  ""It  was  simply  wrong  to  suggest  that  information  on  Prozac  was  missing,  or  that  important  research  data  on  the  benefits  and  possible  side  effects  of  the  drug  were  not  available  to  doctors  and  regulators,""  the  letter  added.  Eli  Lilly's  chief  medical  officer  Alan  Breier  said  that  the  article  was  ""false  and  misleading""  as  the  documents  it  referred  to  were  actually  created  by  officials  at  the  US  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  and  presented  to  an  FDA  meeting  in  1991.  Later,  FDA  medical  advisors  agreed  the  claims  were  based  on  faulty  data  and  there  was  no  increased  risk  of  suicide." 

1	"Oscars  steer  clear  of  controversy  |||    The  Oscars  nominations  list  has  left  out  some  of  the  most  controversial  films  of  the  past  year  in  favour  of  safer,  less  contentious  cinema.  |||    If  best  film  nominees  were  drawn  on  the  basis  of  column  inches,  two  of  the  front-runners  would  have  had  to  be  Michael  Moore's  Bush-baiting  documentary  Fahrenheit  9/11  and  Mel  Gibson's  The  Passion  of  the  Christ.  Both  films  polarised  opinion  but  had  critics  talking,  and  the  public  turning  up  to  see  them  -  Fahrenheit  9/11  breaking  US  box  office  records  for  a  documentary,  and  The  Passion  of  the  Christ  making  more  than  US$370m  (£196m)  in  the  US  alone.  But  this  year's  Academy  Awards  have  shied  away  from  the  big  name  controversies,  with  The  Passion  of  the  Christ  -  a  film  accused  of  being  anti-Semitic  -  receiving  nominations  only  in  the  'minor'  categories  of  cinematography,  makeup  and  musical  score.  |||    Fahrenheit  9/11  has  also  been  overlooked,  despite  winning  the  Palme  d'Or  at  the  Cannes  International  Film  Festival  in  2004.  |||    Moore's  caustic  documentary  may  have  been  affected  by  its  distributors'  decision  to  enter  it  in  the  best  picture  category,  rather  than  best  documentary,  says  Tim  Dams,  the  news  editor  of  trade  magazine  Screen  International.  But  he  also  believes  the  strong  political  viewpoint  of  Moore's  film  does  not  sit  well  with  the  Academy.  ""If  you  look  at  past  Oscar  winners  and  nominees,  the  very  conservative  Oscar  voters  tend  to  go  for  very  conservative,  epic-style  pictures.  Fahrenheit  9/11  didn't  really  fit  in  to  that  category.  ""They  tend  to  go  for  films  like  Titanic,  Gladiator,  and  the  Lord  of  the  Rings,  films  with  scale  that  often  aren't  too  contentious,""  he  said.  While  he  said  the  Oscar  voting  panel  were  not  ""snubbing""  Moore's  film,  he  thought  it  was  unlikely  a  documentary  could  ever  seriously  compete  in  a  best  film  category.  ""I  think  it's  more  a  misjudgement  by  the  people  putting  it  out  rather  than  a  deliberate  snub,""  he  said.  |||    The  problem  with  Mel  Gibson's  film,  he  believed,  was  that  the  voting  panel  may  have  been  cautious  in  nominating  a  film  with  dialogue  in  Aramaic,  an  ancient  Middle  Eastern  language.  |||    ""Hollywood  doesn't  tend  to  like  foreign-language  films  -  no-one's  ever  tried  doing  a  film  in  a  dead  language,""  he  said.  But  aside  from  these  two  films,  some  potentially  contentious  pictures  have  won  nominations.  The  German  film  The  Downfall,  a  biopic  tracing  the  final  days  of  Nazi  leader  Adolf  Hitler  in  his  Berlin  bunker,  has  been  recognised  in  the  best  foreign  film  category.  The  film  has  caused  some  controversy  in  showing  Hitler  as  a  fallible  but  human  man,  rather  than  a  semi-mythical,  historical  monster.  But  Mr  Dams  said:  ""It's  not  an  inflammatory  film.  It  has  done  very  well  in  Germany,  and  it's  a  film  that  portrays  Hitler  as  a  human  rather  than  some  kind  of  devil  or  monster.""  Another  'contentious'  film,  Mr  Dams  said,  has  gained  a  nomination  in  the  best  documentary  section  through  the  force  of  its  charm.  |||    Independent  film-maker  Morgan  Spurlock  may  have  forced  fast-food  giant  McDonalds  to  withdraw  its  'super  size'  portions  in  the  US  after  he  went  on  a  month-long  diet  eating  nothing  but  McDonalds  meals  -  and  filmed  his  progress.  |||    The  film  has  been  a  hit  around  the  world.  Mr  Dams  said:  ""It's  a  political  film,  but  it's  quite  fun  and  punky  and  well-paced.  ""Morgan  Spurlock  is  a  really  likeable  guy.  It's  a  very  accessible  film,  and  it  doesn't  beat  you  over  the  head  with  its  views.  ""While  in  Fahrenheit  9/11  there  are  moments  of  comedy,  I  think  the  way  that  Super  Size  Me  is  put  together  -  the  fact  it's  a  very  likeable  film  -  means  it's  won  through  on  charm.""  Dam's  pick  at  this  year's  Oscars?  The  Aviator,  Martin  Scorsese's  biopic  of  aviation  pioneer  and  Hollywood  player  Howard  Hughes.  Tinseltown,  it  seems,  likes  nothing  more  than  a  picture  about  one  of  its  own." 

2	"Final  hunts  held  as  ban  looms  |||    Hunts  in  England  and  Wales  have  begun  on  the  last  day  that  hunting  with  dogs  is  legal,  with  more  due  out  later.  |||    Thousands  of  supporters  are  expected  to  turn  out  at  more  than  250  meets,  many  of  which  have  altered  their  normal  schedules  to  be  out  on  a  Thursday.  The  ban  on  hunting  with  dogs  comes  into  effect  from  0001  GMT  on  Friday.  The  Countryside  Alliance  had  its  latest  legal  bid  to  block  the  ban  thwarted  on  Wednesday  when  the  Appeal  Court  ruled  the  Hunting  Act  was  lawful.  |||    But  the  group  says  hunting  will  continue  in  some  form  after  the  ban  comes  in,  with  hunts  expected  to  test  the  new  law  to  its  limits.  Others  are  expected  to  defy  the  ban  by  continuing  to  hunt  illegally.  |||    Anti-hunt  organisations,  for  whom  the  ban  is  the  culmination  of  years  of  campaigning,  say  they  hope  most  will  stay  within  the  law.  Mike  Hobday,  of  the  League  Against  Cruel  Sports,  told  BBC  News:  ""We've  long  urged  them  to  go  drag  hunting  -  to  follow  an  artificial  scent  -  and  that  is  what  we  hope  they  do.  ""But  if  they  continue  to  chase  foxes,  to  chase  wild  mammals  around  the  countryside,  that's  against  the  law  and  we're  confident  they'll  be  brought  to  justice.""  At  the  headquarters  of  Quorn  hunt  in  Leicestershire,  feelings  were  running  high  as  hunt  enthusiasts  prepared  for  their  final  legal  hunt.  BBC  correspondent  Sarah  Mukherjee  said  hunt  supporters  were  in  tears.  |||    She  said  many  people  did  not  share  the  Countryside  Alliance's  optimism  that  hunting  would  be  able  to  continue.  Farmer  Geoff  Brooks,  a  senior  member  of  the  Quorn  hunt,  told  BBC  News  people's  lives  ""revolved  around  hunting"".  He  described  the  ban  as  ""ridiculous""  and  ""badly  thought  out""  but  said  it  would  be  hard  for  most  people  to  defy  it  as  they  would  not  want  to  risk  their  incomes  by  getting  a  criminal  record.  |||    At  the  Court  of  Appeal  on  Wednesday,  the  Countryside  Alliance  failed  in  its  attempt  to  have  the  Hunting  Act  ruled  invalid.  But  it  says  the  ban  is  unenforceable  because  the  law  is  unclear  and  impossible  to  police.  |||    The  alliance  says  hunt  supporters  will  go  out  and  test  this  law  to  its  limits  on  Saturday.  The  League  Against  Cruel  Sports  and  the  RSPCA  say  they  will  monitor  hunts  and  assist  police  in  bringing  prosecutions.  The  Association  of  Chief  Police  Officers  has  issued  guidance  to  forces  on  how  to  deal  with  the  new  rules.  A  spokesman  said:  ""Basically,  it's  not  going  to  be  police  officers  chasing  about  in  cars  across  fields,  it  will  be  based  on  intelligence  and  information  received  as  well.""  The  decision  on  how  to  police  individual  hunts  will  be  left  to  local  forces,  with  more  officers  sent  to  hunts  where  disruption  is  expected.  He  said  police  would  consider  evidence  submitted  by  anti-hunt  organisations  on  its  merits." 

1	"Stars  pay  tribute  to  actor  Davis  |||    Hollywood  stars  including  Spike  Lee,  Burt  Reynolds  and  Oscar  nominee  Alan  Alda  have  paid  tribute  to  actor  Ossie  Davis  at  a  funeral  in  New  York.  |||    Veteran  star  Ossie  Davis,  a  well-known  civil  rights  activist,  died  in  Miami  at  the  age  of  87  on  4  February  2005.  Friends  and  family,  including  actress  Ruby  Dee  his  wife  of  56  years,  gathered  at  the  Riverside  Church  on  Saturday.  Also  present  at  the  service  was  former  US  president  Bill  Clinton  and  singer  Harry  Belafonte,  who  gave  the  eulogy.  ""He  would  have  been  a  very  good  president  of  the  United  States,""  said  Mr  Clinton.  ""Like  most  of  you  here,  he  gave  more  to  me  than  I  gave  to  him.""  |||    The  87-year-old  was  found  dead  last  weekend  in  his  hotel  room  in  Florida,  where  he  was  making  a  film.  Police  said  that  he  appeared  to  have  died  of  natural  causes.  Davis  made  his  acting  debut  in  1950  in  No  Way  Out  starring  Sidney  Poiter.  He  frequently  collaborated  with  director  Spike  Lee,  starring  in  seven  Lee  films  including  Jungle  Fever,  Do  The  Right  Thing  and  Malcolm  X.  Attallah  Shabazz,  the  daughter  of  activist  Malcolm  X,  recalled  the  famous  eulogy  delivered  by  Davis  at  her  father's  funeral.  ""Harlem  has  come  to  bid  farewell  to  one  of  its  finest  hopes,""  she  said,  quoting  the  man  she  knew  as  Uncle  Ossie.  ""Ditto.""  ""Ossie  was  my  hero,  and  he  still  is,""  said  Aviator  star  Alan  Alda,  a  family  friend  for  over  forty  years.  ""Ossie  was  a  thing  of  beauty.""  |||    ""I  want  so  badly  someday  to  have  his  dignity  -  a  little  of  it  anyway,""  added  Burt  Reynolds,  Davis's  co-star  in  the  90s  TV  comedy  Evening  Shade.  Before  the  midday  funeral,  scores  of  Harlem  residents  formed  a  queue  outside  the  church  to  pay  their  respects  to  Davis.  ""It  is  hard  to  fathom  that  we  will  no  longer  be  able  to  call  on  his  wisdom,  his  humour,  his  loyalty  and  his  moral  strength  to  guide  us  in  the  choices  that  are  yet  to  be  made  and  the  battles  that  are  yet  to  be  fought,""  said  Belafonte,  himself  an  ardent  civil  rights  activist  who  had  been  friends  with  Davis  for  over  60  years.  ""But  how  fortunate  we  were  to  have  him  as  long  as  we  did."""

Talks  with  the  European  stock  market  and  with  rival  bidder  Deutsche  Boerse  will  continue,  the  LSE  said.  Last  week,  the  group  rejected  a  £1.3bn  ($2.5bn)  takeover  offer  from  Deutsche  Boerse,  claiming  that  it  undervalued  the  business.  LSE  saw  its  shares  surge  4.9%  to  a  new  high  of  583p  in  early  trade,  following  the  announcement  on  Monday.  |||    The  offer  follows  widespread  media  speculation  that  Euronext  would  make  an  offer  for  LSE.  Experts  now  widely  expect  a  bidding  war  for  Europe's  biggest  stock  market,  which  lists  stocks  with  a  total  capitalisation  of  £1.4  trillion,  to  break  out.  Commentators  say  that  a  deal  with  Euronext,  which  owns  the  Liffe  derivatives  exchange  in  London  and  combines  the  Paris,  Amsterdam  and  Lisbon  stock  exchanges,  could  potentially  offer  the  LSE  more  cost  savings  than  a  deal  with  Deutsche  Boerse.  |||    A  weekend  report  in  the  Telegraph  had  quoted  an  unnamed  executive  at  Euronext  as  saying  the  group  would  make  a  cash  bid  to  trump  Deutsche  Boerse's  offer.  ""Because  we  already  own  Liffe  in  London,  the  cost  savings  available  to  us  from  a  merger  are  far  greater  than  for  Deutsche  Boerse,""  the  newspaper  quoted  the  executive  as  saying.  Euronext  chief  executive  Jean-Francois  Theodore  is  reported  to  have  already  held  private  talks  with  LSE's  chief  executive  Clara  Furse.  Further  reports  had  suggested  that  Euronext  could  make  an  offer  in  excess  of  the  LSE's  533p  a  share  closing  price  on  Friday.  However,  Euronext  said  it  could  not  guarantee  ""at  this  stage""  that  a  firm  offer  would  be  made  for  LSE.  There  has  been  extensive  speculation  about  a  possible  takeover  of  the  company  since  an  attempted  merger  with  Deutsche  Boerse  failed  in  2000." 

1	"Dirty  Den's  demise  seen  by  14m  |||    More  than  14  million  people  saw  ""Dirty""  Den  Watts  killed  off  on  Friday,  marking  EastEnders'  20th  anniversary,  according  to  unofficial  figures.  |||    Den's  death  came  16  years  after  he  was  supposedly  shot  in  1989.  But  he  came  back  to  the  show  in  September  2003.  The  audience  for  BBC  One's  one-hour  special  averaged  13.7  million  and  peaked  at  14.2  million  in  the  last  15  minutes,  overnight  figures  showed.  Den  died  after  being  confronted  by  Zoe,  Chrissie  and  Sam  in  the  Queen  Vic.  |||    If  the  ratings  are  confirmed,  the  episode  will  have  given  the  soap  its  highest  audience  for  a  year.  The  overnight  figures  showed  almost  60%  of  the  viewing  public  tuned  into  EastEnders  between  2000  and  2100  GMT,  leaving  ITV1  with  about  13%.  ""We  are  very  pleased  with  the  figures,""  a  BBC  spokesman  said.  ""It  shows  viewers  have  really  enjoyed  the  story  of  Den's  demise.""  The  show's  highest  audience  came  at  Christmas  1986,  when  more  than  30  million  tuned  in  to  see  Den,  played  by  Leslie  Grantham,  hand  divorce  papers  to  wife  Angie.  |||    Two  years  later,  24  million  saw  him  apparently  shot  by  a  man  with  a  bunch  of  daffodils  by  a  canal.  More  than  16  million  viewers  watched  his  return  in  2003.  The  show's  ratings  have  since  settled  down  to  about  12  million  per  episode.  Grantham  hit  the  headlines  in  May  after  a  newspaper  printed  photographs  of  him  apparently  exposing  himself  via  a  webcam  from  his  dressing  room.  He  also  allegedly  insulted  four  co-stars.  He  apologised  for  his  ""deplorable  actions""  and  ""a  moment's  stupidity""." 

0	"$1m  payoff  for  former  Shell  boss  |||    Shell  is  to  pay  $1m  (£522,000)  to  the  ex-finance  chief  who  stepped  down  from  her  post  in  April  2004  after  the  firm  over-stated  its  reserves.  |||    Judy  Boynton  finally  left  the  firm  on  31  December,  having  spent  the  intervening  time  as  a  special  advisor  to  chief  executive  Jeroen  van  der  Veer.  In  January  2004,  Shell  told  shocked  investors  that  its  reserves  were  20%  smaller  than  previously  thought.  Shell  said  the  pay-off  was  in  line  with  Ms  Boynton's  contract.  She  was  leaving  ""by  mutual  agreement  to  pursue  other  career  opportunities"",  the  firm  said  in  a  statement.  The  severance  package  means  she  keeps  long-term  share  options,  but  fails  to  collect  on  a  2003  incentive  plan  since  the  firm  has  failed  to  meet  the  targets  included  in  it.  |||    The  revelation  that  Shell  had  inflated  its  reserves  led  to  the  resignation  of  its  chairman,  Sir  Phil  Watts,  and  production  chief  Walter  van  der  Vijver.  |||    An  investigation  commissioned  by  Shell  found  that  Ms  Boynton  had  to  share  responsibility  for  the  company's  behaviour.  Despite  receiving  an  email  from  Mr  Van  de  Vijver  which  said  the  firm  had  ""fooled""  the  market  about  its  reserves,  the  investigation  said,  she  did  nothing  to  inquire  further.  In  all,  Shell  restated  its  reserves  four  times  during  2003.  In  September,  it  paid  £82.7m  in  fines  to  regulators  on  both  sides  of  the  Atlantic  for  violating  market  rules  in  its  reporting  of  its  reserves."

By  Monday's  close,  the  Jakarta  Stock  Exchange  was  down  2.1%  at  1,011.15.  Bar  a  slight  dip  at  the  New  Year,  The  JSE  had  risen  steadily  by  4.7%  since  the  tsunami  hit  on  26  December.  Construction  and  property  companies  in  particular  have  gained  ground,  although  banks  were  among  the  main  fallers  on  Monday.  |||    So  far,  more  than  100,000  people  are  believed  to  have  been  killed  in  Indonesia,  the  country  closest  to  the  earthquake  which  triggered  the  great  wave.  |||    On  Friday,  the  government  said  its  five-year  estimate  of  rebuilding  costs  for  Banda  Aceh  province  -  much  of  which  was  flattened  by  the  quake  and  the  tsunami  -  was  20  trillion  rupiah  ($2.2bn;  £1.1bn),  twice  what  it  had  previously  estimated.  That  cost  could  be  defrayed  by  temporary  debt  relief.  On  Monday,  Indonesian  economy  minister  Aburizal  Bakrie  told  reporters  that  the  Paris  Club  group  of  creditor  countries  was  expected  to  freeze  20-30bn  rupiah  in  payments  due  in  2005  and  2006.  ""We  hope  we  can  resume  the  repayments  at  least  from  2007,""  Mr  Bakrie  said.  French  finance  minister  Herve  Gaymard  said  on  Sunday  that  the  Paris  Club  had  already  agreed  to  a  moratorium  on  repayments  for  tsunami-hit  countries  ahead  of  its  meeting  on  12  January."

Following  complaints,  the  Advertising  Standards  Authority  contacted  Five  to  cease  promotion  of  crime  show  CSI:NY.  Five  admitted  it  had  sent  out  55,000  promotion  packs  but  had  now  stopped.  The  promotion  material  was  sent  in  brown  envelope  of  the  type  used  by  investigators  in  the  series,  a  spin-off  from  the  highly  successful  CSI:  Crime  Scene  Investigation  series,  which  also  runs  on  Five.

Danish  brewer  Carlsberg  suffered  a  3%  fall  in  profits  due  to  waning  demand  and  increased  marketing  costs.  Both  are  looking  to  Russia  and  China  to  provide  future  growth  as  western  European  markets  are  largely  mature.  |||    Heineken's  net  income  fell  to  537m  euros  ($701m;  £371m)  during  2004,  from  798m  euro  a  year  ago.  It  blamed  weak  demand  in  western  Europe  and  currency  losses.  It  had  warned  in  September  that  the  weakening  US  dollar,  which  has  cut  the  value  of  foreign  sales,  would  knock  125m  euros  off  its  operating  profits.  Despite  the  dip  in  profits,  Heineken's  sales  have  been  improving  and  total  revenue  for  the  year  was  10bn  euros,  up  8.1%  from  9.26bn  euros  in  2003.  Heineken  said  it  now  plans  to  invest  100m  euros  in  ""aggressive""  and  ""high-impact""  marketing  in  Europe  and  the  US  in  2005.  Heineken,  which  also  owns  the  Amstel  and  Murphy's  stout  brands,  said  it  would  also  seek  to  cut  costs.  This  may  involve  closing  down  breweries.  |||    Heineken  increased  its  dividend  payment  by  25%  to  40  euro  cents,  but  warned  that  the  continued  impact  of  a  weaker  dollar  and  an  increased  marketing  spend  may  lead  to  a  drop  in  2005  net  profit.  |||    Carlsberg,  the  world's  fifth-largest  brewer,  saw  annual  pre-tax  profits  fall  to  3.4bn  Danish  kroner  (456m  euros).  Its  beer  sales  have  been  affected  by  the  sluggish  European  economy  and  by  the  banning  of  smoking  in  pubs  in  several  European  countries.  Nevertheless,  total  sales  increased  4%  to  36bn  kroner,  thanks  to  strong  sales  of  Carlsberg  lager  in  Russia  and  Poland.  Carlsberg  is  more  optimistic  than  Heineken  about  2005,  projecting  a  15%  rise  in  net  profits  for  the  year.  However,  it  also  plans  to  cut  200  jobs  in  Sweden,  where  sales  have  been  hit  by  demand  for  cheap,  imported  brands.  ""We  remain  cautious  about  the  medium-to-long  term  outlook  for  revenue  growth  across  western  Europe  for  a  host  of  economic,  social  and  structural  reasons,""  investment  bank  Merrill  Lynch  said  of  Carlsberg." 

0	"Markets  fall  on  weak  dollar  fears  |||    Rising  oil  prices  and  the  sinking  dollar  hit  shares  on  Monday  after  a  finance  ministers'  meeting  and  stern  words  from  Fed  chief  Alan  Greenspan.  |||    The  London  FTSE  fell  0.8%  while  Tokyo's  Nikkei  225  dropped  2.11%,  its  steepest  fall  in  three  months.  G20  finance  ministers  said  nothing  about  supporting  the  dollar,  whose  slide  could  further  jeopardise  growth  in  Japan  and  Europe.  And  Mr  Greenspan  warned  Asian  states  could  soon  stop  funding  the  US  deficit.  |||    On  Monday  afternoon,  the  euro  was  close  to  an  all-time  high  against  the  dollar  at  above  $1.30.  Oil  pushed  higher  too  on  Monday,  as  investors  fretted  about  cold  weather  in  the  US  and  Europe  and  a  potential  output  cut  from  oil  producers'  group  Opec,  although  prices  had  cooled  by  the  end  of  the  day.  In  London,  the  benchmark  Brent  crude  price  closed  down  51  cents  at  $44.38  a  barrel,  while  New  York  light  sweet  crude  closed  down  25  cents  at  $48.64  a  barrel.  The  slide  comes  as  the  US  has  been  attempting  to  talk  up  the  traditional  ""strong  dollar""  policy.  |||    The  latest  to  pitch  in  has  been  President  George  W  Bush  himself,  who  told  the  Asia  Pacific  Economic  Co-operation  (Apec)  summit  in  Chile  that  he  remained  committed  to  halving  the  budget  deficit.  Together  with  a  $500bn  trade  gap,  the  red  ink  spreading  across  America's  public  finances  is  widely  seen  as  a  key  factor  driving  the  dollar  lower.  And  last  week  US  Treasury  Secretary  John  Snow  told  an  audience  in  the  UK  that  the  policy  remained  unaltered.  But  he  also  said  that  the  rate  was  entirely  up  to  the  markets  -  a  signal  which  traders  took  as  advice  to  sell  the  dollar.  Some  had  looked  to  the  G20  meeting  for  direction.  But  Mr  Snow  made  clear  exchange  rates  had  not  been  on  the  agenda.  |||    For  the  US  government,  letting  the  dollar  drift  is  a  useful  short-term  fix.  |||    US  exports  get  more  affordable,  helping  perhaps  to  close  the  trade  gap.  In  the  meantime,  the  debt  keeps  getting  bigger,  with  Congress  authorising  an  $800bn  rise  in  what  the  US  can  owe  -  taking  the  total  to  $8.2  trillion.  But  in  a  speech  on  Friday,  Federal  Reserve  chairman  Alan  Greenspan  warned  that  in  the  longer  term  things  are  likely  to  get  tricky.  At  present,  much  of  gap  in  both  public  debt  is  covered  by  selling  bonds  to  Asian  states  such  as  Japan  and  China,  since  the  dollar  is  seen  as  the  world's  reserve  currency.  Similarly,  Asian  investment  helps  bridge  the  gap  in  the  current  account  -  the  deficit  between  what  the  US  as  a  whole  spends  and  what  it  earns.  But  already  they  are  turning  more  cautious  -  an  auction  of  debt  in  August  found  few  takers.  And  Mr  Greenspan  said  that  could  turn  into  a  trend,  if  the  fall  of  the  dollar  kept  eating  into  the  value  of  those  investments.  ""It  seems  persuasive  that,  given  the  size  of  the  US  current  account  deficit,  a  diminished  appetite  for  adding  to  dollar  balances  must  occur  at  some  point,""  he  said." 

1	"Legendary  music  studio  to  close  |||    The  New  York  music  studio  where  John  Lennon  spent  his  final  hours  is  to  close  next  month.  |||    The  Hit  Factory,  which  opened  37  years  ago,  has  played  host  to  some  of  the  biggest  stars  in  music,  including  Paul  Simon,  Madonna  and  David  Bowie.  However,  the  rise  in  digital  recording  has  affected  business  at  the  studio,  which  is  relocating  to  smaller  premises  in  Miami.  Lennon  recorded  his  final  album  Double  Fantasy  at  the  studio  in  1979.  |||    The  studio  was  founded  by  Jerry  Ragovoy  in  1968.  In  1975  it  was  sold  to  fellow  producer  Edward  Germano,  who  turned  it  into  a  100,000  square  foot  studio  with  seven  recording  rooms  and  live  mastering  suites.  His  first  client  was  Stevie  Wonder,  who  recorded  part  of  his  classic  album  Songs  In  The  Key  Of  Life  there.  Other  well-known  albums  to  be  recorded  or  partially  recorded  at  the  studio  include  Bruce  Springsteen's  Born  In  The  USA,  the  Rolling  Stones'  Emotional  Rescue  and  Paul  Simon's  Graceland.  Michael  Jackson,  Billy  Joel,  Jay-Z  and  Beyonce  are  also  among  artists  who  have  used  the  Hit  Factory  in  the  past,  as  well  as  50  Cent  who  survived  an  attempt  on  his  life  as  he  left  the  premises  in  2000.  The  studio  made  history  in  1994  when  it  won  a  record  41  Grammy  nominations  for  songs  recorded,  mastered  or  mixed  there,  including  the  soundtrack  to  the  Whitney  Houston  film  The  Bodyguard."

Between  1.1  and  1.5  million  people,  mainly  Jews,  were  killed  at  Auschwitz.  The  Tories  said  they  were  glad  Mr  Straw  had  been  ""shamed""  into  going,  having  earlier  criticised  the  decision  to  send  a  lower-ranking  official.  Shadow  Foreign  Secretary  Michael  Ancram  said:  ""I  am  glad  the  foreign  secretary  has  finally  been  shamed  into  representing  Britain  at  this  important  act  of  commemoration.  ""Once  again  this  government  has  shown  crass  insensitivity  until  it  has  been  forced  by  public  opinion  into  doing  what  it  should  have  done  in  the  first  place.""  |||    In  Britain,  the  Queen  and  Prince  Philip  will  lead  the  nation's  commemoration  at  a  service  in  Westminster  Hall,  London.  The  Queen  will  also  host  a  reception  for  holocaust  survivors  at  St  James's  Palace.  Altogether,  some  six  million  people,  mainly  Jews,  perished  in  the  Holocaust.  The  Queen's  grandson,  Prince  Harry,  sparked  outrage  earlier  this  week  after  photographs  of  him  wearing  a  Nazi  uniform  at  a  costume  party  emerged.  The  prince,  20,  apologised,  but  critics  have  called  for  him  to  go  to  Auschwitz  for  the  commemoration  of  the  Soviets'  1945  liberation  of  the  camp.  Prince  Harry  should  see  for  himself  ""the  results  of  the  hated  symbol  he  so  foolishly  and  brazenly  chose  to  wear"",  Rabbi  Marvin  Hier,  founder  of  Jewish  human  rights  group  the  Simon  Wiesenthal  Center  said." 

1	"Pupils  to  get  anti-piracy  lessons  |||    Lessons  on  music  piracy  and  copyright  issues  are  to  be  taught  to  secondary  school  pupils  in  the  UK.  |||    The  lessons,  aimed  at  11  to  14-year-olds,  will  introduce  them  to  copyright  -  including  the  issues  of  downloading  from  the  internet  and  the  illegal  copying  of  CDs  -  and  its  role  in  protecting  creativity.  |||    Music  piracy,  including  illegally  swapping  music  online,  costs  the  UK  music  industry  millions  every  year  and  has  been  blamed  for  a  decline  in  world-wide  CD  sales.  British  Music  Rights  (BMR)  -  which  was  formed  to  represent  the  interests  of  songwriters  and  composers  -  worked  with  education  experts  to  put  together  a  learning  pack.  |||    Songwriter  Guy  Chambers,  who  has  worked  with  stars  including  Robbie  Williams,  has  thrown  his  support  behind  the  scheme.  He  said  as  well  as  educating  children  about  music  piracy,  it  would  also  protect  young  people  planning  a  career  in  the  music  industry  from  ""unscrupulous""  individuals.  At  a  debate  in  London  to  launch  the  scheme,  Chambers  said:  ""I  think  it  is  important  that  young  people  receive  practical  and  engaging  learning  in  schools.  ""These  lessons  will  give  them  an  insight  into  how  the  creative  industries  work  which  will  help  them  in  possible  future  careers.""  The  education  pack,  which  has  already  been  requested  by  more  than  1,600  secondary  schools,  is  aimed  at  giving  children  an  understanding  of  copyright  in  relation  to  the  music  industry.  It  will  also  teach  children  about  the  importance  of  royalties  and  raises  awareness  of  different  careers  in  the  music  industry,  particularly  in  the  digital  age.  |||    Henri  Yoxall,  general  manager  of  British  Music  Rights,  told  BBC  News  schools  had  been  crying  out  for  a  resource  to  help  them  educate  pupils  about  the  issues.

The  latest  scandal  at  Bank  of  China  will  do  nothing  to  reassure  foreign  investors  that  China's  big  four  banks  are  ready  for  international  listings.  Government  policy  sees  the  bank  listings  as  vital  economic  reforms.  Bank  of  China  is  one  of  two  frontrunners  in  the  race  to  list  overseas.  The  other  is  China  Construction  Bank.  Both  are  expected  to  list  abroad  during  2005.  |||    They  shared  a  $45bn  state  bailout  in  2003,  to  help  clean  up  their  balance  sheets  in  preparation  for  a  foreign  stock  market  debut.  |||    However,  a  report  in  the  China-published  Economic  Observer  said  on  Monday  that  the  two  banks  may  have  scrapped  plans  to  list  in  New  York  because  of  the  cost  of  meeting  regulatory  requirements  imposed  since  the  Enron  scandal.  Bank  of  China  is  the  country's  biggest  foreign  exchange  dealer,  while  China  Construction  Bank  is  the  largest  deposit  holder.  China's  banking  sector  is  burdened  with  at  least  $190bn  of  bad  debt  according  to  official  data,  though  most  observers  believe  the  true  figure  is  far  higher.  Officially,  one  in  five  loans  is  not  being  repaid.  Attempts  to  strengthen  internal  controls  and  tighten  lending  policies  have  uncovered  a  succession  of  scandals  involving  embezzlement  by  bank  officials  and  loans-for-favours.  The  most  high-profile  case  involved  the  ex-president  of  Bank  of  China,  Wang  Xuebing,  jailed  for  12  years  in  2003.  Although,  he  committed  the  offences  whilst  running  Bank  of  China  in  New  York,  Mr  Wang  was  head  of  China  Construction  Bank  when  the  scandal  broke.  Earlier  this  month,  a  China  Construction  Bank  branch  manager  was  jailed  for  life  in  a  separate  case.  |||    China's  banks  used  to  act  as  cash  offices  for  state  enterprises  and  did  not  require  checks  on  credit  worthiness.  The  introduction  of  market  reforms  has  been  accompanied  by  attempts  to  modernise  the  banking  sector,  but  links  between  banks  and  local  government  remain  strong.  Last  year,  China's  premier,  Wen  Jiabao,  targeted  bank  lending  practices  in  a  series  of  speeches,  and  regulators  ordered  all  big  loans  to  be  scrutinised,  in  an  attempt  to  cool  down  irresponsible  lending.  China's  leaders  see  reforming  the  top  four  banks  as  vital  to  distribute  capital  to  profitable  companies  and  protect  the  health  of  China's  economic  boom.  But  two  problems  persist.  First,  inefficient  state  enterprises  continue  to  receive  protection  from  bankruptcy  because  they  employ  large  numbers  of  people.  Second,  many  questionable  loans  come  not  from  the  big  four,  but  from  smaller  banks.  Another  high  profile  financial  firm,  China  Life,  is  facing  shareholder  lawsuits  and  a  probe  by  the  US  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  following  its  2004  New  York  listing  over  its  failure  to  disclose  accounting  irregularities  at  its  parent  company."

""I  acted  on  impulse,""  Osbourne  said.  ""In  hindsight,  it  could  have  been  a  lot  worse.  It  could've  got  really  ugly.""  A  £100,000  reward  has  been  offered  for  information  leading  to  a  conviction.  His  wife  Sharon,  who  called  the  police,  said  her  wedding  rings  were  taken  from  her  bedside  table  as  she  slept.  |||    The  heavy  metal  star  said  he  could  have  met  the  same  fate  as  late  Beatle  George  Harrison,  who  was  repeatedly  stabbed  in  a  break-in  in  1999.  ""I  could  have  been  badly  injured  or  shot  or  anything,""  Osbourne  said.  ""I  just  thank  God  that  no-one  got  injured.""  He  added  he  was  glad  the  intruders  were  not  hurt.  ""I  wouldn't  want  anyone  to  get  injured.""  The  singer  did  not  want  to  talk  in  detail  about  his  actions  but  when  asked  whether  he  would  do  the  same  again  replied:  ""Is  the  Pope  a  Catholic?""  The  incident  happened  at  0400  GMT  on  Monday  in  Chalfont  St  Peter.  Detective  Inspector  Paul  Miller  of  Thames  Valley  Police  said  it  appeared  a  man  used  a  ladder  to  get  into  the  house  through  a  first  floor  bedroom  window.  ""Whilst  selecting  items  of  jewellery,  the  burglar  was  disturbed  by  Ozzy  who  very  courageously  tackled  this  burglar  and  pursued  him  from  the  house,""  he  said.  Ozzy  said  he  was  ""just  coming  to  grips""  with  what  had  happened  and  his  opinion  of  the  UK  had  been  lowered  after  12  relatively  trouble-free  years  in  the  US.  |||    ""We  lived  in  Los  Angeles  where  people  get  shot  every  day  and  have  been  trailed  by  lots  of  different  stalkers  -  and  yet  we  come  back  to  England  and  I'm  very  disappointed.""  At  a  press  conference  on  Tuesday,  Sharon  Osbourne  gave  details  of  nine  stolen  items.  They  included  a  diamond  wedding  ring  and  two  handmade  wedding  bands  Ozzy  gave  her  when  they  renewed  their  vows  two  years  ago.  She  said  she  wished  she  had  worn  them  at  night.  ""I  always  take  them  off  and  put  them  beside  my  bed  and  that's  where  they  were,  right  beside  me  on  my  bedside  table.""  Also  taken  were  a  pearl  necklace  and  a  sapphire  bought  as  an  investment  for  their  daughters  described  by  Sharon  as  ""one  of  the  only  24-carat  sapphires  that  is  absolutely  pure"".  |||    A  daisy  chain  necklace  that  was  a  20th  anniversary  present  and  a  Franck  Muller  watch  Sharon  said  was  one  of  only  10  made  were  also  stolen.  She  expressed  her  anger  at  the  person  who  ""hasn't  worked  and  wants  to  take  what's  yours"".  ""But  the  thing  is,  we  worked  for  everything.  I  came  from  Brixton.  Ozzy  came  from  not  a  very  nice  part  of  Birmingham  and  everything  we've  got  we  have  worked  our  arses  off  for.""  ""If  I  choose  to  make  an  investment  for  my  kids  in  whatever  way  I  choose  to  make  it,  that's  my  business  and  I  worked  for  every  God  damn  penny.""  Ozzy  also  lamented  two  years  in  which  the  family  has  been  plagued  by  problems,  including  his  critical  injury  in  a  quad  bike  accident,  his  wife's  colon  cancer,  their  childrens'  drug  problems  and  now  the  burglary.  |||    On  Sunday  night,  the  Osbournes  had  been  celebrating  the  birthday  of  singer  Sir  Elton  John's  partner  David  Furnish.  Police  described  the  intruder  as  well-built,  about  5'  10""  tall  and  said  he  was  wearing  a  ski-mask,  a  light-coloured  jacket  and  trainers.  They  believe  he  may  have  injured  himself  when  he  jumped  from  the  window.  There  is  no  description  of  his  accomplice.  Police  think  the  pair  were  driving  a  large  vehicle,  possibly  a  van,  and  are  keen  to  hear  from  anyone  who  may  have  seen  one  leaving  Chalfont  St  Peter  at  speed.  Police  appealed  for  public  help  to  find  the  perpetrators  and  stolen  items  on  0845  8  505  505  or  0800  555  111."

1	"Brits  debate  over  'urban'  music  |||    Joss  Stone,  a  17-year-old  soul  singer  from  Devon,  beat  Dizzee  Rascal,  Jamelia,  Lemar  and  The  Streets  to  win  best  British  urban  act  at  the  Brit  Awards.  Her  victory  has  reignited  the  debate  about  what  urban  music  is.  |||      |||      |||    I'm  not  really  comfortable  with  the  word  urban.  It's  a  word  that's  been  manufactured  in  this  country  and  America  to  describe  black  music.  The  word  urban  seems  to  cover  such  a  broad  range  of  black  music  that  it's  wrong.  How  far  are  the  Brits  removed  from  inner-city  music  and  what  people  are  doing?  It's  so  far  removed  that  I  don't  expect  them  to  get  it  bang  on.  The  music  industry  isn't  championing  music  from  our  particular  genre  very  well  anyway.  People  don't  feel  like  that's  anything  to  do  with  us.  I  don't  feel  like  urban  music's  just  been  celebrated  by  [Joss  Stone]  winning  or  her  being  nominated,  or  by  the  Brits  acknowledging  that  there's  an  urban  music  scene  because  it's  all  a  kick  in  the  teeth  at  the  end  of  the  day.  It's  not  really  relevant.  If  Joss  Stone  is  the  closest  thing  that  they  feel  comfortable  championing  because  of  what  she  looks  like  and  how  she  sounds  and  who  she's  signed  to,  then  so  be  it.  It's  got  nothing  to  do  with  what's  really  going  on.  |||      |||    Urban  as  a  genre  is  very  broad.  If  you  look  underneath  urban,  there  are  a  number  of  core  elements  that  include  hip-hop,  R&B,  garage  and  into  that  obviously  comes  soul.  Joss  Stone  is  a  soul  artist.  Her  first  album  was  called  The  Soul  Sessions.  So  urban  is  a  very  broad  brushstroke  that  is  the  umbrella  over  the  top  of  sub-genres,  and  there  are  offshoots  of  all  of  those.  Joss  Stone  has  had  amazing  success  [in  the  US]  given  that  she's  a  UK  artist.  What  has  really  captured  everybody's  imagination  is  that  here  you  have  a  17-year-old  from  Devon  with  a  voice  to  die  for  and  a  bunch  of  really,  really  good  tunes  and  she  looks  good  -  I  think  that's  what's  done  it.  |||    The  award  for  best  British  urban  act  was  voted  for  by  viewers  of  MTV  Base.  |||      |||    I  don't  think  Joss  was  not  a  worthy  winner.  She  makes  soul  music  and  that  definitely  comes  under  the  category  of  what  we  describe  as  urban.  The  fact  that  she's  from  Devon  is  the  interesting  thing  because  most  of  the  music  we  cover  is  made  in  large  cities  and  she's  literally  rural.  The  great  thing  about  urban  music  is  that  there's  a  big  range.  If  there  is  some  sort  of  root  with  black  music  or  dance  music  in  Britain,  I  think  that's  where  you  can  call  it  urban  -  that's  where  this  new  sub-category,  or  uber-category,  has  come  from.  Joss  Stone  is  certainly  not  old  enough  to  have  had  some  of  the  experiences  of  an  older  soul  singer,  but  you  couldn't  argue  that  she  was  being  inauthentic  with  her  emotions  -  it  is  coming  from  somewhere  genuine.  It  has  to  come  across  as  real.  That's  the  only  cut-off  point  we  have  here  and  that's  the  only  way  by  which  we  judge  people.  |||      |||    What  urban  means  to  us  as  an  organisation  is  the  politically  correct  term  to  describe  music  which  originated  from  a  black  background.  Music  should  become  inclusive  and  if  we  are  fighting  for  a  multi-cultural  Britain,  then  we  should  be  fighting  for  inclusion  rather  than  exclusion.  If  Joss  Stone  can  be  accepted  within  the  urban  music  community,  I  think  acts  from  other  ethnicities  doing  classical  music  and  rock  should  be  accepted  too.  Race  doesn't  make  a  difference  if  everyone  is  included.  Out  of  all  the  awards  dished  out  yesterday,  I'm  still  trying  to  find  out  what  people  of  other  races  received  any  sort  of  recognition  or  award.  |||      |||    A  type  of  music  (especially  street  music)  that  originates  from  a  city,  and  typically  reflects  or  is  characteristic  of  urban  life.  |||    She  might  not  be  urban,  but  when  did  R&B  become  the  hip  hop  tainted  thing  it  is  now?  R&B  stands  for  Rhythm  And  Blues,  remember!  |||    That  Joss  Stone  is  rubbish  is  certain.  If  anyone  deserves  to  win  an  award  for  urban  music  (I  think  probably  should  include  Hip-Hop,  Soul  &  Funk  at  least  but  not  rock  or  pop)  this  year  its  the  Streets,  although  Dizzee  Rascal  stakes  a  good  claim  |||    She  definitely  deserved  to  win  a  prize,  Joss  Stone's  albums  are  quite  simply  amazing,  easily  better  than  anything  else  that  was  released  last  year.  This  whole  debate  about  what  is  urban,  what  isnt  urban  is  completely  pointless  and  probably  fueled  by  urban  artists  who  weren't  nominated  or  didn't  win.  I  cant  see  why  people  can't  just  congratulate  her  for  the  talent  that  she  is.  |||    She  did  deserve  it,  but  I  agree  with  the  comments  about  urban  music.  Its  a  stupid  phrase,  and  particularly  British.  In  the  states  they  tend  to  use  hip  hop  and  R&B,  if  I  say  hip  hop  here  a  lot  of  people  have  no  idea  what  I'm  talking  about.  Very  strange.  |||    What's  in  a  name?  A  rose  by  any  other  name  etc...  If  people  want  to  call  it  urban,  why  not?  If  we  really  analysed  it,  the  term  'dance  music'  is  misleading  because  it  doesn't  describe  everything  you  can  dance  to.  |||    Whilst  I  agree  that  the  term  'urban'  is  open  to  interpretation,  it  strikes  me  as  simply  weird  that  Joss  Stone  has  won.  'Urban'  to  me  is  what  I  hear  being  played  in  parties  in  the  inner  cities  -  I  live  in  Brixton  and  have  never  heard  The  Soul  Sessions  pumping  out  of  of  a  bass  heavy  sound  system  in  any  parties  I've  been  to.  Good  luck  to  Joss  Stone,  let's  celebrate  her  victory  -  let's  also  question  why,  with  artists  so  successful  and  talented  as  Jamelia,  Lemar,  Kanye  West,  Dizzee  Rascal,  Alicia  Keys  and  Outkast  -  we  didn't  see  a  single  black  artist  on  stage  collecting  an  award.  |||    So,  what  you're  saying  is  that  any  music  that  has  black  heritage  is  not  allowed  to  be  sung  by  anyone  who  isn't  black.  And,  if  it  is,  then  they  shouldn't  be  acknowledged  for  it  even  if  they're  pretty  dam  good  at  it?  She's  17,  has  an  amazing  voice,  and  won.  Good  on  her.  Oh,  but  she's  not  ""black""  well,  let's  make  her  feel  real  bad  about  it  then.  How  dare  she!  Though  hang  on,  didn't  the  so-called  'public'  vote  on  this  one?  |||    This  idea  of  pigeonholing  whatever  is  popular  at  the  time  is  no  different  than  what  was  happening  in  the  1940s  and  50s  in  relation  to  what  ""Jazz""  was.  The  media  then  called  anything  that  had  a  swinging  beat,  syncopated  melody  or  soulful  feeling  ""Jazz"",  much  to  the  chagrin  of  the  artists.  It  would  mean  that  ""blues""  would  be  put  in  the  same  mould  as  ""bebop"",  ""cool""  and  ""ragtime"",  all  very  different  styles  at  that  time.  Jazz  was  and  remains  such  a  massively  misunderstood  term.  And  so  what  of  ""Urban""  music?  In  truth  it's  a  lazy  term  to  categorise  music  that  you  don't  really  understand.  Soul  and  garage  are  worlds  apart  musically  (Marvin  Gaye  v  Tuff  Jam?),  but  no  doubt  have  their  connections.  If  we  just  let  the  music  speak  for  itself  and  not  judge  the  success  of  an  artist  by  the  number  of  awards  won,  then  maybe  we  can  enjoy  the  music  for  what  it  is,  rather  than  what  it  represents.  |||    I  demand  a  prize  for  rural  music!  Sucks  to  the  cities-  it's  way  better  out  here.  We  have  hay,  for  one  thing.  |||    Excluding  her  from  what  has  become  known  as  urban  music  would  be  as  bad  as  excluding  Lenny  Kravitz  or  Hendrix  from  rock  music  for  being  black  surely?  I  dont  understand  the  point  that  Ty  is  making.  If  Lemar,  who  makes  music  which  is  less  soulful  than  Joss'  work  won,  he  might  have  said  nothing.  (btw  i'm  black  too)  |||    How  can  she  be  ""urban""  if  she  spent  most  of  her  life  in  the  Devon  countryside?  Nonsense.  |||    I  love  Joss  to  bits  and  don't  care  what  her  branding  is  -  it's  amazing  music,  full  stop.  Stop  puting  it  all  in  brackets  and  let's  just  call  it  music,  and  let's  especially  drop  the  black  /  urban  tag  -  nearly  all  music  came  from  black  origin,  this  just  sets  an  example  that  it  is  ok  to  pigeonhole  people  and  their  music  by  their  colour.  |||    Surely  the  point  of  having  an  urban  music  category  is  simply  to  acknowledge  artists  that  are  making  what  is  (historically)  considered  urban  music,  irrelevent  of  the  colour  of  their  skin,  or  where  they  originate  from.  Joss  Stone  is  simply  singing  a  certain  type  of  music  that  can  be  considered  urban  in  style,  just  as  someone  from  an  inner  city,  and  indeed  not  from  the  USA  could  sing  country  music.  If  that  person  was  good  at  it  and  authentic  in  sound,  would  we  criticise  it  being  referred  to  as  country  music  or  the  artist  for  representing  that  style?  |||    The  term  urban  in  reference  to  a  music  genre  in  UK  has  developed,  in  part,  from  the  controversy  surrounding  the  branding  of  the  MOBO  Awards.  The  very  term  'Music  of  Black  Origin'  has  confused  and  offended  many  people.  This  is  particularly  strange  given  the  existence  of  the  Asian  Music  Awards.  It  appears  that  the  use  of  'black'  or  'white'  in  relation  to  music  makes  people  feel  uncomfortable.  The  term  'urban'  therefore,  has  been  invoked  to  sidestep  the  debate  of  which  type  of  music  came  first  'black'  or  'white'  thereby  rendering  the  issue  colourblind.  The  result  is  now  a  redundant  new  debate  as  to  what  'urban'  also  means.  Perhaps  we  should  have  created  a  new  term  altogether  to  describe  the  various  strains  of  soul/RnB  and  Hip-Hop,  one  which  does  not  also  mean  something  else  -  as  we  have  done  with  'Crunk'.  |||    Urban  is  just  a  word  that's  come  about  recently  to  describe  ""black""  music  that's  become  popular  now.  The  word  wasn't  even  in  use,  or  common  use  five  of  six  years  ago.  It's  just  a  way  of  the  industry  clumping  it  all  together  without  having  to  call  it  black  music,  because  some  people  are  oversensitive  and  might  call  them  racist  for  it.  |||    I'm  in  a  band  that  has  been  called  ""urban"",  and  I  despise  the  label.  I'd  hate  to  think  I  belonged  to  any  neat  marketing  niche,  because  that's  all  it  is.  Ever  since  the  music  channels  and  record  comapnies  tried  to  fracture  what  they  consider  'music  of  black  origin',  these  labels  have  been  used  to  undermine  the  status  of  good  music  into  a  commodity.  Look  at  all  the  TV  broadcasters,  unable  to  reach  young  people  without  condesending,  they  simply  play  some  'urban'  music  on  the  soundtrack  as  if  its  some  dreadful  cheap  lift  music.  Ignore  the  labels,  it  is  what  it  is,  just  music.  |||    As  a  black  man,  I  think  I  agree  with  some  of  the  statements  at  least  the  statements  made  by  the  key  executives.  Black  people  should  lead  the  music  they  invented  .  We  should  stop  calling  a  genre  meaningless,  northing  is  meaningless.  The  real  question  is  would  Joss  Stone  would  have  been  that  successful  doing  the  music  she  was  doing  if  she  were  black?  Same  thing,  with  Streets,  Amy  Winehouse,  etc.  Who's  ever  heard  of  Terri  Walker  or  Rhian  Benson..  They  are  both  10  times  better  than  Joss  Stone  and  both  of  them  have  won  Urban  Music  Awards  and  i  think  Mobos  ,  but  why  not  Brits????  |||    So  what  if  Joss  Stone  won  the  Urban  awards.  Her  music  is  great  soul  and  surely  that  is  under  the  'Urban'  banner?  What  if  The  Streets  had  won?  Would  people  be  whining  because  Mike  Skinner  is  white...  It  seems  that  a  lot  of  the  fuss  is  about  race  where  the  real  issue  should  be  music  and  nothing  else.  |||    Urban  is  PC  version  for  saying  black  music.  I'm  not  doubting  Ms  Stone's  talent,  but  why  didn't  Jamelia  or  Lemar  get  a  Brit?  This  reminds  me  of  what  happened  to  Craig  David  and  Soul  II  Soul  in  the  past,  getting  nominations  are  easy  to  get,  but  picking  up  a  Brit  seems  to  be  the  hardest  thing.  |||    Refreshing  to  see  people  making  reasonable,  intelligent  comments  on  any  topic  these  days.  More  power  to  you,  people!  You  have  said  it:  there  is  music  you  like  and  music  you  don't  like  -  who  cares  what  label  you  put  on  it?  |||    That  entire  category  was  a  mess.  How  can  you  have  people  like  Dizzee  Rascal  up  against  Joss  Stone?  Its  like  putting  Eminem  against  Bob  Geldof.  She  should  have  been  nominated  for  Best  British  R  &  B  act.  Joss  Stone  deserved  to  win  an  award  for  her  talents,  but  I  don't  think  it  was  very  'urban'  of  her  to  sing  angels  with  Robbie  Williams.  |||    Urban  is  a  nonsense  term  -  music  of  black  origin?  Well  doesn't  that  include  rock?  Music  made  in  the  inner  cities?  Well  almost  all  bands  end  up  making  music  in  London/Manchester  etc.  And  doesn't  that  make  some  weird  implication  that  all  black  people  live  in  cities?  It  doesn't  make  any  sense.  |||    Why  does  music  have  to  be  put  into  a  genre?  It's  music,  you  like  it  or  you  don't.  Simple  as  that.  |||    I  play  in  a  heavy  metal  band.  We  are  urban  music  as  far  as  I'm  concerned.  We  live  in  cities  and  spend  our  working  life  in  an  urban  environment;  It  therefore  directly  shapes  what  we  write  musically.  |||    ""Urban""  seems  to  be  the  new  name  for  all  styles  of  black  music.  Why  it  needed  a  rebrand  I  don't  know  as  the  name  is  misleading.  Oasis  originate  from  a  city  and  characterise  the  urban  life  they  know,  therefore  more  than  fit  the  term  ""urban""  yet  as  they're  a  white  rock  band  they  won't  be  described  as  such.  |||    Joss  Stone  has  a  fantastic  voice  and  great  timing  and  delivery  -  what  other  reason  do  they  need  to  award  her  the  Brit?  All  this  ""urban""  and  other  such  categorisation  is  just  the  red-tape  of  the  music  business  and  is  best  ignored.  |||    Yeah,  she  deserved  it.  She  is  talented.  Urban  is  a  crap,  meaningless,  politically  correct  and  probably  actually  racist  marketing  term  though.  There's  only  two  kinds  of  music:  good  and  bad."

Krispy  Kreme  said  accounting  errors  had  forced  the  move,  adding  that  its  board  of  directors  made  the  decision  to  restate  its  accounts  on  28  December.  However,  the  company  was  unavailable  to  comment  on  why  it  had  delayed  the  news.  |||    It  also  warned  it  might  have  to  further  restate  results  for  2004  and  2005.  |||    Shares  in  Krispy  Kreme  sank  14.87%  -  or  $1.83  -  to  close  at  $10.48  on  the  news.  The  revelation  comes  just  a  month  after  the  firm  warned  earnings  would  be  cut  by  as  much  as  7.6%  as  a  result  of  accounting  errors.  Krispy  Kreme  said  the  latest  adjustments  involved  the  way  it  accounted  for  the  repurchase  of  three  franchise  restaurants.  It  added  it  would  now  be  reviewing  how  it  accounts  for  its  leases.  In  a  further  blow,  the  firm  said  it  had  been  advised  that  some  of  its  franchise  owners  were  not  in  compliance  with  their  loan  agreements,  and  warned  it  might  need  to  borrow  extra  money  if  it  was  required  to  honour  agreements  on  franchisee  debts  or  operating  leases.  |||    Krispy  Kreme  added  that  it  had  enough  cash  to  fund  its  current  operations,  but  it  could  not  borrow  any  more  under  its  existing  agreements.  ""There  are  many  more  questions  than  answers,  especially  given  increased  concerns  regarding  company  liquidity,""  JP  Morgan  Securities  analyst  John  Ivankoe  said  in  a  research  note  on  the  firm.  The  announcement  is  the  latest  blow  for  the  one-time  darling  of  Wall  Street,  which  has  lost  80%  of  its  stock  value  in  just  over  a  year.  The  firm  is  currently  facing  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  investigation  of  its  accounts.  Shareholders  have  also  launched  lawsuits  against  the  group,  claiming  it  made  false  statements  and  inflated  sales."

A  tour  bus  used  by  Charles  and  his  entourage  over  the  years  will  also  be  on  permanent  display.  It  is  hoped  the  museum  will  be  ready  for  visitors  in  late  2007.  |||    Mr  Digney  said  the  recording  studio  and  offices  had  been  used  by  Charles  for  many  years,  and  was  where  he  recorded  much  of  his  last  album,  Genius  Loves  Company.  It  is  hoped  the  museum  will  also  house  an  education  centre.  The  building  had  been  declared  a  historic  landmark  by  the  city  of  Los  Angeles  just  before  Charles'  death  in  June  2004  at  the  age  of  73.  Following  his  death,  Charles  won  eight  Grammy  Awards,  including  album  of  the  year  for  Genius  Loves  Company,  a  collection  of  duets."

Edwards  then  left  in  a  surprise  eviction,  with  12%  of  the  vote.  Nineteen-year-old  Blazin'  Squad  singer  Kenzie  is  currently  favourite  to  win  the  £50,000  charity  prize.  Caprice  had  been  the  pre-show  favourite  to  be  voted  out  of  the  house,  with  bookmakers  Ladbrokes  offering  odds  of  1/5  on  her  departure.  Ladbrokes  spokesman  Warren  Lush  had  said  she  was  ""the  hottest  eviction  favourite  so  far  this  series"".  |||    Odds  on  Kenzie's  victory  have  been  slashed  from  4/6  to  1/2,  although  bookmakers  have  said  they  are  not  ruling  out  a  late  rally  from  former  Happy  Mondays  star  Bez.  The  other  remaining  housemate  is  actress  Brigitte  Nielsen.  DJ  Lisa  I'Anson  became  the  third  housemate  to  be  voted  out  on  Wednesday  when  she  became  the  victim  of  a  surprise  eviction  during  a  game  of  hide-and-seek  on  the  Channel  4  show.  I'Anson  said  she  was  ""glad  to  be  out""  and  predicted  that  Kenzie  would  emerge  as  the  winner.  The  winner  is  due  to  be  announced  on  Sunday  night."

The  CBI  also  found  spending  on  innovation,  training  and  retraining  is  forecast  to  go  up  over  the  next  year.  However,  firms  continue  to  scale  back  investment  in  buildings  and  machinery.  |||    The  CBI  said  companies  are  looking  to  the  government  to  lessen  the  regulatory  load  and  are  hoping  interest  rates  will  be  kept  on  hold.  ""Smaller  manufacturers  are  facing  an  uphill  struggle,""  said  Hugh  Morgan  Williams,  chair  of  the  CBI's  SME  Council.  ""The  manufacturing  sector  needs  a  period  of  long-term  stability  in  the  economy.""  The  CBI  found  some  firms  managed  to  increase  prices  for  the  first  time  in  nine  years  -  but  many  said  increases  failed  to  keep  up  the  rise  in  costs.  Of  the  companies  surveyed,  30%  saw  orders  rise  and  27%  saw  them  fall.  The  positive  balance  of  plus  3  compared  with  minus  10  in  the  previous  survey.  When  firms  were  questioned  on  output  volume,  the  survey  returned  a  balance  of  plus  8  -  the  highest  rate  of  increase  for  seven  years  -  and  rose  to  plus  11  when  looking  ahead  to  the  next  three  months."

The  government's  main  problems  are  ""slumping  consumption  and  a  contraction  in  the  construction  industry"".  It  aims  to  create  400,000  jobs  and  will  focus  on  infrastructure  and  home  building,  as  well  as  providing  public  firms  with  money  to  hire  new  workers.  |||    The  government  has  set  an  economic  growth  rate  target  of  5%  for  next  year  and  hinted  that  would  be  in  danger  unless  it  took  action.  ""Internal  and  external  economic  conditions  are  likely  to  remain  unfavourable  in  2005,""  the  Finance  and  Economy  Ministry  said  in  a  statement.  |||    It  blamed  ""continuing  uncertainties  such  as  fluctuating  oil  prices  and  foreign  exchange  rates  and  stagnant  domestic  demand  that  has  shown  few  signs  of  a  quick  rebound"".  In  2004,  growth  will  be  between  4.7%  and  4.8%,  the  ministry  said.  Not  everyone  is  convinced  the  plan  will  work.  ""Our  primary  worry  centres  on  the  what  we  believe  is  the  government's  overly  optimistic  view  that  its  front  loading  of  the  budget  will  be  enough  to  turn  the  economy  around,""  consultancy  4Cast  said  in  a  report.  |||    The  problem  facing  South  Korea  is  that  many  consumers  are  reeling  from  the  effects  of  a  credit  bubble  that  only  recently  burst.  Millions  of  South  Koreans  are  defaulting  on  their  credit  card  bills,  and  the  country's  biggest  card  lender  has  been  hovering  on  the  verge  of  bankruptcy  for  months.  As  part  of  its  spending  plans,  the  government  said  it  will  ask  firms  to  ""roll  over  mortgage  loans  that  come  due  in  the  first  half  of  2005""  .  It  also  pledged  to  look  at  ways  of  helping  families  on  low  incomes.  |||    The  government  voiced  concern  about  the  effect  of  redundancies  in  the  building  trade.  ""Given  the  economic  spill  over  and  employment  effect  in  the  construction  sector,  a  sharp  downturn  in  the  construction  industry  could  have  other  adverse  effects,""  the  ministry  said.  |||    As  a  result,  South  Korea  will  give  private  companies  also  will  be  given  the  chance  to  build  schools,  hospitals,  houses  and  other  public  buildings.  It  also  will  look  at  real  estate  tax  system.  Other  plans  on  the  table  include  promoting  new  industries  such  as  bio-technology  and  nano-technology,  as  well  as  offering  increased  support  to  small  and  medium  sized  businesses.  ""The  focus  will  be  on  job  creation  and  economic  recovery,  given  that  unfavourable  domestic  and  global  conditions  are  likely  to  dog  the  Korean  economy  in  2005,""  the  ministry  said." 

0	"Profits  stall  at  China's  Lenovo  |||    Profits  at  Chinese  computer  firm  Lenovo  have  stood  still  amid  slowing  demand  at  home  and  stiffening  competition.  |||    The  firm  is  in  the  international  spotlight  after  last  year  signing  a  deal  to  buy  the  PC  division  of  personal  computer  pioneer  IBM.  Lenovo's  profit  for  the  three  months  to  December  was  HK$327m  (US$42m;  £22m),  less  than  1%  up  on  the  year  before.  Chinese  PC  sales  have  risen  by  a  fifth  in  each  of  the  past  two  years,  but  are  now  growing  more  slowly.  The  company  is  still  by  far  the  biggest  player  in  China,  with  more  than  a  quarter  of  the  market.  But  Western  firms  such  as  Dell  and  Hewlett-Packard  are  also  mounting  a  more  solid  fight  for  market  share  in  China,  and  Lenovo's  sales  were  down  3.7%  by  revenue  to  HK$6.31bn.  |||    If  the  $1.75bn  agreement  Lenovo  signed  with  IBM  on  8  December  goes  through,  it  will  mark  the  end  of  an  era.  IBM  pioneered  the  desktop  PC  market  in  the  early  1980s,  although  strategic  mis-steps  helped  lose  it  its  early  dominance.  In  any  case,  margins  in  PC  market  are  now  wafer  thin,  and  profits  have  been  hard  to  come  by  for  most  vendors  except  direct-sales  giant  Dell.  But  investors  have  been  less  than  impressed  with  Lenovo's  move,  designed  to  take  it  out  of  China  and  further  onto  the  world  stage.  Its  shares  are  down  20%  since  the  announcement  two  months  ago,  largely  because  of  the  unprofitability  of  the  unit  it  is  buying.  There  have  been  rumours  that  the  deal  could  be  in  trouble  because  US  government  agencies  fear  it  could  offer  China  opportunities  for  industrial  espionage.  The  reports  of  the  possibility  of  an  investigation  into  the  risk  sent  Lenovo's  shares  up  6%  in  late  January." 

2	"Kilroy  launches  'Veritas'  party  |||    Ex-BBC  chat  show  host  and  East  Midlands  MEP  Robert  Kilroy-Silk  has  said  he  wants  to  ""change  the  face  of  British  politics""  as  he  launched  his  new  party.  |||    Mr  Kilroy-Silk,  who  recently  quit  the  UK  Independence  Party,said  ""our  country""  was  being  ""stolen  from  us""  by  mass  immigration.  He  told  a  London  news  conference  that  Veritas  -  Latin  for  ""truth""  -  would  avoid  the  old  parties'  ""lies  and  spin"".  UKIP  leader  Roger  Knapman  says  he  was  glad  to  see  the  back  of  Mr  Kilroy-Silk.  |||    Mr  Kilroy-Silk  promised  a  ""firm  but  fair""  policy  on  immigration  and  said  they  hoped  to  contest  most  seats  at  the  forthcoming  general  election.  He  said  Veritas  would  also  announce  detailed  policies  on  crime,  tax,  pensions,  health  and  defence  over  the  next  few  weeks.  And  he  announced  the  party  would  be  holding  a  leadership  election.  On  Thursday  he  is  due  to  announce  which  constituency  he  will  run  in  at  the  next  general  election  -  that  will  come  amid  speculation  he  has  his  sights  set  on  Defence  Secretary  Geoff  Hoon's  Ashfield  seat.  He  was  joined  in  the  new  venture  by  one  of  UKIP's  two  London  Assembly  members,  Damien  Hockney  who  is  now  Veritas'  deputy  leader.  UKIP's  chairman  Petrina  Holdsworth  has  said  the  group  will  just  be  a  parody  of  the  party  the  men  have  left.  |||    Mr  Kilroy-Silk  announced  his  decision  to  quit  UKIP  at  a  public  meeting  in  Hinckley,  Leicestershire  last  week.  It  came  after  months  of  tension  as  he  vied  unsuccessfully  for  the  leadership  of  that  party.  He  said  he  was  ashamed  to  be  a  member  of  a  UKIP  whose  leadership  had  ""gone  AWOL""  after  the  great  opportunity  offered  by  its  third  place  at  last  June's  European  elections.  ""While  UKIP  has  turned  its  back  on  the  British  people,  I  shall  not,""  he  said.  ""I  will  be  standing  at  the  next  general  election.  I  shall  be  leading  a  vigorous  campaign  for  the  causes  I  believe  in.  ""And,  unlike  the  old  parties,  we  shall  be  honest,  open  and  straight.""  |||    Mr  Hockney  also  left  UKIP  saying  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  would  ""deliver  better""  as  the  leader  of  a  Eurosceptic  party.  A  spokesman  for  UKIP  called  on  Mr  Hockney  to  quit  the  London  Assembly.  The  party  asserts  that  Mr  Hockney  ""has  a  moral  obligation,  if  not  a  legal  one""  to  stand  down.  Its  leader,  Roger  Knapman,  has  said  he  is  glad  to  see  the  back  of  Mr  Kilroy-Silk.  ""He  has  remarkable  ability  to  influence  people  but,  sadly,  after  the  [European]  election  it  became  clear  that  he  was  more  interested  in  the  Robert  Kilroy-Silk  Party  than  the  UK  Independence  Party  so  it  was  nice  knowing  him,  now  'goodbye',""  he  said.  UKIP  officials  also  argue  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  has  not  been  ""straightforward""  in  attacking  the  party  he  once  wanted  to  lead.  |||    This  is  just  what  the  Europhiles  pray  for.  As  the  main  Eurosceptic  party,  UKIP  should  try  to  resolve  its  differences  with  Kilroy  to  show  a  united  front  and  give  the  UK  public  a  serious  political  voice  against  Europe.  Having  multiple  parties  with  the  same  view  point  just  splits  the  vote  further.  |||    Thank  goodness  that  Kilroy-Silk  has  gone  -  now  UKIP  at  least  has  a  chance  in  the  election!  |||    It  is  very  sad  to  see  the  cause  of  Britain  regaining  its  proper  relationship  with  Europe  damaged  by  this  split  within  UKIP.  Robert  Kilroy-Silk  could  have  a  lot  to  offer.  Instead  we  have  a  split  party  and  a  damaged  cause.  Under  the  present  electoral  system,  people  must  work  together,  and  small  parties  have  no  hope  of  representation.  Last  summer,  UKIP  achieved  a  major  advance,  partly  and  only  partly  due  to  Kilroy-Silk.  It  is  a  great  shame  this  has  been  dissipated  in  in-fighting.  |||    UKIP  has  a  wide  platform  of  policies,  not  just  withdrawal  from  the  EU.  This  Kilroy-Silk  conveniently  ignores  in  the  comments  surrounding  the  launch  of  his  own  party.  Neither  the  English  Democrats  nor  the  New  Party  were  interested  in  letting  him  join  them  and  take  over  their  leadership  speaks  volumes.  Veritas  is  the  beginning  of  the  end  for  Kilroy-Silk.  |||    If  he  believes  in  truth  and  democracy  then  he  and  the  two  assembly  members  should  resign  and  force  a  by-elections  to  stand  on  their  own  platform  rather  than  this  backdoor  approach  to  politics  of  being  elected  for  one  party  then  defecting  to  another.  |||    So  UKIP  was  good  enough  for  him  to  lead,  not  good  enough  for  him  to  follow!  |||    Interesting  that  a  party  committed  to  plain  speaking  should  have  a  Latin  name!  |||    Every  opinion  poll  points  to  an  overwhelming  anti-Europe  feeling  in  this  country.  Kilroy-Silk  could  be  on  the  verge  of  something  huge  if  he  can  broaden  his  appeal  beyond  this  one  issue.  He  is  an  extremely  able  communicator  with  years  of  political  experience.  We  wants  quality  schools,  top  hospitals,  clean  and  efficient  public  transport,  punishments  that  fit  the  crime,  limited  asylum,  a  purge  on  bureaucracy  and  less  taxes.  It  needs  courage  and  honesty,  two  qualities  sadly  lacking  in  our  politicians.  Kilroy-Silk  may  just  have  those  very  qualities.  Recruit  the  right  colleagues,  Robert,  and  your  time  may  have  come!  |||    Well  if  you  cannot  get  enough  limelight  being  an  ordinary  MP  then  go  out  and  start  up  your  own  Party.  It's  all  flash  and  no  real  policy  here  |||    Let's  hope  this  is  the  start  of  both  UKIP  and  Kilroy-Silk  slipping  into  obscurity.  |||    Veritas?  The  name  will  doom  it.  But  perhaps  I  am  wrong  for  surely  all  modern  schoolchildren  will  understand  it  since  they  do  still  learn  Latin  in  the  classroom  do  they  not?  The  whole  essence  of  what  RKS  represents  is  Euroscepticism,  so  explain  to  me  how  the  too-twee  label  of  Veritas  symbolises  that?"

The  gains  tracked  a  surge  in  US  gasoline  futures  to  a  record  high  of  $1.4850  a  gallon.  The  jump  followed  a  fire  at  Western  Refining  Company's  refinery  in  Texas,  which  shut  down  petrol  production.  A  spokesman  for  the  group  was  unable  to  say  when  the  production  unit  would  be  back  up  and  running.  ""This  market  simply  wants  to  go  up,""  Citigroup  Global  Markets  analyst  Kyle  Cooper  told  Reuters  news  agency.  Ed  Silliere,  analyst  at  Energy  Merchant,  added:  ""Gasoline  is  up  because  of  the  refinery  issues  in  Texas,  which  means  there  will  be  a  scramble  for  product  in  the  (US)  Gulf  Coast.""  |||    Elsewhere,  a  refinery  in  Houston  was  closed  due  to  mechanical  problems,  while  on  Tuesday  production  at  BP's  Texas  City  refinery  was  taken  down  for  a  short  time.  In  the  approach  to  Spring,  the  market  becomes  much  more  sensitive  to  problems  with  petrol  production  as  dealers  anticipate  rising  demand  for  fuel  ahead  of  the  holiday  season.  The  rise  in  prices  came  despite  a  US  government  report  that  showed  domestic  supplies  of  fuel  oil  and  fuel  were  rising.  Meanwhile,  oil  production  cartel  Opec's  recent  announcement  that  it  was  now  unlikely  to  cut  production  levels  has  also  failed  to  calm  fears  on  the  market.  Oil  prices  are  roughly  45%  higher  than  a  year  ago  and  have  risen  sharply  in  recent  weeks  due  to  a  combination  of  colder  weather,  the  declining  value  of  the  dollar  and  fears  that  Opec  could  rein  in  production  to  head  off  a  seasonal  drop  in  demand.  Instability  in  Iraq  and  underlying  fears  about  terrorism  have  also  played  a  part  in  the  rally." 

2	"Brown  shrugs  off  economy  fears  |||    Gordon  Brown  is  to  freeze  petrol  duty  increases,  fund  a  £1bn  package  to  avoid  big  council  tax  rises  and  boost  childcare  and  maternity  leave.  |||    In  an  upbeat  pre-Budget  report,  he  slightly  increased  borrowing  but  insisted  economic  targets  would  be  met.  The  chancellor  also  hailed  the  longest  period  of  growth  in  UK  ""industrial  history""  but  denied  he  was  ""gloating"".  But  Oliver  Letwin,  for  the  Tories,  attacked  government  red  tape  and  debt,  dubbing  Mr  Brown  ""Sir  Wastealot"".  |||    The  shadow  chancellor  said  Mr  Brown's  ""golden  rule""  had  ""turned  to  dross  in  his  hands""  and  said  he  was  borrowing  to  spend,  not  invest,  with  predicted  debt  over  the  coming  years  totalling  £170bn.  Mr  Letwin  told  MPs:  ""The  tide  is  going  out  on  the  chancellor's  credibility.  He  is  spending,  borrowing  and  taxing  so  much  because  he  is  not  getting  value  for  taxpayer's  money.""  |||    Vincent  Cable,  for  the  Liberal  Democrats,  accused  Mr  Brown  of  ducking  tough  choices.  |||    He  said:  ""Last  week  the  prime  minister  gave  us  the  politics  of  fear;  this  week  the  chancellor  has  offered  the  economics  of  complacency.  ""There  are  serious  challenges  ahead  from  the  falling  dollar  and  from  the  rapid  downturn  in  the  UK  housing  market  and  rising  personal  debt.  But  they  have  not  been  confronted.""  Mr  Brown  rejected  the  Lib  Dem's  call  to  open  up  the  government's  books  to  the  National  Audit  Office,  saying  decisions  on  tax  and  spending  should  be  made  by  ministers.  Some  economists  say  his  forecasts  on  public  finances  are  wishful  thinking.  BBC  economic  editor  Evan  Davis  said  the  figures  were  plausible  but  also  a  gamble.  |||    Mr  Brown's  insistence  he  was  not  ""gloating""  was  a  pointed  rebuttal  of  a  warning  from  new  European  Commissioner  Peter  Mandelson.  In  his  speech,  he  set  out  a  10-year  childcare  strategy  for  if  Labour  wins  the  next  election.  |||    It  includes  a  £285m  cash  injection  to  extend  paid  maternity  leave  from  six  months  to  nine,  with  parents  able  to  transfer  leave  from  the  mother  to  the  father.  He  also  promised  to  increase  free  nursery  education  for  three  and  four-year-olds  to  15  hours  from  April  2007.  And  funds  would  be  provided  to  keep  schools  open  from  0800  to  1800GMT  to  look  after  children  while  their  parents  were  at  work.  Taken  together,  the  measures  would  create  a  ""welfare  state  that  is  truly  family-friendly  for  the  first  time  in  its  history"",  said  Mr  Brown.  He  also  announced  a  cash  hand-out  for  older  pensioners,  with  payments  of  £50  for  the  over-70s  as  part  of  the  winter  fuel  allowance.  In  a  move  ministers  say  should  keep  council  tax  rises  below  5%  next  year,  the  chancellor  said  he  was  providing  an  extra  £1bn  for  local  councils.  The  money  is  expected  to  come  from  government  departments  such  as  health  and  education.  |||    Mr  Brown  said  he  was  set  to  meet  his  two  fiscal  rules  -  to  borrow  only  to  invest  and  keep  debt  ""low  and  sustainable""  -  both  in  this  economic  cycle  and  the  next.  Borrowing  figures  for  2003/4  are  £35bn  -  £2.5bn  less  than  the  £37.5bn  predicted  in  March's  budget,  as  already  announced  by  the  Office  for  National  Statistics.  Borrowing  is  tipped  to  fall  to  £31bn  by  2005/06  -  but  that  is  still  £2bn  more  than  Mr  Brown  predicted  in  his  March  budget.  Inflation  would  be  1.75%  next  year  and  2%  in  the  years  to  follow,  Mr  Brown  forecast.  He  also  pledged  an  extra  £105m  for  security  and  counter-terrorism.  Business  groups  have  welcomed  efforts  to  improve  competitiveness  and  invest  more  in  skills  and  innovation.  But  there  worries  about  the  costs  of  more  family-friendly  working.  Simon  Sweetman,  from  the  Federation  of  Small  Businesses,  said:  ""The  proposals  on  maternity  leave  have  clearly  been  made  with  a  general  election  in  mind  and  with  little  thought  to  the  impact  on  small  employers.""" 

2	"UK  heading  wrong  way  -  Howard  |||    Tony  Blair  has  had  the  chance  to  tackle  the  problems  facing  Britain  and  has  failed,  Michael  Howard  has  said.  |||    ""Britain  is  heading  in  the  wrong  direction"",  the  Conservative  leader  said  in  his  New  Year  message.  Mr  Blair's  government  was  a  ""bossy,  interfering  government  that  takes  decisions  that  should  be  made  by  individuals,""  he  added.  But  Labour's  campaign  spokesman  Fraser  Kemp  responded:  ""Britain  is  working,  don't  let  the  Tories  wreck  it  again"".  Mr  Howard  also  paid  tribute  to  the  nation's  character  for  its  generous  response  to  the  Asian  quake  disaster.  The  catastrophe  was  overshadowing  the  hopes  for  the  future  at  this  usually  positive  time  of  the  year,  Mr  Howard  said.  |||    ""We  watched  the  scenes  of  destruction  with  a  sense  of  disbelief.  The  scale,  the  speed,  the  ferocity  of  what  happened  on  Boxing  Day  is  difficult  to  grasp.  ""Yet  Britain's  response  has  shone  a  light  on  our  nation's  character.  The  last  week  has  shown  that  the  warm,  caring  heart  of  Britain  beats  as  strong  as  ever.""  He  went  on  to  reflect  on  the  values  that  ""most  Britons  hold  dear"".  Looking  ahead  to  the  coming  general  election,  he  pledged  to  ""turn  these  beliefs  into  reality""  and  set  out  the  choices  he  says  are  facing  Britain.  ""How  much  tax  do  people  want  to  pay?  Who  will  give  taxpayers  value  for  money,  the  clean  hospitals  and  good,  disciplined  schools  they  want?  ""Who  can  be  trusted  to  get  a  grip  on  the  disorder  on  our  streets  and  the  chaos  in  our  immigration  system?""  |||    Mr  Blair  has  failed  to  tackle  these  problems,  he  claimed,  saying  he  has  the  ""wrong  solution""  to  them.  |||    ""The  result  is  big  government  and  higher  taxes  eroding  incentives,  undermining  enterprise  and  denying  people  choice.  ""Worst  of  all,  it  is  a  government  that  has  wasted  people's  money  and  failed  to  tackle  the  problems  families  face  today.""  The  Tories,  he  said,  can  cut  crime  and  improve  public  services  without  asking  people  to  pay  more  taxes.  ""We  can  have  progress  without  losing  what  makes  Britain  great  -  its  tolerance,  the  respect  for  the  rule  of  law,  the  ability  of  everyone  to  fulfil  their  potential.  ""We  simply  need  to  change  direction.  The  election  will  give  Britain  the  chance  to  change.""  This  is  the  record  Mr  Blair  will  have  to  defend  in  the  coming  months,  he  said,  urging  voters  to  hold  him  to  account.  |||    But  Labour  spokesman  Mr  Kemp  said:  ""It  would  be  more  appropriate  for  this  message  to  come  out  on  1  April,  not  1  January.""  ""Let  us  never  forget  that  when  Michael  Howard  was  in  government  Britain  suffered  mass  unemployment,  15%  interest  rates,  record  home  repossessions,  and  the  introduction  of  the  poll  tax.  ""With  Labour  Britain  is  working.  Rather  than  alluding  to  false  promises  Michael  Howard  should  be  starting  2005  with  an  apology  to  the  British  people  for  the  misery  that  the  government,  of  which  he  was  a  member,  inflicted  upon  the  country." 

3	"Davenport  hits  out  at  Wimbledon  |||    World  number  one  Lindsay  Davenport  has  criticised  Wimbledon  over  the  issue  of  equal  prize  money  for  women.  |||    Reacting  to  a  disputed  comment  by  All  England  Club  chairman  Tim  Phillips,  the  American  said:  ""I  think  it  is  highly  insulting  if  prize  money  is  taken  away.  ""Somebody,  I  think  it  was  Mr  Phillips,  said  they  won't  have  money  for  flowers  at  Wimbledon.  That's  insulting.""  An  All  England  club  spokesperson  denied  Phillips  made  the  remark,  insisting:  ""He  definitely  didn't  say  it.""  The  statement  added:  ""It  was  said  by  someone  else  and  was  a  humorous  aside  at  the  end  of  a  radio  interview  when  the  conversation  had  moved  to  talking  about  the  Wimbledon  grounds.""  |||    Davenport  was  speaking  following  the  announcement  that  this  week's  Dubai  Duty  Free  event  will  join  the  US  and  Australian  Opens  in  offering  equal  prize  money  for  women.  ""You  hear  about  women  playing  only  three  sets  while  men  play  five,""  said  Daveport.  ""And  the  best  women  are  never  going  to  beat  the  best  men.  ""But  it's  a  different  game  you  go  to  watch  with  the  women  -  it  doesn't  make  it  better  or  worse.  ""Hopefully  we  will  be  able  to  change  people's  minds.""  Serena  Williams,  who  is  also  in  Dubai,  added:  ""I'm  obviously  for  equal  prize  money.  ""Women's  tennis  is  exciting.  Men's  tennis  is  exciting  as  well,  but  the  women  have  it  right  now.

1	"Bafta  to  hand  out  movie  honours  |||    Movie  stars  from  across  the  globe  are  attending  this  year's  Bafta  film  award  ceremony.  |||    British  stars  Imelda  Staunton  and  Clive  Owen  are  hoping  for  awards  at  the  Odeon  in  London's  Leicester  Square.  Hollywood  stars  Leonardo  diCaprio,  Pierce  Brosnan,  Christian  Slater  and  Richard  Gere  are  also  in  the  audience  for  the  biggest  night  in  UK  film.  Hollywood  blockbuster  The  Aviator,  starring  DiCaprio,  leads  the  field  with  14  nominations,  including  best  movie.  It  is  up  against  Eternal  Sunshine  of  the  Spotless  Mind,  Finding  Neverland,  The  Motorcycle  Diaries  and  British  film  Vera  Drake,  which  has  11  nominations.  |||    Staunton  is  one  of  the  favourites  to  land  the  best  actress  award  for  her  gritty  role  as  a  backstreet  abortionist  in  the  small-budget  film.  She  arrived  at  the  ceremony  wearing  a  green  silk  and  chiffon  low  cut  evening  dress  decorated  with  beads.  ""It's  lovely  to  be  here  at  home,  to  be  on  British  soil.  It's  very  nice  indeed,""  she  told  reporters.  |||    Asked  whether  she  was  nervous  about  her  best  actress  nomination  she  said:  ""It's  out  of  my  hands,  there's  nothing  I  can  do.  I'm  here  with  a  lot  of  mates  and  we're  going  to  have  a  very  nice  evening.""  Other  nominees  in  the  best  actress  category  include  Charlize  Theron  for  Monster,  Ziyi  Zhang  for  House  of  Flying  Daggers  and  UK  star  Kate  Winslet,  who  has  two  nods  for  her  roles  in  Eternal  Sunshine  of  the  Spotless  Mind  and  Finding  Neverland.  DiCaprio  faces  competition  from  Bernal,  Jamie  Foxx,  Jim  Carrey  and  Johnny  Depp  in  the  best  actor  category.  The  crowed  screamed  when  he  arrived  on  the  red  carpet.""It's  unlike  anything  I've  ever  encountered.  It's  very  intense  and  very  loud,""  he  told  the  BBC.  |||    ""It's  the  first  time  I've  come  to  the  Baftas  because  it's  the  first  time  I've  been  nominated...I've  appreciated  British  cinema  for  a  long  time  and  to  be  recognised  like  this  is  a  special  honour.""  Gere,  who  is  presenting  the  best  film  award,  said:  ""It's  a  big  party,  I  had  no  idea  it  was  going  to  be  this  big.

He  raised  one  of  the  biggest  cheers  of  the  night  when  he  walked  down  the  red  carpet.  ""I  was  always  a  huge  fan  of  Closer  as  a  play,  so  when  I  got  the  call  to  appear  in  the  film,  it  was  a  huge  thrill  for  me,""  he  said.

His  co-star  Natalie  Portman  is  up  against  Blanchett,  Heather  Craney,  Julie  Cristie  and  Meryl  Streep  in  the  best  supporting  actress  category.  Mike  Leigh  is  up  for  the  best  director  award  for  Vera  Drake,  alongside  Martin  Scorsese  for  The  Aviator,  Michael  Mann  for  Collateral,  Michel  Gondry  for  Eternal  Sunshine  of  the  Spotless  Mind  and  Marc  Forster  for  Finding  Neverland.  |||    The  Orange  British  Academy  Film  Awards  will  be  shown  on  BBC  One  at  2010  GMT." 

0	"Booming  markets  shed  few  tears  |||    The  market,  former  British  government  minister  Michael  Heseltine  once  said,  has  no  morality.  |||    And  indeed,  stock  exchange  traders  around  Asia  have  wasted  little  time  regretting  the  victims  of  this  week's  disaster.  Stock  markets  in  Indonesia  and  India  have  hit  all-time  highs  this  week;  even  in  Sri  Lanka,  more  comprehensively  affected,  the  main  index  has  lost  only  5%  since  the  waves  hit.  Bigger  markets  further  afield  have  barely  twitched.  The  MSCI  World  share  index,  a  measure  of  global  stock  market  performance,  hit  its  highest  level  this  week  since  early  2001;  the  BBC  Global  30  has  risen  by  3%  in  the  past  week.  And  this  at  a  time  when  -  all  sentiment  aside  -  insurance  costs  are  already  estimated  in  the  tens  of  billions  of  dollars,  and  countries  around  the  region  are  looking  at  trimming  their  growth  forecasts.  |||    In  fact,  the  markets  are  being  perfectly  rational.  |||    For  a  start,  the  notional  insurance  cost  of  the  disaster  will  have  little  bearing  on  corporate  bottom  lines.  The  overwhelming  majority  of  the  victims  will  have  had  no  insurance:  according  to  estimates  from  India,  only  one-quarter  of  those  affected  there  were  wealthy  enough  to  afford  insurance,  and  only  one-quarter  of  that  group  at  most  will  have  taken  out  policies.  Indonesia  is  likely  to  have  even  lower  take-up  rates.  And  where  insurance  certainly  is  in  place  -  in,  for  example,  the  many  tourist  complexes  affected  -  the  costs  will  be  borne  in  far-away  corners  of  the  global  reinsurance  market,  rather  than  landing  locally.  |||    Second,  stock  markets  do  not  trade  the  sort  of  companies  likely  to  have  been  damaged.  Most  of  the  biggest  companies  traded  on  the  soaring  Jakarta  Stock  Exchange  are  in  oil,  technology  and  financial  services  -  none  of  which  have  been  hit  by  the  flooding.  Tourist  businesses,  the  most  likely  sufferers,  are  either  foreign-owned  or  too  small  to  have  their  shares  listed.  Those  that  are  listed  have  suffered:  Confifi  Hotel  Holdings,  a  small  Sri  Lankan  tourism  firm,  has  halved  in  value  this  week.  But  there  are  winners  as  well  as  losers.  Asian  stock  markets  are  heavily  inclined  towards  property  and  construction  companies,  many  of  which  will  be  rubbing  their  hands  over  the  reconstruction  opportunities.  In  Indonesia,  shares  in  state  construction  companies  Adhi  Karya  and  Semen  Gresik  have  jumped  sharply  this  week.  |||    More  broadly,  the  academic  consensus  is  that  major  disasters  are  largely  neutral  in  their  longer-term  economic  impact.  |||    According  to  the  Natural  Hazards  Research  and  Applications  Information  Center  at  Colorado  State  University,  there  is  little  evidence  that  disasters  are  inevitably  followed  by  a  depression.  The  need  to  find  money  to  replace  lost  and  damaged  property  is  balanced  by  the  beneficial  effect  of  reconstruction  activity;  there  is  rarely,  the  centre  says,  any  sort  of  rebuilding  boom,  but  in  most  cases  sizeable  indirect  losses  are  avoided.  A  study  of  the  1993  Des  Moines  floods,  from  the  Disaster  Research  Center  at  the  University  of  Delaware*,  found  that  70%  of  local  businesses  were  no  worse  off  after  the  disaster,  and  another  18%  felt  themselves  better  off.  ""Although  it  is  commonly  assumed  on  the  basis  of  anecdotal  evidence  that  disasters  result  in  business  failures  and  bankruptcies  on  a  large  scale,  our  research  indicates  that  most  businesses,  even  those  that  are  especially  hard-hit,  do  indeed  recover,""  the  authors  concluded.  |||    But  disasters  have  a  vast  psychological  impact,  and  markets  are  driven  by  psychological  factors.  |||    In  particular,  many  analysts  warn  of  panic  spreading  unchecked  through  the  global  financial  system,  as  investors  seek  to  cover  themselves  against  the  unforeseeable  effects  of  unguessable  events.  In  fact,  again,  the  risks  here  are  lower  than  they  seem.  Even  the  costliest  natural  disaster  is  rendered  minuscule  by  the  global  capital  market  -  currently  $30  trillion  and  rising.  A  series  of  recent  shocks,  the  Colorado  centre  has  argued,  have  demonstrated  that  this  seamless  global  contagion  hardly  ever  happens:  market  tremors  rarely  translate  into  economic  slumps,  and  economic  woes  rarely  seriously  undermine  markets.  The  trillion-dollar  debts  of  Japan's  banks,  for  example,  have  had  no  effect  on  stock  markets  further  afield  than  Tokyo.  And  the  US  stock  market  was  on  its  way  down  long  before  11  September,  2001;  it  rose  by  20%  during  the  six  months  following  the  attacks.  ""It  is  not  that  the  broking  community  is  indifferent  to  disasters  or  feelings,""  one  Bombay  trader  said  this  week.  ""But  the  reaction  would  have  been  seen  if  business  had  been  affected.  Business  sense  probably  tends  to  overrule  everything  else.""" 

1	"Howl  helps  boost  Japan's  cinemas  |||    Japan's  box  office  received  a  3.8%  boost  last  year,  with  ticket  sales  worth  211bn  yen  (£1.08bn).  |||    The  surge  was  led  by  animated  movie  Howl's  Moving  Castle,  which  took  20bn  yen  (£102m)  to  become  the  biggest  film  in  Japan  in  2004.  It  is  expected  to  match  the  30.7bn  yen  (£157m)  record  of  Hayao  Miyazaki's  previous  film  Spirited  Away.  Japan  Motion  Picture  Producers  figures  showed  that  170  million  cinema  admissions  were  made  in  Japan  in  2004.  The  Last  Samurai,  starring  Tom  Cruise,  was  the  biggest  foreign  movie  hit  in  Japan  last  year,  taking  13.8bn  yen  (£70.7m).  |||    It  was  followed  by  Harry  Potter  and  the  Prisoner  of  Azkaban,  Finding  Nemo  and  The  Lord  of  the  Rings:  The  Return  of  the  King.  The  second  highest-grossing  Japanese  film  was  romantic  drama  Crying  Out  Love  in  the  Centre  of  the  World,  followed  by  Be  With  You  and  Pocket  Monsters  Advanced  Generation.  Japanese  films  accounted  for  37.5%  of  Japan's  box  office  total  last  year,  with  foreign  films  taking  the  remaining  62.5%.  This  represented  a  4.5%  gain  for  the  proportion  of  Japanese  films  in  2004  compared  to  2003.  The  number  of  Japanese  films  released  rose  to  310  in  2004  from  287  the  previous  year.  Sales  of  movies  on  DVD  and  video  amounted  to  497bn  yen  (£2.54bn)  for  the  year." 

2	"Lib  Dems  highlight  problem  debt  |||    People  vulnerable  to  problem  debts  should  be  afforded  greater  protection  from  banks  aggressively  promoting  financial  products,  the  Lib  Dems  say.  |||    Vincent  Cable  says  one  in  eight  households  already  struggle  with  debt  and  that  will  worsen  if  there  is  a  hike  in  interest  rates  or  unemployment.  The  Lib  Dems'  Treasury  spokesman  is  unveiling  a  policy  aimed  at  the  issue.  He  wants  to  see  ""proper  health  checks""  when  loans  are  marketed  so  people  know  to  take  out  payment  protection.  |||    ""Were  economic  conditions  to  deteriorate  at  all,  large  numbers  of  people  could  be  affected  because  they  have  borrowed  to  the  limit,""  Mr  Cable  told  BBC  News.  ""Banks  are  very  aggressively  promoting  debt  in  many  cases  there  is  a  bigger  problem  ahead.""  Mr  Cable  said  the  government's  Consumer  Credit  Bill  would  target  some  of  the  ""extreme  problems""  such  as  loan  sharking,  but  ministers  had  been  ""a  bit  complacent""  about  the  wider  issue  of  debt  levels.  He  said  much  of  the  payment  protection  currently  available  was  ""extremely  expensive""  and  there  were  ""lots  of  exclusions"".  |||    Mr  Cable  added  that  the  Office  of  Fair  Trading  should  investigate  the  market.  Lib  Dem  leader  Charles  Kennedy  meanwhile  is  in  the  middle  of  a  tour  of  the  UK  aimed  at  persuading  voters  his  is  the  ""real  opposition"".  Mr  Kennedy  is  visiting  a  mixture  of  rural  seats,  where  his  party  is  hoping  to  make  gains  from  the  Conservatives,  and  urban  areas  traditionally  associated  with  Labour.  Labour  say  a  Lib  Dem  vote  could  ""let  the  Tories  in"",  while  the  Tories  say  the  Lib  Dems  would  mean  ""higher  taxes,  soft  crime  laws,  more  power  to  Europe"".  Mr  Kennedy's  tour  comes  as  he,  Labour  leader  Tony  Blair  and  Conservative  leader  Michael  Howard  all  step  up  campaigning  ahead  of  the  next  General  Election,  widely  expected  to  be  held  on  5  May.  |||    The  Liberal  Democrats  say  in  the  northern  cities,  the  race  is  between  them  and  Labour,  while  in  southern  seats  -  particularly  the  south  west  -  it  is  between  them  and  the  Tories.  Speaking  to  the  BBC's  Westminster  Hour  on  Sunday,  Mr  Kennedy  said  the  upcoming  general  election  -  widely  tipped  for  5  May  -  would  be  much  more  unpredictable  than  any  others  in  ""recent  experience"".  And  he  brushed  off  Labour  suggestions  a  vote  for  his  party  would  mean  letting  the  Tories  in  ""by  the  back  door"".  ""If  you  look  at  the  four  previous  parliamentary  by-elections,  the  Liberal  Democrats  have  demonstrated  that,  not  only  can  we  leapfrog  the  Conservatives  where  we  start  in  a  third  place  position,  but  we  can  go  on  to  defeat  the  government.  ""That's  going  to  be  the  story,  I  think,  of  this  coming  general  election."""

""We  have  had  rain  up  until  the  day  before  the  show  many  times,  but  for  some  reason  the  Oscar  gods  always  shine  on  Sunday  and  we  hope  they  will  do  so  again  this  year,""  he  added." 

2	"Blair  hails  Turkey-EU  talks  deal  |||    Tony  Blair  has  hailed  a  deal  bringing  Turkey  a  step  closer  to  EU  membership  as  important  for  the  world's  future  ""peace  and  prosperity"".  |||    Mr  Blair  has  been  a  leading  advocate  of  Turkish  membership  despite  controversy  surrounding  the  idea.  Leaving  a  Brussels  summit  Mr  Blair  said  ""the  fact  Turkey  is  a  Muslim  country  does  not  mean  it  should  be  barred"".  The  deal  to  open  formal  talks  with  Ankara  came  despite  an  EU  demand  for  Turkey  to  recognise  Cyprus.  It  was  agreed  the  issue  can  be  tackled  at  a  later  date  but  Turkish  premier  Recep  Erdogan  had  to  accept  negotiations  did  not  guarantee  his  country  full  EU  membership.  |||    If  it  joins,  Turkey  may  have  to  accept  restrictions  to  limit  migration  by  its  citizens.  Mr  Blair  said  having  Turkey  in  the  EU  was  of  ""importance  to  the  future  peace  and  prosperity  of  my  country,  Britain,  and  the  wider  world"".  |||    ""We  are  stating  a  fundamental  principle  that  the  fact  Turkey  is  a  Muslim  country  does  not  mean  it  should  be  barred  from  Europe.  ""On  the  contrary,  if  it  fulfils  the  same  principles  of  human  rights,  then  Muslim  and  Christian  can  work  together.""  Under  the  agreement,  Turkey  must  issue  a  written  statement  promising  to  sign  an  accord  effectively  recognising  the  Greek  Cypriot  government,  but  gives  Turkey  more  time  to  sell  the  idea  to  its  people.  |||    The  internationally  recognised  southern  part  of  Cyprus  is  an  EU  member,  but  Turkey,  which  occupies  northern  Cyprus,  had  previously  insisted  it  would  not  bow  to  demands  to  recognise  the  country,  calling  the  issue  a  ""red  line"".  It  could  take  up  to  15  years  before  Turkey  is  able  to  join,  and  entry  cannot  be  guaranteed.  The  EU  has  also  announced  that  it  will  start  accession  talks  with  Croatia  in  April  2005.  However,  talks  will  begin  only  if  the  country  co-operates  fully  with  the  UN  war  crimes  tribunal  for  the  former  Yugoslavia." 

1	"Potter  director  signs  Warner  deal  |||    Harry  Potter  director  Alfonso  Cuaron  has  signed  a  three-year  deal  with  Hollywood  studio  Warner  Brothers,  according  to  Variety  trade  magazine.  |||    The  Mexican  film-maker,  who  directed  Harry  Potter  and  the  Prisoner  of  Azkaban,  will  produce  mainstream  movies  and  smaller  Spanish-language  films.  ""We  had  a  wonderful  experience  with  Alfonso  on  Harry  Potter,""  Warner  producer  Jeff  Robinov  told  Variety.  Cuaron's  other  films  include  Mexican  movie  Y  Tu  Mama  Tambien.  |||    The  2001  rites-of-passage  drama  about  two  teenage  boys  who  embark  on  a  relationship  with  an  older  woman,  brought  Cuaron  international  attention  -  and  box  office  glory.  |||    It  also  won  him  and  his  brother  Carlos,  with  whom  he  co-wrote  the  screenplay,  an  Oscar  nomination  for  best  original  screenplay.  Warner  will  distribute  Cuaron's  films  in  several  languages  outside  the  US.  ""This  deal  will  give  us  the  opportunity  to  collaborate  with  Alfonso  on  movies  that  make  the  most  of  his  artistry  and  vision,  and  continue  to  offer  him  the  mainstream  worldwide  audiences  that  our  studio  provides  so  successfully,""  said  Mr  Robinov.  |||    His  first  film  for  Warner  Brothers  was  1995's  family  fantasy  movie  A  Little  Princess.  Based  on  the  novel  by  Frances  Hodgson  Burnett,  A  Little  Princess  tells  the  story  of  a  young  girl  who  is  sent  to  live  in  a  New  York  boarding  school  when  her  widowed  father  enlists  for  war.  After  the  erotic  nature  of  Y  Tu  Mama  Tambien,  Cuaron  was  a  surprise  choice  to  direct  the  third  Harry  Potter  film  but  his  dark  interpretation  was  received  well  by  the  public  and  critics  alike." 

2	"At  a  glance:  Tory  health  checks  |||    The  UK'  opposition  Conservatives  have  unveiled  plans  to  introduce  health  checks  for  immigrants  if  they  win  the  General  Election.  Here's  a  guide  to  the  plan:  |||    People  coming  to  live  and  work  in  Britain  from  outside  the  EU.  If  they  plan  to  stay  six  months  or  more  and  are  from  a  country  with  lots  of  TB,  they  would  have  to  have  a  chest  x-ray  and  further  tests  if  appropriate.  All  people  from  outside  the  European  Union  who  want  to  stay  a  year  or  more  will  have  to  undergo  a  full  medical.  |||    Tuberculosis,  Hepatitis  B  and  HIV.  A  positive  test  for  TB  would  automatically  mean  visa  applications  being  turned  down.  All  other  conditions  would  be  dealt  with  on  a  case  by  case  basis.  |||    People  would  have  to  prove  they  have  an  acceptable  standard  of  health  and  are  unlikely  to  be  a  danger  to  public  health  in  the  UK,  or  impose  significant  costs  or  demands  on  the  NHS.  They  would  also,  if  appropriate,  have  to  be  able  to  undertake  the  work  or  study  they  applied  to  come  here  for.  |||    People  coming  to  Britain  for  less  than  six  months  would  not  be  medically  tested  unless  they  intended  to  work  in  health  care,  childcare  or  teaching.  Children  and  pregnant  women  wanting  to  live  in  Britain  permanently  would  not  have  to  have  a  chest  X-ray  for  TB.  Under  16s  would  not  face  tests  for  hepatitis  and  HIV.  |||    The  Tories  say  people  fleeing  persecution  will  not  be  denied  sanctuary  in  Britain  because  of  poor  health.  However,  they  will  undergo  health  checks  to  ensure  they  receive  the  right  medical  treatment  and  do  not  spread  infectious  diseases.  |||    They  claim  government  figures  show  that  TB  in  England  has  increased  by  25%  over  the  last  10  years  and  that  nearly  two-thirds  of  people  with  the  disease  were  born  overseas.  They  also  believe  there  should  be  stricter  controls  over  who  comes  into  Britain  to  ensure  they  are  not  a  public  health  risk.  They  say  the  plans  will  protect  access  to  the  NHS.  |||    Applicants  will  be  tested  in  their  home  country.  Only  asylum  seekers  will  be  tested  in  the  UK  once  their  refugee  status  is  established.  |||    Home  Office  Minister  Des  Browne  says  the  Government  already  routinely  checks  people  for  TB  if  they  come  into  the  UK  for  six  months  or  more  from  high-risk  countries.  Recent  medical  checks  were  carried  out  on  175,000  people  at  Heathrow  Airport  and  10,000  at  Gatwick.  From  those  tests,  about  100  infectious  cases  of  TB  were  found.  |||    The  Tories  say  47  other  countries  across  the  world  impose  requirements  of  this  kind.  The  party  has  looked  at  the  way  the  system  is  operated  in  Australia,  Canada  and  New  Zealand.  The  Tory  proposals  are  ""quite  closely  modelled""  on  the  New  Zealand  system.  |||    Labour  claims  the  policy  is  little  more  than  a  ""desperate  attempt  to  catch  up  with  Labour's  five-year  plan""  for  immigration  and  asylum,  which  was  published  last  week.  This  says  health  screening  for  TB  will  be  targeted  on  applicants  from  high-risk  areas  before  they  are  given  entry  clearance.  Those  who  are  diagnosed  with  the  disease  would  then  need  to  seek  treatment  at  home  before  being  allowed  to  enter  the  UK.  The  Liberal  Democrats  have  warned  Labour  and  the  Tories  they  were  ""in  danger  of  pandering  to  prejudice  rather  than  challenging  it""." 

0	"German  growth  goes  into  reverse  |||    Germany's  economy  shrank  0.2%  in  the  last  three  months  of  2004,  upsetting  hopes  of  a  sustained  recovery.  |||    The  figures  confounded  hopes  of  a  0.2%  expansion  in  the  fourth  quarter  in  Europe's  biggest  economy.  The  Federal  Statistics  Office  said  growth  for  the  whole  of  2004  was  1.6%,  after  a  year  of  contraction  in  2003,  down  from  an  earlier  estimate  of  1.7%.  It  said  growth  in  the  third  quarter  had  been  zero,  putting  the  economy  at  a  standstill  from  July  onward.  Germany  has  been  reliant  on  exports  to  get  its  economy  back  on  track,  as  unemployment  of  more  than  five  million  and  impending  cuts  to  welfare  mean  German  consumers  have  kept  their  money  to  themselves.  Major  companies  including  Volkswagen,  DaimlerChrysler  and  Siemens  have  spent  much  of  2004  in  tough  talks  with  unions  about  trimming  jobs  and  costs.  According  to  the  statistics  office,  Destatis,  rising  exports  were  outweighed  in  the  fourth  quarter  by  the  continuing  weakness  of  domestic  demand.  |||    But  the  relentless  rise  in  the  value  of  the  euro  last  year  has  also  hit  the  competitiveness  of  German  products  overseas.  The  effect  has  been  to  depress  prospects  for  the  12-nation  eurozone  as  a  whole,  as  well  as  Germany.  Eurozone  interest  rates  are  at  2%,  but  senior  officials  at  the  rate-setting  European  Central  Bank  are  beginning  to  talk  about  the  threat  of  inflation,  prompting  fears  that  interest  rates  may  rise.  The  ECB's  mandate  is  to  fight  rising  prices  by  boosting  interest  rates  -  and  that  could  further  threaten  Germany's  hopes  of  recovery."

GE  is  the  US'  biggest  firm  based  on  stock  market  valuation.  GE's  net  profits  were  $5.37bn  (£2.86bn)  for  the  final  three  months  of  2004,  while  sales  came  in  at  $43.7bn.  The  group,  whose  businesses  range  from  jet  engines  to  the  NBC  television  channel,  forecast  sustained  growth  at  between  10-15%  for  this  year  and  next.  GE's  shares  rose  1%  on  the  news  before  ending  Friday  0.24%  lower.  |||    ""The  industries  GE  is  in  are  doing  very  well.  The  materials,  financial  and  industrial  sectors  are  all  picking  up,""  said  Steve  Roukis,  an  analyst  at  fund  manager  Matrix  Asset  Advisors,  which  has  shares  in  GE.  GE  said  orders  in  the  fourth  quarter  were  15%  higher  than  in  the  same  period  of  2003,  ""with  growth  across  the  board"".  ""In  the  fourth  quarter,  nine  of  our  11  businesses  delivered  at  least  double-digit  earnings  growth,""  said  Mr  Immelt.  Full  year  2004  gains  were  less  spectacular,  but  still  respectable.  Net  profit  was  up  6%  at  $16.6bn.  Last  year,  GE  bought  Vivendi  Universal,  merging  it  with  NBC  to  form  NBC  Universal.  The  success  of  Universal  Studio's  film  'Ray',  a  portrait  of  jazz  musician  Ray  Charles,  has  helped  boost  earnings  at  the  unit."

Good  rains,  increased  use  of  fertilizers  and  improved  seeds  contributed  to  the  rise  in  production.  Nevertheless,  2.2  million  Ethiopians  will  still  need  emergency  assistance.  |||    The  report  calculated  emergency  food  requirements  for  2005  to  be  387,500  tonnes.  On  top  of  that,  89,000  tonnes  of  fortified  blended  food  and  vegetable  oil  for  ""targeted  supplementary  food  distributions  for  a  survival  programme  for  children  under  five  and  pregnant  and  lactating  women""  will  be  needed.  |||    In  eastern  and  southern  Ethiopia,  a  prolonged  drought  has  killed  crops  and  drained  wells.  Last  year,  a  total  of  965,000  tonnes  of  food  assistance  was  needed  to  help  seven  million  Ethiopians.  The  Food  and  Agriculture  Organisation  (FAO)  recommend  that  the  food  assistance  is  bought  locally.  ""Local  purchase  of  cereals  for  food  assistance  programmes  is  recommended  as  far  as  possible,  so  as  to  assist  domestic  markets  and  farmers,""  said  Henri  Josserand,  chief  of  FAO's  Global  Information  and  Early  Warning  System.  Agriculture  is  the  main  economic  activity  in  Ethiopia,  representing  45%  of  gross  domestic  product.  About  80%  of  Ethiopians  depend  directly  or  indirectly  on  agriculture."

Little  Britain  was  named  best  comedy  while  Franz  Ferdinand  beat  Morrissey  and  The  Libertines  to  the  music  award.  Shane  Meadows'  Dead  Man's  Shoes  picked  up  the  best  film  award,  beating  Shaun  of  the  Dead  and  My  Summer  of  Love.  The  two  award  ceremonies  reflect  the  achievements  the  industry  believes  have  been  made  in  the  last  year.  |||    In  2004,  Coronation  Street  pulled  away  from  its  BBC  One  rival  EastEnders  in  the  ratings  and  dominated  other  TV  awards.  Last  year,  the  South  Bank  Award  for  best  TV  drama  went  to  Steven  Poliakoff's  period  piece  The  Lost  Prince,  while  Bloody  Sunday,  about  the  1972  killings  in  Northern  Ireland,  won  in  2003.  In  other  South  Bank  categories,  Little  Britain's  second  series  beat  Nighty  Night  and  The  Green  Wing  to  the  comedy  trophy  while  Alan  Bennett's  The  History  Boys  won  in  the  theatre  category.  Author  David  Mitchell  made  up  for  losing  out  in  the  Booker  Prize  to  Alan  Hollinghurst  by  beating  him  to  the  literary  award  with  his  book  Cloud  Atlas.  Shameless,  State  Of  Play  and  Clocking  Off  creator  Paul  Abbott  got  a  lifetime  achievement  award  while  former  Grange  Hill  actress  Amma  Asante  won  the  breakthrough  award  for  writing  and  directing  her  first  film,  A  Way  Of  Life."

It  is  his  second  number  one  in  a  row.  The  show  used  Presley  photos  last  week.

""We  wanted  to  pay  tribute  to  Elvis  in  the  best  way  we  knew  how,  so  we  thought  getting  a  professional  would  be  the  best  way  for  Top  of  the  Pops  to  do  that.""  Kombou  is  likely  to  appear  on  the  show  again  next  week  as  the  next  Presley  re-release,  A  Fool  Such  As  I,  is  on  course  to  give  him  his  third  number  one  in  three  weeks.

2	"Custody  death  rate  'shocks'  MPs  |||    Deaths  in  custody  have  reached  ""shocking""  levels,  a  committee  of  MPs  and  peers  has  warned.  |||    The  joint  committee  on  human  rights  found  those  committing  suicide  were  mainly  the  most  vulnerable,  with  mental  health,  drugs  or  alcohol  problems.  Members  urged  the  government  to  set  up  a  task  force  to  tackle  deaths  in  prisons,  police  cells,  detention  centres  and  special  hospitals.  There  was  one  prison  suicide  every  four  days  between  1999  and  2003,  MPs  said.  The  report,  which  followed  a  year-long  inquiry  by  the  committee,  found  the  high  death  rate  ""amounts  to  a  serious  failure  to  protect  the  right  to  life  of  a  highly  vulnerable  group"".  |||    Many  of  those  who  ended  up  taking  their  own  lives  had  ""presented  themselves""  to  the  authorities  with  these  problems  before  they  even  offended,  the  report  said.  It  questioned  whether  prison  was  the  most  appropriate  place  for  them  to  be  kept  and  whether  earlier  intervention  would  have  meant  custody  could  have  been  avoided.  |||    Increased  resources  and  a  reduction  in  the  use  of  imprisonment  was  needed  to  address  the  issue  in  the  longer  term,  the  report  said.  Committee  chairman  Labour  MP  Jean  Corston  said:  ""Each  and  every  death  in  custody  is  a  death  too  many,  regardless  of  the  circumstances.  |||    ""Yet  throughout  our  inquiry  we  have  seen  time  and  time  again  that  extremely  vulnerable  people  are  entering  custody  with  a  history  of  mental  illness,  drug  and  alcohol  problems  and  potential  for  taking  their  own  lives.""  ""These  highly  vulnerable  people  are  being  held  within  a  structure  glaringly  ill-suited  to  meet  even  their  basic  needs.  ""Crime  levels  are  falling  but  we  are  holding  more  people  in  custody  than  ever  before.  The  misplaced  over-reliance  on  the  prison  system  for  some  of  the  most  vulnerable  people  in  the  country  is  at  the  heart  of  the  problems  that  we  encountered.  ""Until  we  change  our  whole  approach  to  imprisoning  vulnerable  people  we  cannot  begin  to  meet  our  positive  obligations  under  Article  2  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  and  meet  our  duty  of  care  to  them.""  |||    The  committee  also  highlighted  ""deeply  worrying""  cases  of  children  and  young  people  taking  their  own  lives.  Between  1990  and  2004,  25  children  have  taken  their  own  lives  in  prison  and  two  have  died  in  secure  training  centres.  It  picked  out  the  case  of  Joseph  Scholes,  who  hanged  himself  from  the  bars  of  his  cell  in  Stoke  Heath  Young  Offender  Institution  in  March  2002,  and  urged  the  home  secretary  to  hold  a  public  inquiry.  It  revealed  that  two  weeks  before  his  court  appearance  for  a  series  of  robberies,  the  16-year-old  was  depressed,  exhibiting  suicidal  tendencies  and  slashed  his  face  with  a  knife  about  30  times.  Even  though  the  trial  judge  had  been  alerted  to  his  experience  of  sexual  abuse  and  mental  illness,  he  was  sentenced  to  a  two-year  detention  and  training  order.  Nine  days  into  his  sentence,  Joseph  hung  himself  from  the  bars  of  his  cell  window  with  a  sheet." 

2	"Lord  Scarman,  93,  dies  peacefully  |||    Distinguished  lawyer  Lord  Scarman,  who  conducted  the  inquiry  into  the  1981  Brixton  riots,  has  died  aged  93.  |||    The  peer  enjoyed  a  celebrated  judicial  career,  serving  as  Law  Commission  chairman  in  its  first  seven  years.  He  also  chaired  the  1969  tribunal  set  up  to  investigate  civil  disturbances  in  Northern  Ireland.  Paying  tribute,  the  Lord  Chancellor  Lord  Falconer  said  Lord  Scarman  was  one  of  the  ""great  advocates  of  our  generation"".  |||    ""His  legacy  from  his  decisions  in  the  Lords  and  the  Court  of  Appeal  is  substantial.  ""His  work  in  the  wake  of  the  Brixton  riots  and  his  commitment  to  the  vulnerable  and  dispossessed  was  second  to  none.  |||    ""A  great  judge,  a  great  lawyer  and  a  great  man.""  Lord  Scarman's  nephew  George  Ritchie  said  the  peer,  who  passed  away  peacefully  on  Wednesday,  would  be  ""sadly  missed"".  |||    The  Lord  Chief  Justice,  Lord  Woolf,  who  is  the  most  senior  judge  in  England  and  Wales,  said  it  was  Lord  Scarman's  ""pioneering  work""  which  paved  the  way  for  the  Human  Rights  Act  1998.  ""He  was  a  lawyer  and  a  judge  who  had  a  remarkable  insight  into  human  nature,  and  an  exceptional  sensitivity  to  the  needs  of  a  healthy  society,""  he  said.  ""He  was,  personally,  totally  charming  and  he  will  be  remembered  with  great  affection  and  admiration  by  all  who  came  into  contact  with  him.""  |||    Dame  Elizabeth  Butler-Sloss,  the  president  of  the  Family  Justice  Division,  said  Lord  Scarman  was  a  ""good  and  humane  judge""  and  one  of  the  greatest  figures  of  the  late  20th  century.  Lord  Scarman  will  be  remembered  for  the  public  inquiry  he  led  into  a  string  of  race  riots  which  began  in  Brixton  when  racial  tensions  rose  after  a  police  crackdown  on  street  robbery.  During  the  following  three  days  of  disturbances  that  spread  to  the  Midlands,  Merseyside,  Bristol  and  Leeds,  nearly  400  people  were  injured  and  buildings  and  vehicles  were  set  alight.  |||    The  inquiry  famously  settled  on  the  so-called  ""rotten  apples""  theory,  which  argued  that  only  a  few  police  officers  were  racist,  saying  most  were  not.  It  spawned  new  law  enforcement  practices  and  led  to  the  creation  of  the  Police  Complaints  Authority.  Trevor  Phillips,  chair  of  the  Commission  for  Racial  Equality,  praised  Lord  Scarman's  ""ability  to  listen"".  He  said:  ""When  Lord  Scarman  toured  the  streets  of  Brixton  his  presence  was  electrifying.  ""A  community  which  had  been  systematically  ignored  by  everyone  else  was  suddenly  embraced  by  the  epitome  of  the  English  establishment.  ""His  great  quality  was  the  ability  to  listen  to  young  people  of  all  backgrounds,  many  of  whose  language  he  could  barely  understand,  genuinely  to  hear  what  they  had  to  say  and  to  talk  to  them  as  human  beings.  ""He  never  lost  the  special  combination  of  wisdom,  humanity  and  the  spark  of  radicalism  that  marked  his  watershed  report  into  the  Brixton  riots."""

Running  sub-eight  seconds  twice  in  a  week  puts  her  right  up  there  and  if  she  repeats  that  in  Madrid  she  will  be  close  to  picking  up  a  medal.  But  what  was  great  about  Sunday's  performance  was  that  she  was  under  pressure  to  produce  the  goods  when  it  counted.  Diane  Allahgreen  has  been  our  best  hurdler  for  some  time  now  and  I  think  she  was  surprised  to  be  beaten  by  Sarah.  And  knowing  that  she  got  the  better  of  Diane  in  a  head-to-head  race  will  give  Sarah  confidence.  In  the  men's  race  on  Saturday,  Allan  Scott  was  right  in  there  and  there  is  definitely  more  to  come  from  him.  In  fact,  the  men's  60m  hurdles  is  so  strong,  I  think  the  selectors  will  pick  three  hurdlers  to  go  to  Madrid.  |||    Phillips  Idowu  lit  up  the  field  events,  not  only  with  his  hair,  but  also  with  his  leap  of  17.30m,  which  puts  him  at  the  top  of  the  world  rankings.  I  had  a  chat  with  him  before  the  competition  and  he  was  really  looking  forward  to  getting  out  there.  He  feels  he  is  in  great  shape  and  has  some  big  jumps  inside  him  -  but  then  Phillips  always  has.  A  lot  of  the  athletes  said  the  runway  was  not  very  helpful,  so  for  Phillips  to  jump  like  that  is  a  good  performance.  He  is  such  a  huge  talent  but  just  needs  some  consistency  -  and  if  he  does  that  then  the  big  jumps  will  get  even  further.  Across  the  board  I  thought  Kelly  Sotherton  had  a  great  weekend  and  continued  to  show  she  is  developing.  She  picked  up  three  personal  bests  in  the  long  jump,  high  jump  and  60m  hurdles  and  you  can't  ask  for  more  than  that.  Kelly  will  be  up  against  Carolina  Kluft  in  the  pentathlon  at  the  European  Championships  but  she  has  every  chance  of  a  medal  on  the  basis  of  what  we've  seen  so  far.  |||    She  has  a  complicated  training  regime  where  different  people  help  her  with  different  disciplines  but  it  seems  to  be  working  really  well.  It  wasn't  all  good  news  in  Sheffield.  I  thought  both  the  60m  races  were  disappointing  in  different  ways.  Jason  Gardener  may  have  won  but  he  wasn't  at  his  best.  I  chatted  to  him  afterwards  and  he  knows  it  was  an  off-day  for  him.  He's  there  to  be  shot  at  and  the  other  lads  nearly  got  a  big  scalp  out  there.  In  the  women's  race,  Jeanette  Kwayke  was  hoping  to  run  against  defending  champion  Joice  Maduaka.  The  pair  are  enjoying  a  bit  of  rivalry  but  Joice  had  to  pull  out  with  a  chest  infection.  If  she  had  made  the  final  I  think  Jeanette  would  have  gone  a  bit  quicker.  |||    Janine  Whitlock  competed  well  in  the  pole  vault  on  her  return  following  a  two-year  drugs  ban.  But  the  most  disappointing  thing  in  the  wider  view  is  that  she  is  our  best  pole  vaulter  by  a  long  way  and  that  shouldn't  be  the  case.  The  event  has  moved  on  immensely  since  Janine  has  been  away  and  if  there  was  more  domestic  competition  I  think  that  would  help  her.  A  couple  of  other  interesting  topics  to  look  out  for  are  the  citizenship  issues  surrounding  Mark  Findlay  and  Rabah  Yusuf.  Findlay  is  a  Londoner  who  has  chosen  to  represent  Trinidad  and  Tobago  but  has  never  run  for  them  so  he  could  still  compete  for  Great  Britain.  Yusuf,  who  came  third  in  the  400m,  is  from  the  Sudan  but  is  trying  to  gain  British  citizenship.  He  came  to  Britain  as  a  high  jumper  but  damaged  his  toe,  started  doing  more  running  and  found  his  talent.  So  we  shall  have  to  see  what  happens  to  both  of  them." 

0	"Executive  trio  leave  Aer  Lingus  |||    Three  senior  executives  of  Ireland's  state-owned  airline,  Aer  Lingus,  are  set  to  leave  early  on  28  January  after  accusations  of  a  conflict  of  interest.  |||    The  trio  are  chief  executive  Willie  Walsh,  chief  financial  officer  Brian  Dunne  and  chief  operations  officer  Seamus  Kearney.  The  three  have  refused  to  confirm  reports  they  plan  to  launch  a  private  airline  in  competition  with  Aer  Lingus.  They  announced  in  November  they  would  quit  in  May,  but  did  not  give  a  reason.  That  decision  had  followed  an  announcement  by  Irish  Prime  Minister  Bertie  Ahern  -  who  is  still  considering  the  future  of  the  airline  -  which  ruled  out  a  proposed  management  buy-out  of  Aer  Lingus.  Mr  Walsh  denied  they  had  been  forced  out  early  because  of  the  reports  claiming  they  were  set  to  launch  a  competitor  airline.  |||    ""What  I  do  after  I  leave  Aer  Lingus  is  still  too  early  to  say,""  Mr  Walsh  told  AP  news  agency  on  Wednesday.  ""I  have  opportunities  open  to  me.  Brian  and  Seamus  are  in  the  equally  fortunate  position.""  He  said  he  had  received  more  than  40  business  proposals,  mostly  aviation-related,  since  the  trio  announced  their  resignations  two  months  ago.  Mr  Walsh  said  there  was  no  conflict  of  interest,  and,  if  he  was  to  launch  a  rival  airline  or  join  an  existing  competitor,  ""this  thing  happens  in  every  business"".  ""There's  absolutely  no  question  of  a  conflict  of  interest.  I've  been  completely  focused  on  my  responsibilities  at  Aer  Lingus,""  he  told  AP.  |||    This  week  opposition  politicians  had  called  on  the  Irish  government  to  make  an  urgent  decision  on  the  future  of  the  airline.  On  Wednesday  Irish  Transport  Minister  Martin  Cullen  said  in  a  statement:  ""A  conflict  of  interest  cannot,  should  not  and  will  not  be  allowed  to  arise  between  their  current  roles  at  Aer  Lingus  and  their  future  career  intentions.""  Last  Friday  the  minister  had  announced  he  was  to  advertise  for  three  senior  executives  for  Aer  Lingus.  Mr  Walsh,  who  took  charge  in  2000,  and  his  team  have  earned  praise  for  turning  Aer  Lingus  around,  by  cutting  air  fares  and  staff,  and  re-positioning  it  as  a  low-fare  airline  to  rival  Ryanair.  The  company  is  85%  owned  by  the  government  and  15%  by  its  staff." 

0	"US  data  sparks  inflation  worries  |||    Wholesale  prices  in  the  US  rose  at  the  fastest  rate  in  more  than  six  years  in  January,  according  to  government  data.  |||    New  figures  show  the  Labor  Department  producer  price  index  (PPI)  rose  by  0.3%  -  in  line  with  forecasts.  But  core  producer  prices,  which  exclude  food  and  energy  costs,  surged  by  0.8%,  the  biggest  rise  since  December  1998,  increasing  inflationary  concerns.  In  contrast,  the  University  of  Michigan  barometer  of  US  retail  consumer  confidence  showed  a  slight  dip.  The  university's  index  of  consumer  spending  fell  to  94.2  in  early  February  from  95.5  in  January,  which  could  indicate  a  fall  in  retail  spending  by  the  US  public.  The  mixed  set  of  data  on  Friday  led  to  volatile  early  Wall  Street  trade,  as  the  Dow  Jones,  Standard  and  Poor's  500,  and  Nasdaq  swung  between  positive  and  negative  territory.  |||    The  economic  figures  come  on  the  back  of  increased  fears  that  the  Federal  Reserve  chairman  may  be  about  to  raise  interest  rates  in  order  to  stifle  any  inflationary  pressures.  The  Fed  has  been  raising  interest  rates  at  a  gradual  pace  since  June  2004,  in  an  attempt  to  make  sure  inflation  does  not  get  out  of  control.  |||    Mr  Greenspan  told  Congress  this  week  that  the  central  bank  was  on  guard  against  the  possibility  that  a  rebounding  economy  could  trigger  stronger  inflation  pressures.  ""The  PPI  would  argue  for  Greenspan  to  continue  to  raise  rates  at  a  measured  pace,""  said  Joe  Quinlan,  chief  market  stategist  at  Bank  of  America  Capital  Management.  ""But  this  Michigan  survey  tells  you  that  the  consumer  might  be  downshifting  a  little  bit  in  terms  of  their  confidence  and  their  spending;  this  could  be  an  indication  of  that.""  |||    Consumer  spending  accounts  for  66%  of  US  economic  activity  and  is  viewed  as  a  gauge  of  the  health  of  the  economy,  which  is  why  the  Michigan  data  is  closely  observed.  However  on  Friday,  it  was  overshadowed  by  the  core  PPI  core  figure,  which  surged  2.7%  during  the  past  12  months,  the  biggest  year-on-year  gain  in  nine  years.  ""The  concern  is  that  traders  might  interpret  this  big  jump  in  the  core  PPI  as  an  impetus  for  the  Fed  to  be  more  aggressive  than  a  measured  move  in  moving  rates,""  said  Paul  Cherney,  chief  market  analyst  at  Standard  &  Poor's.  But  Ian  Shepherdson,  chief  US  economist  at  High  Frequency  Economics,  said  the  PPI  report  was  ""much  less  alarming""  than  at  first  glance.  One-time  increases  in  alcohol  and  tobacco  prices,  which  ""are  no  indication  of  broad  PPI  pressure"",  were  responsible  for  the  increase,  he  said.  Prices  for  autos  and  trucks  also  jumped  in  January,  but  Shepherdson  said  ""it  is  a  good  bet  these  increases  won't  stick""." 

0	"ECB  holds  rates  amid  growth  fears  |||    The  European  Central  Bank  has  left  its  key  interest  rate  unchanged  at  2%  for  the  19th  month  in  succession.  |||    Borrowing  costs  have  remained  on  hold  amid  concerns  about  the  strength  of  economic  growth  in  the  12  nations  sharing  the  euro,  analysts  said.  Despite  signs  of  pick-up,  labour  markets  and  consumer  demand  remain  sluggish,  while  firms  are  eyeing  cost  cutting  measures  such  as  redundancies.  High  oil  prices,  meanwhile,  have  put  upward  pressure  on  the  inflation  rate.  |||    Surveys  of  economists  have  shown  that  the  majority  expect  borrowing  costs  to  stay  at  2%  in  coming  months,  with  an  increase  of  a  quarter  of  a  percentage  point  predicted  some  time  in  the  second  half  of  the  year.  If  anything,  there  may  be  greater  calls  for  an  interest  rate  cut,  especially  with  the  euro  continuing  to  strengthen  against  the  dollar.  ""The  euro  land  economy  is  still  struggling  with  this  recovery,""  said  economist  Dirk  Schumacher.  The  ECB  ""may  sound  rather  hawkish  but  once  the  data  allows  them  to  cut  again,  they  will.""  Data  coming  out  of  Germany  on  Thursday  underlined  the  problems  facing  European  policy  makers.  While  Germany's  economy  expanded  by  1.7%  in  2004,  growth  was  driven  by  export  sales  and  lost  some  of  its  momentum  in  the  last  three  months  of  the  year.  |||    The  strength  of  the  euro  is  threatening  to  dampen  that  foreign  demand  in  2005,  and  domestic  consumption  currently  is  not  strong  enough  to  take  up  the  slack.  Inflation  in  the  eurozone,  however,  is  estimated  at  about  2.3%  in  December,  above  ECB  guidelines  of  2%.  ECB  President  Jean-Claude  Trichet  has  remained  upbeat  about  prospects  for  the  region,  and  inflation  is  expected  to  drop  below  2%  later  in  2005.  The  ECB  has  forecast  economic  growth  in  the  eurozone  of  1.9%  in  2005." 

0	"Bank  opts  to  leave  rates  on  hold  |||    The  Bank  of  England  has  left  interest  rates  on  hold  at  4.75%  for  a  sixth  month  in  a  row.  |||    The  Bank's  Monetary  Policy  Committee  (MPC)  decided  to  take  no  action  amid  mixed  signals  from  the  economy.  But  some  economists  predict  a  further  rise  in  the  cost  of  borrowing  will  come  later  this  year.  Interest  rates  rose  five  times  between  November  2003  and  August  2004  as  soaring  house  prices  and  buoyant  consumer  data  sparked  inflation  fears.  Bank  of  England  governor  Mervyn  King  has  recently  warned  against  placing  too  much  weight  on  one  month's  economic  data,  suggesting  the  MPC  is  waiting  for  a  clearer  picture  to  emerge.  Economists  see  next  week's  inflation  report  from  the  MPC  as  key  in  assessing  whether  a  further  interest  rate  rise  is  necessary  to  keep  the  economy  in  check.  |||    Slower  consumer  spending  and  a  quieter  housing  market  are  likely  to  have  convinced  the  MPC  that  rates  should  be  left  unchanged  in  recent  months.  Inflation,  however,  has  been  rising  faster  than  expected,  hitting  an  annual  rate  of  1.6%  in  December  -  its  highest  level  in  six  months.  Data  on  Wednesday  also  showed  manufacturing  output  rose  at  its  fastest  rate  since  May  last  month,  reinforcing  a  view  that  economic  growth  was  stronger  than  forecasts.  |||    And  recent  house  surveys  from  the  Halifax  and  Nationwide  have  indicated  prices  are  still  rising,  albeit  at  a  slower  pace  than  in  recent  years.  Philip  Shaw,  chief  economist  at  Investec  Securities,  said  he  believed  rates  would  remain  at  4.75%  for  the  rest  of  the  year  although  strong  economic  data  could  lead  to  a  further  hike.  ""The  economic  landscape  has  changed  quite  considerably  over  the  last  couple  of  months,  ""  he  said.  ""Growth  appears  stronger  and  the  MPC  may  become  more  concerned  about  inflation  trends.""  Howard  Archer,  economist  at  Global  Insight  said  the  MPC  ""may  well  consider  that  the  balance  of  risks  to  the  growth  and  inflation  outlook  have  moved  from  the  downside  to  the  upside"".  |||    Business  groups  welcomed  the  MPC's  widely-expected  move  to  leave  rates  on  hold  and  cautioned  against  further  rises.  The  British  Chambers  of  Commerce  (BCC)  said  it  was  ""concerned  by  the  clamour  in  some  quarters""  for  early  interest  rate  increases.  ""We  believe  that  these  demands  should  be  firmly  resisted,""  said  David  Frost,  BCC  director  general.  ""Manufacturing  still  faces  extremely  serious  problems  and  is  performing  poorly,  in  spite  of  the  recent  revised  figures.""  Ian  McCafferty,  chief  economist  at  the  CBI,  said  the  MPC  faced  an  ""interesting""  challenge.  ""Consumers  appear  to  have  pulled  in  their  horns  over  the  holiday  period,  and  exporters  are  struggling  with  the  strength  of  sterling,""  he  said.  ""However,  the  broader  economy  continues  to  show  healthy  growth,  and  the  tight  labour  market  and  buoyant  commodity  prices  are  nudging  inflation  higher.""" 

3	"White  prepared  for  battle  |||    Tough-scrummaging  prop  Julian  White  is  expecting  a  resurgent  Wales  to  give  him  a  rough  ride  in  England's  Six  Nations  opener  in  Cardiff  on  Saturday.  |||    The  Leicester  tight-head  is  in  the  form  of  his  life,  making  the  England  number  three  shirt  his  own.  But  he  knows  Wales  will  put  his  technique  under  immense  scrutiny.  ""The  Welsh  scrum  is  a  force  to  be  reckoned  with,""  he  told  BBC  Sport.  ""They  have  made  a  lot  of  changes  for  the  better  over  the  last  few  years.""  White  is  also  impressed  with  the  Welsh  pack's  strength  in  depth.  ""Gethin  Jenkins  is  starting  at  loose-head  for  them.  He  has  played  a  bit  at  tight-head  but  I  think  his  favoured  position  is  loose-head  and  he  is  very  good,""  he  added.  The  31-year-old  has  made  a  massive  contribution  to  the  England  and  Leicester  cause  of  late  and  is  arguably  the  form  tight-head  prop  in  the  world.  |||    He  destroyed  South  Africa's  Os  du  Randt  in  the  scrum  at  Twickenham  last  autumn  to  give  England  the  platform  for  an  impressive  32-16  victory.  Leicester,  who  signed  White  from  Bristol  when  the  West  Country  side  were  relegated  from  the  Zurich  Premiership  in  the  summer  of  2003,  have  also  been  aided  by  White's  presence  this  season.  The  Tigers  are  sitting  pretty  at  the  top  of  the  Premiership  table  and  have  also  booked  their  place  in  the  last  eight  of  the  Heineken  Cup.  ""I  am  pleased  with  my  form,""  he  said.  ""But  my  form  is  helped  by  the  people  I  play  with  at  Leicester  -  people  like  Martin  Johnson  and  Graham  Rowntree.  ""It's  been  a  good  season  so  far  and  to  be  in  the  starting  XV  for  the  first  game  of  the  Six  Nations  is  what  every  player  wants.  ""I  am  delighted  with  the  way  things  have  gone  but  we  have  to  get  it  right  this  weekend.""  White  is  now  one  of  the  more  experienced  members  of  the  England  squad  which  takes  to  the  field  on  Saturday.  Injuries  have  taken  their  toll  and  coach  Andy  Robinson  has  been  deprived  of  Richard  Hill,  Jonny  Wilkinson,  Martin  Corry,  Mike  Tindall,  Will  Greenwood  and  Stuart  Abbott.  |||    And  with  27  caps  and  a  World  Cup  winner's  medal  to  his  name,  White  is  now  in  a  position  to  offer  his  experience  to  youngsters  such  as  centres  Matthew  Tait  and  Jamie  Noon.  ""I  don't  know  how  much  experience  a  tight-head  can  give  a  centre  but  you  are  there  to  give  them  a  pat  on  the  back  if  things  go  wrong  or  to  be  there  if  they  want  to  talk  in  any  way,""  he  added.  ""When  I  first  came  into  the  squad,  people  like  Jason  Leonard  and  Martin  Johnson  were  the  first  to  come  over  and  talk  through  things  and  help  out.  |||    ""It  gives  you  a  lot  of  confidence  when  people  like  that  speak  to  you.  ""I  was  in  awe  of  a  lot  of  them  so  to  sit  down  and  speak  with  them  and  realise  you  are  on  the  same  wavelength  is  good.""  White  missed  the  vast  majority  of  last  year's  Six  Nations  because  of  a  knee  injury  and  is  raring  for  the  2005  event  to  get  going.  And  that  is  despite  the  opening  game  taking  place  amid  the  red-hot  atmosphere  in  Cardiff.  ""I  enjoy  the  atmosphere.  The  Millennium  Stadium  is  probably  one  of  the  best  stadiums  in  the  world,""  he  said.  ""To  go  down  there  and  hear  the  shouting  and  the  singing  -  it's  one  of  my  favourite  places  to  play.  ""This  is  probably  the  most  even  Six  Nations  for  a  long  time.  England,  Ireland,  France  and  Wales  are  all  contenders.  ""On  form,  Ireland  should  be  favourites  but  you  just  don't  know  -  that's  the  great  thing  about  this  tournament.""" 

2	"MPs  criticise  child  access  system  |||    Divorced  parents  seeking  access  to  their  children  are  often  disadvantaged  by  the  legal  system,  MPs  have  said.  |||    The  Constitutional  Affairs  Select  Committee  said  parents  with  custody  could  exploit  delays  in  the  system  to  stop  former  partners  gaining  access.  Courts  should  be  used  as  a  last  resort,  but  where  they  are,  their  orders  should  be  enforced  more  rigorously,  MPs  said.  But  they  rejected  the  claim  made  by  some  campaign  groups  that  there  should  be  a  legal  presumption  of  equal  access.  |||    Currently  the  presumption  is  that  the  interests  of  the  child  are  paramount.  ""An  arbitrary  'template'  imposed  on  all  families,  whatever  the  needs  of  the  child,  would  relegate  the  welfare  of  individual  children  to  a  secondary  position,""  the  MPs  said.  |||    They  said  the  law  should  be  changed  to  require  family  courts  specifically  to  take  account  of  the  importance  of  sustaining  the  relationship  between  the  child  and  the  non-resident  parent  in  contested  cases.  This  would  ""reassert  the  rights  of  non-resident  parents  to  contact  with  their  children,  as  well  as  the  rights  of  children  to  contact  with  both  their  parents,  while  maintaining  sufficient  flexibility  to  cope  with  issues  of  safety"",  they  said.  Delays  in  court  hearings  and  the  inability  to  effectively  enforce  court  orders  allowed  ""a  new  'status  quo'  arrangement  for  the  children  to  become  established  by  default"",  they  said.  |||    ""Although  the  courts  rigorously  avoid  conscious  bias,  there  are  considerable  grounds  for  accepting  that  non-resident  parents  are  frequently  disadvantaged  by  the  system  as  it  is  administered  at  present.  ""Given  the  strong  animosity  between  the  parties  which  is  common  in  contested  family  cases,  we  find  it  hard  to  believe  that  tactical  delay  is  not  sometimes  used  to  the  advantage  of  resident  parents.""  Committee  chairman  Alan  Beith  said  the  five-month  inquiry  had  been  a  ""complex  and  emotive""  one.  ""At  the  moment,  far  too  many  contact  and  residency  cases  are  being  dealt  with  by  the  courts  when  they  could  be  better  resolved  through  professional  mediation  and  negotiation,""  he  said.  ""This  situation  has  to  change.  The  court  system  should  only  be  used  as  a  last  resort,  where  mediation  and  negotiation  have  completely  broken  down  or  where  issues  of  abuse  or  domestic  violence  need  to  be  dealt  with.  ""This  will  help  to  reduce  delays  and  improve  the  lives  of  many  children  across  the  country.""" 

2	"Councils  'must  find  Gypsy  sites'  |||    Ministers  are  telling  councils  to  find  more  sites  for  travellers,  amid  continuing  rows  concerning  a  string  of  unauthorised  encampments.  |||    Councils  are  also  to  be  given  stronger  powers  to  move  on  illegal  settlements  by  Gypsy  communities  on  rural  land.  More  money  is  to  be  given  to  councils  to  develop  official  caravan  parks,  said  housing  minister  Yvette  Cooper.  In  November,  MPs  urged  ministers  to  make  councils  create  sites  because  3,500  travellers  have  no  place  to  stop.  Ms  Cooper  said  an  annual  scheme  to  refurbish  existing  traveller  sites  would  now  be  extended  to  consider  council  bids  for  new  stopping  places.  That  scheme  has  paid  out  £25m  in  four  years,  with  £8m  available  for  2005.  |||    ""There  are  two  major  problems  in  the  planning  system  at  the  moment  concerning  Gypsy  and  traveller  sites,""  said  Ms  Cooper.  ""Firstly,  local  authorities  are  not  identifying  enough  appropriate  locations  either  for  private  or  public  sites.  And  secondly,  they  do  not  have  enough  powers  to  deal  swiftly  with  development  on  inappropriate  sites.  ""The  result  is  that  there  are  too  many  developments  on  inappropriate  sites,  causing  tensions  and  difficulties  for  both  the  neighbouring  communities  and  the  Gypsies  and  travellers.  ""That  is  why  we  are  consulting  on  a  new  obligation  on  local  authorities  to  identify  more  appropriate  sites,  as  well  as  new  powers  to  take  immediate  action  if  the  development  is  in  the  wrong  place  and  cannot  be  tolerated  in  even  the  short-term  because  of  risk  to  local  amenity  and  the  environment.""  Under  the  new  regulations,  expected  to  be  in  force  in  the  spring,  officials  will  be  able  to  serve  ""temporary  stop  notices""  aimed  at  preventing  works  on  a  site  before  a  council  has  had  chance  to  obtain  a  full  legal  ban.  Many  MPs  with  rural  constituencies,  particularly  in  eastern  England,  have  been  pressing  the  government  to  create  stronger  enforcement  powers,  saying  villagers  are  suffering  because  of  the  legal  delays  in  removing  illegal  encampments.  |||    Andrew  Ryder,  of  the  Traveller  Law  Reform  Coalition,  said:  ""We  welcome  talk  about  an  obligation  on  councils  to  identify  land  for  Gypsies  and  travellers,  so  long  as  it  is  a  real  obligation  as  opposed  to  a  recommendation  which  could  be  and  was  easily  ignored.  ""New  accommodation  proposals  for  travellers  need  to  be  backed  up  with  decent  funding  and  intervention  by  the  government  when  councils  attempt  to  dodge  their  responsibilities  towards  travellers,  as  they  often  do.  ""Living  on  the  side  of  the  road  or  being  worn  down  by  planning  appeals,  legal  action  and  eviction  is  no  one's  idea  of  fun.""  In  their  November  report,  MPs  from  the  committee  scrutinising  the  Office  for  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  responsible  for  housing,  said  most  illegal  traveller  encampments  were  caused  by  a  lack  of  places  to  stop.  Numerous  communities  and  councils  were  paying  for  lengthy  and  expensive  evictions  against  travelling  communities,  said  the  MPs.  In  turn,  the  problems  had  worsened  because  councils  were  reluctant  to  voluntarily  provide  sites  because  of  resistance  from  residents.  Two  of  the  most  controversial  traveller  sites  -  Cottenham  in  Cambridgeshire  and  Minety  in  Wiltshire  -  remain  embroiled  in  an  ongoing  legal  battle."

The  owner  of  brands  such  as  Dairy  Milk,  Dr  Pepper  and  Snapple  generates  more  than  80%  of  its  sales  outside  the  UK.  Cadbury  said  it  was  confident  it  would  hit  its  targets  for  2005.  ""While  the  external  commercial  environment  remains  competitive,  we  are  confident  that  we  have  the  strategy,  brands  and  people  to  deliver  within  our  goal  ranges  in  2005,""  said  chief  executive  Todd  Stitzer.  |||    The  modest  profit  rise  had  been  expected  by  analysts  after  the  company  said  in  December  that  the  poor  summer  weather  had  hit  soft  drink  sales  in  Europe.  |||    Cadbury  said  its  underlying  sales  were  up  by  4%  in  2004.  Growth  was  helped  by  its  confectionery  brands  -  including  Cadbury,  Trident  and  Halls  -  which  enjoyed  a  ""successful""  year,  with  like-for-like  sales  up  6%.  Drinks  sales  were  up  2%  with  strong  growth  in  US  carbonated  soft  drinks,  led  by  Dr  Pepper  and  diet  drinks,  offset  by  the  weaker  sales  in  Europe.  Cadbury  added  that  its  Fuel  for  Growth  cost-cutting  programme  had  saved  £75m  in  2004,  bringing  total  cost  savings  to  £100m  since  the  scheme  began  in  mid-2003.  The  programme  is  set  to  close  20%  of  the  group's  factories  and  shed  10%  of  the  workforce.  Cadbury  Schweppes  employs  more  than  50,000  people  worldwide,  with  about  7,000  in  the  UK." 

2	"Escaped  prisoner  report  ordered  |||    First  Minister  Jack  McConnell  has  ordered  a  report  on  the  decision  to  allow  a  paranoid  schizophrenic  knife  attacker  to  go  on  a  visit  unguarded.  |||    Michael  Ferguson,  36,  escaped  after  being  allowed  out  of  the  high-security  Carstairs  unit.  The  SNP's  Nicola  Sturgeon  has  demanded  to  know  who  was  responsible  for  signing  off  the  leave.  The  Scottish  Executive  said  ministers  would  be  notified  but  it  would  ""not  be  common  practice""  to  sign  approval.  An  executive  spokesman  said  the  health  department  and  the  state  hospital  itself  would  work  together  on  preparing  the  report.  Ministerial  responsibility  for  Carstairs  rests  with  Rhona  Brankin,  the  deputy  health  minister.  Ms  Brankin  said:  ""The  first  minister  has  called  for  a  review  of  what  has  happened,  we  need  to  talk  to  the  state  hospital  and  we  need  to  reflect  on  this.""  Ms  Sturgeon  has  written  to  Mr  McConnell  asking  for  clarification  on  the  move  to  allow  the  prisoner  out.  She  said  questions  must  be  answered  about  his  escape,  if  the  public  is  to  be  reassured  about  safety.  Police  are  still  searching  for  Ferguson,  who  failed  to  return  after  a  trip  to  East  Kilbride  on  Monday.  |||    The  Scottish  National  Party's  parliamentary  leader  argued  that  under  the  law,  authorisation  of  Ferguson's  leave  of  absence  would  have  come  directly  from  ministers.  She  said:  ""The  Scottish  Executive  seemed  to  indicate  yesterday  that  the  escape  of  Mr  Ferguson  was  a  matter  for  Carstairs.  ""However,  my  understanding  is  that,  under  the  mental  health  legislation,  the  decision  to  grant  this  patient  -  and  any  restricted  patient  -  leave  of  absence,  would  have  required  direct  and  specific  authorisation  by  Scottish  ministers.""  She  added:  ""I  have  written  to  the  first  minister  today  asking  for  confirmation  of  that  fact.  I  have  also  asked  him  to  confirm  which  minister  would  routinely  take  decisions  of  this  nature  and  what  information  they  are  based  on.  ""This  is  not  an  attempt  to  apportion  blame,  but  to  ensure  a  better  understanding  of  the  decision  making  process  in  such  important  and  sensitive  cases.""  |||    Police  said  Ferguson  posed  a  danger  to  the  public.  BBC  Scotland  political  correspondent  Glenn  Campbell  said  the  first  minister  had  ordered  an  urgent  report  into  the  situation.  He  said:  ""We  understand  from  the  executive  that  in  this  case  no  individual  minister  signed  off  the  approval  for  Michael  Ferguson  to  be  released  unescorted  from  Carstairs.  ""The  executive  concedes  that  it  is  up  to  Scottish  ministers,  they  have  a  legal  responsibility  for  approving  this  sort  of  leave,  but  they  say  routinely  it  is  specialised  officials  that  make  that  decision  and  simply  inform  ministers  that  they  have  taken  it.  ""But  at  that  stage  presumably  ministers  can  ask  hard  questions  and  can  ask  for  reassurances  that  the  patient  is  not  a  serious  danger  to  the  public  or  that  any  risk  has  been  minimised.""  Scottish  Conservative  leader,  David  McLetchie,  said  earlier  it  was  ""almost  beyond  belief  that  this  has  been  allowed  to  happen"".  |||    The  executive  spokeswoman  said  the  recommendation  for  leave  was  agreed  by  a  psychiatric  advisor  ""in  conjunction  with  officials  on  behalf  of  ministers"".  She  said:  ""Ministers  were  told  of  that,  notified  of  it,  but  it  would  not  be  common  practice  for  them  to  sign  it  off.  ""They  do  have  statutory  responsibility,  but  the  common  practice  has  been  that  people  who  work  with  the  patient  and  have  the  best  knowledge  about  risk  would  make  that  decision.""  Ferguson,  who  slashed  a  man  in  a  doctors'  surgery  in  Coatbridge  in  1994,  had  been  out  to  see  his  fianc&#233;e  Annabella  Holmes,  47,  whom  he  met  when  she  was  a  patient  at  the  high  security  complex  in  South  Lanarkshire.  He  is  described  as  being  5ft  9ins  tall,  slim,  with  blond  hair,  blue  eyes  and  a  fair  complexion.  Ferguson  was  wearing  a  black  jacket,  grey  jeans,  black  jumper  and  black  shoes  when  he  was  last  seen.  He  has  multiple  fading  tattoos  on  his  left  hand  and  a  very  faded  tear  tattoo  under  his  left  eye.  Ms  Holmes  is  not  missing  but  there  have  been  no  sightings  of  Ferguson  since  Monday.  Strathclyde  Police  asked  anyone  who  spots  Ferguson  to  contact  Sergeant  Keith  McDonald  on  |||    ." 

0	"Mexican  in  US  send  $16bn  home  |||    Mexican  labourers  living  in  the  US  sent  a  record  $16.6bn  (£8.82bn)  home  last  year.  |||    The  Bank  of  Mexico  said  that  remittances  grew  24%  last  year  and  now  represent  the  country's  second-biggest  source  of  income  after  oil.  Better  records  and  greater  prosperity  of  Mexican  expatriates  in  the  US  are  the  main  reasons  behind  the  increase.  About  10  million  Mexicans  live  in  the  US,  where  there  are  16  million  citizens  of  Mexican  origin.  Remittances  now  represent  more  than  2%  of  the  country's  GDP,  according  to  the  Bank  of  Mexico's  figures.  Last  year,  there  were  50.9  million  transactions,  with  an  average  value  of  $327  per  remittance,  the  bank  said.  According  to  Standard  &  Poor's,  which  has  recently  upgraded  Mexico's  sovereign  debt  rating,  the  rise  in  remittances  helps  protect  the  Mexican  economy  against  a  potential  fall  in  the  international  oil  prices.  |||    The  growth  in  remittances  has  sparked  fierce  competition  between  banks.  Bank  of  America  announced  last  week  that  it  planned  to  eliminate  transfer  fees  for  some  customers.  Remittance  charges  are  estimated  to  have  dropped  by  between  50  and  60%,  reports  from  the  US  Treasury  and  the  Inter-American  Development  Bank  have  said.  The  Inter-American  Development  Bank  estimates  that  remittances  to  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean  reached  $45bn  in  2004." 

2	"'Poll  Idols'  face  first  hurdles  |||    Vote  For  Me  -  ITV1's  Pop  Idol  style  talent  contest  for  would-be  politicians  -  finally  hits  our  screens  this  week.  |||    Over  the  next  four  days,  hundreds  of  potential  candidates  will  be  whittled  down  by  a  panel  of  experts  and  public  vote.  The  winner  will  then  be  encouraged  to  stand  as  an  independent  at  the  next  general  election,  which  is  expected  in  the  spring.  But  opinion  is  divided  on  whether  any  of  the  potential  candidates  unearthed  so  far  have  got  what  it  takes  to  make  it  in  politics.  ""Any  of  them  would  make  competent  MPs,""  former  independent  MP  Martin  Bell  insisted  on  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme.  |||    Mr  Bell,  who  will  be  offering  his  advice  to  the  contestants  on  Wednesday,  argues  that  Westminster  has  its  share  of  ""odd  balls""  and  the  show  will  engage  ordinary  voters.  ""If  it  gets  more  people  voting  and  more  people  interested  in  politics  there  is  no  harm  in  that,""  he  said.  But  Sir  Bernard  Ingham,  Margaret  Thatcher's  former  press  secretary,  took  a  less  charitable  view,  accusing  the  programme  of  ""corrupting  politics"".  |||    He  said  the  producers  would  not  achieve  their  aim  of  re-engaging  voters  ""with  that  bunch  of  nutters"".  To  give  Sir  Bernard  his  dues,  Monday  evening's  opening  episode  did  attract  more  than  a  smattering  of  eccentrics  and  self-publicists.  Among  those  chancing  their  arm  were  a  druid  priest  and  a  former  porn  star,  who  insisted  on  removing  her  top  to  make  her  point  about  the  legalisation  of  brothels.  Among  the  more  eccentric  policy  proposals  was  a  public  holiday  on  Bruce  Forsyth's  birthday  and  Bill  Oddie  for  prime  minister.  The  show  follows  the  time-honoured  Pop  Idol  format,  with  queues  of  nervous  hopefuls  and  a  panel  of  three  experts  judging  their  performance.  |||    The  contestants  were  given  60  seconds  to  present  their  manifestos.  Then  the  final  25  were  tested  on  their  lobbying  ability.  They  were  then  cross-examined  by  the  panel,  which  was  chaired  by  ex-ITN  political  editor  John  Sergeant,  with  television  host  Lorraine  Kelly  taking  the  Nicki  Chapman  role.  But  the  real  star  of  the  show  is  Kelvin  MacKenzie,  in  the  Simon  Cowell,  Mr  Nasty  seat.  |||    The  former  Sun  editor  dispensed  a  stream  of  well-crafted  insults  and  one-liners.  His  advice  for  one  young  contestant  was  to  ""get  a  haircut  and  a  brain  transplant"".  Wheelchair  user  Kevin  Donnellon  was  asked:  ""Why  on  earth  do  you  want  our  elected  representatives  to  be  disabled?""  ""Don't  you  care  about  the  Inuit?"",  implored  guitar-toting  environmental  campaigner  Barry  Lim.  ""I  don't  care  about  them.  I  care  about  myself  and  when  the  sun's  shining  I  think  -  fantastic,""  replied  Mr  MacKenzie.  |||    Mr  Lim  later  reduced  the  panel  to  fits  of  giggles  as  he  outlined  his  plan  to  make  people  do  community  service  instead  of  paying  taxes.  ""When  the  prime  minister  turns  to  the  chancellor  and  says  how  much  have  we  got  in  the  coffers  Mr  Brown,  he  says  well,  prime  minister,  bad  news,  all  the  houses  in  Britain  have  been  painted  but  actually  nobody  has  paid  any  tax,""  observed  Mr  MacKenzie.  ""That  was  an  total  disaster.  I  just  couldn't  seem  to  think  of  things  to  say,""  a  crestfallen  Mr  Lim  confided  in  the  show's  presenter,  Jonathan  Maitland.  Irfan  Hanif,  a  25-year-old  doctor  from  Bolton,  made  a  good  impression,  even  if  he  was  a  little  thrown  by  Mr  MacKenzie's  suggestion  that  instead  of  being  treated  by  the  NHS,  young  drunks  should  ""given  a  good  beating""  and  left  to  die.  Dominic  Carman  -  son  of  late  libel  lawyer  George  Carman  -  was  voted  through  to  the  final  25,  on  a  platform  of  cutting  defence  spending  to  boost  education.  Opinion  was  more  divided  over  Rodney  Hylton-Potts,  a  59-year-old  convicted  fraudster.  Mr  MacKenzie  thought  the  smooth-talking  former  solicitor  -  with  a  hardline  on  crime  and  immigration  -  deserved  a  chance  to  progress.  ""He  could  join  the  rest  of  the  crooks  in  the  Houses  of  Parliament.""  But  Ms  Kelly  said  she  ""would  not  trust  him  as  far  as  she  could  throw  him"".  The  series  continues  throughout  the  week,  with  the  public  given  the  chance  to  evict  one  prospective  MP  every  night.  ITV  will  not  fund  the  election  campaign  for  the  eventual  winner,  but  the  publicity  could  give  the  winner  a  flying  start  over  other  candidates." 

2	"Observers  to  monitor  UK  election  |||    Ministers  will  invite  international  observers  to  check  the  forthcoming  UK  general  election  is  fairly  run.  |||    The  move  comes  amid  claims  the  poll  could  be  marred  by  electoral  fraud.  A  report  by  two  MPs  committees  called  on  Thursday  for  urgent  changes  to  the  electoral  registration  system  to  combat  vote  rigging  and  boost  turnout.  But  in  a  written  response  to  Labour  MP  Gordon  Prentice,  the  government  said  it  would  normally  invite  observers  to  any  UK  election.  |||    Junior  constitutional  affairs  minister  Christopher  Leslie  said:  ""I  fully  expect  us  to  repeat  our  previous  practice  of  doing  so  once  the  date  for  the  next  general  election  is  announced.""  The  government  has  looked  at  ways  of  boosting  voter  turnout,  which  fell  to  59%  in  the  last  general  election  in  2001.  |||    But  trial  all-postal  ballots  in  four  English  regions  last  summer  were  hit  by  delays  and  some  fraud  allegations.  Liberal  Democrat  peer  Lord  Greaves  called  last  week  for  international  observers  at  the  general  election  -  saying  otherwise  there  could  be  months  of  court  challenges  ""on  a  scale  not  seen  since  the  19th  Century"".  Thursday's  report  was  drawn  up  by  two  committees  scrutinising  the  work  of  the  Office  of  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  (ODPM)  and  the  Department  for  Constitutional  Affairs  (DCA).  It  said  that,  with  the  growth  of  postal  voting,  there  was  a  strong  case  to  tighten  up  fraud  protection  by  requiring  voters  to  register  individually,  rather  than  by  household.  It  also  said  about  three  million  people  eligible  to  vote  are  not  registered  to  do  so.  |||    Figures  for  the  2001  general  election  suggest  29%  of  people  aged  between  18  and  24,  and  19%  of  black  voters  were  not  on  the  electoral  roll.  Young  people  in  shared  accommodation  are  thought  to  miss  out  because  no  one  acts  as  head  of  the  household  to  fill  in  the  form.  ODPM  committee  chairman  Andrew  Bennett  said  individual  voter  registration,  as  opposed  to  registration  by  household,  should  be  quickly  introduced  as  it  could  ""dramatically  reduce  the  chances  of  fraud"".  But  his  counterpart  on  the  DCA  committee,  Alan  Beith,  said  it  should  be  delayed  ""until  measures  likely  to  increase  registration  have  been  put  in  place  and  proved  effective.""  Shadow  Constitutional  Affairs  Secretary  Oliver  Heald  accused  the  government  of  ""dragging  its  feet""  over  ""this  badly  needed  measure"".  ""It  is  vital  that  we  move  ahead  with  the  Northern  Ireland  system  of  individual  electoral  registration  to  safeguard  the  integrity  of  the  Britain's  electoral  system,""  he  said.  |||    The  report  said  individual  registration  should  be  treated  carefully  as  12%  of  voters  disappeared  from  the  electoral  roll  in  Northern  Ireland  when  it  was  introduced  in  2002.  The  report  said  the  government  should  consider  fines  for  unregistered  voters,  but  accepted  many  experts  said  it  would  be  an  expensive  system  that  would  be  hard  to  enforce.  It  said  incentives  to  register,  such  as  £20  council  tax  rebate,  were  likely  to  be  seen  as  ""gimmicks""  and  risked  undermining  the  integrity  of  the  system,  MPs  said.  Instead  they  called  for  ""imaginative  campaigns""  to  boost  interest."

Women  make  up  a  third  of  the  workforce.  The  research  was  carried  out  jointly  by  the  UK  Film  Council  and  industry  training  body  Skillset.  It  also  found  that  women  in  the  industry  were  less  likely  than  men  to  be  married  or  have  dependant  children.  |||    The  study,  which  claims  to  be  the  most  in-depth  so  far  conducted,  found  60%  of  women  in  the  film  industry  hold  degrees,  compared  with  39%  of  men.  Whilst  17%  of  men  in  the  industry  had  no  qualifications,  this  was  true  for  only  five  per  cent  of  women.  In  the  lower  salary  bracket,  35%  of  women  earn  less  than  £20,000  a  year,  compared  to  only  18%  of  men.  The  research  found  very  few  women  worked  in  the  camera,  sound,  electrical  and  construction  departments,  but  they  made  up  a  majority  of  those  working  in  make-up  and  hairdressing.  |||    UK  Film  Council  chief  executive  John  Woodward  said:  ""Whilst  the  UK  has  benefited  hugely  from  its  highly-qualified  film  production  workforce  there  are  still  many  barriers  facing  people  who  want  to  get  in  and  stay  in  the  industry.""  ""Developing  the  film  production  workforce  must  be  underpinned  with  a  commitment  to  diversity  as  well  as  training.""  The  workforce  is  largely  focused  around  London,  with  78%  in  the  industry  based  in  the  capital  and  the  south  east  of  England.  The  industry  depends  heavily  on  word  of  mouth,  with  81%  being  recruited  in  that  way.  In  total,  only  five  percent  of  the  workforce  is  made  up  of  ethnic  minorities,  although  in  London  the  figure  rises  to  24%.  The  necessity  of  completing  unpaid  work  experience  to  get  into  the  workforce  has  also  shot  up,  from  5%  before  the  1980s,  to  45%  after  2000." 

2	"Labour  chooses  Manchester  |||    The  Labour  Party  will  hold  its  2006  autumn  conference  in  Manchester  and  not  Blackpool,  it  has  been  confirmed.  |||    The  much  trailed  decision  was  ratified  by  Labour's  ruling  National  Executive  Committee  in  a  break  with  the  traditional  choice  of  a  seaside  venue.  It  will  be  the  first  time  since  1917  that  the  party  has  chosen  Manchester  to  host  the  annual  event.  Blackpool  will  get  the  much  smaller  February  spring  conference  instead  in  what  will  be  seen  as  a  placatory  move.  |||    For  years  the  main  political  parties  have  rotated  between  Blackpool,  Bournemouth  and  Brighton.  And  the  news  the  much  larger  annual  conference  is  not  to  gather  in  Blackpool  will  be  seen  as  a  blow  in  the  coastal  resort.  In  1998  the  party  said  it  would  not  return  to  Blackpool  but  did  so  in  2002.  The  following  year  Bournemouth  hosted  the  event  before  the  party  signed  a  two  year  deal  for  Brighton  to  host  the  autumn  conference.  |||    Colin  Asplin,  Blackpool  Hotel  Association  said:  ""We  have  tried  very  hard  to  make  sure  they  come  back  to  Blackpool.  ""Obviously  we  have  failed  in  that.  I  just  hope  Manchester  can  handle  the  crowds.  ""It  amazes  me  that  the  Labour  Party,  which  is  a  working  class  party,  doesn't  want  to  come  to  the  main  working  class  resort  in  the  country.""  The  exact  cost  to  Blackpool  in  terms  of  lost  revenue  for  hotel  accommodation  is  not  yet  known  but  it  is  thought  that  block  bookings  will  be  taken  at  the  major  Manchester  hotels  after  the  official  announcement."

US  gaming  consortium  BLB  will  pay  $339m  (£182.5m)  for  the  US  unit,  although  the  deal  is  subject  to  certain  conditions.  BLB  holds  a  22%  stake  in  Wembley  and  last  year  came  close  to  buying  the  whole  firm  in  a  £308m  takeover  deal.  Shares  in  Wembley  were  up  56  pence,  or  7.6%,  at  797p  by  mid-morning.  |||    The  sale  of  the  US  gaming  unit  will  leave  Wembley  with  its  UK  business.  This  includes  greyhound  tracks  at  Wimbledon  in  London,  Belle  Vue  in  Manchester,  Perry  Barr  and  Hall  Green  in  Birmingham,  Oxford  and  Portsmouth.  Analysts  have  valued  the  six  tracks  at  between  £40m-£50m.  The  US  business  accounts  for  about  90%  of  Wembley's  operating  profit  and  consists  of  operations  in  Rhode  Island  and  Colorado.  BLB's  purchase  of  the  US  unit  is  subject  to  the  agreement  of  a  revenue-sharing  deal  being  struck  with  Rhode  Island  authorities.  Wembley  said  that,  once  the  deal  was  completed,  it  anticipated  returning  surplus  cash  to  shareholders.  ""Whilst  the  completion  of  the  sale  of  the  US  Gaming  Division  remains  subject  to  a  number  of  conditions,  we  believe  this  development  is  a  positive  step  towards  the  maximisation  of  value  for  shareholders,""  said  Wembley  chairman  Claes  Hultman.  Wembley  sold  the  English  national  football  stadium  in  1999  to  concentrate  on  its  gaming  operations." 

2	"Crucial  decision  on  super-casinos  |||    A  decision  on  whether  to  allow  Westminster  to  legislate  on  super-casinos  is  set  to  be  made  by  the  Scottish  Parliament.  |||    The  government  has  plans  for  up  to  eight  Las  Vegas  style  resorts  in  the  UK,  one  of  which  is  likely  to  be  in  Glasgow.  Scottish  ministers  insist  they  will  still  have  the  final  say  on  whether  a  super-casino  will  be  built  in  Scotland.  But  opposition  parties  say  that  will  not  happen  in  practice.  The  vote  is  due  to  be  taken  on  Wednesday  and  is  expected  to  be  close.  |||    The  Scottish  Executive  believes  that  the  legislation  should  be  handled  by  Westminster.  The  new  law  will  control  internet  gambling  for  the  first  time  and  is  aimed  at  preventing  children  from  becoming  involved.  A  super-casino  in  Glasgow  could  be  located  at  Ibrox  or  the  Scottish  Exhibition  and  Conference  Centre.  The  new  gambling  bill  going  through  Westminster  will  allow  casino  complexes  to  open  to  the  public,  have  live  entertainment  and  large  numbers  of  fruit  machines  with  unlimited  prizes.  But  the  Scottish  National  Party  and  the  Tories  say  the  issue  of  super-casinos  should  be  decided  in  Scotland  and  believe  the  executive  is  shirking  its  responsibility."

Disney  failed  to  tell  investors  that  between  1999  and  2001  it  employed  three  adult  children  of  three  then  directors.  The  firm  has  neither  admitted  nor  denied  wrongdoing  in  the  settlement.  |||    The  three  Disney  directors  in  question  in  the  central  matter  of  the  SEC's  investigation  -  Reveta  Bowers,  Stanley  Gold  and  Raymond  Watson  -  have  all  since  left  the  company,  with  Ms  Bowers  and  Mr  Watson  both  retiring,  and  Mr  Gold  quitting  in  2003.  Their  children  were  paid  between  $60,000  (£30,800)  and  $150,000  a  year,  with  shareholders  not  being  informed.  The  SEC  also  found  that  Disney  did  not  disclose  that  a  50%  Disney-owned  subsidiary  company  -  Lifetime  -  employed  the  wife  of  current  Disney  director  John  Bryson,  and  that  she  earned  more  than  $1m  a  year.  Louise  Bryson  remains  with  Lifetime.  |||    Disney  also  failed  to  disclose  payments  to  Air  Shamrock,  an  airline  owned  by  Mr  Gold  and  fellow  former  Disney  directors  Roy  Disney.  Finally,  Disney  also  did  not  reveal  that  it  provided  more  than  $200,000  annually  for  office  space,  secretarial  services,  and  a  leased  car  and  driver  to  former  director  Thomas  Murphy.  ""Shareholders  have  a  significant  interest  in  information  regarding  relationships  between  the  company  and  its  directors,""  said  SEC  deputy  enforcement  director  Linda  Thomsen.  ""Failure  to  comply  with  the  SEC's  disclosure  rules  in  this  area  impedes  shareholders'  ability  to  evaluate  the  objectivity  and  independence  of  directors."""

But  when  asked  about  their  own  family's  financial  outlook,  a  majority  in  14  countries  said  they  were  positive  about  the  future.  Almost  23,000  people  in  22  countries  were  questioned  for  the  poll,  which  was  mostly  conducted  before  the  Asian  tsunami  disaster.  The  poll  found  that  a  majority  or  plurality  of  people  in  13  countries  believed  the  economy  was  going  downhill,  compared  with  respondents  in  nine  countries  who  believed  it  was  improving.  Those  surveyed  in  three  countries  were  split.  In  percentage  terms,  an  average  of  44%  of  respondents  in  each  country  said  the  world  economy  was  getting  worse,  compared  to  34%  who  said  it  was  improving.  Similarly,  48%  were  pessimistic  about  their  national  economy,  while  41%  were  optimistic.  And  47%  saw  their  family's  economic  conditions  improving,  as  against  36%  who  said  they  were  getting  worse.  |||    The  poll  of  22,953  people  was  conducted  by  the  international  polling  firm  GlobeScan,  together  with  the  Program  on  International  Policy  Attitudes  (Pipa)  at  the  University  of  Maryland.  ""While  the  world  economy  has  picked  up  from  difficult  times  just  a  few  years  ago,  people  seem  to  not  have  fully  absorbed  this  development,  though  they  are  personally  experiencing  its  effects,""  said  Pipa  director  Steven  Kull.  ""People  around  the  world  are  saying:  'I'm  OK,  but  the  world  isn't'.""  There  may  be  a  perception  that  war,  terrorism  and  religious  and  political  divisions  are  making  the  world  a  worse  place,  even  though  that  has  not  so  far  been  reflected  in  global  economic  performance,  says  the  BBC's  Elizabeth  Blunt.  |||    The  countries  where  people  were  most  optimistic,  both  for  the  world  and  for  their  own  families,  were  two  fast-growing  developing  economies,  China  and  India,  followed  by  Indonesia.  China  has  seen  two  decades  of  blistering  economic  growth,  which  has  led  to  wealth  creation  on  a  huge  scale,  says  the  BBC's  Louisa  Lim  in  Beijing.  But  the  results  also  may  reflect  the  untrammelled  confidence  of  people  who  are  subject  to  endless  government  propaganda  about  their  country's  rosy  economic  future,  our  correspondent  says.  South  Korea  was  the  most  pessimistic,  while  respondents  in  Italy  and  Mexico  were  also  quite  gloomy.  The  BBC's  David  Willey  in  Rome  says  one  reason  for  that  result  is  the  changeover  from  the  lira  to  the  euro  in  2001,  which  is  widely  viewed  as  the  biggest  reason  why  their  wages  and  salaries  are  worth  less  than  they  used  to  be.  The  Philippines  was  among  the  most  upbeat  countries  on  prospects  for  respondents'  families,  but  one  of  the  most  pessimistic  about  the  world  economy.  Pipa  conducted  the  poll  from  15  November  2004  to  3  January  2005  across  22  countries  in  face-to-face  or  telephone  interviews.  The  interviews  took  place  between  15  November  2004  and  5  January  2005.  The  margin  of  error  is  between  2.5  and  4  points,  depending  on  the  country.  In  eight  of  the  countries,  the  sample  was  limited  to  major  metropolitan  areas." 

2	"Visa  row  mandarin  made  Sir  John  |||    The  top  civil  servant  at  the  centre  of  the  David  Blunkett  visa  affair  has  been  knighted  in  the  New  Year  Honours.  |||    Sir  John  Gieve  was  Home  Office  permanent  secretary  during  the  saga  which  ended  with  Mr  Blunkett  quitting.  He  and  other  civil  servants  were  criticised  for  failing  to  recall  how  the  visa  for  Mr  Blunkett's  ex-lover's  nanny  came  to  be  fast-tracked.  The  outgoing  head  of  the  troubled  Child  Support  Agency  Doug  Smith  also  earns  an  honour  in  the  New  Year's  list.  Mr  Smith,  57,  whose  retirement  was  announced  by  Work  and  Pensions  Secretary  Alan  Smith  in  November,  is  made  a  Commander  of  the  Order  of  Bath.  |||    Both  men  were  giving  evidence  to  a  Commons  committee  on  the  computer  difficulties  facing  the  agency,  which  left  thousands  of  single  parents  without  any  maintenance  payments,  when  the  announcement  was  made.  The  knighting  of  Sir  John,  54,  will  be  received  with  astonishment  by  opposition  politicians.  |||    The  Liberal  Democrats  said  it  ""beggared  belief""  he  and  fellow  officials  could  not  remember  how  Leoncia  Casalme's  application  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain  went  from  Mr  Blunkett's  office  to  the  head  of  the  Immigration  and  Nationality  Department.  Meanwhile,  the  Conservatives  accused  officials  of  a  ""collective  failure""  of  memory.  But  Sir  Alan  Budd,  who  led  an  inquiry  into  the  affair,  said  he  had  no  reason  to  believe  anyone  involved  had  deliberately  withheld  information.  |||    Downing  Street  defended  the  decision  to  honour  both  men,  with  a  spokesperson  saying:  ""You  have  to  look  at  their  whole  career.""  Sir  John  was  made  permanent  secretary  in  April  2001  following  a  Civil  Service  career  which  dates  back  to  1974.  He  has  also  worked  in  the  Treasury  and  the  Department  of  Employment.  A  Department  for  Work  and  Pensions  spokeswoman  said  of  Mr  Smith's  honour:  ""The  award  reflects  all  that  he  has  achieved  in  a  Civil  Service  career,  principally  in  the  Inland  Revenue,  spanning  over  40  years  -  not  just  his  role  as  chief  executive  of  the  Child  Support  Agency.  |||    ""In  his  career  he  has  personally  led  a  number  of  successful  major  change  programmes.""  Mr  Smith  is  set  to  stay  on  at  the  CSA  until  March.  Less  controversial  will  be  the  knighthoods  for  Derek  Wanless  and  Mike  Tomlinson,  who  undertook  major  government  reviews  on  health  and  education  respectively.  Former  NatWest  chief  executive  Mr  Wanless,  57,  has  delivered  not  one  but  two  major  reports  on  the  NHS.  Ex-chief  inspector  of  schools  Mr  Tomlinson,  62,  has  recommended  replacing  A-Levels  and  GCSEs  with  a  new  diploma  system  in  a  shake-up  of  the  exams  system." 

2	"Borders  rail  link  campaign  rally  |||    Campaigners  are  to  stage  a  rally  calling  for  a  Borders  rail  link  which  was  closed  in  1969  to  be  reopened.  |||    They  will  mark  the  36th  anniversary  of  the  line  closure,  which  ran  from  Edinburgh  through  the  Borders  and  on  to  Carlisle,  with  a  walk  at  Tweedbank.  Anne  Borthwick,  of  Campaign  for  Borders  Rail,  said  reopening  the  Waverley  Line  would  restore  the  area's  prosperity.  MSPs  are  considering  the  reintroduction  of  passenger  rail  services  through  Midlothian  to  the  Borders.  Campaigners  have  said  that  reopening  the  Waverley  Line,  which  could  cost  up  to  £100m,  would  be  a  huge  economic  boost  for  the  Borders.  |||    In  2000,  Borders  Council  said  the  area's  economy  had  suffered  since  the  closure.  Ms  Borthwick  said  the  lobby  group  was  determined  to  keep  the  pressure  on  the  Scottish  Executive.  ""We  are  hoping  that  many  people  will  join  us  in  a  march  to  mark  the  36th  anniversary  of  the  closure  of  the  Waverley  Line,""  she  said.  ""Campaign  for  Borders  Rail  is  the  biggest  independent  lobby  group  in  Scotland  and  we  have  been  lobbying  tirelessly  for  the  reinstatement  of  rail  services  to  the  Borders  and  eventually  to  Carlisle.  |||    ""We  believe  that  it  is  time  for  the  Scottish  Executive  to  commit  to  the  first  phase  of  the  project  by  pledging  to  fund  the  line  between  Edinburgh  and  Tweedbank  in  the  first  instance  and  then  investigate  extending  the  line  in  the  future.""  Ms  Borthwick  said  reopening  the  line  would  be  a  prosperous  move  and  protect  the  character  of  the  Scottish  Borders.  A  study  in  2000,  which  was  commissioned  by  the  executive,  Scottish  Borders  Council,  Midlothian  Council  and  Scottish  Borders  Enterprise,  found  that  a  half-hourly  service  from  Tweedbank  to  Edinburgh  could  cover  its  operating  costs.  It  also  found  that  a  half-hourly  service  from  Gorebridge  to  Edinburgh  could  cover  operating  costs  and  that  a  freight  railway  joining  the  West  Coast  Main  Line  at  Longtown  could  also  be  reinstated." 

2	"Report  attacks  defence  spending  |||    The  Ministry  of  Defence  has  been  criticised  over  the  soaring  spending  costs  and  growing  delays  of  its  top  equipment  projects.  |||    A  National  Audit  Office  report  on  the  20  biggest  projects  says  costs  have  risen  by  £1.7bn  in  the  past  year.  It  says  there  is  ""little  evidence""  the  MoD's  performance  had  improved,  despite  the  introduction  of  a  ""smart  acquisition""  policy  six  years  ago.  A  senior  defence  official  told  the  BBC  lessons  were  being  learned.  The  NAO's  annual  report  showed  the  total  cost  of  the  20  projects  covered  was  expected  to  reach  £50bn  -  14%  higher  than  originally  planned.  The  total  delays  amounted  to  62  months,  with  average  individual  delays  rising  by  three  months.  |||    Sir  John  Bourn,  head  of  the  NAO,  said  the  problems  showed  the  principles  of  the  scheme  known  as  smart  acquisition  had  not  been  consistently  applied.  ""Many  problems  can  be  traced  to  the  fact  that  the  MoD  has  not  spent  enough  time  and  resources  in  the  assessment  phase,""  the  report  says.  The  NAO  found  that  projects  launched  since  the  start  of  the  scheme  were  showing  the  same  worrying  tendencies  as  the  older  ""legacy  projects"",  such  as  the  Eurofighter.  A  senior  defence  official,  speaking  to  the  BBC's  defence  correspondent  Paul  Adams,  said  that  although  the  figures  were  still  not  good  enough,  the  report  reflected  unrealistic  expectations  early  on  in  the  project  cycle.  This  year's  overspend  was  significantly  less  than  last  year's  £3.1bn  total,  and  the  Defence  Procurement  Agency  -  which  is  responsible  for  buying  defence  equipment  -  was  improving.  |||    Lord  Bach,  Minister  for  Defence  Procurement,  said  he  was  ""obviously  still  disappointed  with  the  cost  and  time  increases  shown"",  but  insisted  that  the  Defence  Procurement  Agency  had  ""undertaken  a  huge  amount  of  work  to  expose  any  underlying  problems  on  projects"".  The  latest  findings  follow  a  string  of  critical  reports  issued  within  the  last  12  months,  and,  according  to  our  correspondent,  contain  few  new  surprises.  Turning  around  the  Defence  Procurement  Agency  ""was  a  little  like  trying  to  turn  around  a  super  tanker  -  it  takes  a  very  long  time  indeed"",  he  said.  Our  correspondent  said  it  was  the  same  projects,  including  the  Joint  Strike  Fighter,  the  Nimrod  and  A400M  aircraft  and  the  Type  45  Destroyer,  which  were  resonsible  for  the  bulk  of  the  cost  over-runs  and  delay.  But  he  added  some  projects,  such  as  the  C-17  heavy  lift  aircraft  and  Successor  Identification  Friend  or  Foe  (SIFF),  were  showing  good  performances."

""This  film  should  be  judged  on  its  artistic  merit,  not  who  spends  more  money  on  advertising,""  Davey  said.  But  DVDs  will  be  sent  to  Oscar  voters,  who  will  be  invited  to  screenings.  Icon  spent  very  little  on  advertising  the  film,  which  deals  with  the  last  hours  of  Jesus  Christ's  life,  when  it  was  released  earlier  this  year  -  instead,  it  made  the  film  available  for  special  screenings  at  churches.  It  went  on  to  gross  over  $600m  (£322m)  in  ticket  sales  worldwide.  Over  recent  years,  marketing  films  to  the  members  of  the  Academy  of  Motion  Picture  Arts  and  Sciences  has  become  a  multi-million  dollar  industry.  Last  year,  the  academy  formed  a  committee  to  tighten  the  rules  after  the  campaigns  spilled  over  into  personal  attacks  between  studios.  Academy  president  Frank  Pierson  praised  Gibson's  move  for  working  to  restore  the  Oscars  as  a  ""celebration  and  appreciation  of  excellence,""  and  resisting  the  ""crass  commercialisation  that  was  threatening  the  integrity  of  the  award""."

Nonetheless,  US  crude  is  still  30%  more  expensive  than  at  the  beginning  of  2004,  boosted  by  growing  demand  and  bottlenecks  at  refineries.  Traders  ignored  the  possible  effects  of  Asia's  tidal  waves  on  global  supplies.  |||    Instead,  the  focus  is  now  on  US  consumption,  which  is  heavily  influenced  in  the  short  term  by  the  weather.  ""With  the  revised  milder  temperatures...  I'm  more  inclined  to  think  we'll  push  lower  and  test  the  $40-40.25  range,""  said  John  Brady  of  ABN  AMRO.  ""The  market  definitely  feels  to  be  on  the  defensive.""  Statistics  released  last  week  showed  that  stockpiles  of  oil  products  in  the  US  had  risen,  an  indication  that  severe  supply  disruptions  may  not  arise  this  winter,  barring  any  serious  incident.  Oil  prices  have  broken  records  in  2004,  topping  $50  a  barrel  at  one  point,  driven  up  by  a  welter  of  worries  about  unrest  in  Iraq  and  Saudi  Arabia,  rising  demand  and  supply  bottlenecks.  London's  International  Petroleum  Exchange  remained  closed  for  the  Christmas  holiday." 

2	"Brown  hits  back  in  Blair  rift  row  |||    Gordon  Brown  has  criticised  a  union  leader  who  said  conflict  between  himself  and  Tony  Blair  was  harming  the  workings  of  government.  |||    Jonathan  Baume,  of  the  top  civil  servants'  union,  spoke  of  ""competing  agendas""  between  Mr  Brown  and  Mr  Blair.  But  the  chancellor  said  Mr  Baume  was  never  at  meetings  between  himself  and  the  prime  minister  so  could  not  judge.  He  said  the  union  leader  was  trying  to  block  civil  service  reform  which  threatened  his  members'  jobs.  It  suited  the  purpose  of  Mr  Baume's  union,  the  First  Division  Association,  to  suggest  there  were  two  agendas  battling  against  each  other  because  the  union  was  trying  to  resist  the  planned  reforms,  Mr  Brown  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme.  |||    Under  the  plans,  unveiled  in  the  Gershon  report,  some  84,000  civil  servants  jobs  will  be  axed  or  changed  and  the  savings  ploughed  back  into  frontline  services.  Mr  Brown  said:  ""To  be  honest  I  don't  think  you  can  rely  on  his  [Mr  Baume's]  judgement  on  this  matter  when  it  comes  to  the  decisions  that  the  government  are  making.  ""Mr  Blair  and  I  are  making  exactly  the  same  decisions  on  civil  service  reforms.  We  are  determined  to  go  on  with  the  Gershon  reforms.""  He  also  said  that  as  Mr  Baume  was  never  present  at  meetings  between  himself  and  the  prime  minister,  he  was  not  in  a  position  to  judge.  On  Wednesday,  ahead  of  the  Chancellor's  pre-Budget  report,  Mr  Baume  told  BBC  News  there  were  sometimes  ""conflicting  and  competing  agendas  for  government""  between  Number  10  and  the  Treasury.  |||    What  the  chancellor  wanted  was  ""not  by  any  means  what  Alan  Milburn  and  the  prime  minister  want  to  see"",  Mr  Baume  said.  ""Government  departments  get  their  money  from  the  Treasury  on  the  basis  of  public  service  agreements  they  sign  up  to,  but  at  the  same  time  the  prime  minister  also  has  an  agenda  and  that's  not  necessarily  the  same  as  the  Treasury's  and  the  prime  minister  is  of  course  a  very  powerful  figure  in  any  government.  ""He  also  sends  instructions  and  messages  and  directions  to  departments  about  how  he  would  like  each  secretary  of  state  and  each  department  to  implement  a  policy  agenda.  ""The  problem  is  that  on  many  occasions  these  two  don't  add  up  and  individual  cabinet  ministers  as  well  as  departments  have  to  make  sense  of  this  battle.""  Number  10  said  ministers  were  interested  in  governing  and  not  a  ""soap  opera""  about  Mr  Blair  and  Mr  Brown.  Tory  shadow  chancellor  Oliver  Letwin  said:  ""The  battle  Royal  that  the  top  civil  servants  are  now  reporting  on  between  the  chancellor  and  Tony  Blair  is  preventing  them  both  from  getting  on  with  the  business  of  getting  taxpayers  value  for  money.""" 

2	"Job  cuts  'false  economy'    -  TUC  |||    Plans  to  shed  71,000  civil  service  jobs  will  prove  to  be  a  ""false  economy""  that  could  hamper  public  sector  reforms,  according  to  a  TUC  report.  |||    Public  and  Commercial  Services  union  members  have  already  voted  to  strike  over  cuts  for  one  day  on  5  November.  The  TUC  said  cuts  would  deliver  less  than  6%  of  the  £22bn  ministers  hope  to  save  through  efficiency  reforms.  General  secretary  Brendan  Barber  warned  the  ""costs  could  easily  outweigh  the  benefits"".  ""The  government's  big  boost  to  public  spending  is  now  showing  results,""  said  Mr  Barber.  ""Public  services  are  improving  but  looking  for  simple  savings  through  job  cuts  at  this  stage  could  be  a  false  economy.  |||    ""They  may  shoot  a  Tory  fox,  but  cutting  thousands  of  civil  service  jobs  will  hit  the  morale  and  capabilities  of  the  public  servants  expected  to  implement  government  reforms.  The  costs  could  easily  outweigh  the  benefits.""  Next  Friday's  strike  action  by  the  PCS  is  the  biggest  in  the  civil  service  since  1993,  hitting  Jobcentres,  benefit  agencies,  pensions  offices,  customs  and  driving  tests.  The  union  says  it  is  concerned  about  pensions,  sick  pay  and  forced  relocation  as  well  as  the  cut  in  jobs.  Last  month  it  was  announced  that  a  total  of  37  social  security  offices  and  Jobcentres  across  the  UK  would  close  in  the  first  wave  of  plans  to  shed  civil  service  jobs.  The  number  of  civil  servants  in  Britain  rose  to  more  than  520,000  in  April.  Other  areas  the  strike  will  affect  include  passports,  museums  and  galleries,  libraries  and  health  and  safety  inspections."

ABC  bought  the  rights  to  the  British  show,  which  was  first  aired  in  2003  and  became  a  hit  on  Channel  4.  The  US  network  is  not  part  of  the  claim,  but  has  supported  RDF's  action.  ""We  respect  our  producing  partners'  right  to  protect  their  intellectual  property  in  whatever  manner  they  deem  most  appropriate,""  said  ABC  in  a  statement.  A  spokesman  for  Fox  said  it  had  not  seen  the  details  of  the  legal  action  and  could  not  comment.  |||    Their  show  was  first  screened  in  June,  and  was  criticised  in  the  press  for  its  similarities  to  Wife  Swap.  ABC  originally  planned  to  call  their  programme  Trading  Moms,  but  changed  it  to  avoid  confusion  with  the  Fox  version.  Earlier  this  year,  the  NBC  network  claimed  that  Fox's  boxing  show  The  Next  Great  Champ  had  been  hurriedly  produced  to  ensure  its  programme  was  the  first  to  be  screened.  NBC  alleged  that  boxing  regulations  had  been  violated,  but  failed  in  their  attempt  to  have  the  show  pulled.  The  Fox  show  proved  a  ratings  flop,  while  NBC's  The  Contender  is  due  to  begin  in  February."

The  vast  archive  of  instruments,  signed  records  and  posters  were  collected  by  a  dedicated  fan  who  had  become  friendly  with  the  star.  The  auction  was  billed  as  the  biggest  collection  of  Hendrix  memorabilia  to  go  under  the  hammer.  The  majority  of  the  items  were  collected  by  fan  Bob  Terry  who  began  collecting  at  the  age  of  17.  He  later  sold  it  on  to  another  collector.  |||    Hendrix,  widely  considered  one  of  the  best  guitarists  of  his  era,  died  of  a  drug  overdose  in  1970  at  the  age  of  27.  The  1965  Fender  Stratocaster  was  used  by  the  musician  on  tour  and  in  his  studio.  A  poem  written  by  Hendrix  two  weeks  after  his  infamous  appearance  at  the  Monterey  Festival  where  he  set  light  to  his  guitar  went  for  £10,000.  The  Jimi  Hendrix  Experience's  first  single  Hey  Joe,  signed  by  all  the  band,  was  sold  for  £2,000.  The  sale,  hosted  by  auctioneers  Cooper  Owen,  was  held  at  the  Hard  Rock  Cafe  in  London."

It  said  scripts  have  been  commissioned  for  a  series  about  a  community  of  working  class  people  in  of  Chicago.  The  original  EastEnders  was  pulled  from  BBC  America  last  year  after  it  proved  a  failure  in  the  ratings.  US  versions  of  other  British  hits  have  proved  less  successful  across  the  Atlantic.  |||    BBC  comedy  Coupling  was  remade  with  a  US  cast,  but  lost  its  primetime  slot  on  the  NBC  network  due  to  disappointing  ratings.  At  home,  EastEnders  has  been  facing  its  own  ratings  battle,  recently  losing  out  to  rival  ITV  soap  Emmer  dale.  Primetime  soaps  on  US  television  have  made  a  recent  comeback,  following  the  success  of  ABC  serial  Desperate  Housewives.  The  series  takes  a  ""darkly  comedic""  look  at  the  goings-on  of  a  group  of  characters  living  in  the  suburbs." 

2	"Former  NI  minister  Scott  dies  |||    Former  Northern  Ireland  minister  Sir  Nicholas  Scott  has  died  at  a  London  hospice,  his  family  has  announced.  |||    The  former  Conservative  MP  for  Kensington  and  Chelsea,  died  after  a  long  illness  diagnosed  as  Alzheimer's.  The  71-year-old  served  in  Northern  Ireland  from  1981  to  1987  during  the  premiership  of  Margaret  Thatcher.  As  a  Northern  Ireland  minister  he  dealt  with  education  and  later  security  where  he  rode  out  the  mass  IRA  escape  from  the  Maze  in  1983.  |||    In  education,  he  encountered  criticism  over  school  closures  and  the  future  of  the  Catholic  training  colleges.  He  also  merged  the  New  University  of  Ulster  and  the  Ulster  Polytechnic  to  create  the  University  of  Ulster.  Sir  Nicholas  was  a  strong  defender  of  the  Anglo-Irish  Agreement  and  was  held  in  esteem  in  Dublin  government  and  SDLP  circles.  But  he  experienced  hostility  from  unionists  some  of  whom  dubbed  him  ""Minister  of  Discord"".  After  leaving  Northern  Ireland  in  a  reshuffle,  he  became  a  UK  disability  minister.  Sir  Nicholas  was  replaced  as  the  member  for  Kensington  and  Chelsea  by  the  flamboyant  Alan  Clark,  after  being  deselected  by  his  constituency  in  December  1996.  His  deselection  followed  a  series  of  scandals  including  being  found  slumped  in  the  street  by  police  during  the  Tory  Party  conference  in  Bournemouth  and  taken  back  to  his  hotel.  |||    Sir  Nicholas  claimed  strong  painkillers  he  was  taking  for  a  back  problem  had  reacted  badly  with  a  small  amount  of  alcohol.  After  his  sacking,  he  bitterly  said  that  despite  the  support  of  Cabinet  ministers  and  Tory  backbenchers,  the  Eurosceptics  in  his  constituency  were  ""absolutely  determined  to  get  rid  of  me"".  His  colourful  career  also  included  a  very  public  disagreement  with  daughter  Victoria  over  civil  rights  for  the  disabled.  Sir  Nicholas  admitted  he  misled  MPs  when  he  denied  his  department  had  been  involved  in  wrecking  tactics  designed  to  kill  the  Disability  Bill  in  1994.  Victoria,  a  lobbyist  for  disabled  rights,  denounced  her  father's  actions  and  heaped  insult  on  injury  when  she  joined  the  calls  for  him  to  resign.  He  joined  the  backbenches  two  months  later." 

2	"UK  needs  tax  cuts,  Tories  insist  |||    A  major  change  of  direction  is  needed  in  Britain  if  it  is  to  prosper,  the  shadow  chancellor  said  as  the  Tory  Party  spring  conference  began.  |||    Oliver  Letwin  said  the  UK  could  not  compete  with  other  countries  without  the  £4bn  tax  cuts  he  was  promising.  Tory  co-chairman  Liam  Fox  had  opened  the  forum  in  Brighton  with  an  attack  on  Labour's  record  and  party  leader  Michael  Howard  is  due  to  speak  later.  Tony  Blair  has  said  Conservative  policies  would  cause  economic  failure.  But  Mr  Letwin  said  Britain  had  fallen  from  fourth  to  11th  in  the  international  economic  competitiveness  league.  |||    ""Can  this  country  compete,  can  this  country  prosper,  unless  we  do  something  about  the  burden  of  regulation  and  tax  on  our  economy?""  he  said.  ""If  we  are  going  to  take  on  the  great  challenges,  the  challenges  like  those  posed  by  the  Chinese  and  the  Indians,  we  have  got  to  do  something  about  getting  down  the  burden  of  regulation  and  getting  down  the  burden  of  tax,""  he  said.  ""The  fact  is  the  very  carefully  costed,  fully  funded  plans  we  have  laid  out  for  saving  £12bn  by  2007-2008  are  absolutely  crucial  to  delivering  an  economy  that  will  prosper  and  provide  people  with  jobs  and  indeed  provide  the  public  services  with  the  money  they  need  on  a  sustainable  long-term  basis.""  Mr  Letwin  said  voting  for  Labour  meant  choosing  higher  taxes,  borrowing  and  waste.  |||    Earlier,  Dr  Fox  had  said  Labour's  rule  had  been  characterised  by  ""lost  trust  and  failure  to  deliver"".  He  also  attacked  the  government's  ""failure""  to  control  immigration  and  asylum  and  criticised  its  record  on  the  NHS,  telling  delegates  Labour  cannot  be  trusted  on  education  or  crime.  A  Tory  government  would  sort  out  the  ""shambles""  of  immigration,  put  patients  before  statistics  and  bring  discipline  to  schools,  he  said.  Michael  Howard,  who  had  been  due  to  welcome  delegates  to  the  conference  on  Friday,  will  address  them  in  a  lunchtime  speech.  His  welcome  address  had  to  be  postponed  after  he  stayed  in  London  to  lead  the  party's  opposition  to  the  Prevention  of  Terrorism  Bill  in  its  lengthy  progress  through  Parliament.  The  bill  was  finally  passed  on  Friday  evening,  after  more  than  30  hours  of  debate.  Mr  Howard  is  likely  to  defend  his  party's  handling  of  the  bill,  which  was  only  passed  after  the  Conservatives  accepted  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair's  promise  that  MPs  would  be  able  to  review  it  within  a  year." 

2	"Blair  told  to  double  overseas  aid  |||    Tony  Blair  is  being  urged  to  use  all  his  negotiating  powers  to  end  poor  countries'  debt  and  double  aid.  |||    Some  45  million  children  will  die  needlessly  before  2015  and  aid  budgets  are  half  their  1960  levels,  Oxfam  says  in  a  report,  Paying  the  Price.  The  call  comes  as  the  prime  minister  prepares  to  assume  the  presidency  of  the  G8  of  top  industrialised  nations.  ""As  rich  countries  get  richer,  they're  giving  less  and  less.  This  scandal  must  stop,""  Oxfam's  Barbara  Stocking  said.  |||    ""The  world's  poorest  children  are  paying  for  rich  countries'  policies  in  aid  and  debt  with  their  lives.  ""2005  offers  the  chance  for  an  historic  breakthrough,  but  unless  world  leaders  act  now  the  year  will  end  in  shameful  failure,""  the  charity's  director  added.  The  report  said:  ""For  rich  countries,  providing  aid  to  help  to  end  global  poverty  is  an  obligation  and  a  matter  of  justice,  not  an  act  of  charity.""  It  also  points  out  that  in  1970  the  G8  of  top  industrialised  nations  agreed  to  spend  0.7%  of  their  incomes  on  aid.  But  34  years  later  none  of  the  organisations  members  have  reached  this  target  and  many  have  not  yet  set  a  timetable,  the  report  says.  |||    It  argues  that  the  price  of  not  investing  in  poor  countries'  sustainable  development  will  be  felt  across  the  world.  The  report  said:  ""Global  poverty  threatens  our  shared  prosperity  and  security.  ""Environmental  crises  and  natural  disasters,  disease  and  drug  trafficking  know  no  national  borders.  Poverty  heightens  the  likelihood  of  conflict  and  unrest.  ""New  threats  to  the  peace  and  security  of  rich  nations  arise  from  poverty  and  gross  inequalities.  ""Criminal  and  terrorist  networks  are  more  likely  to  operate  where  state  institutions  are  weak.""  |||    Both  the  prime  minister  and  Chancellor  Gordon  Brown  have  called  for  urgent  action  to  fight  world  poverty.  Mr  Blair,  who  has  described  Africa  as  a  ""scar""  on  the  world's  conscience,  has  already  said  tackling  world  poverty  would  be  one  his  G8  priorities  along  with  climate  change  and  the  Aids  epidemic.  Mr  Brown  has  also  pledged  to  write  off  the  debt  owed  to  Britain  by  the  world's  poor  nations.  A  spokeswoman  for  the  Department  for  International  Development  said:  ""The  government  had  made  a  clear  commitment  to  reaching  0.7%  of  gross  national  income  for  overseas  development  aid  by  2013.  ""If  Britain's  proposal  for  an  International  Finance  Facility  were  adopted,  the  objective  of  0.7%  could  be  achieved  earlier,  by  2008-09.  ""These  additional  resources  will  be  used  to  increase  UK  bilateral  aid  to  Africa  to  at  least  £1.25bn  a  year  by  2008  and  spend  at  least  £1.5bn  on  HIV/Aids  related  work  over  the  next  three  years.""" 

2	"MPs  to  debate  'euthanasia  laws'  |||    MPs  are  preparing  to  debate  a  bill  which  critics  claim  would  legalise  euthanasia  ""by  the  back  door"".  |||    The  bill  would  give  legal  force  to  ""living  wills"",  where  people  say  they  want  medical  treatment  withheld  if  they  become  severely  incapacitated.  The  Mental  Capacity  Bill  has  broad  support  from  charities  who  say  it  would  give  better  safeguards  over  treatment.  But  Christian  groups  say  it  could  mean  doctors  withholding  food  and  fluids  even  if  they  think  it  inappropriate.  |||    Ministers  insist  the  Mental  Capacity  Bill  -  for  England  and  Wales  -  would  not  change  laws  on  assisted  suicide  and  contains  a  presumption  in  favour  of  preserving  life.  |||    The  bill  would  establish  a  legal  presumption  that  everybody  can  make  decisions  about  their  own  treatment  unless  proved  otherwise.  It  would  allow  people  to  give  somebody  the  power  of  attorney  to  make  decisions  on  their  behalf,  which  could  be  challenged  by  doctors.  Critics  fear  it  could  allow  ""killing  by  omission""  through  withdrawing  treatment.  An  amendment  to  the  bill  -  specifically  preventing  decisions  that  would  bring  about  death  -  has  been  tabled  by  former  Conservative  leader  Iain  Duncan  Smith.  Ninety  one  MPs  have  signed  a  petition  backing  the  amendment.  MPs  could  vote  on  it  later  on  Tuesday,  during  the  bill's  report  stage  debate.  The  Bill  will  then  go  to  a  third  reading  and  be  debated  in  the  Lords,  before  becoming  law.  |||    The  Christian  Medical  Fellowship  (CMF)  and  Lawyers'  Christian  Fellowship  (LCF)  said  the  Mental  Capacity  Bill  would  allow  euthanasia  by  the  ""back  door"".  Peter  Saunders  of  the  CMF  said  it  believed  advance  refusals  should  be  only  advisory,  not  legally  binding.  ""CMF  is  concerned  that  patients  will  make  unwise  and  hasty  advance  decisions  to  refuse  food  and  fluids  without  being  properly  informed  about  the  diagnosis  and  the  expected  course  their  illness  will  take,""  he  said.  |||    The  LCF's  Andrea  Williams  said  there  were  ""too  many  loopholes  that  could  be  abused  by  unscrupulous  doctors"".  Ex-Labour  minister  Frank  Field  told  BBC  Two's  Newsnight  programme  there  was  a  danger  people  would  feel  under  pressure  to  ""do  away""  with  themselves  so  relatives  could  inherit  their  assets.  |||    Constitutional  Affairs  Minister  David  Lammy  said  laws  affecting  750,000  people  with  dementia  needed  updating.  Mr  Lammy  told  BBC  News  Labour  MPs  would  not  get  a  free  vote  as  the  law  was  being  strengthened,  not  changed.  ""We  are  against  euthanasia,  we  are  against  assisted  suicide  but  we  are  in  a  situation  now  where  people  can  make  living  wills  and  that  has  the  force  of  the  common  law,""  he  said.  ""Doctors  are  saying  they  want  more  clarity.  Patients  are  saying  they  want  more  clarity.""  The  Making  Decisions  Alliance,  which  includes  the  Alzheimer's  Society,  Age  Concern,  Mencap  and  the  National  Autistic  Society,  said  misunderstandings  over  the  bill  had  to  be  cleared  up.  ""It  will  not  change  the  current  law  on  euthanasia  and  will  actually  provide  a  series  of  better  safeguards  when  decisions  are  made  for  people  who  lack  capacity,""  the  alliance  said  in  a  statement.  The  British  Medical  Association  also  backs  the  bill,  saying  it  just  gives  incapacitated  people  the  same  rights  as  others.  Debate  on  legalising  euthanasia  has  intensified  in  the  UK  because  of  cases  like  that  of  motor  neurone  patient  Diane  Pretty.  She  died  two  years  ago  after  losing  a  legal  battle  to  allow  her  husband  to  help  her  commit  suicide."

Asia's  biggest  airline  joins  Japanese  rival  All  Nippon  as  one  of  the  first  carriers  to  order  the  mid-size  7E7,  which  Boeing  says  is  super-economical.  Airbus  this  week  announced  the  first  pre-sale  of  its  7E7  rival  -  the  A350.  Boeing's  great  European  competitor  is  to  sell  10  of  its  forthcoming  A350  to  Spanish  carrier  Air  Europe,  which  has  the  option  to  buy  two  more  in  a  deal  that  could  be  worth  more  than  $1.8bn.  Both  the  7E7  and  the  A350  are  being  designed  to  be  as  fuel-efficient  as  possible  in  the  200-  to  300-seat  sector,  and  each  will  be  available  in  both  short  and  long  range  versions.  |||    Japan  Airlines  said  it  had  looked  at  both  aircraft  before  choosing  the  7E7,  also  known  as  the  Dreamliner.  ""We  chose  the  7E7  after  carefully  considering  both  it  and  Airbus'  aircraft,""  said  a  Japan  Airlines  spokesman.  ""The  7E7  fits  better  for  what  we  needed  and  it  could  be  delivered  when  we  hoped  to  get  it.""  Boeing  continues  to  enjoy  a  dominance  over  Airbus  in  Japan,  and  Japanese  companies  are  taking  key  roles  in  building  the  7E7.  The  first  7E7s  will  be  delivered  to  Japan  Airlines  in  April  2008.  Boeing  has  set  itself  a  target  of  getting  200  firm  commitments  for  the  7E7  by  the  end  of  this  year,  and  has  orders  for  56  so  far.  Airbus  hopes  to  have  50  orders  in  place  for  the  A350  by  mid-2005."

They  have  risen  to  the  head  of  the  UK's  art  rock  ranks  with  an  album  of  songs  that  are  catchy,  creative  and  original  enough  to  sound  fresh.  With  a  cool,  spiky,  fun  sound  previously  associated  with  bands  like  Talking  Heads,  they  hit  upon  a  style  that  had  been  out  of  fashion  for  a  while  and  so  was  ripe  for  another  airing.  Their  first  UK  single  hit  number  three  last  January,  followed  by  two  more  top  20  hits,  while  the  album  has  sold  more  than  600,000  copies  in  11  months  on  release.  In  September  it  was  named  album  of  the  year  winning  the  prestigious  Mercury  Music  Prize.  |||    On  the  festivals  circuit,  they  have  been  one  of  the  main  attractions  for  huge  crowds  at  Glastonbury,  T  in  the  Park  and  Reading/Leeds.  They  have  also  found  success  in  Japan,  Europe  and  the  US.  By  September  the  album  had  sold  500,000  in  the  States  and  total  sales  were  pushing  two  million  worldwide.  They  have  been  nominated  for  three  Grammy  awards  in  the  US  as  well  as  the  US  music  industry's  Shortlist  award,  but  lost  the  Shortlist  prize  to  US  band  TV  on  the  Radio.  Nevertheless  Franz  Ferdinand  were  the  only  UK  band  to  win  an  MTV  Video  Music  Award  this  year,  taking  the  breakthrough  video  crown  for  Take  Me  Out.  |||    The  four-piece  met  two  years  ago  when  drummer  Paul  Thomson  was  working  at  the  Glasgow  art  school  where  bassist  Bob  Hardy  was  studying.  Singer  Alex  Kapranos  was  studying  English  at  university  but  had  friends  at  art  school,  and  the  line-up  was  completed  when  guitarist  Nick  McCarthy  moved  from  Munich,  Germany,  to  the  city.  At  the  turn  of  the  year,  Kapranos  told  BBC  News  Online  the  band  were  fed  up  with  serious  bands  in  ""that  post-rock  thing  that  seemed  to  be  doing  its  damndest  to  avoid  any  bloody  tune"".  |||    ""We  want  people  to  go  away  from  the  gigs  humming  the  tunes  that  we  were  singing.  But  at  the  same  time  bringing  an  edge  to  it.""  Franz  Ferdinand  had  a  question  they  asked  themselves  every  time  they  wrote  a  song,  Kapranos  said.  ""Where's  the  fun  in  that?""  they  pondered  at  every  stage,  making  enjoyment  the  top  priority  and  ensuring  they  did  not  disappear  up  their  own  muso  posteriors.  The  band  started  out  with  a  DIY  ethic  that  saw  them  take  over  a  disused  art-deco  warehouse  in  Glasgow  and  rename  it  The  Chateau.  The  venue  soon  became  legendary  -  so  well-known  that  the  police  spent  a  month  trying  to  find  it,  eventually  raiding  it  and  arresting  Kapranos.  But  the  charges  of  running  an  illegal  bar  and  contravening  health  and  safety,  fire  hazard  and  noise  abatement  laws  were  dropped.  |||    The  band  took  over  an  abandoned  Victorian  courtroom  and  jail  instead,  and  named  that  The  Chateau.  The  buzz  about  the  band  soon  spread  around  the  music  industry  and  40  record  labels  turned  up  to  one  gig  in  Glasgow  -  which  the  band  thought  was  ""totally  ridiculous"".

2	"Malik  rejects  all-black  MP  lists  |||    A  call  for  ethnic  minority  shortlists  to  boost  the  number  of  black  and  Asian  MPs  has  been  rejected  by  one  of  Labour's  most  senior  Asians.  |||    Shahid  Malik,  who  is  on  Labour's  ruling  NEC,  accepted  people's  frustration  but  said  there  should  be  targets  not  lists  to  boost  representation  of  minorities.  Just  13  of  Britain's  659  MPs  are  from  ethnic  minority  groups,  he  added.  Commission  for  racial  equality  chief  Trevor  Phillips  argued  on  Sunday  the  time  had  come  for  such  shortlists.  That  came  after  it  emerged  that  one  of  Britain's  most  ethnically  diverse  constituency,  West  Ham,  was  to  get  a  women-only  shortlist  for  the  next  election  following  an  NEC  ruling.  |||    Mr  Phillips  said  changes  to  the  race  relations  legislation  might  allow  political  parties  to  reserve  seats  for  under-represented  groups.  For  example  in  West  Ham,  this  might  allow  only  women  and  minorities  to  seek  to  be  candidates.  ""If  we  get  to  the  other  side  of  the  general  election  and  find  that  minorities  are  not  represented,  we  have  to  say  that  after  20  or  30  years  of  talking  about  this,  we  cannot  go  on  the  same  way,""  he  said.  He  added:  ""It  would  be  terribly  disappointing  if  in  the  least  white  constituency  [West  Ham]  in  the  whole  of  Europe  we  didn't  have  a  minority  candidate.""  Appearing  on  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme,  Mr  Malik,  who  is  himself  running  for  the  seat  of  Dewsbury,  acknowledged  that  so  far  women-only  shortlists  had  failed  to  deliver  a  boost  in  the  number  of  ethnic  minority  candidates.  |||    But  he  argued:  ""I  do  think  that  there  currently  things  that  parties  can  do  and  which  they  aren't  doing...  for  example  setting  targets  to  ensure  that  existing  democratic  structures  are  more  reflective.""  Labour  MP  Diane  Abbot,  who  backs  Mr  Phillips'  proposal  of  shortlists,  said  she  had  been  elected  along  with  three  other  ethnic  minority  MPs  -  Keith  Vaz,  Paul  Boateng  and  Bernie  Grant  -  in  1987  but  it  took  another  10  years  before  another  black  woman  was  able  to  win  a  seat.  That  was  a  rate  of  progress  Ms  Abbott  described  as  ""painful"".  ""I  am  a  little  older  than  Shahid  and  served  on  the  National  Executive  Committee  in  the  1990s  -  I  was  the  first  black  person  on  the  NEC  ...  crossing  our  fingers  and  hoping  we  are  going  to  get  more  black  and  Asian  MP  hasn't  worked,""  she  said.  ""The  shortlist  strategy  works  for  women  and  I  believe  that  it  can  be  made  to  work  for  black  and  Asian  people.""  On  Tuesday  Labour  chairman  Ian  McCartney  said  his  party  was  ""ambitious""  to  improve  black  and  Asian  representation.  ""We  haven't  ruled  out  all-black  shortlists  and  welcome  a  debate  in  the  party  about  this,""  he  said." 

2	"Anti-terror  plan  faces  first  test  |||    Plans  to  allow  Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  to  place  terror  suspects  under  house  arrest  without  trial  are  set  for  their  first  real  test  in  Parliament.  |||    Tories,  Lib  Dems  and  some  Labour  MPs  are  poised  to  vote  against  the  plans.  Mr  Clarke  says  the  powers  are  needed  to  counter  terror  threats.  Opponents  say  only  judges,  not  politicians,  should  be  able  to  order  detention  of  UK  citizens.  The  government  is  expected  to  win  Wednesday's  vote  in  the  Commons,  but  faces  a  battle  in  the  House  of  Lords.  |||    The  Prevention  of  Terrorism  Bill  was  published  on  Tuesday.  It  proposes  ""control  orders"",  which  would  mean  house  arrest  in  the  most  serious  cases,  and  curfews,  electronic  tagging  and  limits  on  telephone  and  internet  access  for  other  suspects.  |||    The  two  opposition  parties  are  particularly  worried  that  the  control  orders  would  initially  be  imposed  on  the  say-so  of  the  home  secretary,  rather  than  a  judge.  Tory  shadow  home  secretary  David  Davis  warned  of  the  potential  for  miscarriages  of  justice,  like  the  Guildford  Four  -  for  which  Tony  Blair  recently  apologised  -  as  a  result  of  the  pressure  on  politicians  to  lock  up  terror  suspects.  ""Those  pressures  would  be  much  more  for  a  politician  than  they  would  on  a  judge  and  that's  why  we  have  serious  concerns  abut  that  approach,""  he  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme.  |||    Mr  Clarke  says  he  does  not  intend  to  use  the  house  arrest  powers  now  -  even  for  the  11  current  terror  detainees.  He  also  said  that  any  decision  he  made  would  be  reviewed  by  a  judge  within  seven  days.  The  foreign  terror  suspects  currently  detained  are  mostly  held  at  London's  Belmarsh  prison.  They  are  held  under  laws  which  the  Law  Lords  have  ruled  break  human  rights  rules  -  and  which  are  due  to  expire  on  14  March.  |||    The  new  powers,  designed  to  replace  the  existing  laws  and  meet  the  Law  Lords'  concerns,  would  apply  to  British  as  well  as  foreign  terror  suspects.  Critics  say  that  giving  politicians  the  power  to  deprive  UK  citizens  of  their  freedom  is  the  biggest  attack  on  civil  liberties  for  300  years.  Opposition  MPs  are  also  angry  they  will  have  only  two  days  -  Wednesday  and  next  Monday  -  to  debate  the  new  plans  before  they  pass  to  the  House  of  Lords.  But  the  government  says  the  existing  powers  run  out  soon  so  must  be  replaced  urgently.  |||    In  a  rare  move,  the  Tories  and  Lib  Dems  have  jointly  tabled  a  motion  opposing  the  new  bill,  saying  the  house  arrest  plans  are  ""excessive"".  It  argues  decisions  should  be  taken  on  a  higher  standard  of  proof  and  the  plan  ""wrongly  infringes  the  right  to  liberty""  by  failing  to  bring  terrorists  to  trial  where  there  is  evidence.  Mr  Davis  told  Today:  ""It  gives  a  minister,  for  the  first  time  in  modern  history,  the  right  to  detain  without  trial,  without  showing  the  evidence  and  indeed,  in  some  respects,  almost  the  allegation  against  the  individual  concerned.""  |||    He  questioned  why  there  was  ""such  a  rush""  to  introduce  the  legislation  when  Mr  Clarke  had  indicated  he  was  not  planning  to  use  the  house  arrest  powers  straight  away.  Liberal  Democrat  home  affairs  spokesman  Mark  Oaten  said:  ""We  believe  it  should  be  the  judge  that  takes  decisions,  not  politicians.""  Mr  Clarke  said  the  security  services  and  police  backed  his  measures  and  it  would  be  ""rash  and  negligent""  to  ignore  their  advice.  Nobody  should  doubt  that  terrorists  at  home  and  abroad  wanted  to  attack  the  UK  and  its  interests,  he  argued."

In  2005  it  ""will  rise  toward  13,000"",  predicted  Morgan  Stanley  equity  strategist  Naoki  Kamiyama.  The  optimism  in  the  financial  markets  contrast  sharply  with  pessimism  in  the  Japanese  business  community.  Earlier  this  month,  the  quarterly  Tankan  survey  of  Japanese  manufacturers  found  that  business  confidence  had  weakened  for  the  first  time  since  March  2003.  |||    Slower  economic  growth,  rising  oil  prices,  a  stronger  yen  and  weaker  exports  were  blamed  for  the  fall  in  confidence.  Despite  this,  traders  expect  strength  in  the  global  economy  to  benefit  Japan,  which  has  been  close  to  sliding  into  recession  in  recent  months.  Structural  reform  within  Japan  and  an  anticipated  end  to  the  banking  sector's  bad  debt  problems  should  also  help,  they  say." 

2	"Hatfield  executives  go  on  trial  |||    Engineering  firm  Balfour  Beatty  and  five  railway  managers  are  to  go  on  trial  for  manslaughter  over  the  Hatfield  rail  crash  in  2000.  |||    Four  people  died  when  a  section  of  rail  broke  and  a  high  speed  train  derailed.  Balfour  Beatty's  railway  maintenance  arm  was  in  charge  of  the  upkeep  of  the  line  at  Hatfield,  Hertfordshire.  Balfour  Beatty  managers  Anthony  Walker  and  Nicholas  Jeffries,  and  Railtrack  managers  Alistair  Cook,  Sean  Fugill  and  Keith  Lea  all  face  individual  charges.  All  five  men,  along  with  four  others,  are  also  accused  of  breaches  of  health  and  safety  laws.  Balfour  Beatty  Rail  Maintenance  faces  a  corporate  manslaughter  charge.  It  is  expected  the  trial  could  last  as  long  as  a  year.  The  accident,  on  17  October  2000,  happened  when  the  London  to  Leeds  express  came  off  the  tracks  at  115  mph,  when  it  was  derailed  by  a  cracked  section  of  rail.  The  accident  on  the  East  Coast  Main  Line  sparked  major  disruption.  The  overall  responsibility  for  the  line  was  Railtrack's  -  the  company  that  has  now  become  Network  Rail.  Those  who  died  in  the  accident  were  Steve  Arthur,  46,  from  Pease  Pottage,  West  Sussex;  Peter  Monkhouse,  50,  of  Headingley,  Leeds;  Leslie  Gray,  43,  of  Tuxford,  Nottingham;  and  Robert  James  Alcorn,  37,  of  Auckland,  New  Zealand."

The  final  of  the  first  series  will  take  place  on  11  December.  Last  Saturday's  show  was  beaten  in  the  ratings  by  the  BBC's  Strictly  Come  Dancing.  ""Working  on  the  X  Factor  has  been  a  blast...  I  predict  series  two  will  be  even  better,""  said  Cowell.  ""I  think  the  production  team  have  done  an  amazing  job,""  he  added.  |||    The  Pop  Idol-style  show  votes  off  a  group  or  contestant  every  week  -  the  two  that  receive  the  lowest  public  vote  have  to  perform  a  second  time  before  the  judges  make  a  final  decision.  Rowetta  Satchell,  Steve  Brookstein,  Tabby  Callaghan  and  group  G4  are  the  remaining  finalists.  ITV's  controller  of  entertainment,  Claudia  Rosencrantz,  said  she  had  no  hesitation  in  recommissioning  the  show.  ""There's  much  more  to  come  this  series  as  we  build  towards  the  final  next  month  and  it's  great  to  have  secured  this  terrific  format  for  our  viewers  for  another  series,""  she  said." 

2	"Blunkett  sorry  over  murder  plan  |||    David  Blunkett  has  apologised  to  MPs  after  the  Home  Office  announced  ""prematurely""  via  press  release  a  review  of  murder  laws.  |||    The  home  secretary  confirmed  the  review  was  to  get  under  way  in  the  wake  of  a  Law  Commission  report  which  branded  the  current  murder  law  as  ""a  mess"".  He  said  the  review  would  look  at  partial  defences  to  murder,  including  provocation  and  at  mandatory  sentences.  The  Home  Office  has  already  said  the  review  will  begin  next  year.  |||    On  Wednesday,  a  Home  Office  spokeswoman  said  the  terms  of  reference  for  the  review  had  not  been  established  but  it  was  likely  to  include  only  England  and  Wales.  News  of  the  review  was  released  because  it  was  thought  Mr  Blunkett  would  make  the  official  announcement  in  a  Commons  debate  on  Wednesday.  But  the  announcement  never  came,  with  the  home  secretary  saying  the  debate  had  never  reached  that  stage.  Amid  opposition  anger,  Mr  Blunkett  had  to  answer  an  emergency  question  in  Parliament  on  Thursday.  He  said  he  had  taken  steps  to  ensure  the  incident  was  not  repeated.  Shadow  home  secretary  David  Davis  welcomed  his  ""gracious  apology""  and  the  review  itself.  But  he  argued  the  minister  should  have  volunteered  a  formal  statement  instead  of  having  to  be  ""dragged""  to  face  MPs.  |||    In  its  report,  the  Law  Commission  said  it  had  found  wide  support  among  criminal  justice  professionals  for  an  end  to  the  mandatory  life  sentence  for  murder.  The  panel  suggested  different  kinds  of  murders  could  be  ""graded""  to  recognise  the  seriousness  of  the  offence.  |||    But  the  Home  Office  said  mandatory  life  sentences  would  not  be  abolished  and  argued  courts  already  had  flexibility.  The  commission,  an  independent  body  including  two  judges,  a  senior  barrister  and  sentencing  experts,  had  been  asked  to  consider  reforms  to  the  defence  of  provocation  in  murder  cases.  But  it  said  its  proposals  were  unlikely  to  work  without  a  far  wider  review  of  the  law.  Results  of  a  consultation  exercise  showed  64  respondents  out  of  146  -  among  them  21  judges  -  believed  a  mandatory  life  sentence  for  every  murder  was  ""indefensible  and  should  cease"".  |||    A  key  question  was  whether  one  category  should  continue  to  cover  all  types  of  murder  from  mercy  killings  to  serial  or  contract  killings.  The  commission  found  support  for  the  idea  of  grading  murders  so  that  the  sentence  reflected  the  seriousness  of  the  offence.  But  speaking  after  the  report  was  published,  Home  Office  minister  Baroness  Scotland  said:  ""Murder  is  the  most  serious  of  crimes  and  we  have  no  intention  of  abolishing  the  mandatory  life  sentence.  ""Where  an  offender  is  convicted  of  murder,  the  court  must  pass  a  life  sentence.""  The  commission  also  recommended  tightening  the  law  so  that  the  provocation  defence  cannot  be  used  in  cases  where  someone  has  killed  for  revenge,  such  as  a  jealous  husband  who  murders  an  unfaithful  wife." 

3	"Rush  future  at  Chester  uncertain  |||    Ian  Rush's  future  as  Chester  manager  is  uncertain  after  he  and  assistant  Mark  Aizlewood  refused  a  severance  package.  |||    Chester  have  won  only  two  of  their  last  10  League  games  but  Chairman  Steve  Vaughan  claims  he  cannot  afford  to  sack  the  43-year-old  Liverpool  legend.  Vaughan  said:  ""I  offered  a  financial  settlement  so  they  could  resign  with  dignity  but  an  obvious  action  is  to  dismiss  them.  ""I  haven't  because  of  the  finances,  so  technically  they're  still  employees.""  Vaughan  claimed  that  Aizlewood  had  ""verbally  agreed""  to  the  offer.  But  the  Chester  chairman  added:  ""After  they  discussed  the  offer  with  their  solicitor,  who  also  acts  as  their  agent,  they  decided  to  withdraw  the  verbal  agreement,  which  was  disappointing.""  Rush  was  appointed  at  the  end  of  August  following  the  departure  of  former  Liverpool  team-mate  Mark  Wright,  who  guided  Chester  to  the  Conference  title  last  season.  Chester  were  bottom  of  League  Two  when  Rush  took  over  but  the  former  Liverpool  striker  enjoyed  an  impressive  start  to  managerial  life,  taking  the  club  into  the  third  round  of  the  FA  cup  and  winning  the  manager-of-the-month  award  for  October.  Chester's  downturn  in  form  culminated  in  a  5-0  defeat  at  Shrewsbury  that  leaves  them  hovering  just  above  the  League  Two  relegation  zone." 

2	"Brown's  poll  campaign  move  denied  |||    The  government  has  denied  reports  that  Gordon  Brown  is  preparing  to  oust  Alan  Milburn  as  Labour's  election  supremo.  |||    Work  and  pensions  minister  Alan  Johnson  said  it  was  wrong  to  suggest  the  chancellor  would  usurp  Mr  Milburn,  adding  they  would  ""work  as  a  team"".  A  report  in  the  Sunday  Business  claimed  Mr  Brown  has  been  asked  to  take  charge  of  media  strategy,  while  Mr  Milburn  would  move  to  a  behind-the-scenes  role.  Labour  has  always  maintained  Mr  Brown  would  have  a  central  campaign  role.  |||    But  many  Labour  backbenchers  are  said  to  be  dissatisfied  with  the  way  election  campaigning  has  gone  and  have  said  they  wanted  to  see  the  chancellor  take  a  bigger  role.  Some  commentators  say  the  Tories  have  grasped  the  initiative,  putting  Labour  on  the  back  foot,  having  to  respond  to  Conservative  policy  announcements.  These  claims  follow  various  opinion  polls  which  suggest  the  Tories  have  been  gaining  on  Labour.  Party  strategists  are  believed  to  want  to  bring  Mr  Brown  to  centre-stage  having  seen  support  rise,  in  private  polling,  after  his  Budget  last  week.  But  another  report  in  the  Sunday  Telegraph  claims  Mr  Milburn  is  unwilling  to  allow  any  new  role  for  the  chancellor  to  come  at  his  expense.  Mr  Johnson  told  BBC  News:  ""Gordon  Brown  will  play  a  central  role  in  any  election  campaign.  ""They  were  wrong  when  they  said  Milburn  was  ousting  Brown  and  they're  wrong  now  if  they  are  saying  Brown  is  ousting  Milburn.  We  work  as  a  team.""  Mr  Milburn  has  repeatedly  said  the  chancellor  was  key  to  the  campaign  and  dismissed  claims  of  a  rift.  Neither  Downing  Street  nor  the  Labour  Party  would  comment  directly  on  the  reports." 

1	"Brando  'rejected  Godfather  role'  |||    Late  film  star  Marlon  Brando  is  said  to  have  repeatedly  turned  down  his  Oscar-winning  role  in  The  Godfather.  |||    The  actor's  friend  Budd  Schulberg  told  Vanity  Fair  magazine  that  Brando's  assistant  suggested  he  read  the  novel.  The  actor  repeatedly  refused,  throwing  the  book  at  her  and  saying:  ""For  the  last  time,  I  won't  glorify  the  mafia"".  But  Brando,  who  died  last  July  at  the  age  of  80,  eventually  took  the  role  of  Don  Corleone,  winning  him  an  Oscar  in  1973  which  he  notoriously  refused.  The  actor  sent  a  young  woman  dressed  in  Native  American  costume  to  refuse  the  award  on  his  behalf  and  to  draw  attention  to  the  plight  of  Native  Americans.  |||    Schulberg  told  the  magazine  that  Brando's  assistant  realised  the  film  star  had  warmed  to  the  idea  of  The  Godfather  role  when  he  sported  a  drawn-on  pencil  moustache  and  asked:  ""How  do  I  look?""  His  assistant,  Alice  Marchak,  said  that  he  looked  like  George  Raft,  an  actor  famed  for  playing  gangsters  on  the  silver  screen.  Every  time  she  went  to  see  Brando  from  then  on,  she  added,  he  was  wearing  a  different  gangster-style  moustache.  Brando  was  asked  to  screen  test  for  the  role  in  The  Godfather,  as  studio  executives  were  said  to  be  reluctant  for  the  actor  to  play  the  part  following  problems  on  the  set  of  Brando's  previous  film  Mutiny  on  the  Bounty  .  In  fact  Brando's  Academy  Award  triumph  revived  his  career.  The  actor  was  nominated  for  an  Oscar  the  following  year  for  his  role  in  Bernardo  Bertolucci's  Last  Tango  in  Paris.  Before  his  death,  Brando  granted  gaming  company  Electronic  Arts  the  rights  to  use  his  voice  and  image  in  a  video  game  based  on  the  Godfather  film  and  book  and  recorded  voice-overs  which  closely  resembled  his  role  as  Don  Corleone.  Brando's  co-stars  from  The  Godfather,  James  Caan  and  Robert  Duvall,  will  also  reprise  their  roles  for  the  video  game,  it  was  confirmed  on  Wednesday." 

0	"US  trade  deficit  widens  sharply  |||    The  gap  between  US  exports  and  imports  has  widened  to  more  than  $60bn  (£31.7bn),  an  all-time  record.  |||    Figures  from  the  Commerce  Department  for  November  showed  exports  down  2.3%  to  $95.6bn,  while  imports  grew  1.3%  to  $155.8bn  on  rising  consumer  demand.  Part  of  the  expanding  deficit  came  from  high  prices  for  oil  imports.  But  the  numbers  suggested  the  sliding  dollar  -  which  makes  exports  less  expensive  -  has  had  little  impact,  and  could  indicate  slowing  economic  growth.  |||    The  trade  deficit  -  far  bigger  than  the  $54bn  widely  expected  on  Wall  Street  -  prompted  a  rapid  response  from  the  currency  markets.  |||    By  1650  GMT,  the  dollar  was  trading  against  the  euro  at  $1.3280,  almost  a  cent  and  a  half  weaker  than  before  the  announcement.  Against  the  pound,  the  dollar  was  down  about  0.7%  at  $1,8923.  ""The  dollar's  fall  has  been  sudden,  violent  and  appropriate  given  this  number,""  said  Brian  Taylor  of  Wells  Fargo  in  Minneapolis.  ""Recent  exchange  rate  movements  certainly  haven't  had  any  impact  yet.""  Treasury  Secretary  John  Snow  put  a  brave  face  on  the  news,  saying  it  was  a  sign  of  strong  economic  expansion.  ""The  economy  is  growing  at  such  a  fast  rate  that  it  is  generating  lots  of  disposable  income...  some  of  which  is  used  to  buy  goods  from  our  trading  partners.""  |||    Although  the  White  House  officially  still  backs  the  US's  traditional  ""strong  dollar""  policy,  it  has  tacitly  indicated  that  it  would  be  happy  if  the  slide  continued.  The  dollar  has  fallen  by  50%  against  the  euro  -  as  well  as  by  30%  against  the  yen  -  in  the  past  three  years.  The  main  catalyst,  most  economists  accept,  is  the  large  budget  deficit  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  current  account  deficit  -  the  difference  between  the  flow  of  money  in  and  out  of  the  US  -  on  the  other.  The  trade  deficit  is  a  large  part  of  the  latter.  In  November,  the  fall  in  exports  was  largely  due  to  a  decline  in  sales  of  industrial  supplies  and  materials  such  as  chemicals,  as  well  as  of  cars,  consumer  goods  and  food.  One  small  bright  spot  for  US  policy-makers  was  a  slight  decline  in  the  deficit  with  China,  often  blamed  for  job  losses  and  other  economic  woes.  Although  China's  overall  trade  surplus  is  expanding,  according  to  Chinese  government  figures,  the  Commerce  Department  revealed  the  US's  deficit  with  China  was  $19.6bn  in  November,  down  from  $19.7bn  the  month  before.  But  the  deficit  with  Japan  was  at  its  worst  in  more  than  four  years."

2	"Campaign  'cold  calls'  questioned  |||    Labour  and  the  Conservatives  are  still  telephoning  the  millions  of  people  who  have  signed  up  to  make  sure  they  do  not  get  marketing  ""cold  calls"".  |||    The  parties  say  they  can  stick  to  the  rules  by  ensuring  that  their  calls  are  not  marketing  -  for  instance  by  asking  about  people's  voting  intentions.  The  Lib  Dems  are  asking  the  watchdog  overseeing  the  rules  to  stop  the  calls.  The  information  commissioner's  office  says  surveys  are  allowed  but  people  had  to  be  told  if  personal  data  was  kept.  Telephone  call  centres  are  expected  to  be  used  as  never  before  by  all  the  three  major  parties  in  the  run-up  to  the  general  election.  |||    But  seven  million  telephone  numbers  are  on  the  Telephone  Preference  Service  (TPS)  lists,  which  ban  unsolicited  sales  and  marketing  calls.  Both  schemes  are  run  by  the  Direct  Marketing  Association  and  backed  by  EU  directives  on  privacy  and  electronic  communications.  |||    The  rules  on  marketing  calls  apply  as  much  to  politicians  as  to  private  sector  companies.  But  that  does  not  mean  Labour  and  the  Tories  are  not  calling  people  signed  up  to  the  TPS.  A  Labour  Party  spokesman  told  the  BBC  News  website  the  party  avoided  those  on  TPS  lists  when  telephoning  people  about  membership  or  fundraising.  But  that  did  not  happen  for  ""voter  identification""  calls.  ""When  we  ask  which  party  they  will  vote  for,  that  is  not  marketing  and  we  have  very  clear  legal  advice  that  it  is  not,""  he  said.  ""So  it  is  not  covered  by  the  Telephone  Preference  Service.""  |||    He  said  the  party  always  asked  people  if  they  would  be  happy  to  be  contacted  again  and  if  they  said  no,  they  were  not  rung  again.  A  Conservative  spokeswoman  said  the  party  stuck  to  the  rules  when  it  rang  TPS  subscribers.  She  said:  ""We  do  apply  TPS  but  in  line  with  the  law.  We  would  not  do  things  that  are  not  allowed  in  the  law.""  Assistant  information  commissioner  Phil  Jones  said  it  was  classed  as  marketing  if  political  parties  telephoned  people  to  encourage  them  to  vote  for  them.  But  ""classic  market  research"",  such  as  a  poll  of  voter  intentions,  did  not  constitute  direct  marketing,  he  said.  ""If  a  party  is  calling  someone  who  is  registered  on  TPS  and  records  their  voting  intention  with  a  view  to  using  this  information  in  the  future,  this  should  be  clear  to  the  voter  concerned,""  said  Mr  Jones.  ""If  a  party  rings  a  person  who  is  registered  on  TPS  to  ask  about  their  voting  intention  and  goes  on  to  encourage  that  voter  to  support  them,  the  party  may  well  be  in  breach  of  the  regulations.  ""In  summary,  whether  a  party  calling  TPS  registered  voters  to  check  their  voting  intentions  will  breach  regulations  will  depend  on  the  script  used  and  whether  the  script  is  followed.""  Mr  Jones  said  the  watchdog  received  ""very  few  complaints""  on  the  issue.  |||    Earlier,  Lib  Dem  chairman  Matthew  Taylor  wrote  to  the  watchdog  saying:  ""The  advice  we  have  received  on  several  previous  occasions  is  that  such  phone  calls  are  illegal.""  He  says  evidence  from  local  Lib  Dem  parties  around  the  country  suggests  there  are  ""significant""  numbers  of  such  calls.  ""I  hope  you  can  therefore  take  swift  and  efficient  action  to  ensure  that  this  ceases,""  he  tells  the  commissioner.  Mr  Taylor  argues  there  should  be  new  guidelines  so  all  parties  can  act  in  the  same  way  if  the  watchdog  believes  the  rules  allow  parties  to  ring  TPS  numbers  about  voting  intentions  and  later  urge  those  people  to  vote  for  them." 

0	"BMW  cash  to  fuel  Mini  production  |||    Less  than  four  years  after  the  new  Mini  was  launched,  German  car  maker  BMW  has  announced  £100m  of  new  investment.  |||    Some  200  new  jobs  are  to  be  created  at  the  Oxford  factory,  including  modernised  machinery  and  a  new  body  shell  production  building.  The  result  of  the  investment  could  be  to  raise  output  to  more  than  200,000  cars  from  2007.  The  rise,  from  189,000  last  year,  is  a  response  to  rapidly-rising  demand  and  could  help  wipe  out  waiting  lists.  Before  Wednesday's  announcement,  BMW  had  invested  some  £280m  in  Mini  production.  |||    Since  its  launch  during  summer  2001,  the  new  Mini  has  gone  from  strength  to  strength.  |||    Last  year,  almost  one  in  six  cars  sold  by  the  BMW  group  was  a  Mini.  The  company  admits  that  the  success  of  the  brand  came  despite  scepticism  from  many  in  the  industry.  ""Our  decision  to  produce  a  new  Mini  was  not  received  well  right  away,""  said  Norbert  Reithofer,  a  member  of  the  BMW  management  board.  Initially,  BMW  said  it  would  produce  100,000  Mini  models  a  year  at  its  vast  Cowley  factory  on  the  outskirts  of  Oxford,  but  the  target  was  quickly  reached,  then  raised,  time  and  time  again.  Not  everyone  is  convinced  that  the  boom  can  continue.  ""The  risk  is  that  after  they've  invested  massively  in  the  brand,  demand  tapers  off  like  it  did  with  the  new  VW  Beetle,""  said  Brad  Wernle,  from  Automotive  News  Europe.  |||    The  price  of  the  car  has  also  gone  up.  When  it  was  launched,  the  cheapest  Mini  cost  just  more  than  £10,000.  These  days,  buyers  will  have  to  fork  out  almost  £11,500  to  own  a  new  Mini  One,  or  even  more  for  the  Cooper  S  which  costs  up  to  £17,730.  The  Mini  Convertible,  which  was  launched  last  spring,  costs  up  to  £15,690  for  the  top  model,  and  there  is  even  a  waiting  list.  Second-hand  Minis  are  not  cheap  either.  A  Mini  One  bought  when  the  model  was  launched  should  still  fetch  at  least  £8,000  for  the  cheapest  model,  while  a  used  Cooper  S  is  likely  to  be  priced  from  £12,556,  according  to  the-car  buying  website  Parker's.  The  consumers'  association  Which  operates  with  slightly  different  numbers,  yet  it  confirms  that  the  Mini  Cooper  1.6  depreciates  slower  than  any  other  car,  other  than  the  Mercedes  Benz  C180  SE  and  the  BMW  1  Series  116i  SE.  |||    The  Cowley  factory,  which  initially  seemed  far  too  large  a  production  plant  for  just  100,000  Minis,  is  increasingly  being  put  to  good  use.  |||    There  are  plans  to  tear  down  old  buildings  and  build  new  ones  and  there  are  rumours  that  a  new  paint  shop  could  be  included  in  the  plans.  BMW's  Mini  adventure  has  made  good  much  of  what  went  wrong  during  its  stewardship  of  the  UK  car  maker  Rover  which  it  sold  for  £10  five  years  ago  to  the  Phoenix  consortium.  In  1999,  when  BMW  still  owned  Rover,  the  Oxford  factory  was  producing  the  award-winning  Rover  75.  During  that  year,  3,500  people  produced  56,000  cars.  Last  year,  in  the  same  factory,  almost  four  times  as  many  vehicles  were  produced  by  just  4,500  Mini-workers.  The  Mini  factory's  current  output  is  equally  impressive  when  compared  with  the  main  Rover  factory  in  Longbridge,  which  in  1999  produced  180,000  Rover  cars.  Last  year,  MG  Rover,  which  employs  more  than  6,000  people,  produced  just  110,000  cars,  though  it  hopes  to  land  a  deal  with  Shanghai  Automotive  Industry  Corporation  (SAIC)  that  could  help  double  the  number  of  cars  produced  at  Longbridge.  Indeed,  Mini  is  not  only  producing  more  cars  than  MG  Rover  does;  it  remains  ahead  even  when  the  current  sales  of  Land  Rovers  and  Range  Rovers  (which  are  made  by  the  former  Rover  unit  that  BMW  sold  to  Ford)  are  taken  into  account." 

1	"Da  Vinci  Code  is  'lousy  history'  |||    The  plot  of  an  international  bestseller  that  thousands  of  readers  are  likely  to  receive  as  a  Christmas  present  is  'laughable',  a  clergyman  has  said.  |||    The  Da  Vinci  Code  claims  Jesus  was  not  crucified,  but  married  Mary  Magdalene  and  died  a  normal  death.  It  claims  this  was  later  covered  up  by  the  Church.  The  Bishop  of  Durham,  the  Rt  Rev  Dr  Tom  Wright,  described  the  novel  as  a  ""great  thriller""  but  ""lousy  history"".  The  book  has  sold  more  than  seven  million  copies  worldwide.  Despite  enjoying  Dan  Brown's  conspiracy  theory,  the  Bishop  said  there  was  a  lack  of  evidence  to  back  up  its  claims.  |||    Writing  his  Christmas  message  in  the  Northern  Echo,  the  Bishop  said:  ""Conspiracy  theories  are  always  fun  -  fun  to  invent,  fun  to  read,  fun  to  fantasise  about.  ""Dan  Brown  is  the  best  writer  I've  come  across  in  the  genre,  but  anyone  who  knows  anything  about  1st  century  history  will  see  that  this  underlying  material  is  laughable.""  A  great  deal  of  credible  evidence  proves  the  Biblical  version  of  Jesus'  life  was  true,  according  to  the  Bishop.  ""The  evidence  for  Jesus  and  the  origins  of  Christianity  is  astonishingly  good,""  he  said.  ""We  have  literally  a  hundred  times  more  early  manuscripts  for  the  gospels  and  letters  in  the  New  Testament  than  we  have  for  the  main  classical  authors  like  Cicero,  Virgil  and  Tacitus.  |||    ""Historical  research  shows  that  they  present  a  coherent  and  thoroughly  credible  picture  of  Jesus,  with  all  sorts  of  incidental  details  that  fit  the  time  when  he  lived,  and  don't  fit  the  world  of  later  legend.""  Brown's  book  has  become  a  publishing  phenomenon,  consistently  topping  book  charts  in  the  UK  and  US.  The  Da  Vinci  Code  has  been  translated  into  42  languages  and  has  spawned  its  own  cottage  industry  of  publications,  including  guides  on  to  how  to  read  the  book,  rebuttals  and  counter  claims.  The  book,  which  has  become  an  international  best-seller  in  little  over  two  years,  is  set  to  be  made  into  a  film  starring  Tom  Hanks." 

1	"Label  withdraws  McFadden's  video  |||    The  new  video  of  former  Westlife  singer  Brian  McFadden  has  been  pulled  after  a  Dublin  school  complained  about  being  associated  with  his  song  Irish  Son.  |||    St  Fintian's  High  School  says  it  is  clearly  identified  in  the  video,  while  McFadden  never  went  there.  McFadden  makes  claims  that  he  was  beaten  at  his  own  school  in  the  song's  lyrics,  saying  it  had  ""cell  blocks"".  The  performer's  record  label  Sony  BMG  has  withdrawn  the  video  and  issued  replacements  to  television  stations.  The  label  believed  the  school  name  was  fictitious  until  they  received  the  complaint.  They  have  said  the  reference  to  the  school  was  unintentional  and  coincidental.  |||    The  head  of  Christian  Brothers'  school  St  Fintian's,  Richard  Fogarty,  said  the  video  implied  that  the  24-year-old  pop  star  had  attended  his  school  and  was  abused  there.  ""The  school  has  always  treated  its  pupils  with  respect,""  Mr  Fogarty  said  in  a  statement.  McFadden  makes  specific  references  to  the  Christian  Brothers  in  his  song,  but  did  not  attend  St  Fintian's.  Corporal  punishment  was  outlawed  in  Irish  schools  in  1982  when  McFadden  was  two  years  old.  |||    McFadden,  whose  debut  solo  album  is  released  next  week,  has  said  that  every  song  is  autobiographical  and  ""a  true  story"".  Alcoholism  and  domestic  violence  are  among  the  other  topics  dealt  with  in  his  songs,  half  of  which  have  been  written  with  Robbie  Williams'  former  collaborator,  Guy  Chambers.  McFadden,  who  quit  chart-topping  group  Westlife  in  March,  went  to  number  one  in  September  with  his  first  solo  single  Real  To  Me.  He  enjoyed  12  chart-toppers  with  the  boy  band  before  parting  company  with  them." 

2	"Galloway  plea  for  hostage  release  |||    Ex-Labour  MP  George  Galloway  has  appealed  for  the  release  of  aid  worker  Margaret  Hassan,  kidnapped  in  Iraq.  |||    Mrs  Hassan,  59,  who  led  Care  International  operations  in  Iraq,  was  abducted  in  Baghdad  on  19  October.  Mr  Galloway  was  expelled  from  the  Labour  party  because  of  his  staunch  opposition  to  the  war  on  Iraq.  He  denied  an  earlier  report  that  he  planned  to  make  a  direct  appeal  to  the  kidnappers  via  the  Al-Jazeera  Arabic  television  channel.  |||    Speaking  in  London  on  Saturday  at  the  first  annual  delegate  conference  of  his  newly-founded  party,  the  Respect  Coalition,  he  said:  ""I  have  deliberately  not  involved  myself  before  in  any  of  these  situations.  ""But  this  woman  has  been  a  prominent  opponent  of  both  the  war  and  the  preceding  years  of  sanctions.  ""I  am  prepared  to  do  anything  I  can  to  help  save  her  life.""  A  spokesman  later  said  Mr  Galloway  had  friends  in  common  with  Ms  Hassan,  who  he  described  as  a  prominent  anti-war  activist,  and  that  he  was  ""willing  to  do  anything  -  go  to  Iraq  or  be  an  intermediary  or  anything  that's  necessary"".  Since  her  abduction,  several  videos  of  Mrs  Hassan  have  been  broadcast  by  Al-Jazeera.  The  latest  footage  showed  Mrs  Hassan  asking  for  British  troops  to  be  pulled  out  of  Iraq.  She  also  urged  Care  International,  the  aid  agency  she  works  for,  to  close  its  office  in  Baghdad,  and  appealed  for  Iraqi  women  prisoners  to  be  freed.  Care  has  since  closed  down  all  its  operations  in  Iraq." 

2	"Blair  'said  he  would  stand  down'  |||    Tony  Blair  promised  Gordon  Brown  he  would  stand  down  before  the  next  election,  a  new  book  about  the  chancellor  claims.  |||    But  the  prime  minister  changed  his  mind  following  intervention  from  allies  in  the  Cabinet,  according  to  the  book.  The  book  by  Sunday  Telegraph  journalist  Robert  Peston  said  the  pair  had  ""mutual  animosity  and  contempt""  for  each  other.  The  book,  Brown's  Britain,  said  Tony  Blair  felt  by  November  2003  he  had  lost  voters'  trust.  |||    The  author's  sources,  all  unnamed  ""allies""  of  Mr  Blair  and  Mr  Brown,  said  the  prime  minister  felt  the  Iraq  war  had  undermined  him  and  that  he  was  no  longer  an  asset  to  the  Labour  Party.  |||    The  book,  serialised  in  the  Sunday  Telegraph,  alleges  that  Mr  Blair  told  the  chancellor  at  a  dinner  hosted  by  deputy  PM  John  Prescott  in  November  2003  of  his  intention  to  stand  down.  ""At  that  stage  he  saw  Gordon  Brown  and  said,  'look  you  are  the  next  most  influential  member  of  the  government,  I  need  your  help  to  get  through  the  next  year,""  Mr  Peston  said.  ""I  myself  recognise  that  I'm  going  to  have  to  stand  down  before  the  election  but  help  me  to  get  through  the  year  and  I  will  then  stand  down.'""  But  he  changed  his  mind  in  June  2004,  following  intervention  from  allies  in  the  Cabinet  and  the  suspicion  that  the  chancellor  was  deliberately  manoeuvring  against  him,  the  book  claims.  |||    Mr  Peston  told  BBC  News:  ""My  understanding  is  that  they  are  not  nearly  as  close  or  as  friendly  as  they  once  were.  ""What  the  book  says  is  there  now  a  pretty  profound  mutual  mistrust,  mutual  animosity.  ""I  think  in  public  you  see  this  double  act  pretending  everything  is  alright  but  in  private  I  don't  think  the  relationship  is  good  because  Brown,  understandably,  feels  deeply  betrayed  -  particularly  over  this  issue  of  the  leadership.""  There  has  been  fresh  speculation  of  a  rift  recently,  following  their  separate  responses  to  the  Asian  tsunami.  Rumours  of  a  rift  were  fuelled  by  the  sudden  decision  to  hold  Mr  Blair's  monthly  media  conference  at  the  same  time  as  a  long-planned  speech  by  Mr  Brown  on  UK  plans  to  tackle  global  poverty  with  a  new  ""Marshall  Plan""  for  Africa.  There  was  speculation  the  pair  were  trying  to  outdo  each  other's  response  to  the  disaster.  |||    Former  welfare  minister  Frank  Field  MP  criticised  the  reported  rivalry  between  the  pair  on  GMTV's  Sunday  Programme.  |||    ""What  sort  of  model  does  it  give  to  the  nation  when  the  two  most  important  political  leaders  do  nothing  but  fight  it  out  together  or  use  their  aides  to  fight  it  out?""  the  Labour  MP  for  Birkenhead  asked.  He  said  the  prime  minister  should  sack  Mr  Brown,  but  did  not  believe  Mr  Blair  was  strong  enough  to  do  so.  Conservative  policy  co-ordinator  David  Cameron,  MP  for  Witney,  added:  ""If  it  wasn't  so  serious  it  would  be  funny.  ""But  it  is  serious  -  you've  got  the  two  most  senior  people  in  the  government  not  concentrating  on  fighting  crime,  poverty  or  dirty  hospitals  -  they  are  fighting  each  other.""  Carol  Walker,  BBC  News  24  political  correspondent,  added:  ""There  is  a  real  concern  that  this  could  undermine  the  general  election  campaign.  ""And  clearly  it  is  very  bad  news  for  the  government  at  a  time  when  it  is  trying  to  explain  what  it  is  doing  to  respond  to  the  terrible  problems  thrown  up  by  the  tsunami  disaster.""" 

1	"Baghdad  Blogger  on  big  screen  |||    A  film  based  on  the  internet  musings  of  the  ""Baghdad  Blogger""  has  been  shown  at  the  Rotterdam  Film  Festival.  |||    The  film  has  been  directed  by  the  man  who  calls  himself  Salam  Pax,  the  author  of  the  weblog  about  Iraqi  life  during  and  after  the  war.  The  movie  version  comes  in  the  form  of  a  series  of  shorts  made  by  Pax  on  a  hand-held  camera.  Baghdad  Blogger  is  among  a  number  of  films  about  Iraq  showcased  at  the  Dutch  festival,  which  runs  until  Sunday.  Following  the  fascination  with  the  writing  of  Salam  Pax  -  not  his  real  name  -  he  began  a  regular  column  in  The  Guardian  newspaper  and  was  given  a  crash  course  in  documentary  film-making.  For  the  film  he  travelled  Iraq  to  document  the  changing  landscape  of  the  country  and  the  problems  it  has  faced  since  the  invasion,  speaking  to  ordinary  Iraqis  about  their  experiences.  The  festival  will  also  see  the  screening  of  Underexposure,  one  of  Iraq's  first  features  to  emerge  since  the  toppling  of  Saddam  Hussein.  |||    Director  Oday  Rasheed  made  the  film  on  discarded  1980s  Kodak  film  taken  from  the  remains  for  the  former  Ministry  of  Culture  building.  It  centres  on  the  lives  of  families  and  strangers  going  about  their  everyday  business  as  Baghdad  is  under  siege.  Rasheed  said  the  title  was  refers  to  the  isolation  felt  by  Iraqis  under  Saddam's  regime  and  the  difficult  time  the  country  is  now  experiencing.  ""Saddam's  regime  was  hell,  but  now  I  think  the  hell  has  doubled,""  Rasheed  said.  The  festival  was  also  due  to  screen  murdered  Dutch  film-maker  Theo  Van  Gogh's  film  about  the  treatment  of  woman  under  Islam,  but  it  was  withdrawn  due  to  safety  fears.  Van  Gogh  was  shot  and  stabbed  in  November  2004,  following  death  threats  he  received  about  his  film  Submission." 

2	"Abortion  not  a  poll  issue  -  Blair  |||    Tony  Blair  does  not  believe  abortion  should  be  an  election  issue,  arguing  it  is  a  matter  for  individual  conscience.  |||    The  prime  minister's  spokesman  set  out  Mr  Blair's  view  after  the  top  Catholic  in  England  and  Wales  backed  Michael  Howard's  stance  on  abortions.  The  Tory  leader  supports  a  reduction  in  the  legal  limit  from  24  weeks  to  20  and  has  said  current  rules  are  ""tantamount  to  abortion  on  demand"".  The  prime  minister  has  made  it  clear  he  has  no  plans  to  the  change  the  law.  |||    Mr  Blair's  spokesman  said:  ""The  Catholic  church  has  a  well-known  position  on  this  issue  and  it  was  one  of  many  issues  the  Cardinal  mentioned  and  therefore  it  should  be  seen  in  that  context.""  His  words  came  as  Cardinal  Cormac  Murphy  O'Connor,  the  Archbishop  of  Westminster,  backed  Mr  Howard's  stance  and  distanced  himself  from  Labour.  In  a  statement,  he  said  abortion  was  a  ""very  key  issue"",  saying:  ""The  policy  supported  by  Mr  Howard  is  one  that  we  would  commend,  on  the  way  to  a  full  abandonment  of  abortion.""  |||    Cardinal  O'Connor  claimed  Labour  had  ""developed""  the  notion  that  it  was  the  natural  party  of  Catholics,  but  he  said:  ""We  are  not  going  to  suggest  people  support  one  particular  party.""  The  Family  Planning  Association  says  a  reduction  would  particularly  affect  young  women  who  often  seek  help  later.  More  than  180,000  women  in  England  and  Wales  had  terminations  last  year,  of  which  fewer  than  1%  were  carried  out  between  22  and  24  weeks.  |||    In  the  Cosmopolitan  interview  Mr  Howard  said:  ""I  believe  abortion  should  be  available  to  everyone,  but  the  law  should  be  changed.  ""In  the  past  I  voted  for  a  restriction  to  22  weeks  and  I  would  be  prepared  to  go  down  to  20.""  All  three  main  parties  say  the  issue  is  one  for  each  MP's  conscience,  rather  than  one  where  there  is  a  party-wide  policy.  Mr  Howard  stressed  his  views  were  his  personal  views.  Shadow  home  secretary  David  Davis  said  he  understood  Mr  Howard  had  been  signalling  that  a  Conservative  government  would  allow  a  Commons  vote  on  the  issue.  Mr  Blair  and  Liberal  Democrat  leader  Charles  Kennedy  also  gave  their  views  during  interviews,  conducted  as  part  of  the  magazine's  ""High  Heeled  Vote""  campaign.  |||    Mr  Blair,  who  last  year  denied  he  planned  to  join  his  wife  and  four  children  in  the  Catholic  faith  despite  regularly  taking  communion,  said  abortion  was  a  ""difficult  issue"".  ""However  much  I  dislike  the  idea  of  abortion,  you  should  not  criminalise  a  woman  who,  in  very  difficult  circumstances,  makes  that  choice.  ""Obviously  there  is  a  time  beyond  which  you  can't  have  an  abortion,  and  we  have  no  plans  to  change  that  although  the  debate  will  continue.""  Mr  Kennedy  said  he  had  previously  voted  for  a  22-week  limit  but  medical  advances  mean  ""I  don't  know  what  I  would  do  now"".  The  Roman  Catholic  Archbishop  of  Cardiff,  the  Most  Reverend  Peter  Smith,  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme  that  the  church  merely  wanted  people  to  ""reflect  on  issues  in  light  of  the  gospel""  before  voting.  Anne  Weyman,  chief  executive  of  the  Family  Planning  Association,  asked:  ""What  is  the  benefit  to  women,  or  to  the  potential  child,  of  forcing  a  woman  to  have  a  baby?""  Anti-abortion  group  the  Pro-Life  Alliance  ""congratulated""  Mr  Howard  on  his  new  stance,  but  said  it  did  not  go  far  enough."

Van  Gogh  was  shot  and  stabbed  to  death  in  Amsterdam  six  weeks  ago.  A  Dutch-Moroccan  man  suspected  of  radical  Islamist  links  has  been  charged.  The  killing,  and  Fortuyn's  death  in  2002,  convulsed  the  Netherlands.  Many  Dutch  people  have  questioned  their  country's  self-image  as  a  peaceful,  tolerant  nation  in  the  wake  of  the  murders,  which  triggered  heated  debate  about  immigration.  |||    An  animal  rights  activist  was  sentenced  to  18  years  in  prison  last  year  for  killing  Fortuyn.  Earlier  this  year,  Van  Gogh  made  a  film  accusing  Islam  of  promoting  violence  against  women.  It  caused  outrage  among  Muslims  and  death  threats  were  made  against  him.  The  film  06/05  will  become  available  on  the  internet  on  Wednesday  and  go  on  general  release  in  Dutch  cinemas  in  January.  Van  Gogh's  movie  mixes  real  images  of  the  day  of  Fortuyn's  murder  with  a  fictional  plot  about  Dutch  intelligence  services  conspiring  to  silence  the  politician.  The  story  unfolds  through  the  eyes  of  a  freelance  photographer  who  unwittingly  takes  pictures  revealing  the  involvement  of  Dutch  authorities  in  Fortuyn's  murder.  Photographer  Jim  de  Booy  then  goes  on  the  run  from  secret  service  agents  who  burgle  his  home  and  threaten  his  family."

Fannie  Mae  last  month  warned  that  some  records  were  incorrect.  The  other  main  US  mortgage  firm  Freddie  Mac  restated  earnings  by  $5bn  (£2.6bn)  last  year  after  a  probe  of  its  books.  The  SEC's  comments  are  likely  to  increase  pressure  on  Congress  to  strengthen  supervision  of  Fannie  Mae  and  Freddie  Mac.  |||    The  two  firms  are  key  parts  of  the  US  financial  system  and  effectively  underwrite  the  mortgage  market,  financing  nearly  half  of  all  American  house  purchases  and  dealing  actively  in  bonds  and  other  financial  instruments.  The  investigation  of  Freddie  Mac  in  June  2003  sparked  concerns  about  the  wider  health  of  the  industry  and  raised  questionsmarks  over  the  role  of  the  Office  of  Federal  Housing  Enterprise  Oversight  (OFHEO),  the  industry's  main  regulator.  Having  been  pricked  into  action,  the  OFHEO  turned  its  attention  to  Fannie  May  and  in  September  this  year  said  that  the  firm  had  tweaked  its  books  to  spread  earnings  more  smoothly  across  quarters  and  play  down  the  amount  of  risk  it  had  taken  on.  The  SEC  found  similar  problems.  The  watchdog's  chief  accountant  Donald  Nicolaisen  said  that  ""Fannie  Mae's  methodology  of  assessing,  measuring  and  documenting  hedge  ineffectiveness  was  inadequate  and  was  not  supported""  by  generally  accepted  accounting  principles."

Its  withdrawal  from  the  $325m  (£170m)  contract  in  November  is  thought  to  be  the  largest  cancellation  to  date.  Contrack  said  ""the  original  scope  of  work  that  was  envisioned  could  not  be  executed  in  a  cost-effective  manner"".  But  the  firm  denied  reports  it  was  withdrawing  completely  from  Iraq.  ""Members  of  the  joint  venture  including  Contrack  are  committed  to  the  ongoing  reconstruction  efforts,  are  actively  working  in  Iraq  and  continue  to  look  for  new  construction  opportunities  in  the  country,""  it  said  in  a  statement.  The  Pentagon's  Project  and  Contract  Office  (PCO)  in  Baghdad  said  it  had  taken  over  Contrack's  management  of  the  subcontractors  working  on  the  transportation  projects.  |||    US  firms  and  their  workers  have  been  targets  of  attacks,  and  security  concerns  are  said  to  be  a  major  reason  for  the  slow  pace  of  reconstruction  in  Iraq.  Of  the  $18.4bn  in  reconstruction  funds  approved  by  Congress,  less  than  $2bn  has  been  spent.  Lt  Col  Eric  Schnaible  of  the  PCO  told  the  Associated  Press  news  agency  Contrack's  withdrawal  from  the  transportation  contract  was  a  ""mutually  agreed-to  separation""  and  did  not  indicate  a  movement  by  US  companies  to  leave  Iraq.  ""Some  parts  of  the  country  are  a  whole  lot  more  permissive  than  others,""  he  added.  ""Where  we  can  get  the  work  done,  good  things  are  happening.""" 

0	"Consumer  spending  lifts  US  growth  |||    US  economic  growth  accelerated  in  the  third  quarter,  helped  by  strong  consumer  spending,  official  figures  have  shown.  |||    The  economy  expanded  at  an  annual  rate  of  3.7%  in  the  July  to  September  period,  the  Commerce  Department  said.  The  figure  marked  an  increase  on  the  3.3%  growth  recorded  in  the  second  quarter,  but  fell  short  of  the  4.2%  rate  pencilled  in  by  forecasters.  The  increase  reflected  the  biggest  jump  in  consumer  spending  in  a  year.  ""It  was  a  little  softer  than  the  consensus,  but  not  a  real  surprise,""  said  Gary  Thayer,  an  economist  at  AG  Edwards  &  Sons.  Friday's  growth  estimate  is  one  of  the  last  significant  pieces  of  economic  data  before  the  2  November  presidential  election.  |||    Democrat  challenger  John  Kerry  has  criticised  President  George  W  Bush's  handling  of  the  economy,  pointing  to  a  net  loss  of  over  800,000  jobs  since  Mr  Bush  took  office.  Analysts  said  the  economy  was  still  not  growing  fast  enough  to  stimulate  large-scale  job  creation.  ""It's  a  pretty  good  growth  rate,  but  it  may  not  be  good  enough  to  create  enough  jobs,""  said  Robert  Brusca,  chief  economist  at  Fact  and  Opinion  Economics  in  New  York.  However,  President  Bush  is  expected  to  point  to  Commerce  Department  figures  showing  that  consumer  spending  grew  at  4.6%  in  the  third  quarter,  up  from  just  1.6%  in  the  second,  as  evidence  that  his  policies  are  generating  solid  growth.  Consumer  spending  accounts  for  about  two  thirds  of  all  economic  activity  in  the  US.  |||    The  weaker  than  expected  growth  figure  makes  it  less  likely  that  the  US  Federal  Reserve  will  raise  interest  rates  next  month,  economists  said.  ""The  economy  regained  some  traction  in  the  third  quarter,  but  the  growth  is  not  robust,""  AG  Edwards'  Thayer.  ""I  think  that  means  the  Fed  can  take  its  time  raising  rates.  We'll  probably  see  one  more  rate  hike  before  the  end  of  the  year.""  In  an  effort  to  pre-empt  rising  inflation,  the  Federal  Reserve  has  pushed  through  three  quarter-point  rate  rises  since  June  this  year,  taking  borrowing  costs  to  1.75%.  On  the  financial  markets,  the  dollar  fell  slightly  against  the  euro  and  the  yen,  while  the  Dow  Jones  index  of  leading  US  shares  was  little  changed." 

0	"Could  Yukos  be  a  blessing  in  disguise?  |||    Other  things  being  equal,  the  notion  of  entrepreneurs  languishing  in  jail  while  their  companies  are  sold  off  for  a  song  ought  to  be  bad  for  business.  |||    But  in  the  looking-glass  world  of  modern  Russia,  the  opposite  might  just  be  true,  a  new  report*  has  argued.  The  study,  from  the  Centre  for  Economic  Policy  Research,  does  not  praise  the  rough  handling  of  oil  company  Yukos.  But  it  argues  that  more  rigorous  tax  policing  has  benefited  all  Russian  firms,  even  targets  of  the  tax  police.  ""An  increase  in  tax  enforcement  can  increase  the  amount  [of  dividends  and  other  income]  outside  shareholders  will  receive,  even  accounting  for  increased  levels  of  taxation,""  the  authors  say.  |||    The  paper's  reasoning  is  complex,  and  is  based  on  a  sophisticated  model  of  the  relationship  between  tax  regimes  and  corporate  governance  -  in  particular,  the  propensity  of  management  to  steal  from  the  company.  The  calculations  demonstrated  what  many  Russian  analysts  already  knew:  that  increasing  the  tax  rate  increases  the  amount  that  managers  steal,  since  undeclared  income  becomes  relatively  more  valuable.  In  the  West,  meanwhile,  higher  tax  rates  translate  far  more  smoothly  into  higher  government  revenues.  On  the  other  hand,  increasing  the  rigour  with  which  taxes  are  collected  encourages  companies  to  become  more  transparent,  forcing  them  to  be  able  to  demonstrate  their  financial  position  far  more  accurately.  The  net  result,  the  authors  say,  is  that  the  extra  amount  companies  pay  in  tax  is  more  than  compensated  for  by  greater  efficiency  and  financial  soundness.  |||    After  Vladimir  Putin  became  president  in  2000,  he  did  not  raise  taxes,  but  put  a  lot  of  effort  -  too  much,  critics  argue  -  into  enforcement.  |||    Since  then,  the  Russian  stock  market  has  more  than  trebled  in  value,  a  rise  the  authors  attribute  at  least  in  part  to  the  newly  tough  approach.  The  report  highlights  the  case  of  Sibneft,  a  Russian  oil  company  that  came  close  to  merging  with  Yukos  last  year.  After  Mr  Putin  came  to  power,  the  company's  overall  effective  tax  rate  rose  from  2.6%  to  10.4%,  and  Sibneft  was  the  target  of  a  series  of  aggressive  raids  by  fiscal  police.  But  shareholders  benefited  hugely:  Sibneft  started  to  pay  dividends  -  $53m  in  2000  and  almost  $1bn  in  2001  -  and  closed  down  the  network  of  opaque  subsidiaries  it  had  previously  used  for  siphoning  off  unofficial  funds.  According  to  the  authors,  although  a  variety  of  changes  were  sweeping  through  Russian  industry  at  the  time,  the  increase  in  tax  enforcement  is  the  only  likely  explanation  for  the  change  of  fortunes  at  Sibneft  and  many  of  its  peers.  |||    Does  this  analysis  make  sense?  In  part,  certainly.  For  all  its  faults,  corporate  Russia  has  become  far  more  orderly  and  law-abiding  since  2000.  Companies  have  rushed  to  list  their  shares  on  international  stock  exchanges  -  something  unthinkable  in  the  wilder  days  of  the  1990s  -  and  most  large  firms  now  produce  their  accounts  to  international  standards.  Foreign  direct  investment,  long  negligible,  is  starting  to  flow  in  serious  amounts  -  $7bn  in  2003  -  and  stock  market  returns  have  been  among  the  healthiest  in  Europe.  But  the  authors'  model  does  not  quite  cover  all  the  complexities.  For  a  start,  the  model  assumes  that  the  various  parties  have  clearly-defined  motivation:  companies  want  to  maximise  profit,  governments  want  to  maximise  tax  revenue.  In  fact,  the  alarmingly  close  connections  between  big  business  and  government  in  Russia  -  connections  often  greased  by  bribery  -  blur  the  apparently  antagonistic  relationship.  Companies  can,  for  example,  persuade  officials  to  overlook  non-payment  of  taxes.  |||    And  the  authors'  definition  of  tax  enforcement  seems  unrealistically  Western.  Genuine,  disinterested  tax  collection  might  well  work  wonders  in  Russia;  the  problem  with  recent  examples  has  been  the  erratic  and  unpredictable  way  laws  are  enforced.  The  case  against  Yukos,  for  example,  has  moved  in  fits  and  starts,  with  little  clarity  from  the  government  about  its  intentions,  and  little  faith  from  investors  that  the  letter  of  the  law  would  be  followed.  As  far  as  most  commentators  are  concerned,  the  state  is  pursuing  Yukos  out  of  a  political  vendetta,  rather  than  simply  to  enforce  fiscal  rectitude.  Since  Yukos'  founder,  Mikhail  Khodorkovsky,  was  arrested  a  year  ago,  the  Russian  market  has  dropped  by  10%  -  an  indication  that  few  investors  feel  optimistic  about  the  salutary  effect  on  corporate  performance." 

1	"The  comic  book  genius  of  Stan  Lee  |||    Stan  Lee,  the  man  responsible  for  a  string  of  comic  superheroes  that  have  become  household  names,  has  won  a  court  battle  for  a  slice  of  the  profits  from  the  hit  Spider-Man  movies.  |||    Many  marvel  at  the  man  who  gave  his  characters  extraordinary  powers  and  everyday  headaches  -  a  formula  which  revolutionised  comics.  Born  in  1922  to  poor  working-class  Jewish  immigrants  from  Romania,  Stan  Lieberman,  got  a  job  in  Timely  Publications,  a  company  owned  by  a  relative.  He  was  assigned  to  the  comics  division  and  -  thanks  to  a  fertile  imagination  -  rose  to  editor  by  the  age  of  18.  For  more  than  20  years,  he  was  ""the  ultimate  hack""  -  knocking  out  crime  stories,  horrors,  westerns,  anything  to  sate  the  appetite  of  his  juvenile  readership.  Words  of  more  than  two  syllables  were  discouraged.  Characters  were  either  all  good  or  bad,  with  no  shades  of  grey.  So  embarrassed  was  Lieberman  by  much  of  what  he  was  writing  that  he  refused  to  put  his  real  name  on  the  byline.  He  assumed  the  ""dumb  name"",  Stan  Lee,  now  legally  adopted.  |||    By  the  time  he  was  40,  Lee  had  decided  he  was  too  old  for  the  comic  game.  His  British-born  wife,  Joan,  suggested  he  had  nothing  to  lose  and,  for  his  swansong,  should  write  the  kind  of  characters  he  really  wanted  to  create.  After  a  rival  comic  had  come  up  with  a  superteam  consisting  of  Batman,  Superman  and  Wonder  Woman,  Timely  needed  to  respond.  |||    Lee's  answer,  in  1961,  was  the  Fantastic  Four  -  a  team  of  astronauts  who  gained  super  powers  after  being  bombarded  with  cosmic  rays.  They  were  to  change  Lee's  life,  and  the  comics  industry,  forever.  Lee  gave  each  character  individual,  everyday  teenage  problems  such  as  dandruff,  ingrown  toenails  and  acne.  They  would  frequently  fall  out  with  their  parents  and  each  other.  The  fan  letters  poured  in.  Without  immediately  knowing  it,  Stan  Lee  had  ushered  in  the  golden  age  of  comics,  and  his  imagination  was  rekindled.  His  Marvel  universe  spawned  the  new  title  of  Marvel  Comics.  Soon  after,  nerdy  Peter  Parker  was  transformed  -  after  a  bite  from  an  irradiated  spider  -  into  someone  who  could  crawl  up  the  sides  of  New  York's  skyscrapers.  Spider-Man  was  born.  He  was  to  become  an  icon  of  modern  popular  culture.  Spidey,  as  he  is  affectionately  known,  had  quite  extraordinary  powers  -  yet  he  had  problems  at  work,  at  home  and  with  his  girlfriends.  At  last,  the  teenager  was  no  longer  just  the  sidekick,  but  the  main  hero.  And  the  hero  was  no  longer  just  brawn,  he  had  brains  too.  |||    ""Just  because  he's  a  hero  and  has  super  powers  doesn't  mean  he  doesn't  have  problems,""  Stan  Lee  told  the  BBC.  The  Incredible  Hulk,  The  Mighty  Thor,  Iron  Man  and  the  rest  all  grappled  with  problems  like  drug  abuse,  bigotry  and  social  inequality.  Radically,  Lee  gave  the  artists  responsible  for  the  comic  designs  credits  for  their  work.  Jack  Kirby,  Frank  Miller,  John  Romitaand  and  others  achieved  cult  status  in  their  own  right.  Other  superheroes  broke  new  ground  in  other  ways.  Daredevil  was  blind,  Black  Panther  was  black  and  Silver  Surfer  pondered  the  state  of  humanity.  Lee's  influence  remains.  Some  years  ago  the  Marvel  hero,  Northstar,  came  out  of  the  closet.  In  its  heyday,  Marvel  was  selling  50  million  copies  a  year.  Until  he  retired  from  editing  in  1971,  Stan  Lee  wrote  all  the  copy  for  Marvel's  covers.  |||    In  1999,  his  Stan  Lee  Media  venture,  aimed  at  marrying  comic-strips  with  the  internet,  went  spectacularly  wrong.  Lee  went  bankrupt  and  his  business  partner  landed  in  prison  for  fraud.  In  2001  though,  he  started  a  new  company  entitled  POW!  (Purveyors  of  Wonder)  Entertainment,  which  is  currently  developing  films  and  television  programmes.  His  latest  project  is  a  superhero  based  on  a  real  person  -  Jay  J  Armes,  who  has  metal  claws  after  losing  both  hands  aged  12  and  fights  crime  with  a  tiger.  But  his  40-year-old  creations  are  still  as  enduring  as  ever  -  with  X-Men,  The  Hulk  and  Daredevil  have  all  been  turned  into  Hollywood  action  movies  in  the  last  five  years.  But  Spider-Man  has  been  the  biggest  box  office  hit,  with  the  2002  original  and  its  2004  sequel  taking  almost  $1.6bn  (£857m)  in  ticket  sales  around  the  world  -  before  DVD  and  merchandise  sales  are  counted.  It  seems  Stan  Lee  is  as  indestructible  as  his  heroes." 

2	"Terror  detainees  win  Lords  appeal  |||    Detaining  foreign  terrorist  suspects  without  trial  breaks  human  rights  laws,  the  UK's  highest  court  has  ruled.  |||    In  a  blow  to  the  government's  anti-terror  measures,  the  House  of  Lords  law  lords  ruled  by  an  eight  to  one  majority  in  favour  of  appeals  by  nine  detainees.  Most  of  the  men  are  being  indefinitely  held  in  Belmarsh  prison,  south  London.  The  law  lords  said  the  measures  were  incompatible  with  European  human  rights  laws.  The  men  will  stay  behind  bars  while  ministers  decide  how  to  react.  The  ruling  creates  a  major  problem  for  Charles  Clarke  on  his  first  day  as  home  secretary  following  David  Blunkett's  resignation.  The  Liberal  Democrats  say  Mr  Clarke  should  use  the  fact  he  is  new  to  the  job  to  take  issue  with  a  law  established  by  his  predecessor,  David  Blunkett.  Belmarsh  prison  has  been  dubbed  Britain's  Guantanamo  Bay  by  civil  rights  campaigners  opposed  to  the  use  of  emergency  anti-terror  laws.  |||    The  detainees  took  their  case  to  the  House  of  Lords  after  the  Court  of  Appeal  backed  the  Home  Office's  powers  to  hold  them  without  limit  or  charge.  The  government  opted  out  of  part  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  concerning  the  right  to  a  fair  trial  in  order  to  bring  in  anti-terrorism  legislation  in  response  to  the  11  September  attacks  in  the  US.  Any  foreign  national  suspected  of  links  with  terrorism  can  be  detained  or  can  opt  to  be  deported.  However  those  detained  cannot  be  deported  if  this  would  mean  persecution  in  their  homeland.  |||    On  Thursday,  senior  law  lord  Lord  Bingham  said  the  rules  were  incompatible  with  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  as  they  allowed  detentions  ""in  a  way  that  discriminates  on  the  ground  of  nationality  or  immigration  status"".  Lord  Nicholls  of  Birkenhead,  in  his  ruling,  said:  ""Indefinite  imprisonment  without  charge  or  trial  is  anathema  in  any  country  which  observes  the  rule  of  law.  ""It  deprives  the  detained  person  of  the  protection  a  criminal  trial  is  intended  to  afford.""  |||    He  said  the  weakness  for  the  government's  case  was  that  it  was  trying  to  justify  detention  without  trial  for  foreign  suspects  -  but  not  for  British  suspects.  Lord  Hoffmann  said:  ""The  real  threat  to  the  life  of  the  nation,  in  the  sense  of  a  people  living  in  accordance  with  its  traditional  laws  and  political  values,  comes  not  from  terrorism  but  from  laws  such  as  these.""  But  Lord  Walker  of  Gestingthorpe,  the  one  law  lord  to  oppose  the  appeal,  said  the  anti-terror  laws  contained  important  safeguards  against  oppression.  |||    In  a  statement,  detainee  'A'  in  Woodhill  Prison  said:  ""I  hope  now  that  the  government  will  act  upon  this  decision,  scrap  this  illegal  'law'  and  release  me  and  the  other  internees  to  return  to  our  families  and  loved  ones.""  The  case  was  heard  by  a  panel  of  nine  law  lords  rather  than  the  usual  five  because  of  the  constitutional  importance  of  the  case.  Ben  Emmerson  QC,  representing  seven  of  the  detainees,  said  the  men  had  already  been  in  custody  for  nearly  three  years.  He  said  they  had  been  given  no  idea  when,  if  ever,  they  would  be  released,  had  never  been  formally  interviewed  and  there  was  no  prospect  they  would  ever  be  put  on  trial.  When  the  men  were  first  held,  they  took  their  cases  to  the  Special  Immigration  Appeals  Commission  (SIAC).  The  commission  ruled  on  30  July,  2002  that  the  anti-terror  act  unjustifiably  discriminated  against  foreign  nationals  as  British  people  could  not  be  held  in  the  same  way.  But  that  ruling  was  later  overturned  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  who  said  there  was  a  state  of  emergency  threatening  the  life  of  the  nation."

2	"Parliament's  record  of  scandal  |||    In  a  locked  room  at  the  heart  of  Parliament  there  is  a  hive  of  scandal.  |||    Sex,  betrayal  and  custody  of  children  are  all  there  in  this  affair  but  this  time  it  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  recent  troubles  of  David  Blunkett  or  Boris  Johnson.  |||    Few  realise  that  Westminster  in  effect  has  its  own  divorce  den.  For  sprinkled  among  12  floors  of  archives  are  blow-by-blow  accounts  of  marital  break-ups  -  and  now  you  can  search  what's  there  online.  Until  1857,  the  only  way  in  England  to  get  a  full  divorce  which  allowed  re-marriage  was  to  obtain  an  Act  of  Parliament  by  proving  adultery  or  life-threatening  cruelty.  The  legacy  is  pages  of  testimonies  used  in  the  hearings,  dating  back  to  1670,  all  recorded  among  the  325,000  items  which  fill  the  12  floors  of  the  parliamentary  archives  in  Parliament's  Victoria  Tower.  Most  people  researching  their  family  history  want  to  discover  some  tale  of  illicit  love.  This  gives  them  the  chance.  |||    Divorce  by  Parliament  was  an  expensive  process  open  really  only  to  the  rich  but  the  records  also  include  the  testimony  of  maids,  butlers  and  coachmen  about  their  masters  and  mistresses.  Among  the  records  is  the  story  of  Jane  Campbell,  the  first  woman  ever  to  divorce  her  husband.  That  happened  in  1801  after  she  had  discovered  her  husband,  Edward  Addison,  had  committed  adultery  with  her  sister  Jessy.  |||    A  transcript  of  evidence  from  Jessy's  maid,  Amelia  Laugher,  shows  her  telling  how  Addison  frequently  passed  by  her  on  the  way  to  the  room  where  she  had  just  put  her  mistress  naked  to  bed.  It  must  have  been  a  killer  blow  to  Addison's  case  -  he  had  already  fled  abroad  rather  than  pay  the  £5,000  damages  ordered  by  a  civil  court.  As  well  as  making  divorce  history,  Jane  Campbell  won  custody  of  her  children  -  unusual  for  a  woman  at  the  time.  But  divorces  are  by  no  means  the  only  documents  in  the  archives  which  hold  personal  details  of  people  often  far  removed  from  politics  and  Parliament.  |||    There  are  the  protestation  returns  from  1642  -  lists  of  the  Protestants  who  pledged  to  ""maintain  the  true  reformed  Protestant  religion"".  There  are  details  of  foreign  nationals  made  British  citizens  by  act  of  Parliament,  including  composer  George  Frideric  Handel  in  1727.  And  the  mass  of  private  bills  which,  for  example  authorise  the  building  of  railways  and  roads,  contain  both  the  names  and  addresses  of  those  involved  and  testimonies  giving  people  a  unique  perspective  on  how  their  ancestors  opposed  them.  |||    Tax  bills  may  be  an  extra  source  for  pedigree  hunters  -  the  longest  stretches  for  about  300m  and  is  longer  than  the  Palace  of  Westminster  itself,  listing  the  names  of  appointed  tax  collectors.  This  wealth  of  material  has  long  been  open  to  the  public  at  the  House  of  Lords  Record  Office,  with  visitors  able  to  phone  ahead  when  they  want  to  view  particular  items  in  the  search  room.  But  now  five  years  of  work  has  produced  an  online  catalogue.  David  Prior,  assistant  clerk  of  the  archives,  says  the  catalogue  opens  up  new  possibilities  for  research.  ""Before,  you  just  could  not  do  it,  you  faced  trawling  through  pages  and  pages  of  printed  material,""  he  says.  Mr  Prior  sees  the  changes  as  part  of  a  wider  revolution  in  archives  generally.  ""The  archive  profession  may  look  fairly  staid  but  is  in  an  enormous  period  of  change,  mainly  motivated  by  the  potential  of  IT,  which  is  opening  up  all  sorts  of  vistas  for  us,""  he  says.  |||    The  archives  do,  of  course,  hold  records  of  high  (and  low)  politics  too  for  both  Houses  of  Parliament,  including  copies  of  all  acts  passed  since  1497  -  the  oldest  dealing  with  the  employment  of  workers  in  the  woollen  industry  in  Norfolk.  Records  for  the  Commons  only  date  back  to  1834  -  anything  earlier  was  wiped  out  by  the  fire  which  destroyed  most  of  the  Parliament  buildings  in  1834.  |||    But  that  still  leaves  some  of  the  most  important  documents  of  UK  political  history  -  parts  of  the  Bill  of  Rights  from  1689,  the  death  warrant  for  Charles  I,  the  private  papers  and  diaries  of  major  politicians  such  as  David  Lloyd  George  and  Andrew  Bonar  Law.  There  is  also  the  1606  act  establishing  5  November  as  a  thanksgiving  day  -  the  year  after  the  Gunpowder  Plot.  That  document  is  likely  to  feature  in  the  exhibition  the  archives  will  put  on  next  year  as  part  of  a  series  of  events  across  London  to  mark  the  400th  anniversary  of  Guy  Fawkes'  conspiracy.  As  Mr  Prior  remarks  as  we  walk  by  shelf  after  shelf  of  vellum  (parchment  made  from  goat's  skin):  ""All  human  life  is  here."""

He  said  watching  the  show  caused  his  blood  pressure  to  rise  so  high  that  he  became  dizzy  and  light-headed.  The  legal  assistant  said  NBC  was  ""sending  the  wrong  message  to  viewers  that  cash  can  make  or  have  people  do  just  about  anything  beyond  reasoning"".  The  hand-written,  four-page  lawsuit  said:  ""To  have  the  individuals  on  the  show  eat  and  drink  dead  rats  was  crazy  and  from  a  viewer's  point  of  view  made  me  throw-up  as  well  as  another  in  the  house  at  the  same  time.""  Mr  Aitken,  who  lives  in  Cleveland,  said  that  after  becoming  light-headed,  he  ran  towards  the  bedroom  and  knocked  his  head  in  a  doorway.  A  spokesman  for  NBC  said  it  had  no  comment  on  the  lawsuit,  but  confirmed  the  stunt  show  did  feature  a  rat-eating  scene  in  New  York's  Times  Square  on  8  November.  Past  shows  have  featured  viewers  eating  spiders  and  live  worms.  The  programme  has  been  screened  in  the  UK  on  Sky  One." 

1	"Greer  attacks  'bully'  Big  Brother  |||    Germaine  Greer  has  criticised  Celebrity  Big  Brother's  ""bullying""  of  housemates  after  quitting  the  reality  TV  show.  |||    She  said  ""superior""  bullying  tactics,  like  making  housemates  cold  and  hungry,  could  encourage  playground  bullying.  She  also  condemned  the  ""complete  irresponsibility""  of  adding  Brigitte  Nielsen's  former  mother-in-law  Jackie  Stallone  to  the  house  on  Monday.  Nielsen  had  panicked  that  if  she  reacted  badly  it  could  harm  her  access  to  her  children,  Greer  said.  The  feminist  writer  and  broadcaster  said  Big  Brother  had  behaved  ""like  a  child  rather  than  a  parent""  by  taunting  contestant  John  McCririck  after  denying  him  a  cola  drink.  ""I  thought  it  was  actually  demonstrating  the  role  of  taunting  in  the  playground  and  there  are  so  many  children  whose  lives  have  actually  been  destroyed  by  taunting  in  the  playground,""  Greer  said.  She  also  said  that  her  fellow  housemates  had  publicity-seeking  ""agendas"".  |||    ""I  had  no  idea  who  would  be  in  here  and  it's  wrong  for  me  to  present  myself  in  the  same  context  as  they  are.""  Media  observers  had  been  surprised  by  Greer's  initial  decision  to  join  the  third  celebrity  version  of  the  Channel  4  reality  TV  show,  given  that  she  has  written  critical  articles  about  the  format  in  the  past.  As  she  packed  her  suitcase  to  leave  the  house  she  told  fellow  housemates:  ""I'm  leaving  over  specific  issues,  but  best  for  everyone  if  I  don't  discuss  them.  ""I  have  a  problem  with  decisions,  I  make  them  fast  and  when  I  make  them,  I  stick  to  them.""  Greer  had  earlier  failed  to  persuade  other  contestants  to  stage  a  naked  protest  against  Big  Brother.  |||    Other  celebrities  to  walk  out  of  a  reality  show  TV  include  Sex  Pistol  John  Lydon,  former  EastEnders  actress  Danniella  Westbrook  and  ex-E17  singer  Brian  Harvey  who  all  left  I'm  A  Celebrity...  Get  Me  Out  Of  Here.  Previous  Big  Brother  housemates  to  leave  before  their  time  were  Sunita  Sharma  and  Sandy  Cumming  from  the  third  series  of  the  non-celebrity  version  of  the  show.  |||    VOTE      Was  Germaine  Greer  right  to  leave  Celebrity  Big  Brother?      Yes    No      Results  are  indicative  and  may  not  reflect  public  opinion  |||    Happy  Mondays  dancer  Bez  is  now  2-1  favourite  to  win  the  show,  followed  by  Blazin'  Squad  singer  Kenzie  at  5-2  and  actor  Jeremy  Edwards  at  4-1.  Ladbrokes  spokesman  Warren  Lush  said  that  the  series  was  still  ""wide  open"",  adding  that  the  last  24  hours  had  also  seen  a  rush  of  bets  on  McCririck  slashing  his  odds  to  8-1.  DJ  Lisa  I'Anson  is  the  outsider  with  odds  of  40-1,  while  Jackie  Stallone,  who  joined  the  house  on  Monday,  is  also  one  of  the  less  popular  housemates  at  20-1.  The  first  eviction  of  the  series  has  now  been  postponed  after  Greer's  exit  unexpectedly  reduced  the  number  of  competitors.  The  eight  remaining  contestants  are  competing  for  a  £50,000  prize,  to  be  donated  to  the  charity  of  their  choice,  if  they  survive  a  series  of  public  votes.  For  every  50p  vote  cast  by  viewers  by  telephone  or  text  during  the  programme's  run,  9p  will  go  to  a  tsunami  charity  appeal." 

2	"MPs  quiz  aides  over  royal  income  |||    Senior  officials  at  the  two  bodies  generating  private  income  for  the  Queen  and  Prince  of  Wales  are  to  be  questioned  by  MPs.  |||    Aides  from  the  Duchy  of  Lancaster  and  Duchy  of  Cornwall  will  appear  before  the  Commons  Public  Accounts  Committee.  It  has  been  reported  they  could  be  questioned  about  Prince  Charles'  spending  on  Camilla  Parker  Bowles.  But  BBC  correspondent  Peter  Hunt  said  they  are  not  responsible  for  how  money  is  spent  and  may  be  unable  to  answer.  Duchy  officials,  who  will  appear  before  the  committee  on  Monday,  are  only  responsible  for  generating  money.  The  Duchy  of  Lancaster  provides  the  Queen's  private  income,  while  the  Duchy  of  Cornwall  provides  Prince  Charles'  annual  income.  The  Duchy  of  Cornwall  is  a  140,000-acre  estate  across  25  counties,  and  also  includes  residential  properties,  shops,  offices,  stocks  and  shares.  It  was  set  up  in  1337  by  King  Edward  III  to  provide  income  for  successive  heirs  to  the  throne.  It  covers  the  cost  of  the  prince's  public  and  private  life  -  neither  Charles,  nor  William  and  Harry,  receive  taxpayers'  money  from  the  Civil  List.  However,  the  Prince  of  Wales  did  receive  over  £4m  from  government  departments  and  grants-in-aid  in  2003-4.  The  duchy  last  year  generated  almost  £12m.  The  prince  has  voluntarily  paid  income  tax  -  currently  40%  -  since  1993."

But  the  figures,  along  with  this  week's  inflation  report,  could  trigger  another  interest  rate  rise  in  the  New  Year.  However,  recent  data  from  the  British  Retail  Consortium  showed  a  0.2%  slip  in  High  Street  sales  during  November.  |||    The  ONS  data  confounded  analyst  expectations.  Many  had  expected  sales  to  fall  slightly  in  November  as  shoppers  put  off  buying  Christmas  presents  until  December.  However,  retailers'  attempts  to  draw  in  the  crowds  may  be  behind  November's  unexpected  rise  in  sales,  they  say.  Aggressive  tactics,  such  as  one-day  discount  sales  adopted  by  stores  such  as  Marks  &  Spencer,  appear  to  have  paid  off.  ""Price  discounting  has  certainly  accounted  for  much  of  this  because  the  value  of  retail  sales  hasn't  grown  as  much  as  volumes,""  said  Investec  economist  David  Page.  The  figures  sparked  a  rally  for  sterling  as  the  data  supported  the  view  that  it  is  too  early  to  assume  that  base  rates  have  peaked."

By  1700  GMT,  Petrel's  shares  fell  from  97p  ($1.87)  to  44p  ($0.85).  Petrel  said  that  it  has  not  received  any  information  from  Iraqi  authorities  to  confirm  or  deny  the  report.  |||    Iraq  is  seeking  to  award  contracts  for  three  projects,  valued  at  $500m  (£258.5m).  Turkey's  Everasia  is  reported  by  Reuters  to  have  won  a  contract  to  develop  the  Khurmala  Dome  field  in  the  north  of  the  country.  A  Canadian  company,  named  IOG,  is  reported  to  have  won  the  contract  to  run  the  Himrin  field.  Ironhorse  Oil  and  Gas  has  denied  to  Reuters  that  it  is  the  company  in  question.  These  two  projects  aim  to  develop  Khurmala  field  to  produce  100,000  barrels  per  day  and  raise  the  output  of  Himrin.  The  winners  of  the  contract  are  to  build  new  flow  lines  and  build  gas  separation  stations.  The  contract  to  develop  the  Suba-Luhais  field  has  not  yet  been  awarded  as  Iraq's  Oil  Ministry  is  studying  the  offers.  If  Iraq's  cabinet  approves  the  oil  ministry's  choice  of  companies,  then  this  will  be  the  first  deal  that  Iraq  has  signed  with  a  foreign  oil  company.  Iraq  is  still  trying  to  boost  its  production  capacity  to  match  levels  last  seen  in  the  eighties,  before  the  war  with  Iran.

0	"Industrial  output  falls  in  Japan  |||    Japanese  industrial  output  fell  in  October  while  unemployment  rose,  casting  further  doubt  on  the  strength  of  the  country's  economic  recovery.  |||    Production  dropped  1.6%  in  October,  reflecting  a  decline  in  exports,  while  unemployment  levels  edged  up  0.1%  to  4.7%,  slightly  higher  than  forecast.  The  economy  has  grown  for  six  quarters  but  growth  slowed  dramatically  in  the  last  quarter  amid  weaker  global  demand.  Japan's  government  remains  optimistic  due  to  strong  domestic  demand.  |||    Analysts  had  been  forecasting  a  0.1%  rise  in  month  on  month  industrial  output.  |||    According  to  figures  from  the  Ministry  of  Economy,  Trade  and  Industry  (METI),  the  decline  was  led  by  a  fall  in  demand  for  electronic  parts  for  mobile  phones  and  digital  televisions.  Although  inventories  fell  0.7%  month  on  month,  they  were  36%  higher  than  a  year  ago.  ""It's  a  sign  that  the  economy's  adjustment  phase  is  stronger  than  expected,""  said  Takashi  Yamanaka,  an  economist  with  UFJ  Bank.  Japan  downgraded  its  overall  economic  assessment  earlier  this  month  for  the  first  time  in  a  year.  |||    Growth  slowed  to  0.3%  in  the  quarter  ending  September  30,  down  from  6.3%  in  the  first  quarter  of  2004.  Experts  believe  the  economy  -which  stagnated  for  most  of  the  1990s  -may  be  entering  a  softer  patch  on  the  back  of  rising  oil  prices  and  the  falling  dollar.  Japanese  government  officials  played  down  the  latest  data,  arguing  that  domestic  consumer  demand  was  still  resilient.  ""The  outlook  for  November  is  positive  so  I  don't  think  one  can  say  that  conditions  have  worsened  just  because  of  the  fall  in  October,""  said  a  METI  official.  Despite  the  rise  in  unemployment,  jobless  figures  are  still  some  way  below  historical  highs  of  recent  years.  The  comparatively  weak  economic  date  preyed  on  shares  with  the  Nikkei  down  1%  in  afternoon  trade." 

0	"Euro  firms  miss  out  on  optimism  |||    More  than  90%  of  large  companies  around  the  world  are  highly  optimistic  about  their  economic  prospects,  a  survey  of  1,300  bosses  suggests.  |||    Their  biggest  worries  are  not  terror  threats,  but  over-regulation,  low-cost  competition  and  the  wild  ups  and  downs  of  oil  prices.  There  is  one  exception:  Firms  in  Western  Europe  -  but  not  the  UK  -  are  lacking  confidence  after  years  of  slow  growth.  When  business  advisers  PricewaterhouseCoopers  (PwC)  conducted  the  same  survey  two  years  ago,  nearly  30%  of  bosses  were  gloomy  about  their  prospects.  |||    Global  business  leaders  say  that  they  are  facing  a  two-pronged  regulatory  assault.  After  a  string  of  corporate  scandals  in  the  United  States  -  from  Enron  to  WorldCom  -  the  Sarbanes-Oxley  act  forces  companies  to  be  much  more  transparent,  but  doing  all  the  paperwork  costs  a  lot  of  time  and  money.  Across  Europe,  meanwhile,  all  stock  exchange-listed  companies  are  currently  in  the  process  of  moving  to  new  and  complex  accounting  standards  called  IFRS.  Hacking  through  the  red  tape  can  hardly  be  avoided,  but  many  chief  executives  around  the  world  appear  to  have  decided  on  how  to  deal  with  low-cost  competitors.  |||    Already,  about  28%  of  the  bosses  polled  for  the  survey  say  that  they  have  moved  parts  of  their  business  into  low-wage  countries,  and  another  11%  plan  to  do  so  in  the  future.  Possibly  as  a  result,  the  worry  about  low-cost  competition  has  slightly  fallen  from  last  year,  with  just  54%  of  companies  calling  it  a  ""significant  threat""  or  ""one  of  the  biggest  threats"".  But  PwC's  global  chief  executive,  Samuel  DiPiazza,  said  a  growing  number  of  companies  were  also  concerned  that  moves  to  outsource  work  to  cheaper  countries  could  both  hurt  their  reputation  in  their  home  markets  and  harm  the  quality  of  service  they  provide  to  their  customers.  |||    According  to  Frank  Brown,  global  advisory  leader  at  PwC  ,  the  trend  of  large  companies  to  have  global  operations  has  one  clear  upside:  ""One  risk  in  one  region  -  for  example  the  Middle  East  -  won't  kill  your  business  anymore.""  Surprisingly,  the  survey  suggests  that  the  rapid  decline  of  the  US  dollar  is  not  seen  as  a  huge  threat  anymore,  unlike  even  a  year  ago,  when  it  was  cited  as  the  third-largest  problem.  Mr  DiPiazza  said  the  interviews  with  chief  executives  suggested  that  companies  had  ""adjusted""  to  the  new  reality  of  a  euro  that  buys  $1.30  and  more,  while  others  had  successfully  hedged  their  positions  and  locked  in  more  favourable  exchange  rates.  |||        -  For  the  survey,  PricewaterhouseCoopers  interviewed  1,324  chief  executives  throughout  the  world  during  the  last  three  months  of  2004." 

2	"Howard  unveils  election  platform  |||    The  Conservatives  would  stand  up  for  the  ""forgotten  majority"",  Michael  Howard  pledged  as  he  unveiled  the  first  part  of  the  Tory  election  manifesto.  |||    The  Tory  leader  argued  there  was  a  mass  of  people  whom  he  says  feel  let  down  by  Tony  Blair  and  who  share  Tory  values.  In  the  foreword  to  the  manifesto,  he  promises  to  focus  on  restoring  order,  trying  to  lower  taxes  and  giving  power  back  to  the  people.  Labour  says  the  document  offers  only  a  return  to  a  ""failed  Tory  past"".  The  Liberal  Democrats  say  the  Conservatives  cannot  win  what  they  predict  will  be  a  three-party  contest.  |||    Campaigning  activity  is  accelerating  ahead  of  the  general  election,  which  is  widely  tipped  for  May  but  could  be  any  time  before  June  2006.  Labour  on  Monday  postponed  a  launch  of  election  posters  because  of  the  Asian  tsunami  disaster.  Mr  Howard  published  the  introduction  to  the  Tory  manifesto.  Other  chapters  will  follow  in  coming  weeks.  |||    In  a  speech  in  Northamptonshire,  he  said  the  ""forgotten  majority""  made  up  the  backbone  of  Britain.  They  were  people  who  were  saving  for  their  first  home  or  their  retirement,  working  hard  and  accepting  their  responsibilities.  He  says  in  the  manifesto  foreword:  ""They  have  been  forgotten,  neglected  and  taken  for  granted  by  Mr  Blair.""  |||    Saying  Britain  must  change  direction,  Mr  Howard  argues  government  is  too  big  and  cannot  continue  ""down  the  path  of  ever  rising  taxes"".  He  promises  to  ensure  frontline  professionals,  parents  and  patients  make  the  key  decisions  rather  than  Whitehall  ""bureaucrats"".  And  he  says  the  Tories  would  get  a  grip  on  crime,  immigration  and  disorder.  ""The  decline  of  responsibility  and  the  proliferation  of  so-called  'human  rights'  have  left  us  in  a  moral  quagmire,  unable  to  get  a  grip  on  rising  crime  and  disorder,""  he  says.  |||    Mr  Howard  says  he  will  produce  a  Timetable  for  Action  so  people  can  hold  him  to  account  but  on  issues  like  taxation  he  has  so  far  only  published  options,  not  specific  plans.  Mr  Howard  told  BBC  News:  ""I'm  determined  to  lower  taxes  but  I'm  also  determined  not  to  make  any  promises  I  can't  keep.""  The  Tories  were  unveiling  material  months  ahead  of  the  expected  election  because  they  needed  time  to  make  voters  aware  of  their  policies,  he  said.  He  was  asked  if  Tory  support  for  the  government  on  Iraq  and  identity  cards  had  given  the  Lib  Dems  the  chance  to  portray  themselves  as  the  opposition  to  Labour.  Mr  Howard  argued  the  only  test  for  his  policies  was  whether  they  were  best  for  Britain.  It  had  nothing  to  do  with  putting  ""clear  blue  water""  between  himself  and  his  opponents.  |||    Labour's  election  slogan  will  be:  ""Britain's  working,  don't  let  the  Tories  wreck  it  again"".  Campaign  coordinator  Alan  Milburn  accused  the  Tories  of  ""launching  Thatcherism  in  instalments""  while  Labour  helped  the  hard  working  majority  of  families.  Lib  Dem  president  Simon  Hughes  said  his  party  had  set  out  its  election  stance  in  September.  ""The  Liberal  Democrats  will  ask  the  British  people  for  support  this  year  as  the  party  with  the  policies  best  able  to  deliver  freedom  and  fairness  and  to  restore  trust,""  he  said."

However,  Judge  Letitia  Clark  said  the  hearing  would  continue  on  Thursday  when  arguments  in  the  case  would  be  heard.  Russian  authorities  are  due  to  auction  off  Yuganskneftegas  on  19  December  to  pay  a  huge  tax  bill  sent  to  Yukos.  |||    Russian  prosecutors  are  forcing  the  sale  of  the  firm's  most  lucrative  asset  Yuganskneftegas  to  help  pay  a  $27bn  (£14bn)  back  tax  bill,  which  they  claim  is  owed  by  Yukos.  |||    Filing  for  bankruptcy  protection  in  the  US  was  ""a  last  resort  to  preserve  the  rights  of  our  shareholders,  employees  and  customers,""  said  Yukos  chief  executive  Steven  Theede.  The  company  added  it  had  opted  to  take  action  through  American  courts  as  US  bankruptcy  law  gives  worldwide  jurisdiction  over  a  debtor  company's  property  and  because  it  was  seeking  a  judiciary  willing  to  protect  the  value  of  shareholders'  investments.  However,  as  the  firm  is  based  in  Russia  and  has  no  significant  US  assets,  lawyers  are  unsure  of  the  outcome  of  the  case.  ""We  are  here  to  stop  60%  of  our  body  from  being  cut  off  on  Sunday,""  Zack  Clement,  a  lawyer  for  Yukos,  told  Judge  Clark  in  an  emergency  hearing  in  Houston,  Texas,  on  Wednesday.  As  well  as  the  bid  to  get  Chapter  11  bankruptcy  -  which  protects  firms  from  creditors,  allowing  them  to  continue  trading  as  they  restructure  their  finances  -  the  group  also  made  a  claim  for  damages  against  the  Russian  government.  Yukos  asked  the  Houston  court  to  order  Russia  to  arbitration  so  that  it  can  press  claims  for  billions  of  dollars  in  damages  over  a  ""campaign  of  illegal,  discriminatory  and  disproportionate""  tax  claims.  Mr  Clement  said  that  under  Russian  law,  the  Russian  government  was  obliged  to  enter  into  arbitration  as  set  out  in  international  law.  |||    He  added  that  the  opening  bid  for  the  firm's  Yuganskneftgas  unit  was  $8bn  -  less  than  half  of  the  $20bn  that  Yukos  advisers  say  it  is  worth.  ""We  believe  the  only  significant  bidder  at  the  auction  on  Sunday  is  Gazprom,""  he  said,  referring  to  Russia's  natural  gas  giant.  Yukos  maintains  that  the  forced  auction  is  illegal  and  ""will  cause  the  company  to  suffer  immediate  and  irreparable  harm.""  Many  commentators  believe  the  Russian  government's  aggressive  pursuit  of  Yukos  is  a  politically-motivated  response  to  the  political  ambitions  of  its  former  chief  executive,  Mikhail  Khodorkovsky.  Mr  Khodorkovsky,  who  had  funded  liberal  opposition  groups,  was  arrested  in  October  last  year  on  fraud  and  tax  evasion  charges  and  is  still  in  jail  Analysts  believe  that  if  its  production  unit  is  auctioned  off,  it  is  likely  to  be  bought  up  by  a  government-backed  firm,  like  Gazprom,  effectively  bringing  a  large  chunk  of  Russia's  lucrative  oil  and  gas  industry  back  under  state  control." 

2	"Howard  unveils  Tory  asylum  plans  |||    Tory  plans  to  cut  immigration  to  the  UK  are  not  racist  and  will  make  the  asylum  system  fairer  for  genuine  refugees,  Michael  Howard  has  said.  |||    As  his  party  set  out  detailed  asylum  reform  plans,  Mr  Howard  said  they  would  help  smash  people  smuggling  gangs.  There  would  be  an  annual  limit  on  asylum  and  all  claims  would  be  processed  overseas.  Some  charities  say  the  plans  would  put  refugees'  lives  at  risk  if  they  were  turned  away  once  quotas  were  filled.  |||    Tony  Blair  said  Labour  would  set  out  workable  plans  for  tackling  immigration  abuse  in  the  next  few  weeks  and  attacked  the  Tory  plans.  ""By  cutting  the  number  of  front-line  immigration  staff  at  our  borders,  they  will  actually  make  the  problem  worse,""  said  Mr  Blair.  Liberal  Democrat  chairman  Matthew  Taylor  said  there  needed  to  be  a  quick,  fair  and  firm  asylum  system.  But  he  said  it  was  ""absolutely  disgusting""  to  propose  a  system  which  could  turn  away  genuine  refugees.  The  Conservatives  say  there  is  little  risk  of  this  happening  as  demand  for  asylum  will  be  considered  when  quotas  are  set.  |||    In  a  speech  in  London  on  Monday,  Mr  Howard  said:  ""It's  not  racist,  as  some  people  to  claim,  to  talk  about  controlling  immigration  far  from  it.""  He  said  that  coming  from  an  immigrant  family  himself  he  recognised  that  ""firm  but  fair""  immigration  controls  were  essential  for  good  community  relations.  |||        -  Withdrawing  from  the  1951  United  Nations  Convention  on  refugees,  which  obliges  countries  to  accept  people  being  persecuted  on  the  basis  of  need,  not  numbers      -  Introduce  laws  to  allow  the  immediate  removal  of  asylum  seekers  whose  claims  were  clearly  unfounded  because  they  came  from  safe  countries  or  had  destroyed  documents      -  Detain  asylum  seekers  without  documents  so  people  whose  identity  was  not  known  were  not  able  to  move  freely  around  the  UK  -  a  worry  for  ""national  security""      -  Stop  considering  asylum  applications  inside  the  UK  and  instead  take  people  from  United  Nations  refugee  agency  camps.  Anyone  applying  for  asylum  would  be  taken  to  new  centres  close  to  their  countries  of  origin.        |||    The  Tories  also  want  quotas  for  those  seeking  work  permits  through  an  Australian-style  points  system  and  those  wanting  to  join  families  in  the  UK.  |||    Mr  Howard  said  nearly  160,000  people  were  settling  in  the  UK  every  year  -  the  size  of  a  city  like  Peterborough.  The  plans  would  help  achieve  a  ""substantial  reduction""  in  immigration,  he  said,  although  he  could  not  predict  a  figure.  He  said  that  only  two  out  of  10  asylum  seekers  had  their  claims  accepted  under  the  current  ""unfair  and  inhumane""  system.  |||    ""We  need  to  break  the  link  between  arriving  in  Britain  and  claiming  asylum,""  Mr  Howard  said.  ""By  breaking  that  link  we  can  smash  the  criminal  gangs  at  the  heart  of  the  trade  in  people  smuggling.""  |||    But  the  UN  refugees  agency  is  worried  the  policy  sends  the  wrong  message  to  poorer  countries  which  receive  the  bulk  of  refugees.  And  a  spokesman  for  European  Justice  and  Home  Affairs  Commissioner  Franco  Frattini  said  the  plans  would  contravene  EU  asylum  policy,  which  meant  the  UK  could  not  simply  refuse  to  hear  an  asylum  case.  Refugee  Council  Chief  Executive  Maeve  Sherlock  called  the  plans  ""dangerous,  ill  thought-out  and  hugely  irresponsible"".  Lives  could  be  put  at  risk  if  refugees  were  turned  away  once  the  quotas  were  filled,  she  warned.  Commission  for  Racial  Equality  chairman  Trevor  Phillips  said  asylum  applications  were  down  40%  and  economic  migration  down  about  10%.  |||    He  did  not  think  Mr  Howard  intended  to  centre  the  debate  about  race.  But  he  warned  that  some  campaigners  could  use  his  words  to  hint  the  policy  was  about  keeping  out  people  of  a  different  colour  or  culture.  Mr  Howard  called  that  suggestion  ""disgraceful""." 

1	"Lee  to  create  new  film  superhero  |||    Comic  book  veteran  Stan  Lee  is  to  team  up  with  producer  Robert  Evans  to  create  a  movie  featuring  a  new  superhero.  |||    Foreverman  will  focus  on  a  character  who  has  to  face  problems  in  everyday  life  as  well  as  using  his  special  powers  to  save  the  world.  Paramount  Pictures,  the  studio  behind  the  film,  have  revealed  few  details  about  the  project  but  say  it  has  the  potential  to  spawn  a  series  of  films.  Lee  is  best  known  for  his  work  on  Spider-Man  and  The  Incredible  Hulk.  |||    He  is  collaborating  on  the  script  with  screenwriter  Peter  Briggs,  who  penned  the  recent  comic  book  adaptation  Hellboy.  ""We  believe  it  to  be  truly  a  whole  new  franchise,""  said  Gill  Champion,  president  and  chief  executive  of  Lee's  POW!  Entertainment.  ""In  this  world  where  people  are  looking  for  something  different,  Stan's  idea  was  to  create  a  concept  not  seen  before  to  become  an  evergreen  franchise  for  Paramount.""  Many  of  Lee's  other  creations,  including  X-Men  and  Daredevil,  have  been  turned  into  films  in  the  past  five  years.

A  third  Spider-Man  film  is  scheduled  for  release  in  2007.  Another  Marvel  Comics  adaptation,  The  Fantastic  Four,  will  be  released  in  cinemas  this  summer." 

1	"Bening  makes  awards  breakthrough  |||    Film  actress  Annette  Bening  is  up  for  an  Oscar  for  her  starring  role  in  the  award-winning  film  Being  Julia.  |||    Bening,  who  was  born  in  Texas  in  1958,  has  gained  prominence  for  a  string  of  key  roles.  Although  an  Oscar  has  so  far  eluded  her,  her  status  as  one  of  Hollywood's  favourite  actresses  remains  solid.  One  of  the  biggest  Oscars  buzzes  in  recent  years  was  for  Bening's  role  as  troubled  Carolyn  Burnham  in  1999's  American  Beauty.  But  her  deliciously  neurotic  portrayal  of  surburban  life  turning  sour  was  overlooked  in  favour  of  Hilary  Swank's  leading  role  in  Boys  Don't  Cry.  After  opening  her  career  in  the  theatre  -  and  gaining  a  Tony  Award  nomination  in  1986  -  Bening  had  a  low-key  spell  in  television.  She  then  made  her  film  debut  as  a  sex-starved  wife  in  1988's  The  Great  Outdoors,  opposite  comics  Dan  Akroyd  and  John  Candy.  |||    Following  a  cameo  in  Postcards  From  The  Edge,  Bening's  breakthrough  role  came  in  1990,  playing  seductive  con  artist  Myra  Langtry  in  The  Grifters  -  a  role  that  won  her  an  Oscar  nomination.  Despite  some  rave  reviews,  Bening  did  not  win  the  best  supporting  actress  Academy  Award.  |||    However  the  high-profile  performance  enabled  Bening  to  capture  roles  in  a  number  of  big  budget  Hollywood  productions,  co-starring  with  some  of  Hollywood's  greatest  players,  including  Robert  De  Niro  and  Harrison  Ford.  But  it  was  her  role  opposite  Warren  Beatty  in  1991  gangster  flick  Bugsy  which  had  the  greatest  impact.  Bening  played  Virginia  Hill,  another  role  which  won  her  high  critical  acclaim,  but  the  film  only  picked  up  two  of  a  staggering  12  Oscar  nominations.  |||    Bugsy  was  the  start  of  a  very  significant  liaison  for  Bening  -  she  married  Beatty,  with  whom  she  had  a  child  as  the  couple  promoted  the  film  in  Europe.  The  couple  now  have  four  children  together.  A  pair  of  contrasting  yet  successful  performances  peppered  Bening's  career  in  the  mid-1990s.  She  played  Michael  Douglas'  opposite  number  in  romantic  comedy  The  American  President,  and  as  a  ""fiery""  Queen  Elizabeth  I  in  a  contemporary  adaptation  of  Shakespeare's  Richard  III.  |||    Bening  was  the  first  choice  to  play  the  female  lead  in  American  Beauty,  director  Sam  Mendes'  film  debut  which  was  a  critical  and  commercial  success  -  but  the  actress  had  to  be  content  with  a  Bafta  award  for  her  strong  performance.  But  current  film  Being  Julia  has  made  Bening  an  award-winning  actress  rather  than  the  perennial  nominee,  with  success  at  the  Golden  Globes.  The  witty  tale  of  revenge  and  love  set  in  1930s  London  sees  the  eponymous  theatrical  diva  -  played  by  Bening  -  grow  tired  of  her  success  and  fall  for  a  young  American  -  and  could  be  the  role  which  finally  wins  her  the  coveted  Academy  Award." 

1	"Redford's  vision  of  Sundance  |||    Despite  sporting  a  corduroy  cap  pulled  low  over  his  face  plus  a  pair  of  dark  glasses,  Robert  Redford  cuts  an  unmistakable  figure  through  the  star-struck  crowds  at  Sundance.  |||    It's  a  rare  downtown  appearance  for  the  man  who  started  the  annual  festival  in  Park  City,  Utah  back  in  the  1980s.  Now  in  its  twenty-first  year,  Sundance  continues  to  grow.  Some  45,000  people  are  estimated  to  have  descended  on  this  small  ski  town  with  nothing  but  movies  on  the  mind.  It's  an  opportunity  to  meet  and  make  deals.  Redford  wanted  Sundance  to  be  a  platform  for  independent  film-makers,  but  the  commercial  success  of  many  showcased  films  have  led  to  criticism  that  the  festival  is  becoming  too  mainstream.  |||    Smaller  festivals  like  Slamdance  and  XDance,  which  take  place  during  the  same  week  in  Park  City,  are  competing  for  Sundance's  limelight.  But  Redford  is  not  worried.  ""The  more  the  merrier,""  he  says.  ""The  point  was  to  create  opportunities  for  people  who  may  not  have  them.  ""Once  independent  film  had  a  place  where  the  work  could  be  seen,  suddenly  the  merchants  came.  With  them  the  celebrities  came,  then  the  paparazzi  -  and  suddenly  it  began  to  take  on  a  whole  new  tone,""  explains  Redford.  |||    ""People  started  to  say  we  had  gone  mainstream  and  Hollywood,  but  actually  Hollywood  came  to  us  because  suddenly  there  was  good  business  in  independent  film,""  he  adds.  International  film-makers  have  always  been  celebrated  here,  but  2005  is  the  first  year  a  dedicated  World  Dramatic  and  Documentary  competition  is  being  held.  |||    Redford  wants  the  festival  to  encompass  viewpoints  he  believes  the  American  media  fails  to  reflect,  particularly  how  the  US  is  perceived  internationally.  He  has  never  hidden  the  fact  that  he  is  a  Democrat.  But  he  reserves  particular  disdain  for  the  current  Republican  administration.  ""It's  the  ability  to  maintain  the  importance  of  dissent  in  a  democratic  system  which  right  now  is  under  threat  with  the  attitude  of  this  administration,""  he  says.  ""I  think  many  voices  are  being  shut  down  or  accused  of  being  unpatriotic  if  they  want  to  express  another  point  of  view.  That's  very  unhealthy  and  very  dangerous.  |||    ""If  we  take  that  policy  into  the  world,  there  will  be  the  same  victims  and  the  same  consequences.""  Sundance  isn't  just  one  big  screening.  There  are  discussion  panels  and  Q&A  sessions  with  directors  tackling  controversial  topics  like  America's  ""culture  wars""  and  the  Iraq  war.  While  Redford  wishes  the  festival  to  be  a  forum  for  dissent,  the  profile  of  the  audience  is  fairly  monolithic.  Educated,  middle  class  and  predominantly  white  Americans  comes  Sundance,  with  views  from  the  same  end  of  the  political  spectrum  -  anti-war  and  socially  liberal.  But  Redford  knows  this  and  started  the  Sundance  TV  Channel  in  an  effort  to  reach  a  wider  audience.  ""When  you  look  at  the  films  here,  what  we  are  presenting  is  very  much  egalitarian.  And  it's  about  good  films  and  good  story-telling  be  it  African  America,  Asian,  women,  gay,  lesbian.  ""Sooner  or  later  we  will  do  away  with  those  stereotypical  labels  and  people  will  say  'it's  just  a  film  by  so-and  so'.""" 

1	"John  Peel  replacement  show  begins  |||    The  permanent  replacement  for  late  DJ  John  Peel's  BBC  Radio  1  show  goes  on  air  on  Tuesday,  with  three  hosts  chosen  to  fill  the  legendary  presenter's  slot.  |||    Rock  DJ  Huw  Stephens  will  go  on  air  in  the  2300  slot  every  Tuesday,  with  black  music  champion  Ras  Kwame  on  Wednesdays  and  dance  DJ  Rob  Da  Bank  on  Thursdays.  Rob  Da  Bank  filled  in  after  Peel  had  a  heart  attack  aged  65  in  October.  All  three  will  play  ""diverse,  unpredictable  and  non-commercial""  songs  under  the  banner  of  the  OneMusic  show.  |||    Radio  1  said  the  station  was  not  trying  to  replace  Peel,  but  would  rise  to  the  ""challenge""  of  ""keeping  his  legacy  alive""  with  unpredictable  music.  The  three  DJs  were  chosen  for  their  ""in-depth  musical  knowledge  across  a  variety  of  musical  genres"",  the  station  said.  |||    Rob  Da  Bank  is  one  of  the  hosts  of  The  Blue  Room,  an  early  morning  weekend  show  which  plays  electronic  and  dance  music.  Huw  Stephens  has  been  one  half  of  the  Thursday  night  show  Bethan  and  Huw  in  Wales,  which  explores  new  music,  especially  up-and-coming  acts  in  Wales.  And  Ras  Kwame  is  host  of  100%  Homegrown  on  Radio  1's  digital  station  1Xtra,  dedicated  to  showcasing  the  best  hip-hop  and  garage.  Another  change  to  the  station  line-up  will  see  Sara  Cox  return  after  maternity  leave.  She  will  host  the  lunchtime  show  on  Saturdays  from  this  week.  |||    Good  luck  to  all  three  of  them,  not  one  DJ  could  fill  Peels  boots  so  it's  probably  a  good  idea  to  get  them  all  contributing.  This  time  next  year  I  hope  we  are  saying  how  well  these  DJs  have  done,  but  I  fear  this  time  next  year  we  will  really  realise  how  much  John  Peel  will  be  forever  missed.  |||    Very  good  idea  to  continue  the  legacy  without  attempting  to  replace  John  Peel.  Also,  there  will  surely  be  a  wider  spectrum  for  international  music  as  three  top  radio  DJs  unite  under  the  One  World  name.  Congratulations!  |||    The  whole  glory  of  John  Peel  was  the  fact  he  was  not  commited  to  one  genre.  He  played  what  he  liked  across  the  range  of  music....  this  is  not  going  to  be  the  same,  and  all  they  seem  to  be  doing  is  what  they  already  have.  Bring  back  Steve  Lamacq.  |||    The  obvious  heir  to  John  Peel  is  the  marvellous,  wonderful  and  talented  Claire  Kember  from  totallyradio.com.  This  lady  is  young  and  fresh  and  is  one  of  the  most  knowledgeable  and  likeable  people  in  British  broadcasting  today.  Everyone  who  listens  to  her  show  understands  and  compares  her  to  the  ledgendary  John  Peel.  BBC  Radio  should  seek  out  the  real  talent  from  internet  radio  stations,  people  who  are  making  a  real  impact  on  the  world  of  music  and  the  world  in  general." 

2	"Teens  'know  little'  of  politics  |||    Teenagers  questioned  for  a  survey  have  shown  little  interest  in  politics  -  and  have  little  knowledge.  |||    Only  a  quarter  of  14-16  year  olds  knew  that  Labour  was  the  government,  the  Tories  were  the  official  Opposition  and  the  Lib  Dems  were  the  third  party.  Almost  all  could  identify  Tony  Blair,  but  only  one  in  six  knew  who  Michael  Howard  was,  and  just  one  in  10  recognised  Charles  Kennedy.  The  ICM  survey  interviewed  110  pupils  for  education  watchdog  Ofsted.  Nearly  half  those  pupils  polled  said  it  was  not  important  for  them  to  know  more  about  what  the  political  parties  stand  for.  And  4%  of  those  questioned  thought  the  Conservatives  were  in  power  -  while  2%  of  them  believed  the  Lib  Dems  were.  The  survey  also  looked  at  issues  of  nationality.  It  found  the  Union  flag  and  fish  and  chips  topped  the  list  of  symbols  and  foods  associated  with  being  British.  Many  of  the  pupils  also  looked  on  themselves  as  English,  Scottish  or  Welsh,  rather  than  British;  while  the  notion  of  being  European  hardly  occurred  to  anyone." 

2	"Child  access  law  shake-up  planned  |||    Parents  who  refuse  to  allow  former  partners  contact  with  their  children  could  be  electronically  tagged  under  plans  being  considered  by  ministers.  |||    Curfews  and  community  service  orders  were  other  options  which  could  be  used  if  court  orders  to  allow  parental  access  were  defied,  Lord  Falconer  said.  The  constitutional  affairs  secretary  outlined  some  of  the  plans  on  Tuesday.  He  denied  fathers'  activists  had  forced  the  changes,  telling  the  BBC  ""there  is  a  recognition  that  something  is  wrong"".  Between  15,000  and  20,000  couples  go  to  court  to  resolve  access  disputes  each  year,  although  in  nine  out  of  10  separations  there  is  no  court  intervention.  |||    Lord  Falconer  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme  he  hoped  voluntary  mediation  could  help  solve  disputes  before  they  reached  court.  But  he  opposed  compulsory  mediation,  saying  that  it  would  lead  to  many  people  taking  part  with  the  wrong  attitude.  Other  plans  include:  |||    -  Parenting  plans  to  give  advice  on  access  arrangements,  based  on  real-life  examples  that  have  worked  in  the  past      -  Extending  in-court  conciliation  -  more  informal  hearings  before  contested  court  cases      -  Better  access  to  legal,  emotional  and  practical  advice  by  telephone  and  internet      -  Legal  aid  changes  to  give  incentives  for  early  resolution  of  disputes.  |||    Judges  can  already  jail  parents  who  breach  contact  orders  but  that  was  a  ""nuclear  option""  which  was  rarely  used  as  it  was  not  seen  as  being  in  the  child's  interests,  a  spokesman  said.  The  aim  of  the  new  legislation  was  to  provide  a  ""medium  range""  of  penalties,  such  as  fines,  community  service  orders,  compulsory  anger  management  or  parenting  classes  or  curfews.  |||    Failure  to  comply  with  these  measures  could  result  in  offenders  being  electronically  tagged.  On  the  possibility  of  tagging  uncooperative  parents,  Lord  Falconer  said:  ""Tagging  may  be  going  too  far,  but  let's  have  a  debate  about  that.""  Full  details  of  the  new  powers  will  not  be  revealed  until  a  bill  is  published  ""in  the  next  two  weeks,""  a  spokesman  said.  |||    The  government's  proposals  have  met  with  disapproval  from  fathers'  rights  groups.  John  Ison,  from  the  controversial  group  Fathers  4  Justice,  said:  ""It  is  very  disappointing.  What  we  have  got  is  a  cynical  case  of  recycling  existing  legislation.""  Jim  Parton,  from  Families  Need  Fathers,  said  the  new  proposals  ""lacked  compulsion"".  |||    ""We  would  like  to  see  couples  develop  a  plan  and  then  have  it  as  a  source  of  a  court  order  -  then  you  know  where  you  stand,  you  know  what  the  minimum  access  is.  ""Otherwise,  you  see  people  make  agreements  which  then  fall  apart.""  Mr  Parton  said  he  had  been  told  by  Children's  Minister  Margaret  Hodge  there  was  not  enough  time  to  pass  the  bill  through  parliament  before  the  general  election,  which  is  likely  to  take  place  in  May.  |||    The  Conservatives  have  called  for  an  equal  split  between  parents  on  access  to  be  made  law.  Theresa  May,  shadow  secretary  for  the  family,  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme  that  the  government's  plans  were  ""inadequate""  and  were  ""papering  over  the  cracks  of  the  current  system"".  She  said  a  Conservative  government  would  bring  a  ""radical  reform""  of  the  family  courts,  as  well  as  enforcing  a  ""legal  presumption  of  co-parenting  and  compulsory  mediation"".  ""We  want  to  make  courts  the  last  resort,  rather  than  the  first  resort,""  she  added.  The  government  says  children  cannot  simply  be  divided  up  ""like  property""  when  a  marriage  collapses.  The  Liberal  Democrats  have  argued  for  flexibility  in  deciding  access  rules,  rather  than  having  ""rigid  targets""." 

1	"Sundance  to  honour  foreign  films  |||    International  films  will  be  given  the  same  prominence  as  US  films  at  next  year's  Sundance  Film  Festival,  with  movies  dominated  by  the  theme  of  war.  |||    The  independent  film  festival  will  feature  two  new  international  cinema  competitions,  during  its  20-30  January  season  in  Utah.  Forty-two  films  will  debut  at  Sundance,  including  The  Liberace  of  Baghdad  by  British  director  Sean  McAllister.  The  prestigious  festival  was  founded  by  actor  Robert  Redford  in  1981.  |||    ""We  have  always  had  an  international  component,  but  from  next  year  they  will  enter  a  jury  competition,""  festival  director  Geoffrey  Gilmore  said.  ""We  wanted  to  give  world  cinema  more  emphasis  and  have  now  put  it  on  par  with  the  American  dramatic  and  documentary  competitions.""  Twelve  films  competing  in  the  new  world  cinema  documentary  category  focus  on  countries  and  people  under  siege.  |||    The  Liberace  of  Baghdad  features  an  Iraqi  pianist  hiding  in  a  hotel  as  he  waits  for  a  visa,  while  Finnish  film  The  Three  Rooms  of  Melancholia  looks  at  the  war  in  Chechnya.  Shake  Hands  With  The  Devil:  The  Journey  of  Romeo  Dallaire  tells  of  a  UN  mission  to  Rwanda  during  the  1994  genocide,  while  French-Israeli  production  Wall  looks  at  Israel's  controversial  security  wall  separating  it  from  the  Palestinian  territories.  The  16  films  competing  in  the  new  world  cinema  dramatic  category  include  works  from  Germany,  South  Korea,  Angola,  China,  Denmark  and  Australia.  |||    Several  Hollywood  stars  feature  in  the  festival's  American  independent  drama  category,  including  Keanu  Reeves  and  Benjamin  Bratt.  Vince  Vaughn  stars  in  quirky  movie  Thumbsucker  while  21  Grams  actress  Naomi  Watts  plays  a  budding  Hollywood  actress  in  Ellie  Parker.  The  top  Grand  Jury  prize  at  this  year's  festival  went  to  low  budget  sci-fi  thriller  Primer,  written  and  directed  by  Shane  Carruth.  Morgan  Spurlock  earned  the  directing  award  for  Super  Size  Me,  which  became  an  international  box  office  hit." 

1	"Kidman  wins  photographer  battle  |||    Actress  Nicole  Kidman  has  won  a  restraining  order  against  two  paparazzi  photographers  who  she  claims  left  her  fearful  of  leaving  her  Sydney  mansion.  |||    The  Oscar-winning  star  took  action  against  Jamie  Fawcett  and  Ben  McDonald  after  a  bugging  device  was  found  outside  her  home  earlier  this  week.  Lawyers  for  the  pair  denied  allegations  they  had  planted  the  device.  The  Australian  actress  is  currently  in  Sydney  to  film  her  latest  movie,  Eucalyptus,  with  Russell  Crowe.  Kidman  was  prompted  to  take  action  following  a  reported  high-speed  car  chase  with  members  of  the  paparazzi  in  Sydney  last  weekend.  |||    According  to  local  newspaper  the  Daily  Telegraph,  the  incident  involved  paparazzi  driving  through  red  lights  and  on  the  wrong  side  of  the  road  in  pursuit  of  Kidman's  vehicle.  Lawyers  for  Mr  Fawcett  and  Mr  McDonald  denied  that  the  pair  were  involved  in  the  chase.  Kidman  sought  the  ""apprehended  violence""  orders  -  normally  used  in  Australia  in  cases  of  domestic  violence  and  similar  incidents  -  after  being  advised  to  do  so  by  local  police.  ""Nicole  would  like  to  make  it  clear  that  she  acknowledges  she  is  a  public  figure  and  that  reporters  and  photographers  have  a  job  to  do  and  she  respects  that,""  said  Kidman's  publicist  Wendy  Day.  ""However,  these  are  specific  actions  against  two  individuals  who,  over  a  period  of  time,  have  caused  her  to  feel  threatened,  intimidated  and  unable  to  leave  her  home  without  fearing  for  her  safety.""  Magistrate  Lee  Gilmore,  who  issued  the  restraining  order  at  Waverley  Local  Court  in  Sydney,  said  she  understood  the  photographers  were  entitled  to  earn  a  living  but  there  had  to  be  limits  to  their  behaviour.  ""Miss  Kidman  says  she's  willing  to  put  up  with  some  of  it,  but  it's  gone  beyond  that,""  she  said.  ""I  do  believe  the  allegation  in  relation  to  the  driving  is  a  serious  issue.""" 

2	"Labour  MPs'  fears  over  squabbling  |||    If  there  is  one  thing  certain  to  stiffen  the  spines  of  Labour  MPs  it  is  the  prospect  of  losing  their  seats  at  a  general  election.  |||    And  it  was  largely  that  fear  that  led  to  Tony  Blair  and  Gordon  Brown  being  read  the  riot  act  during  a  meeting  of  the  parliamentary  Labour  party.  The  views  expressed  by  both  backbenchers  and  Labour  peers  over  the  claimed  squabbling  between  the  two  men  starkly  demonstrated  the  widely-held  view  within  the  Labour  party  that  the  two  most  powerful  figures  in  the  government  are  jeopardising  the  next  election.  As  one  hugely-disgruntled  backbencher  said  before  the  meeting:  ""It  is  time  they  realised  it's  not  just  my  seat  they  are  threatening  but  if  they  go  on  like  this  they  could  put  the  election  in  doubt.""  It  is  a  sentiment  that  is  now  running  throughout  the  Labour  benches  with  MPs  eager  to  underline  the  message  to  their  leaders  to  stop  the  squabbling  and  get  on  with  the  job  at  hand.  |||    As  Paul  Flynn  said:  ""What  has  deeply  upset  the  party  is  in  this  time  of  all  times,  when  we  wanted  to  come  together,  we  wanted  to  lead  on  the  global  issues,  to  change  politics  for  the  next  decade,  the  whole  thing  was  wrecked  by  a  piece  of  childishness  by  the  two  main  people  in  the  party,  two  people  we  greatly  respect.""  |||    Stephen  Pound  echoed  the  message,  saying:  ""We  know  that  the  one  thing  that  could  entirely  jeopardise  what  we  are  trying  to  achieve,  not  for  the  Labour  Party  but  for  this  country,  is  the  appearance  of  division.  We  remember  the  1980s"".  They  backed  the  suggestion  that  unless  the  squabbling  stopped,  the  people  briefing  on  behalf  of  the  two  men  would  be  ""named  and  shamed"".  The  dressing  down  appears  to  have  done  the  trick,  with  Mr  Brown  joining  his  alleged  rival  Alan  Milburn  -  who  the  prime  minister  put  in  charge  of  election  planning  in  Mr  Brown's  stead  -  and  Deputy  Prime  Minister  John  Prescott  at  an  election  poster  launch.  But  the  effect  of  all  this  is  to  have  achieved  two  things.  Firstly,  nobody  is  attempting  to  suggest  any  more  that  the  stories  of  the  rift  between  the  chancellor  and  the  prime  minister  are  fictions  created  by  the  media  and  authors.  Even  Mr  Prescott  admitted  that,  had  he  still  been  a  backbencher,  he  would  have  been  giving  Mr  Blair  and  Mr  Brown  the  same  message.  |||    Secondly  it  has  also  underlined  the  view  that  the  election  campaign  has,  to  all  intents  and  purposes,  kicked  off.  But  whether  the  telling  off  and  the  subsequent  change  in  behaviour  by  the  two  men  will  do  any  good  -  or  can  even  be  sustained  through  the  campaign  -  remains  to  be  seen.  |||    Even  as  the  MPs  were  expressing  their  fears  it  emerged  that,  while  Mr  Brown  is  in  Africa  for  a  week,  the  prime  minister  is  to  deliver  a  keynote  speech  on  election  themes  for  a  third  term.  And  he  is  expected  to  repeat  his  recent  insistence  that  the  next  manifesto  will  be  ""New""  Labour  through  and  through.  Similarly,  some  were  pointing  out  that  the  chancellor,  during  the  election  poster  launch,  once  again  refused  to  deny  the  claim  that  he  told  the  prime  minister  he  could  never  trust  anything  he  said.  None  the  less,  what  some  believe  now  is  that  the  effect  of  the  warnings  from  the  backbenchers  will  actually  be  to  silence  the  Brown  camp,  effectively  strengthening  the  prime  minister's  hand.  For  example,  will  those  Brownite  briefers  suggest  their  man  is  unhappy  at  the  prime  minister's  timing  or  subject  matter,  as  may  have  been  the  case  in  the  past?  What  all  seem  agreed  on,  however,  is  that  this  sniping  simply  cannot  be  allowed  to  go  on  through  the  election  campaign.  Mind  you,  we  have  heard  similar  pledges  before." 

2	"Concerns  at  school  diploma  plan  |||    Final  appeals  are  being  made  for  the  government  not  to  ditch  the  reform  plan  for  England's  secondary  schools  put  forward  by  the  Tomlinson  report.  |||    The  government's  response  to  the  plan  for  a  four-tier  diploma  to  replace  all  existing  14-19  qualifications  is  expected  next  week.  Some  are  worried  it  could  be  scuppered  if,  as  Tony  Blair  and  Ruth  Kelly  have  suggested,  GCSEs  and  A-levels  stay.  Sir  Mike  Tomlinson  himself  was  briefed  only  this  week.  He  is  said  to  be  feeling  more  comfortable  about  what  the  government  is  likely  to  say  than  if  he  had  read  only  what  was  in  newspapers  in  the  earlier  part  of  the  week.  But  the  government  was  said  to  be  still  rewriting  its  response  on  Friday.  ""It  will  be  a  tragedy  if  the  government  comes  through  with  a  half-hearted  response,""  said  the  chairman  of  the  Commons  education  select  committee,  Labour  MP  Barry  Sheerman.  |||    His  main  concern  was  the  reports  that  there  would  be  a  diploma  -  but  only  to  replace  existing  vocational  qualifications.  ""We  must  tackle  head-on  the  structural  mess  that  is  our  secondary  education  system,""  he  wrote  in  the  Times  Educational  Supplement.  ""It  is  not  the  case  that  the  academic  stream  in  secondary  is  fine  while  the  vocational  route  is  desperately  weak.""  The  Qualifications  and  Curriculum  Authority  (QCA)  has  also  told  the  government  not  to  ""compromise"".  The  QCA  said  the  potential  ""step-change  in  participation  and  attainment""  lay  in  the  integrity  of  the  whole  diploma.  ""Any  partial  implementation  of  the  proposals  would,  in  our  view,  compromise  that  integrity,""  said  its  chairman,  Sir  Anthony  Greener.  It  is  a  sign  of  the  QCA's  concern  that  its  advice  went  to  ministers  last  December  but  was  publicised  only  recently.  But  people  understand  that  a  White  Paper  response  is  government  policy  and  has  to  command  wider  ministerial  support  than  if  it  were  coming  only  from  the  Department  for  Education  and  Skills.  They  may  be  content  if  it  does  not  ""close  too  many  doors""  in  writing  -  whatever  spin  is  put  on  it.  |||    The  chief  inspector  of  schools,  David  Bell,  also  said  recently  that  GCSEs  and  A-levels  should  go.  ""One  of  the  reasons  why  I'm  so  strongly  in  favour  of  these  terms  disappearing  over  time  is  that  it's  good  for  the  symbols  of  change  to  be  seen  right  across  the  system,""  he  said.  ""If  we  don't  say  this  is  a  sea-change  in  education,  we  will  miss  a  great  opportunity.""  Universities  and  head  teachers  in  both  the  independent  and  state  sectors  have  also  backed  the  Tomlinson  proposals,  which  include  having  higher  grades  at  advanced  level  to  differentiate  between  the  brightest  students.  A  note  of  concern  has  been  expressed  repeatedly  by  the  employers'  organisation,  the  CBI,  which  complains  of  a  lack  of  skills.  In  an  attempt  to  address  this,  the  Tomlinson  plan  is  for  tests  in  ""functional""  maths  and  literacy  -  decidedly  not  GCSEs.  It  has  been  suggested  the  government  will  take  steps  of  some  sort  to  meet  firms'  concerns  on  this  score.  Another  dissenter  is  Sir  Mike  Tomlinson's  predecessor  as  chief  schools  inspector,  Professor  Chris  Woodhead,  who  has  said  there  is  no  need  for  such  a  ""massive  upheaval"".  The  Conservative  Party  has  put  forward  plans  to  revert  to  a  system  of  having  only  the  brightest  percentage  of  students  each  year  getting  the  top  A-level  grade,  no  matter  how  well  the  others  have  done." 

1	"Spider-Man  creator  wins  profits  |||    Spider-Man  creator  Stan  Lee  is  to  get  a  multi-million  dollar  windfall  after  winning  a  court  battle  with  comic  book  company  Marvel.  |||    A  judge  has  upheld  Lee's  demand  for  10%  of  Marvel's  profits  from  the  hugely  successful  Spider-Man  films.  Spider-Man  and  its  sequel  made  $1.6bn  (£857m)  at  box  offices  worldwide.  Of  the  cut  now  due  to  Lee,  82,  who  created  Spider-Man  in  1962,  his  lawyer  said:  ""It  could  be  tens  of  millions  of  dollars,  that's  no  exaggeration.""  US  District  Court  Judge  Robert  W  Sweet  ruled  Lee  should  get  a  tenth  of  profits  generated  since  November  1998  by  Marvel  TV  and  movie  productions  involving  the  company's  characters.  Lee  took  legal  action  in  2002,  saying  Marvel  shut  him  out  of  ""jackpot""  profits  from  the  first  blockbuster  film.  |||    He  said  the  company  -  where  he  worked  for  more  than  60  years  -  had  gone  back  on  agreement  to  give  him  the  10%.  As  well  as  Spider-Man,  Lee  co-created  the  Incredible  Hulk,  X-Men,  Daredevil  and  Fantastic  Four  characters.  He  said:  ""I  am  gratified  by  the  judge's  decision  although,  since  I  am  deeply  fond  of  Marvel  and  the  people  there,  I  sincerely  regret  that  the  situation  had  to  come  to  this.""  The  ruling  also  means  he  is  entitled  to  a  slice  of  profits  from  DVD  sales  and  certain  merchandise.  Marvel  said  it  would  appeal  and  did  not  expect  the  decision  to  impact  on  financial  forecasts  for  2004  and  beyond.  The  New  York  court  did  not  rule  on  Lee's  claims  to  a  share  of  profits  from  some  Spider-Man  and  Hulk  movie  merchandise,  which  will  be  decided  at  a  future  trial,  Marvel  said." 

3	"Souness  delight  at  Euro  progress  |||    Boss  Graeme  Souness  felt  Newcastle  were  never  really  in  danger  of  going  out  of  the  Uefa  Cup  against  Heerenveen.  |||    An  early  own  goal  followed  by  an  Alan  Shearer  strike  earned  them  a  2-1  win  and  a  place  in  the  Uefa  Cup  last  16.  ""Obviously  with  winning  in  the  first  leg  it  gave  us  a  great  advantage,""  he  said  after  the  4-2  aggregate  victory.  ""We  got  our  goals  early  and  in  the  minds  of  some  players  the  job  was  done  but  then  they  got  a  goal  and  perhaps  made  us  a  bit  nervous.""  Shearer's  goal  moved  him  within  12  of  Jackie  Milburn's  club  scoring  record  of  200  for  the  Magpies.  But  Souness  said  he  did  not  think  beating  the  record  would  have  any  bearing  on  his  decision  to  retire  at  the  end  of  the  season.  ""I  think  if  he  got  it  this  year  he  would  want  to  stay  next  year  anyway,""  he  added.  |||    ""He  struck  the  ball  very  well  -  he  always  has  done  -  and  I  think  it  was  the  power  and  pace  that  beat  the  goalkeeper.""  Souness  also  paid  tribute  to  Laurent  Robert,  who  was  at  the  heart  of  much  of  United's  attacking  play.  ""In  the  first  half  he  did  really  well  and  did  everything  you  want  from  a  wide  player.  More  of  the  same  in  future  please,""  he  said." 

2	"Top  Tories  on  Lib  Dem  'hit  list'  |||    The  Liberal  Democrats  are  aiming  to  unseat  a  string  of  top  Tories  -  including  leader  Michael  Howard  -  at  the  next  general  election.  |||    Mr  Howard's  seat  is  at  the  top  of  the  Liberal  Democrats'  list.  Others  targeted  include  Oliver  Letwin,  David  Davis  and  Theresa  May,  Lib  Dem's  elections  chief  Lord  Rennard  said.  He  said  it  was  ""nothing  personal""  but  that  ""very  many  of  the  prominent  Conservatives""  had  slender  leads  in  seats  where  the  Lib  Dems  were  second.  |||    In  2001,  Michael  Howard  won  the  Folkestone  &  Hythe  seat  with  20,645  votes,  compared  to  14,738  for  the  Liberal  Democrat  candidate  Peter  Carroll,  giving  the  Tory  leader  a  majority  of  5,907.  Asked  if  this  amounted  to  the  party's  much  vaunted  ""decapitation  strategy""  Lord  Rennard  said  it  was  not  a  term  he  had  ever  used.  But  he  urged  Labour  supporters  to  vote  tactically  to  remove  prominent  Conservatives.  ""I  just  don't  think  Labour  voters  in  these  sort  of  seats  could  resist  the  temptation  to  use  their  votes  effectively  to  remove  a  Conservative.""  He  denied  this  strategy  was  opportunism,  insisting  the  Lib  Dem's  policies  on  issues  such  as  tuition  fees,  the  council  tax  and  free  care  for  the  elderly  appealed  ""to  all  sides  of  the  political  spectrum"".  ""We  are  in  favour  of  tactical  voting  as  long  as  the  tactic  is  to  vote  Liberal  Democrat,""  he  added.  A  Conservative  spokesperson  said:  ""The  Liberal  Democrats  can  talk  all  they  like  about  strategy.  The  problem  the  Liberal  Democrats  face  is  that  a  large  number  of  Lib  Dem  voters  do  not  agree  with  their  policies.  ""We  will  be  pointing  out  how  they  are  soft  on  crime,  how  they  support  higher  taxes,  their  opposition  to  controlled  immigration  and  support  for  giving  Europe  more  control  over  our  lives""." 

2	"Blair  dismisses  quit  claim  report  |||    Tony  Blair  has  dismissed  reports  he  told  Gordon  Brown  he  would  quit  before  the  next  general  election.  |||    ""You  don't  do  deals  over  jobs  like  this,""  the  prime  minister  told  BBC  One's  Breakfast  with  Frost  programme.  According  to  a  new  book,  Brown's  Britain,  Mr  Blair  went  back  on  a  pledge  to  make  way  for  Mr  Brown  after  Cabinet  allies  intervened  in  June  2004.  Mr  Blair  said  the  claims  were  ""reheated  from  six  months  ago""  and  that  he  was  concentrating  on  running  the  country.  Mr  Blair  said:  ""I've  dealt  with  this  six  months  ago.  I  said  then  you  don't  do  deals  over  jobs  like  this  -  you  don't.  |||    ""What  both  of  us  are  actually  concentrating  on  are  the  issues  that  concern  the  country.""  The  book,  by  Sunday  Telegraph  journalist  Robert  Peston  and  serialised  in  the  newspaper,  said  the  pair  had  ""mutual  animosity  and  contempt""  for  each  other.  |||    It  claims  Tony  Blair  felt  by  November  2003  he  had  lost  voters'  trust  because  of  the  Iraq  war  and  that  he  was  no  longer  an  asset  to  the  Labour  Party.  And  that  at  a  dinner  hosted  by  Deputy  Prime  Minister  John  Prescott  he  told  Mr  Brown  of  his  intention  to  stand  down.  According  to  Mr  Peston  the  prime  minister  said:  ""Help  me  to  get  through  the  year  and  I  will  then  stand  down.""  But  he  then  changed  his  mind  in  June  2004,  following  intervention  from  allies  in  the  Cabinet  and  the  suspicion  that  the  chancellor  was  deliberately  manoeuvring  against  him,  according  to  the  book.  |||    Mr  Peston  told  BBC  News:  ""My  understanding  is  that  they  are  not  nearly  as  close  or  as  friendly  as  they  once  were.  ""What  the  book  says  is  there  is  now  a  pretty  profound  mutual  mistrust,  mutual  animosity.  ""I  think  in  public  you  see  this  double-act  pretending  everything  is  alright,  but  in  private  I  don't  think  the  relationship  is  good  because  Brown,  understandably,  feels  deeply  betrayed  -  particularly  over  this  issue  of  the  leadership.""  But,  in  a  wide-ranging  BBC  interview  covering  issues  such  as  the  Asian  tsunami  disaster,  the  Middle  East  peace  process  and  Northern  Ireland,  Mr  Blair  said:  ""When  you  get  to  the  top  in  politics  you  get  this  huge  swell  around  you.  ""All  sorts  of  people  make  all  sorts  of  claims  and  counter-claims.""  He  admitted  to  a  ""sense  of  frustration""  about  the  allegations  which  he  said  had  been  made  ""countless  times"".  |||    There  has  been  fresh  speculation  of  a  rift  recently,  following  their  separate  responses  to  the  Asian  tsunami.  These  rumours  were  fuelled  by  Mr  Blair's  decision  to  hold  his  monthly  media  conference  at  the  same  time  as  a  long-planned  speech  by  Mr  Brown  on  UK  plans  to  tackle  global  poverty  with  a  new  ""Marshall  Plan""  for  Africa.  There  was  speculation  the  pair  were  trying  to  outdo  each  other's  response  to  the  disaster.  But  the  prime  minister  said  he  had  discussed  these  claims  with  the  chancellor  and  dismissed  them  as  a  ""load  of  nonsense"".  Former  welfare  minister  Frank  Field  MP  said  the  prime  minister  should  sack  Mr  Brown,  but  did  not  believe  Mr  Blair  was  strong  enough  to  do  so.  |||    Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  accused  the  prime  minister  and  Mr  Brown  of  ""squabbling  like  schoolboys"".  He  told  Sky  News'  Sunday  with  Adam  Boulton:  ""This  is  the  politics  of  the  playground  and  Britain  really  does  deserve  better.""  The  Liberal  Democrat  parliamentary  chairman  Matthew  Taylor  said  the  personal  ambition  of  Mr  Blair  and  Mr  Brown  was  ""getting  in  the  way  of  good  government"".  ""Either  they  need  to  grow  up  and  put  their  squabbles  to  one  side  or  they  cannot  expect  the  electorate  to  support  a  divided  government  at  the  next  election.""  During  the  interview  Mr  Blair  also  said  the  former  home  secretary  David  Blunkett  would  play  a  ""big  role""  at  the  general  election."

Declines  in  the  dollar  have  also  contributed  to  the  rising  oil  price.  US  crude  was  trading  at  $51.39  at  0710  GMT  in  Asian  electronic  trade  on  Wednesday.  A  barrel  of  US  crude  oil  closed  up  $2.80  at  $51.15  in  New  York  on  Tuesday.  Opec  members  said  on  Tuesday  that,  given  such  high  prices,  the  cartel  saw  no  reason  to  cut  its  output.  |||    Although  below  last  year's  peak  of  $55.67  a  barrel,  which  was  reached  in  October,  prices  are  now  well  above  2004's  average  of  $41.48.  Brent  crude  also  rose  in  London  trading,  adding  $1.89  to  $48.62  at  the  close.  |||    Much  of  western  Europe  and  the  north  east  of  America  has  been  shivering  under  unseasonably  low  temperatures  in  recent  days.  The  decline  in  the  US  dollar  to  a  five-week  low  against  the  euro  has  also  served  to  inflate  prices.  ""The  primary  factor  is  the  weak  dollar,""  said  Victor  Shum,  a  Singapore-based  analyst  with  Purvin  and  Gertz.  Expectations  that  a  rebound  in  the  dollar  would  halt  the  oil  price  rise  were  not  immediately  borne  out  on  Wednesday  morning,  as  oil  prices  carried  on  upwards  as  the  dollar  strengthened  against  the  euro,  the  pound  and  the  yen.  |||    Several  Opec  members  said  on  Tuesday  that  a  cut  in  production  was  unlikely,  citing  rising  prices  and  strong  demand  for  oil  from  Asia.  ""I  agree  that  we  do  not  need  to  cut  supply  if  the  prices  are  as  much  as  this,""  Fathi  Bin  Shatwan,  Libya's  oil  minister,  told  Reuters.  ""I  do  not  think  we  need  to  cut  unless  the  prices  are  falling  below  $35  a  barrel,""  he  added." 

2	"Clarke  faces  ID  cards  rebellion  |||    Charles  Clarke  faces  his  first  real  test  as  home  secretary  on  Monday  with  a  possible  backbench  rebellion  over  the  controversial  ID  cards  bill.  |||    Up  to  30  Labour  MPs  could  oppose  the  scheme  during  a  Commons  debate.  Mr  Clarke,  who  took  on  the  post  on  Thursday  after  David  Blunkett  quit,  has  rejected  calls  to  ""pause""  on  the  bill.  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  also  faces  a  possible  rebellion  after  deciding  to  back  identity  cards.  The  Liberal  Democrats  oppose  the  plans.  |||    Mr  Clarke,  writing  in  The  Times,  accused  some  critics  of  ""liberal  woolly  thinking  and  spreading  false  fears""  by  claiming  ID  cards  would  erode  civil  liberties.  He  writes  that  it  is  actually  a  ""profoundly  civil  libertarian  measure  because  it  promotes  the  most  fundamental  civil  liberty  in  our  society  -  which  is  the  right  to  live  free  from  fear  crime  and  fear"".  Mr  Clarke  is  expected  to  try  and  win  over  opponents  to  the  scheme  by  saying  officials  who  secretly  accessed  information  they  were  not  allowed  to  see  would  face  up  to  two  years  in  jail.  He  is  also  expected  to  cut  the  £85  cost  of  the  card  and  passport,  for  the  elderly  and  those  on  lower  incomes.  |||    Mr  Howard  last  week  said  his  front  bench  team  had  reached  a  ""collective  view""  to  back  ID  cards  after  holding  a  ""good  discussion"",  but  admitted  it  was  ""not  an  easy  issue"".  He  had  decided  to  support  the  plans  as  the  police  said  they  would  help  fight  terror,  crime  and  illegal  immigration.  But  former  shadow  attorney  general  Bill  Cash  said  there  was  still  ""very  deep""  disquiet  about  the  plan  among  senior  Tories.  He  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  the  government  was  ""intensely  authoritarian""  and  was  creating  ""increasingly  a  Big  Brother  society"".  Critics  argue  that  introducing  the  cards  would  be  a  costly  scheme  with  no  specific  aim.  |||    Ministers  say  it  would  help  the  fight  against  terrorism,  illegal  immigration  and  organised  crime.  But  opponents  say  that  similar  schemes  in  other  countries  have  not  prevented  attacks  like  the  Madrid  rail  bombing.  On  Sunday,  Lib  Dem  leader  Charles  Kennedy  repeated  his  call  for  a  ""pause""  in  considering  the  legislation.  |||    He  told  BBC's  Breakfast  with  Frost  programme  that  Mr  Clarke  had  a  ""real  opportunity""  on  Monday  following  the  departure  of  Mr  Blunkett.  ""If  you  were  running  a  family  or  a  business  would  you  have  the  second  reading  of  the  Identity  Cards  Bill  tomorrow  or  would  you  pause  to  reflect  and  see  what  you  might  do  about  it  in  the  New  Year?  ""That  is  the  sensible  way  to  go  about  it  but  I  think  this  government  has  got  itself  so  much  into  tram  lines  now  that  it  is  not  behaving  sensibly  at  all.""  The  first  cards  would  be  issued  in  2008  and,  when  he  was  introducing  the  bill,  Mr  Blunkett  suggested  Parliament  could  decide  in  2011  or  2012  whether  to  make  it  compulsory  for  everybody  to  own  the  cards,  although  not  to  carry  them.  The  new  bill  would  also  create  new  criminal  offences  on  the  possession  of  false  identity  documents." 

0	"Quake's  economic  costs  emerging  |||    Asian  governments  and  international  agencies  are  reeling  at  the  potential  economic  devastation  left  by  the  Asian  tsunami  and  floods.  |||    World  Bank  president  James  Wolfensohn  has  said  his  agency  is  ""only  beginning  to  grasp  the  magnitude  of  the  disaster""  and  its  economic  impact.  The  tragedy  has  left  at  least  25,000  people  dead,  with  Sri  Lanka,  Thailand,  India  and  Indonesia  worst  hit.  Some  early  estimates  of  reconstruction  costs  are  starting  to  emerge.  Millions  have  been  left  homeless,  while  businesses  and  infrastructure  have  been  washed  away.  |||    Economists  believe  several  of  the  10  countries  hit  by  the  giant  waves  could  see  a  slowdown  in  growth.  |||    In  Sri  Lanka,  some  observers  have  said  that  as  much  as  1%  of  annual  growth  may  be  lost.  For  Thailand,  that  figure  is  much  lower  at  0.1%.  Governments  are  expected  to  take  steps,  such  as  cutting  taxes  and  increasing  spending,  to  facilitate  a  recovery.  |||    ""With  the  enormous  displacement  of  people...there  will  be  a  serious  relaxation  of  fiscal  policy,""  Glenn  Maguire,  chief  economist  for  the  region  at  Societe  Generale,  told  Agence  France  Presse.  ""The  economic  impact  of  it  will  certainly  be  large,  but  it  should  not  be  enough  to  derail  the  momentum  of  the  region  in  2005,""  he  said.  ""First  and  foremost  this  is  a  human  tragedy.""  India's  economy,  however,  is  less  likely  to  slow  because  the  areas  hit  are  some  of  the  least  developed.  The  regional  giant  has  enjoyed  strong  growth  in  2004.  But  India  now  faces  other  problems,  with  aid  workers  under  pressure  to  ensure  a  clean  supply  of  water  and  sanitation  to  prevent  an  outbreak  of  disease.  |||    Thailand's  Prime  Minister  Thaksin  Shinawatra  has  estimated  the  destruction  at  20bn  baht  ($510m).  Analysts  said  that  figure  is  likely  to  rise  and  the  country's  tourist  industry  is  likely  to  be  hardest  hit.  Thailand's  fishing  and  real  estate  sectors  also  will  be  affected  by  Sunday's  9.0  magnitude  earthquake,  which  sent  huge  waves  from  Malaysia  to  Africa.  Malaysia  said  as  many  as  1,000  fishermen  will  be  affected  and  that  damage  to  the  industry  will  be  ""significant"",  Agence  France  Presse  reported.  Rapid  rebuilding  will  be  key  to  limiting  the  impact  of  the  tragedy.  ""In  three  months,  we  should  rebuild  70%  of  the  damage  in  the  three  worst  hit  provinces,""  said  Juthamas  Siriwan,  governor  of  the  Tourism  Authority  of  Thailand.  The  outlook  for  Sri  Lanka  is  less  optimistic,  with  analysts  predicting  that  the  country's  tourist  industry  will  struggle  to  recovery  quickly.  Tourism  is  a  vital  to  many  developing  countries,  providing  jobs  for  19  million  people  in  the  south  east  Asian  region,  according  to  the  World  Travel  and  Tourism  Council  (WTTC)." 

1	"Music  man  to  the  Oscars  |||    Bill  Conti's  job  of  musical  director  of  the  Oscars  show  is  not  for  the  faint-hearted  since  conducting  the  orchestra  is  the  ultimate  plate-spinning  assignment.  |||    This  year  marks  Conti's  17th  turn  at  the  helm  of  the  Academy  Awards  orchestra.  ""The  excitement  is  a  live  performance  as  a  musician,""  he  says.  ""All  of  your  colleagues,  everyone  in  the  film  industry  is  in  the  theatre.  All  the  important  people.  ""I  guess  it's  just  a  television  show  but  we  always  think  it's  a  bit  more.'  The  orchestra  strikes  up  more  than  110  times  during  the  average  Oscars  show.  As  well  as  playing  the  presenters  and  winners  on  and  off  stage,  it  also  performs  during  the  commercial  breaks  to  entertain  the  live  audience  in  the  house.  |||    ""It's  a  very  busy  evening,  it  takes  a  certain  amount  of  preparation  of  music,  orchestrating,  sketching  rehearsing,  before  the  show.  But  you  don't  know  what  the  unexpected  will  be  and  as  the  musical  director,  it's  exciting,""  explains  Conti.  And  much  of  the  preparation  goes  into  mastering  scores  that  will  never  be  performed.  ""We  don't  know  who  the  winners  will  be.  So  when  they  say,  'the  winner  is',  we  have  five  different  pieces  of  music  in  front  of  us,  they  say  the  name,  we  play  the  appropriate  one  immediately,""  adds  Conti.  |||    The  orchestra  is  often  called  upon  to  play  when  the  winners  ramble  on  too  long  during  their  acceptance  speeches,  despite  being  told  to  be  brief  by  the  show's  producers.  |||    The  decision  to  drown  out  or  'kill'  the  offending  star  with  music  is  relayed  from  the  director's  box  to  the  orchestra  via  Conti's  earpiece.  ""I  don't  feel  good  about  it  at  all.  It's  not  my  call  though,""  he  says.  ""When  the  director  says  'music'  the  orchestra  plays  and  he  takes  a  long  shot  of  the  hall.  We  don't  usually  see  the  person  speaking  while  his  microphone  is  cut  off.  ""The  person  that's  been  cut  off,  who's  10  feet  from  me,  is  glaring  at  me  like  it's  death  time.""  On  occasions,  some  stars  have  taken  it  upon  themselves  to  send  a  warning  shot  across  the  bows  of  the  musical  director  before  they  start  to  speak.  ""Julia  Roberts,  when  she  came  on,  she  asked  me  to  not  get  ready  to  play  because  she  had  so  much  to  do,""  he  says.  Conti  received  an  Oscar  in  1983  for  the  original  score  of  The  Right  Stuff.  He  also  received  two  nominations  in  the  original  song  category  in  1976  for  Gonna  Fly  Now  from  Rocky  and  in  1981  for  the  title  song  from  For  Your  Eyes  Only.  |||    ""It's  a  moment  in  the  sun,""  he  says.  ""When  people  get  up  there,  some  people,  this  is  hard  to  believe,  people  that  spend  their  lives  in  front  of  the  camera  or  audiences  entertaining,  might  get  a  little  flustered.  ""But  there's  this  moment  in  time  when  the  biggest  award  that  they  could  possibly  get  in  their  life  has  been  handed  to  them  and  they're  either  not  in  control  or  they  want  to  thank  everyone  that  they  ever  met.""  |||    The  image  of  the  Oscars  telecast  is  one  of  slick  presentation  and  smooth  transitions  between  performances  and  the  award  categories.  Behind  the  scenes,  the  key  players,  such  as  Conti,  have  a  bewildering  array  of  technical  props  to  deal  with.  ""There's  a  big  script  and  video  monitors  you  have  to  watch  and  there  are  also  audio  controls.  I  can  control  hearing  in  my  ears,  the  left  ear  or  the  right  ear  -  different  things  at  different  times.  |||    ""I  have  to  communicate  with  the  director.  I  have  a  little  microphone  that's  attached  to  my  headset.  To  open  up  that  microphone,  I  have  a  footswitch,""  he  explains.  Conti's  most  nerve-wracking  moment  came  during  his  first  Oscars  show  as  musical  director,  in  1977,  when  a  member  of  the  orchestra  alerted  him  that  they  could  smell  smoke.  Conti  immediately  told  the  show's  director:  ""I  start  cursing  and  screaming,  I  tell  him  we're  not  going  to  die  for  this  show  -  you  must  do  something  or  I'm  going  to  climb  out  of  this  pit  with  60  musicians  and  we're  going  to  be  home  in  10  minutes.  ""'Oh  no  Bill  don't  do  anything,""  came  the  response.  ""Imagine  these  elegantly  dressed  ladies  and  gentlemen  of  the  orchestra,  60  or  so  of  them  in  the  pit  and  while  we're  playing,  firemen  with  their  helmets  and  their  hatchets  crawling  among  us  trying  to  find  the  reason  for  the  smoke.""  The  smell  turned  out  to  be  new  paint  smouldering  on  the  music  stands.  ""No  one  died,  it's  not  a  big  story,  but  it  was  scary  at  the  time,""  laughs  Conti.  When  the  ceremony  is  over,  the  music  director  attends  the  annual  Governor's  Ball  with  his  family.  ""I  have  a  drink  and  relive  the  show,""  he  says.  ""I'm  not  for  too  much  carousing.  I  go  home  and  unwind.  It  takes  me  about  a  day.""" 

2	"US  casino  'tricks'  face  ban  in  UK  |||    Controversial  new  UK  casinos  will  be  banned  from  using  American  tricks  of  the  trade  to  ensure  they  are  ""socially  responsible"",  it  has  been  suggested.  |||    Culture  Secretary  Tessa  Jowell  said  proposed  super-casinos  will  be  different  from  their  US  counterparts.  In  America,  pheromones  have  reportedly  been  released  from  machines  to  encourage  aggressive  gambling  and  clocks  are  often  removed  from  walls.  Eight  super-casinos  are  proposed  from  2010  if  the  Gambling  Bill  becomes  law.  Ms  Jowell  said  the  legislation  would  ban  psychological  trickery.  |||    She  told  The  Times:  ""British  casinos  will  be  quite  different  to  those  overseas.  |||    ""They  will  have  to  act  in  a  socially  responsible  way  and  will  be  tightly  regulated.  ""They  will  be  run  according  to  British  rules  and  we'll  simply  not  allow  any  tricks  which  people  are  subjected  to  unawares  and  which  increase  the  risk  of  problem  gambling.""  One  tactic  used  in  the  US  is  simulating  daylight  during  night-time  to  lull  players  into  remaining  at  the  tables  and  slot  machines.  Casinos  also  frequently  offer  free  food,  drink  and  hotel  accommodation  to  keep  punters  betting.  A  spokesman  for  the  British  Casino  Association,  which  represents  the  UK  industry,  said  the  government  was  trying  to  allay  fears  over  a  ""UK  Las  Vegas"".  He  said  the  way  the  licences  were  being  awarded  meant  UK  firms  were  at  a  massive  disadvantage  and  foreign  companies  would  be  certain  to  win  the  contracts.  ""The  UK  industry  is  one  of  the  world's  most  respected,""  he  said.  ""We  have  the  lowest  level  of  problem  gambling  in  the  world.  ""We  certainly  don't  use  pheremones.  ""The  UK  gambling  industry  is  being  totally  frozen  in  time,  and  the  foreign  companies  will  take  over.""" 

2	"'Nuclear  dumpsite'  plan  attacked  |||    Plans  to  allow  foreign  nuclear  waste  to  be  permanently  stored  in  the  UK  have  been  branded  ""deeply  irresponsible""  by  the  Liberal  Democrats.  |||    The  government  has  confirmed  intermediate  level  waste  (ILW)  that  was  to  have  been  shipped  back  to  its  home  countries  will  now  be  stored  in  the  UK.  The  cash  raised  will  go  towards  the  UK's  nuclear  clean-up  programme.  But  Lib  Dem  Norman  Baker  accused  ministers  of  turning  Britain  into  a  ""nuclear  dumpsite"".  |||    Under  current  contracts,  British  Nuclear  Fuels  should  return  all  but  low  level  waste,  but  none  has  ever  been  sent  back.  In  future,  only  highly-radioactive  waste  will  be  sent  back  to  its  country  of  origin,  normally  Germany  or  Japan,  under  armed  guard.  Intermediate  waste  from  countries  such  as  Japan,  Germany,  Spain,  Italy,  Switzerland  and  Sweden  will  be  stored  permanently  in  the  UK.  At  the  moment,  this  waste  is  stored  at  Sellafield,  in  Cumbria,  in  the  form  of  glass  bricks,  untreated  liquid  waste  or  solid  material  in  drums.  In  a  statement,  the  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry  said  the  new  policy  meant  there  would  be  a  ""sixfold  reduction  in  the  number  of  waste  shipments  to  overseas  countries"".  And  it  said  highly-radioactive  waste  would  be  returned  to  its  home  country  sooner,  ensuring  there  would  be  no  overall  increase  in  radioactivity.  |||    Trade  Secretary  Patricia  Hewitt  said  the  new  arrangements,  revealed  in  a  Commons  written  statement,  would  raise  up  to  £680m  for  Britain's  nuclear  clean-up  programme,  under  the  new  Nuclear  Decommissioning  Agency.  But  the  move  has  been  criticised  by  environmental  groups  and  the  Liberal  Democrats.  Mr  Baker,  the  Lib  Dem  environment  spokesman,  said:  ""I  have  been  warning  for  months  that  this  would  happen  and  raised  it  with  government  several  times.  But  now  our  worst  fears  have  been  confirmed.  ""Once  again  Britain's  environmental  and  health  needs  are  being  ignored  in  policies  driven  by  the  Treasury  and  DTI.  ""This  is  a  terrible  attempt  to  offload  some  of  the  £48bn  cost  of  cleaning  up  nuclear  sites.  ""The  Energy  Act  was  supposed  to  help  Britain  clean  up,  but  in  order  to  pay  for  it  we  are  becoming  a  nuclear  dumpsite.  ""The  nuclear  industry  is  an  economic,  social  and  environmental  millstone  that  hangs  around  Britain's  neck.""" 

1	"Joy  Division  story  to  become  film  |||    The  life  of  late  Joy  Division  singer  Ian  Curtis  is  to  be  made  into  a  film,  it  has  been  announced.  |||    The  Manchester-based  production  is  called  Touching  From  A  Distance,  after  a  book  by  Curtis's  widow  Deborah  which  forms  the  basis  for  the  film.  Music  mogul  Tony  Wilson,  who  headed  the  record  company  Joy  Division  were  signed  to,  will  be  co-executive  producer.  The  musician  committed  suicide  in  1980  aged  23,  shortly  before  the  band  were  due  to  go  on  tour  in  the  US.  Mr  Wilson,  who  has  remained  friends  with  Curtis's  widow  and  daughter  Natalie,  who  he  says  asked  for  his  involvement  to  make  the  film  ""official"".  ""People  have  different  ideas  as  to  why  Ian  committed  suicide,  so  maybe  the  film  will  reflect  those  different  views,""  he  told  the  BBC  News  website.  |||    Plans  for  a  separate  Joy  Division  film  had  been  announced  at  the  Cannes  Film  Festival  earlier  this  year,  but  the  project  did  not  get  off  the  ground  as  it  failed  to  get  the  backing  of  Curtis's  family.  Mr  Wilson,  who  was  also  involved  with  Joy  Division's  sucessor  band  New  Order,  as  well  as  the  Happy  Mondays,  said  he  would  ""rather  not""  appear  in  the  film.  He  made  a  cameo  appearance  in  24  Hour  Party  People,  in  which  his  leading  role  was  played  by  Steve  Coogan.  ""I'm  not  an  actor  and  I  did  a  lousy  job  playing  my  part  in  24  Hour  Party  People,""  said  the  Factory  Records  founder,  who  has  been  associated  with  the  Manchester  music  scene  since  the  1970s.  ""Film  people  have  a  tendency  to  mess  up  when  they  touch  music,  but  I  hope  this  one  works.  |||    ""This  is  much  more  than  the  music  -  they  want  to  do  the  real  story  of  Ian,""  he  said.  The  film  is  to  be  directed  by  Dutch-born  Anton  Corbijn,  who  has  made  music  movies  for  Depeche  Mode  and  U2.  It  will  be  produced  by  a  US  production  company,  while  the  widow  of  Ian  Curtis  will  also  be  an  executive  producer."

Baikal  paid  260.75bn  roubles  ($9.37bn:  £4.8bn)  for  Yugansk  -  nowhere  near  the  $27bn  Russia  says  Yukos  owes  in  taxes.  Yukos  reacted  immediately  by  repeating  its  view  that  the  auction  was  illegal  in  international  and  Russian  law,  and  said  Baikal  had  bought  itself  trouble.  |||    ""The  company  considers  that  the  victor  of  today's  auction  has  bought  itself  a  serious  $9bn  headache,""  said  Yukos  spokesman  Alexander  Shadrin.  He  said  the  company  would  continue  to  make  ""every  lawful  move""  to  protect  tens  of  thousands  of  shareholders  in  Yukos  from  ""this  forcible  and  illegitimate  removal  of  their  property"".  Meanwhile,  Tim  Osborne,  head  of  Yukos  main  shareholders'  group  Menatep,  said  that  Yukos  may  have  to  declare  itself  bankrupt,  and  that  legal  action  would  be  taken,  outside  Russia,  against  the  auction  winners.  Reports  from  Russia  say  Baikal  has  paid  a  deposit  of  nearly  $1.7bn  from  a  Sberbank  (Savings  Bank)  account  to  the  Russian  Federal  Property  Fund,  for  Yugansk.  |||    The  sale  came  despite  a  restraining  order  issued  by  a  US  court  dealing  with  the  firm's  bankruptcy  application  for  Chapter  11  protection.  Yukos  has  always  insisted  the  auction  was  state-sponsored  theft  but  Russian  authorities  argued  they  were  imposing  the  law,  trying  to  recover  billions  in  unpaid  taxes.  There  were  originally  four  registered  bidders,  and  with  its  close  ties  to  the  Kremlin,  state-backed  gas  monopoly  Gazprom  had  been  seen  as  favourite.  But  just  two  companies  turned  up  for  the  auction,  Gazprom  and  the  unknown  Baikal  Finance  Group,  named  after  a  large  freshwater  lake  in  Siberia.  And,  according  to  Tass  news  agency,  Gazprom  did  not  make  a  single  bid,  leaving  the  way  open  for  Baikal,  which  paid  above  the  auction  start  price  of  246.75bn  roubles.  |||    Mystery  firm  Baikal  Finance  Group  is  officially  registered  in  the  central  Russian  region  of  Tver,  but  many  analysts  believe  it  may  be  linked  to  Gazprom.  Kaha  Kiknavelidze,  analyst  at  Troika  Dialog,  said:  ""I  think  a  decision  that  Yugansk  should  end  up  with  Gazprom  was  taken  a  long  time  ago.  So  the  main  question  was  how  to  structure  this  transaction.  |||    ""I  would  not  exclude  that  the  structure  of  the  deal  has  slightly  changed  and  Gazprom  now  has  a  partner.  ""I  would  also  not  exclude  that  Baikal  will  decline  to  pay  in  14  days,  that  are  given  by  law,  and  Gazprom  is  then  recognised  as  the  winner.  This  would  give  Gazprom  an  extra  14  days  to  accumulate  the  needed  funds.  ""Another  surprise  was  that  the  winner  paid  a  significant  premium  above  the  starting  price.""  However,  Gazprom  has  announced  it  is  not  linked  to  Baikal  in  any  way.  And  Paul  Collison,  chief  analyst  at  Brunswick  UBS,  said:  ""I  see  no  plausible  explanation  for  the  theory  that  Baikal  was  representing  competing  interests.  ""Yugansk  will  most  likely  end  up  with  Gazprom  but  could  still  end  up  with  the  government.  There  is  still  potential  for  surprises.""  Yugansk  is  at  the  heart  of  Yukos  -  pumping  close  to  a  million  barrels  of  oil  a  day.  The  unit  was  seized  by  the  government  which  claims  the  oil  giant  owes  more  than  $27bn  in  taxes  and  fines.  Yukos  says  those  tax  demands  are  exorbitant,  and  had  sought  refuge  in  US  courts.  |||    The  US  bankruptcy  court's  initial  order  on  Thursday  -  to  temporarily  block  the  sale  -  in  response  to  Yukos  filing  for  Chapter  11  bankruptcy  protection,  was  upheld  in  a  second  ruling  on  Saturday.  The  protection,  if  recognised  by  the  Russian  authorities,  would  have  allowed  Yukos'  current  management  to  retain  control  of  the  business  and  block  the  sale  of  any  company  assets.  Yukos  has  said  the  sale  amounts  to  expropriation  -  punishment  for  the  political  ambitions  of  its  founder,  Mikhail  Khodorkovsky.  Mr  Khodorkovsky  is  now  in  jail,  on  separate  fraud  charges.  But  President  Vladimir  Putin  has  described  the  affair  as  a  crackdown  on  corruption  -  and  the  BBC's  Sarah  Rainsford  in  Moscow  says  most  Russians  believe  the  destruction  of  Yukos  is  now  inevitable.  Hours  before  the  auction  lawyers  for  Menatep,  a  group  through  which  Mr  Khodorkovsky  and  his  associates  control  Yukos,  said  they  would  take  legal  action  in  other  countries.  Menatep  lawyers,  who  were  excluded  from  observing  the  auction,  said  they  would  retaliate  by  seeking  injunctions  in  foreign  courts  to  impound  Russian  oil  and  gas  exports." 

2	"Howard  dismisses  Tory  tax  fears  |||    Michael  Howard  has  dismissed  fears  from  some  Conservatives  that  his  plans  for  £4bn  tax  cuts  are  too  modest.  |||    He  defended  the  package,  saying  it  was  a  plan  for  the  Tories'  first  Budget  and  he  hoped  to  be  able  to  go  further.  The  Tories  on  Monday  highlighted  £35bn  in  ""wasteful""  spending  they  would  stop  to  allow  tax  cuts,  reduced  borrowing  and  more  spending  on  key  services.  Labour  and  the  Liberal  Democrats  say  the  party's  sums  do  not  add  up  and  claim  it  would  cut  frontline  services.  The  Tory  tax  plan  follows  complaints  from  some  of  the  party's  MPs  that  Mr  Howard  and  shadow  chancellor  Oliver  Letwin  have  taken  too  long  to  unveil  the  proposals.  Now  they  have  promised  a  figure  but  have  yet  to  reveal  which  taxes  would  be  targeted.  |||    Tory  backbencher  Edward  Leigh  said  the  proposals  were  a  step  in  the  right  direction  but  he  told  the  Financial  Times:  ""I  would  come  up  sooner  with  much  greater  tax  cuts.""  Interviewed  on  BBC  Radio  2's  Jeremy  Vine  show,  Mr  Howard  said:  ""It  is  perfectly  true  that  I  am  being  attacked  on  one  side  by  people  who  think  we  ought  to  be  promising  much,  much  bigger  tax  cuts  and  spending  cuts.  |||    ""On  the  other  side,  there  are  people  who  say  we  won't  be  able  to  achieve  these  tax  cuts.  ""I  think  we  have  got  it  about  right.""  Mr  Howard  said  voters  faced  a  clear  choice  at  the  next  election  between  more  waste  and  more  tax  under  Labour  and  Tory  value  for  money  and  lower  taxes.  He  added:  ""I  would  like  to  be  able  to  do  more,  and  over  time  I  am  sure  we  will  be  able  to  do  more,  but  at  the  start,  we  have  got  to  recognise  there  is  a  limit  to  what  we  can  do  in  one  go,  in  our  first  Budget.  ""I  have  got  to  be  responsible  about  this.""  |||    The  latest  Tory  plans  came  as  campaigning  for  the  election  -  widely  expected  in  May  -  gathered  pace.  The  Liberal  Democrats  launched  their  pre-election  platform,  with  leader  Charles  Kennedy  saying  his  party  was  the  ""authentic  opposition"",  particularly  on  the  Iraq  war,  council  tax  and  university  tuition  fees.  Lib  Dem  Treasury  spokesman  Vince  Cable  also  branded  the  Tory  plans  as  ""fantasy  economics"".  Labour  hit  back  at  the  Tory  proposals  even  before  their  publication  with  election  coordinator  Alan  Milburn  accusing  Mr  Howard  of  producing  a  ""fraudulent  prospectus"".  The  party  on  Tuesday  challenged  the  Tories  to  publish  the  full  report  from  David  James,  the  trouble-shooter  they  asked  to  identify  possible  savings.  But  the  Tories  are  in  turn  demanding  that  Tony  Blair  spell  out  which  taxes  he  would  raise  if  he  wins  the  election." 

0	"FBI  agent  colludes  with  analyst  |||    A  former  FBI  agent  and  an  internet  stock  picker  have  been  found  guilty  of  using  confidential  US  government  information  to  manipulate  stock  prices.  |||    A  New  York  court  ruled  that  former  FBI  man  Jeffrey  Royer,  41,  fed  damaging  information  to  Anthony  Elgindy,  36.  Mr  Elgindy  then  drove  share  prices  lower  by  spreading  negative  publicity  via  his  newsletter.  The  Egyptian-born  analyst  would  extort  money  from  his  targets  in  return  for  stopping  the  attacks,  prosecutors  said.  ""Under  the  guise  of  protecting  investors  from  fraud,  Royer  and  Elgindy  used  the  FBI's  crime-fighting  tools  and  resources  actually  to  defraud  the  public,""  said  US  Attorney  Roslynn  Mauskopf.  |||    Mr  Royer  was  convicted  of  racketeering,  securities  fraud,  obstruction  of  justice  and  witness  tampering.  Mr  Elgindy  was  convicted  of  racketeering,  securities  fraud  and  extortion.  |||    The  charges  carry  sentences  of  up  to  20  years.  When  the  guilty  verdict  was  announced  by  the  jury  foreman,  Mr  Elgindy  dropped  his  face  into  his  hands  and  sobbed,  the  Associated  Press  news  agency  reported.  He  was  led  weeping  from  the  court  room  by  US  marshals,  AP  said.  Defense  lawyers  contended  that  Mr  Royer  had  been  feeding  information  to  Mr  Elgindy  and  another  trader  in  an  attempt  to  expose  corporate  fraud.  Mr  Elgindy's  team  claimed  that  he  also  was  fighting  against  corporate  wrongdoing.  ""Elgindy's  conviction  marks  the  end  of  his  public  charade  as  a  crusader  against  fraud  in  the  market,""  said  Ms  Mauskopf.  One  of  the  more  bizarre  aspects  of  the  trial  focused  on  the  claims  that  Mr  Elgindy  may  have  had  foreknowledge  of  the  11  September  terrorist  attacks  in  New  York  and  Washington.  Mr  Elgindy  had  been  trying  to  sell  stock  prior  to  the  attack  and  had  predicted  a  slump  in  the  market.  No  charges  were  brought  in  relation  to  these  allegations." 

3	"Jones  files  Conte  lawsuit  |||    Marion  Jones  has  filed  a  lawsuit  for  defamation  against  Balco  boss  Victor  Conte  following  his  allegations  that  he  gave  her  performance-enhancing  drugs.  |||    The  Sydney  Olympic  gold  medallist  says  Conte  damaged  her  reputation  and  she  is  seeking  $25m  (£13m)  in  the  suit.  Conte,  whose  company  is  at  the  centre  of  a  doping  investigation,  made  the  claims  in  a  US  television  programme.  He  and  three  others  were  indicted  in  February  by  a  federal  grand  jury  for  a  variety  of  alleged  offences.  In  an  email  to  the  Associated  Press  on  Wednesday,  Conte  said:  ""I  stand  by  everything  I  said"".  Jones  won  three  gold  medals  and  two  bronzes  in  Sydney  in  2000.  Her  lawsuit,  filed  in  the  US  District  Court  in  San  Francisco,  said  the  sprinter  had  passed  a  lie  detector  test  and  that  she  ""has  never  taken  banned  performance-enhancing  drugs"".  Conte's  statements,  the  suit  added,  were  ""false  and  malicious"".  After  the  ABC  television  program  earlier  this  month,  Jones'  lawyer  Richard  Nicholls  said:  ""Marion  has  steadfastly  maintained  her  position  throughout:  she  has  never,  ever  used  performance-enhancing  drugs.  ""Victor  Conte  is  a  man  facing  a  42-count  federal  indictment,  while  Marion  Jones  is  one  of  America's  most  decorated  female  athletes.  Mr  Conte's  statements  have  been  wildly  contradictory.  ""Mr  Conte  chose  to  make  unsubstantiated  allegations  on  television,  while  Marion  Jones  demanded  to  take  and  then  passed  a  lie  detector  examination.  |||    ""Mr  Conte  is  simply  not  credible.  We  challenge  him  to  submit  to  the  same  lie  detector  procedure  that  Marion  Jones  passed.""  The  sport's  ruling  body,  the  IAAF,  is  taking  a  cautious  approach  to  Conte's  allegations  but  contacted  the  US  Anti-Doping  Agency.  Communications  director  Nick  Davies  said  the  IAAF  would  seek  to  contact  Conte  ""for  further  information"".  But  Davies  stressed  it  would  be  up  to  the  American  authorities  to  decide  whether  they  will  take  action  against  Jones  in  light  of  Conte's  television  interview  and  the  world  governing  body  would  monitor  the  situation  closely.  ""If  it  is  felt  there  is  case  to  answer,  it  would  be  for  its  national  governing  body  (USA  Track  and  Field)  to  take  the  appropriate  disciplinary  action,""  he  added.  ""The  US  Anti-Doping  Agency  has  proved  itself  to  be  very  diligent  in  its  anti-doping  war.  ""And  I  am  sure,  like  ourselves,  they  will  be  watching  the  television  programme  with  great  interest.""  Jones,  who  is  under  investigation  for  steroid  use  by  the  US  Anti-Doping  Agency,  has  continually  denied  ever  taking  illegal  substances  since  being  investigated  in  the  Balco  scandal,  although  she  praised  a  zinc  supplement  Conte  marketed.  Jones,  who  did  not  win  any  medals  in  Athens  in  August,  has  never  failed  a  drugs  test.  Meanwhile,  Conte,  who  has  been  charged  along  with  three  other  men  of  distributing  illegal  steroids  and  money  laundering,  is  due  to  face  trial  in  March."

ID  theft  occurs  when  criminals  use  someone  else's  personal  information  to  steal  credit  or  commit  other  crimes.  Internet  auctions  were  the  second  biggest  source  of  fraud  complaints,  comprising  16%  of  the  total.  The  total  cost  of  fraud  reported  by  consumers  was  $546m  (£290m).  |||    The  report  marks  the  fifth  year  in  a  row  in  which  identity  fraud  has  topped  the  table.  The  biggest  slice  of  the  246,570  ID  fraud  cases  reported  -  almost  30%  -  concerned  abuses  of  people's  credit.  Misusing  someone's  identity  to  claim  new  credit  cards  or  loans  comprised  16.5%  of  the  total,  with  almost  12%  coming  from  false  claims  on  existing  credit.  Another  18%  came  from  attempts  to  rip  off  people's  bank  accounts,  while  13%  of  cases  concerned  attempts  to  defraud  employers  by  abusing  someone  else's  identity.  Outside  the  field  of  ID  theft,  53%  of  the  near-400,000  complaints  were  internet-related.  Among  the  100,000  internet  auction  complaints,  the  failure  of  sellers  to  deliver  or  the  supply  of  sub-standard  goods  were  the  most  common  woes  reported.  Catalogue  and  home-shopping  frauds  were  next  in  line,  accounting  for  8%  of  total  complaints,  while  concerns  about  internet  services  and  computers  -  including  spyware  found  on  people's  PCs  and  undisclosed  charges  for  websites  -  amounted  to  6%  of  complaints."

It  estimated  that  it  needs  almost  30m  euros  ($39m;  £21m)  until  the  end  of  June  if  it  is  to  pay  its  bills.  The  football  club  is  hoping  that  all  its  creditors  will  agree  to  defer  rent  payments  on  its  Westfalen  stadium.  Borussia  officials  met  with  almost  all  the  banks  involved  in  its  financing  on  Friday  and  over  the  weekend.

Chief  executive  Gerd  Niebaum  stepped  down  last  week  and  creditors  have  been  pushing  for  a  greater  say  in  how  the  club  is  run.  Borussia  Dortmund  also  is  facing  calls  to  appoint  executives  from  outside  the  club.  The  club  posted  a  record  loss  of  68m  euros  in  the  12  months  through  June.

They  will  also  talk  to  Fisheries  Minister  Ross  Finnie  and  scientists.  MPs  are  deciding  whether  to  recommend  a  new  system  of  ""community  quotas""  to  conserve  fish  stocks.  The  aim  is  that  fishing  ports  like  Peterhead  or  Fraserburgh  would  be  allocated  a  quota  and  local  people  would  decide  how  to  fish  it.  The  scheme  is  a  variation  on  the  local  management  committees  already  being  established  by  the  European  Union.  |||    Details  are  contained  in  a  Royal  Commission  report  for  the  UK  Government,  along  with  the  more  controversial  idea  of  closing  some  mixed  fishing  grounds  completely.

""I  thought  I  should  explain  myself  before  I  disappear,""  said  Michael,  who  was  at  the  Berlin  film  festival  to  launch  the  documentary.  The  film,  A  Different  Story,  chronicles  Michael's  life  and  career  from  the  1980s  and  his  personal  struggles.  The  41-year-old  chart-topper  told  reporters  in  the  German  capital  that  he  wanted  to  ""move  his  career  into  a  different  form"",  but  added  that  he  does  not  know  what  it  is  going  to  be  yet.  |||    ""I'm  still  going  to  be  making  music,""  he  said,  but  added  that  he  was  ""not  going  to  be  around"".

1	"Film  production  'falls'  40%  in  UK  |||    The  number  of  British  films  produced  in  the  UK  fell  40%  in  2004,  with  movies  starring  Johnny  Depp  and  Jude  Law  among  those  affected,  Screen  Daily  has  said.  |||    Twenty-seven  British  films  were  made  in  the  UK  last  year  following  a  drop  in  funding,  compared  with  45  in  2003,  according  to  the  trade  weekly.  It  attributed  the  drop  to  tighter  tax  laws  and  reduced  funding  from  sources  such  as  the  National  Lottery.  UK  and  US  co-productions  in  Britain  fell  from  102  in  2003  to  81  last  year.  |||    Last  year  the  government  closed  tax  loopholes  that  many  film  investors  had  taken  advantage  of  to  fund  films  in  the  UK.  Several  projects  were  shelved  as  they  faced  the  implications  of  this  clampdown,  coupled  with  the  reduction  in  movie  funding  from  traditional  sources  including  the  lottery  and  Miramax  Films.  Shooting  on  period  drama  Tulip  Fever,  which  was  to  star  Jude  Law  and  Keira  Knightley,  was  postponed  indefinitely  while  shooting  of  The  Libertine  starring  Johnny  Depp  was  moved  to  the  Isle  of  Man.  |||    ""There  isn't  anything  coming  in  to  replace  (the  funds),""  said  The  Libertine's  executive  producer  Marc  Samuelson.  ""We  are  in  a  hiatus.""  Films  with  ""medium""  budgets  of  up  to  £9m,  a  similar  level  to  box  office  hits  Vera  Drake,  Calendar  Girls  and  Enduring  Love,  are  expected  to  be  worst  hit  by  the  tax  clampdown.  The  strength  of  the  pound  against  the  dollar  is  expected  to  have  resulted  in  a  fall  in  the  number  of  US  films  shot  in  the  UK  during  2004,  Screen  International  added.  Big  budget  co-productions,  such  as  the  Harry  Potter  series,  continued  to  be  shot  in  the  UK,  however.  The  UK  Film  Council  said  the  drop  was  partly  due  to  2003  being  an  especially  good  year  for  British  film  production,  when  Bridget  Jones:  The  Edge  of  Reason,  Wimbledon  and  Thunderbirds  were  all  filmed  in  the  UK.  |||    ""The  drop  was  expected  as  there  was  no  way  2003's  record  level  of  production  could  be  bettered,""  the  council's  spokesperson  said.  ""The  reduction  in  indigenous  film  production  in  2004  was  due  to  a  variety  of  factors,  including  the  continuing  long-term  trend  towards  co-production  of  films  in  more  than  one  country  and  changes  to  financing  arrangements.""  It  was  ""too  early""  to  predict  whether  the  downward  trend  in  UK  production  would  continue  throughout  2005,  the  UK  Film  Council  said.  In  September  the  government  introduced  subsidies  worth  up  to  £4m  per  film  for  medium  budget  films,  under  new  Treasury  measures.  It  is  also  due  to  announce  a  replacement  for  UK  film  tax  relief  scheme  Section  48  in  July."

He  is  working  with  Steve  Brown,  who  wrote  the  award-winning  musical  Spend  Spend  Spend.  A  spokeswoman  said  the  plans  were  in  the  ""very  early  stages"",  with  no  cast,  opening  date  or  theatre  announced.  |||    A  series  of  workshops  have  been  held  in  London,  and  on  Wednesday  a  cast  of  singers  unveiled  the  musical  to  a  select  group  of  potential  investors.  Mr  Thoday  said  the  idea  of  turning  the  film  into  a  musical  had  been  an  ambition  of  his  for  almost  20  years.  It's  a  Wonderful  Life  was  based  on  a  short  story,  The  Greatest  Gift,  by  Philip  van  Doren  Stern.  Mr  Thoday  managed  to  buy  the  rights  to  the  story  from  Van  Doren  Stern's  family  in  1999,  following  Mr  Brown's  success  with  Spend  Spend  Spend.  He  later  secured  the  film  rights  from  Paramount,  enabling  them  to  use  the  title  It's  A  Wonderful  Life."

There  were  also  fears  that  too  much  stress  might  be  placed  on  the  fragile  banking  system.  Growth  in  China  remains  at  a  breakneck  9.1%,  and  corporate  investment  is  growing  at  more  than  25%  a  year.  The  breakneck  pace  of  economic  expansion  has  kept  growth  above  9%  for  more  than  a  year.  Rapid  tooling-up  of  China's  manufacturing  sector  means  a  massive  demand  for  energy  -  one  of  the  factors  which  has  kept  world  oil  prices  sky-high  for  most  of  this  year.  In  theory,  the  government  has  a  7%  growth  target,  but  continues  to  insist  that  the  overshoot  does  not  mean  a  ""hard  landing""  in  the  shape  of  an  overbalancing  economy.  A  low  exchange  rate  -  China's  yuan  is  pegged  to  a  rate  of  8.28  to  the  dollar,  which  seems  to  be  in  relentless  decline  -  means  Chinese  exports  are  cheap  on  world  markets.  China  has  thus  far  resisted  international  pressure  to  break  the  link  or  at  least  to  shift  the  level  of  its  peg.  To  some  extent,  the  credit  controls  do  seem  to  be  taking  effect.  Industrial  output  grew  15.7%  in  the  year  to  October,  down  from  23%  in  February,  and  inflation  slowed  to  4.3%  -  although  retail  sales  are  still  booming." 

2	"Kilroy  names  election  seat  target  |||    Ex-chat  show  host  Robert  Kilroy-Silk  is  to  contest  the  Derbyshire  seat  of  Erewash  at  the  next  general  election.  |||    Labour's  Elizabeth  Blackman  won  the  seat  in  1997  and  has  a  6,932  majority.  She  says  she  will  fight  on  her  record  ""as  a  hard-working  constituency  MP"".  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  announced  his  plans  a  day  after  launching  his  new  party,  Veritas,  the  Latin  for  truth.  The  East  Midlands  MEP,  who  quit  the  UK  Independence  Party,  wants  his  new  group  to  ""change  the  face""  of  UK  politics.  His  choice  of  election  constituency  quashes  speculation  that  he  would  stand  against  Defence  Secretary  Geoff  Hoon  in  Ashfield,  Nottinghamshire.  UKIP  won  31%  of  the  vote  in  Erewash  in  last  June's  European  elections  -  with  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  among  their  candidates  for  the  region.  Until  1997,  Erewash  had  been  held  by  the  Tories  since  1970.  Ms  Blackman  said  she  was  proud  of  the  government's  achievements  in  the  area.  She  declined  to  give  her  view  of  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  at  this  point.  |||    On  Thursday,  he  told  a  London  news  conference  that  Veritas  would  avoid  the  old  parties'  ""lies  and  spin"".  He  said  ""our  country""  was  being  ""stolen  from  us""  by  mass  immigration  and  promised  a  ""firm  but  fair""  policy  on  immigration.  Veritas  says  it  hopes  to  contest  most  seats  at  the  forthcoming  general  election  but  plans  to  announce  detailed  policies  on  crime,  tax,  pensions,  health  and  defence  over  the  next  few  weeks.  |||    UKIP  leader  Roger  Knapman  says  he  is  glad  to  see  the  back  of  Mr  Kilroy-Silk.  Labour  campaign  spokesman  Fraser  Kemp  said  Veritas  was  joining  ""an  already  crowded  field  on  the  right  of  British  politics"".  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  was  joined  in  the  new  venture  by  one  of  UKIP's  two  London  Assembly  members,  Damien  Hockney,  who  is  now  Veritas'  deputy  leader.  |||    UKIP's  chairman  Petrina  Holdsworth  has  said  the  group  will  just  be  a  parody  of  the  party  the  men  have  left.  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  quit  UKIP  last  week  after  months  of  tension  as  he  vied  unsuccessfully  for  the  leadership  of  that  party.  He  said  he  was  ashamed  to  be  a  member  of  a  UKIP  whose  leadership  had  ""gone  AWOL""  after  the  great  opportunity  offered  by  its  third  place  at  last  June's  European  elections.  UKIP's  leader,  Roger  Knapman,  has  said  he  is  glad  to  see  the  back  of  Mr  Kilroy-Silk.  ""He  has  remarkable  ability  to  influence  people  but,  sadly,  after  the  [European]  election  it  became  clear  that  he  was  more  interested  in  the  Robert  Kilroy-Silk  Party  than  the  UK  Independence  Party  so  it  was  nice  knowing  him,  now  'goodbye',""  he  said.  UKIP  officials  also  argue  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  has  not  been  ""straightforward""  in  attacking  the  party  he  once  wanted  to  lead." 

1	"Neeson  in  bid  to  revive  theatre  |||    Hollywood  film  star  Liam  Neeson  has  held  a  dinner  party  in  New  York  to  promote  Belfast's  Lyric  Theatre.  |||    The  Ballymena-born  actor  said  that  the  theatre  on  Ridgeway  Street  was  in  a  ""very  dilapidated  condition"".  Lyric  chairman  David  Johnston  has  said  that  rebuilding  the  theatre,  at  a  cost  of  £8m  is  the  only  answer.  Mr  Neeson  said  that  the  idea  was  to  get  a  bunch  of  ""healthy,  wealthy  Irish  Americans""  in  one  room  and  ask  them  to  help  with  fundraising.  |||    The  Oscar-nominated  actor,  whose  films  include  Schindler's  List,  Michael  Collins  and  Star  Wars:  The  Phantom  Menace,  said:  ""The  Lyric  is  too  important  to  the  cultural  and  social  life  of  Northern  Ireland  for  this  building  to  crumble  and  fall  apart.  ""It  gave  me  a  start  professionally.  Mary  O'Malley,  the  founder  of  the  theatre,  gave  me  my  future.  ""In  those  days,  in  the  mid-70s,  when  I  was  there,  we  were  doing  a  play  every  four  weeks.  ""Belfast  was  not  a  pretty  town  to  be  living  in.  ""There  was  serious  trouble,  as  you  know,  but  this  theatre  was  like  a  Belisha  beacon  of  light  and  hope  six  nights  a  week,  doing  everything  from  Shakespeare  to  Yeats  to  O'Casey  with  a  group  of  actors  and  actresses  that  affected  me  very  deeply  and  still  do.""  The  Lyric  began  50  years  ago  but  the  doors  opened  at  its  present  site  on  the  Stranmillis  embankment  overlooking  the  River  Lagan  in  1968.  |||    As  well  as  Liam  Neeson,  it  also  launched  the  careers  of  Adrian  Dunbar  and  Stephen  Rea  and  playwrights  such  as  Martin  Lynch  and  Gary  Mitchell.  Speaking  to  BBC  Northern  Ireland  before  the  event  at  New  York's  SoHo  House,  Mr  Neeson  said  that  his  spirit  belonged  to  the  Glens  of  Antrim.  And  he  said  that  there  was  one  figure  from  his  childhood  that  he  would  love  to  portray  on  the  big  screen  -  Ian  Paisley.  He  said  that  the  DUP  leader  and  preacher  was  a  ""very  dynamic,  extraordinary  figure"".  Neeson  used  to  listen  to  his  sermons  on  a  Friday  night  in  Ballymena.  He  said:  ""What  an  orator.  He  was  from  that  old  school  of  bible-thumping  righteousness.  But  it  was  so  dramatic.  I  found  him  very  powerful.  ""I'd  love  to  get  a  chance  to  play  him  some  time.""" 

1	"Black  Sabbath  top  rock  album  poll  |||    Black  Sabbath  have  topped  a  list  of  the  best  British  rock  albums  of  all  time.  |||    The  band  once  fronted  by  Ozzy  Osbourne  led  a  poll  of  Kerrang!  magazine  readers  with  their  1970  self-titled  debut.  The  band  have  three  more  efforts  on  the  list,  including  fifth-placed  Paranoid.  Osbourne  appears  more  than  any  other  act,  with  two  solo  records  featured.  The  top  five  includes  Led  Zeppelin,  Iron  Maiden  and  Sex  Pistols.  Queen,  Muse,  Manic  Street  Preachers  and  The  Clash  complete  the  top  10.  A  mix  of  heavy  metal,  punk,  glam  rock  and  even  dance  music  makes  up  the  list.  Motorhead,  Judas  Priest  and  Prodigy  are  included  along  with  newer  acts  like  The  Darkness  and  Lostprophets.  |||    Kerrang!  editor  Ashley  Bird  said:  ""It's  amazing  to  see  so  many  incredible  homegrown  albums  in  one  list,  and  without  any  of  the  abysmal  fashion  bands  that  currently  clog  up  the  music  scene.  ""These  are  the  real  opinions  of  proper  rock  fans.""  |||    Formed  by  four  teenage  friends  in  the  West  Midlands  in  the  late  1960s,  Black  Sabbath  are  one  of  Britain's  most  successful  heavy  rock  bands.  Their  debut  was  a  UK  top  10  hit  in  1970  and  sold  more  than  a  million  copies  in  the  US.  Osbourne  said  the  band's  success  in  the  Kerrang!  poll  was  a  triumph  for  British  rock.  He  said:  ""Back  then  you'd  hear:  'If  you  go  to  San  Francisco,  be  sure  to  wear  a  flower  in  your  hair'.  ""We  lived  in  Aston,  Birmingham.  The  only  flowers  I  ever  saw  were  on  a  gravestone  in  our  local  cemetery.""  Despite  being  disliked  by  many  critics,  Black  Sabbath's  subsequent  albums  included  multi-million  sellers  but  internal  rows  led  to  Osbourne  leaving  in  1979.  The  band  continued  without  Osbourne,  who  went  on  to  solo  success  but  also  had  to  battle  alcoholism  and  legal  action  over  his  music  allegedly  inciting  teenagers  to  commit  suicide.  He  was  eventually  cleared  of  the  charges.  Osbourne,  who  bit  off  the  head  of  a  live  bat  on  stage  in  1982,  rejoined  the  band  to  play  the  Live  Aid  charity  concert  in  1985.  After  many  changes  in  line-up,  the  original  four  members  reunited  to  play  live  dates  in  1997.  Black  Sabbath  have  reunited  regularly  in  recent  years  while  Osbourne  has  gone  on  to  wider  fame  with  his  family  through  MTV  documentary  series  The  Osbournes."

""We  have  banned  her  from  all  local  and  international  competitions,""  said  AK  chief  Isaiah  Kiplagat.  ""We  shall  communicate  this  decision  to  the  IAAF  and  all  meet  directors  all  over  the  world.""  The  29-year-old  finished  second  to  Paula  Radcliffe  in  the  2002  and  2003  London  races,  and  was  also  edged  out  in  an  epic  New  York  Marathon  contest  last  year.  |||    But  the  ban  will  prevent  the  two-time  world  half-marathon  silver  medallist  from  challenging  Radcliffe  at  this  year's  London  event  in  April.  Global  Sports  Communications,  Chepkemei's  management  company,  said  she  had  wanted  to  run  in  the  World  Cross  Country  Championships  in  March.  But  AK  maintained  it  was  making  an  example  of  Chepkemei  as  a  warning  to  other  Kenyan  athletes.  ""We  are  taking  this  action  in  order  to  salvage  our  pride,""  said  Kiplagat.  ""We  have  been  accused  of  having  no  teeth  to  bite  with  and  that  agents  are  ruling  over  us.""

Ryanair  said  the  new  planes  would  help  it  to  cut  operating  costs  further.  The  carrier  reported  a  drop  in  quarterly  profit  earlier  this  year  after  it  was  hit  by  higher  fuel  costs.  However,  when  it  reported  the  results,  the  airline  was  upbeat  about  prospects  for  2005,  despite  tough  competition  in  the  budget  airline  market.  |||    Ryanair  chairman  David  Bonderman  said  that  the  737-800  had  ""significantly  reduced  our  unit  operating  costs  and  allowed  us  to  reduce  air  fares  each  year  for  the  last  five  years"".  |||    ""With  this  new  order  and  new  pricing  in  place,  Ryanair  expects  that  unit  operating  costs  (excluding  fuel)  will  continue  to  fall  each  year  for  the  next  five  years,""  he  added.  At  the  end  of  this  year,  Ryanair  will  have  taken  delivery  of  about  100  new  planes,  while  the  70  new  orders  are  due  for  delivery  between  2008  and  2012.  The  airline  said  that  when  all  these  planes  have  been  delivered,  it  will  be  able  to  carry  more  than  70  million  passengers  a  year,  making  it  Europe's  largest  airline.  About  2,500  new  jobs  should  be  created  in  the  next  seven  years,  it  added.  The  order  can  be  seen  as  good  news  for  Boeing,  which  in  recent  years  has  been  overtaken  by  European  plane  maker  Airbus  as  the  world's  biggest-selling  plane  maker."

Children's  charities  have  reacted  with  alarm,  saying  the  policy  amounts  to  forcible  removal  and  may  not  guarantee  the  safety  of  those  affected.  But  the  Home  Office  says  it  may  be  in  the  children's  best  interests  if  it  reunites  them  with  their  communities.  |||    The  pilot,  included  in  the  government's  five-year  immigration  plan,  aims  to  return  unaccompanied  asylum-seeking  children  from  Albania  who  have  failed  in  their  asylum  claims.  |||    Since  2002,  at  least  9,000  under-18s  have  arrived  in  the  UK  to  seek  asylum  without  other  family  members.  These  children  automatically  become  the  responsibility  of  social  services.  Up  to  now,  ministers  have  held  back  from  final  removal  orders  against  unaccompanied  children  until  after  they  are  legally  adults  at  18.  At  least  a  dozen  Albanian-born  teenagers  are  thought  to  have  been  identified  for  return,  according  to  sources,  although  there  is  no  public  confirmation  of  numbers.  Those  selected  could  either  be  returned  to  their  families,  should  they  be  traced,  or  placed  in  the  care  of  other  Albanian  authorities.  Separate  negotiations  to  establish  a  family  tracing  and  returns  scheme  are  believed  to  be  underway  with  another  country.  |||    Under  the  1989  Children  Act,  public  bodies  have  a  duty  to  act  in  the  ""best  interest""  of  a  child  in  their  care.  Laura  Brownlees  of  Save  the  Children  said  there  were  grave  concerns,  not  least  because  of  the  well-documented  trafficking  of  children  into  crime  and  prostitution  in  Albania.  |||    ""If  children  are  going  to  be  returned  then  there  should  be  proper  assessments  and  decisions  on  a  case  by  case  basis,""  she  said.  ""We  do  not  think  there  are  structures  in  place  [to  receive  returning  children  in  Albania].  'If  these  decisions  are  not  in  the  best  interests  of  the  child,  then  that  is  a  forced  removal  because  the  child  will  not  have  any  choice  in  the  final  decision.""  In  its  five-year  immigration  plan,  announced  on  Tuesday,  the  government  said  it  was  addressing  ""the  difficult  issue""  of  returning  unaccompanied  asylum  seeking  children.  A  spokesman  for  the  Home  Office  said  it  was  wholly  wrong  to  suggest  that  the  plan  was  to  return  children  ""and  leave  them  to  rot"".  ""We  are  developing  a  returns  programme  for  unaccompanied  asylum-seeking  children  whose  asylum  and  humanitarian  protection  claims  have  been  refused,""  said  the  spokesman.  ""We  have  been  exploring  how  we  can  establish  reception  and  longer-term  care  arrangements  in  countries  of  origin  and  believe  that  it's  possible  to  return  children  in  a  way  that  is  in  their  best  interests  and  is  safe  and  sustainable.  |||    ""We  do  not  believe  that  it  is  right,  or  in  keeping  with  children's  legislation,  that  children  who  can  return  should  remain  in  the  UK  indefinitely  separated  from  their  families  and  communities.""  The  spokesman  stressed  the  UK  would  abide  by  its  international  human  rights  obligations.  Only  those  children  who  could  be  provided  with  a  carefully  planned  reintegration  package  would  be  returned,  he  said.  But  Andrew  Hogg,  spokesman  for  the  Medical  Foundation  for  the  Care  of  Victims  of  Torture,  said  ministers  had  so  far  failed  to  reassure  agencies.  ""From  what  is  so  far  known,  we  strongly  oppose  the  scheme  because  the  welfare  and  best  interests  of  the  child  will  not  properly  be  taken  into  account,""  said  Mr  Hogg.  ""In  Albania  particularly  there  is  no  statutory  child  care  or  protection  structure.  ""The  Medical  Foundation  has  many  serious  concerns,  including  the  assessment  process  for  suitability  for  return,  the  degrading  of  best  interests  of  the  child  principles  and  of  child  welfare,  and  the  lack  of  safeguards  in  the  chosen  countries.""  A  spokesman  for  the  Albanian  embassy  in  London  said  it  was  the  first  it  had  heard  of  a  scheme,  but  did  not  rule  out  that  there  had  been  an  agreement  between  the  two  countries."

""I  will  be  heading  to  Australia  with  a  lot  of  question  marks  over  me,  I  know  that,""  she  said.  ""But  I  think  there'll  be  less  pressure  than  last  time  even  if  I  am  champion.""  Henin-Hardenne  was  speaking  after  a  6-2  5-7  6-2  loss  to  world  number  six  Dementieva  in  Charleroi,  Belgium,  on  Sunday.  The  previous  day,  the  Olympic  champion  went  down  6-2  7-5  to  France's  Nathalie  Dechy.  |||    ""I  have  to  be  positive,  I  still  have  a  few  weeks,""  she  said.  ""My  body  has  to  get  accustomed  again  to  the  stress,  the  rhythm.""  Henin-Hardenne  slid  down  the  world  rankings  in  the  second  half  of  2004  after  contracting  the  illness  in  April.  After  an  initial  lay-off,  she  was  forced  off  the  circuit  for  a  second  time  after  being  knocked  out  of  the  French  Open  in  the  second  round.  A  comeback  at  the  US  Open  after  a  three-month  absence  ended  when  she  crashed  out  at  the  fourth-round  stage.  But  despite  her  problems,  she  still  won  five  of  the  nine  official  tournaments  she  entered  in  2004  and  won  Olympic  gold  in  Athens,  an  achievement  which  saw  her  named  Belgian  sportswoman  of  the  year  on  Friday.  ""Physically,  it's  obvious  that  I  hit  rock  bottom,""  said  the  22-year-old,  who  will  make  her  comeback  in  the  Sydney  International  from  10-16  January.  ""Since  April,  with  the  exception  of  the  Olympics,  I  have  not  done  much.  ""All  the  successes  I  had  prior  to  that  were  mainly  due  to  the  work  I  put  in  on  building  up  my  fitness.  ""Now  it's  time  to  get  back  to  putting  in  200%  effort  and  I  think  I  am  capable  of  doing  that."""

Ms  Craymer  remortgaged  her  home  to  finance  her  idea  of  a  musical  based  around  Abba's  hits,  which  has  since  become  a  global  triumph.  Teenage  soul  singer  Joss  Stone  is  a  new  entry  on  a  list  of  Britain's  young  music  millionaires  with  £5m.  |||    Ms  Craymer,  who  developed  Mamma  Mia!  with  playwright  Catherine  Johnson  and  members  of  Abba,  is  at  number  31  on  the  music  rich  list.  But  taking  the  top  spot  for  a  second  year  is  former  record  label  boss  Clive  Calder,  whose  wealth  has  risen  to  £1.3bn.  Mr  Calder  is  the  man  behind  acts  including  Britney  Spears.  He  made  his  fortune  by  selling  his  independent  label  Zomba  to  record  giant  BMG.  Former  Beatle  Sir  Paul  McCartney  is  second  on  the  list  with  £800m  -  up  £40m  on  last  year.  Andrew  Lloyd-Webber's  wealth  rose  an  estimated  £300m  on  last  year,  to  £700m,  while  theatre  impresario  Sir  Cameron  Mackintosh's  fortune  rose  from  £340m  to  £400m.  |||    His  recent  hits  have  included  the  West  End  show  Mary  Poppins.  But  Pop  Idol  mogul  Simon  Fuller  has  seen  his  wealth  plummet  from  £220m  last  year  to  £75m  after  selling  his  entertainment  company  19  for  less  than  expected,  according  to  the  Sunday  Times.  Joss  Stone,  the  17-year-old  soul  singer  from  Devon,  was  a  new  entry  in  the  young  music  millionaires  list.  The  list  also  features  Charlotte  Church,  Coldplay,  Daniel  Bedingfield,  Will  Young  and  David  and  Victoria  Beckham.  At  number  one  is  Dhani  Harrison,  son  of  the  late  Beatle  George  Harrison,  who  has  inherited  £140m.  The  Beckhams  -  who  qualify  thanks  to  Victoria's  former  singing  career  -  are  in  second  place  with  £75  million  between  them  -  up  £10m  on  last  year."

The  total  payment  includes  $5m  in  fines  and  more  than  $4m  to  fund  state  compliance  checks  with  gun  laws  and  prevent  ammunition  sales  to  minors.  Wal-Mart  agreed  to  suspend  firearms  sales  in  its  California  stores  in  2003,  |||    The  alleged  violations  included  the  sale  of  guns  to  23  people  who  were  not  allowed  to  possess  them,  and  delivering  36  guns  to  customers  who  acquired  them  for  people  not  allowed  to  own  firearms.  Although  Wal-Mart  has  suspended  firearms  sales  in  the  state,  California  attorney  general  Bill  Lockyer  said  he  wanted  to  be  sure  the  giant  supermarket  chain  would  follow  state  rules  in  future.  ""Wal-Mart's  failure  to  comply  with  gun  safety  laws  put  the  lives  of  all  Californians  at  risk  by  placing  guns  in  the  hands  of  criminals  and  other  prohibited  persons,""  said  Mr  Lockyer.  ""Although  Wal-Mart  has  suspended  gun  sales  in  California,  this  settlement  will  ensure  that  it  follows  state  law  if  it  renews  sales  and  will  also  provide  valuable  public  education  about  the  importance  of  gun  safety.""  The  world's  largest  retailer  has  not  yet  decided  whether  to  resume  firearms  sales  in  California,  company  spokesman  Gus  Whitcomb  said." 

2	"Howard  attacks  cost  of  asylum  |||    Michael  Howard  has  launched  an  attack  on  the  cost  of  Britain's  ""chaotic""  asylum  system  under  Tony  Blair.  |||    The  Tory  leader  said  English  local  authorities  have  spent  more  than  £3bn  -  or  £140  per  household  -  on  asylum  since  Labour  won  power  in  1997.  Mr  Howard  is  expected  to  tell  activists  in  Kent  that  voters'  tolerance  and  desire  to  help  others  are  being  abused.  Other  parties  and  refugee  agencies  have  already  attacked  Tory  plans  for  annual  limits  on  numbers.  |||    Mr  Howard  said  Britain  should  take  its  fair  share  of  the  world's  ""genuine  refugees"".  |||    ""The  anniversary  of  the  liberation  of  Auschwitz  -  where  my  grandmother  was  murdered  along  with  over  a  million  others  -  has  reminded  all  of  us  that  we  have  a  moral  responsibility  to  those  fleeing  persecution,""  he  was  due  to  say.  ""But  if  we  are  to  fulfil  responsibility,  we  have  to  get  a  grip  of  the  system.  ""Fair  play  matters.  People  want  a  government  that  upholds  the  rules  -  not  one  that  turns  a  blind  eye  when  they  are  bent  and  abused,""  he  said.  ""And  let's  be  clear.  Our  asylum  system  is  being  abused  -  and  with  it  Britain's  generosity.""  Earlier  this  week,  Mr  Howard  said  his  party's  plans  to  cut  immigration  were  not  racist,  arguing  they  would  make  the  asylum  system  fairer  for  genuine  refugees.  If  elected,  his  party  would  institute  an  annual  limit  on  asylum  and  all  claims  would  be  processed  overseas.  |||    That  prompted  some  charities  to  say  the  plans  would  put  refugees'  lives  at  risk  if  they  were  turned  away  once  quotas  were  filled.  ""If  we  have  a  moral  responsibility  towards  people  fleeing  persecution,  then  these  policies  will  not  provide  a  safe  haven,""  said  Hannah  Ward  of  the  Refugee  Council.  ""If  people  turn  up  in  the  UK  asking  for  help  they  will  be  turned  away.  Michael  Howard's  policy  effectively  means  there  is  no  safe  haven  in  the  UK.  ""When  it  comes  to  costs,  then  perhaps  we  should  start  with  how  decisions  are  made  on  asylum  seekers.  So  many  of  them  are  shown  to  be  wrong  -  one  in  five  decisions  that  are  appealed  are  successfully  overturned,  rising  to  half  for  some  nationalities.  ""We  need  good  quality  decision-making  on  asylum  applications  because  it  is  delays  in  the  system  which  cost  so  much.""  |||    Tony  Blair  said  Labour  would  set  out  workable  plans  for  tackling  immigration  abuse  in  the  next  few  weeks  and  attacked  the  Tory  plans.  ""By  cutting  the  number  of  front-line  immigration  staff  at  our  borders,  they  will  actually  make  the  problem  worse,""  said  Mr  Blair.  Liberal  Democrat  chairman  Matthew  Taylor  said  there  needed  to  be  a  quick,  fair  and  firm  asylum  system.  But  he  said  it  was  ""absolutely  disgusting""  to  propose  a  system  which  could  turn  away  genuine  refugees.  The  Conservatives  say  there  is  little  risk  of  this  happening  as  demand  for  asylum  will  be  considered  when  quotas  are  set.  On  Monday,  Mr  Howard  said:  ""It's  not  racist,  as  some  people  to  claim,  to  talk  about  controlling  immigration  far  from  it.""" 

0	"Minister  hits  out  at  Yukos  sale  |||    Russia's  renationalisation  of  its  energy  industry  needs  to  be  reversed,  a  senior  government  figure  has  warned.  |||    Economy  minister  German  Gref  told  the  Kommersant  newspaper  that  direct  state  involvement  in  oil  was  ""unjustified"".  His  comments  follow  the  sale  of  much  of  oil  giant  Yukos  to  cover  back  taxes  -  a  deal  which  effectively  took  most  of  the  firm's  assets  into  public  ownership.  On  28  December,  another  senior  economic  adviser  called  the  sale  ""the  swindle  of  the  century"".  Yuganskneftegaz,  the  unit  which  produced  60%  of  Yukos'  output,  had  been  seized  and  sold  in  December  for  less  than  $10bn  to  a  previously  unknown  firm  called  Baikal.  |||    Baikal  promptly  passed  into  the  hands  of  state-controlled  firm  Rosneft,  itself  shortly  to  merge  with  state  gas  giant  Gazprom.  ""We  used  to  see  street  hustlers  do  this  kind  of  thing,""  Andrei  Illarionov  -  then  economic  adviser  to  President  Vladimir  Putin  -  told  a  press  conference.  ""Now  officials  are  doing  it.""  Within  days,  he  was  stripped  of  most  of  his  responsibilities.  |||    Mr  Gref,  a  well-known  opponent  of  nationalisation  in  competitive  parts  of  the  market,  was  keen  to  distance  himself  from  Mr  Iliaronov's  comments.  The  privatisation  of  companies  such  as  Yukos  in  the  1990s  had  been  badly  handled,  he  said.  But  he  stressed  that  the  government  needed  to  get  out  of  oil.  ""I  think  that  Rosneft  and  Yuganskneftegaz,  should  it  become  a  state-owned  company,  must  be  privatized,""  he  said.  |||    ""Today  our  government  is  ineffective  and  state  companies,  as  a  result,  are  for  the  overwhelming  part  ineffective  as  well.""  And  he  warned  that  using  back  taxes  to  deal  with  firms  like  Yukos  -  a  technique  now  being  applied  by  the  Kremlin  to  several  other  firms  -  was  a  mistake.  ""If  we  follow  that  logic,  we  should  nationalise  all  businesses,""  he  said.  Many  large  Russian  companies,  particularly  in  the  energy  sector,  use  complex  webs  of  offshore  companies  to  avoid  taxes.  |||    Mr  Gref  also  poured  cold  water  on  President  Putin's  promises  of  doubled  economic  growth  within  a  decade.  The  assault  on  Yukos'  assets  has  been  widely  blamed  for  a  slowdown  in  economic  growth  in  recent  months.  ""The  task  is  not  simply  to  double  GDP;  instead  it  is  to  use  GDP  to  qualitatively  improve  people's  lives,""  Mr  Gref  told  Kommersant.  ""We  don't  need  simply  to  increase  GDP,  but  to  improve  its  structure.""  Instead  of  focusing  on  headline  growth  figures,  Russia  needed  to  focus  on  better  institutions,  such  as  a  more  efficient  -  and  less  corrupt  -  court  system."

Journalists  at  the  firm  met  on  Friday  afternoon  to  discuss  how  to  react  to  the  surprise  announcement.  The  cuts  come  against  a  background  of  fierce  competition  for  readers  and  sluggish  advertising  revenues  amid  competition  from  online  advertising.  The  National  Union  of  Journalists  has  called  on  the  management  to  recall  the  notice  of  redundancy  by  midday  on  Monday  or  face  a  strike  ballot.  |||    Pearson's  Financial  Times  said  last  week  it  was  offering  voluntary  redundancy  to  about  30  reporters.  |||    The  National  Union  of  Journalists  said  it  stood  strongly  behind  the  journalists  and  did  not  rule  out  a  strike.  ""Managers  have  torn  up  agreed  procedures  and  kicked  staff  in  the  teeth  by  sacking  people  to  pay  for  printing  facilities,""  said  Jeremy  Dear,  NUJ  General  Secretary.  NUJ  official  Barry  Fitzpatrick  said  the  company  had  ignored  the  90-day  consultation  period  required  for  companies  planning  more  than  10  redundancies.  ""They  have  shown  a  complete  disregard  for  the  consultative  rights  of  our  members,""  said  Mr  Fitzpatrick,  who  added  that  the  company  now  planned  to  observe  the  consultation  procedures.  The  two  Telegraph  titles  currently  employ  521  journalists.  |||    Some  broadsheet  newspapers  -  especially  those  which  have  not  moved  to  a  tabloid  format  -  have  suffered  circulation  declines,  which  are  hitting  revenues.  The  Telegraph  has  announced  no  plans  to  go  tabloid  although  both  The  Independent  and  The  Times  have  seen  circulation  rise  since  shrinking  in  size.  |||    The  Guardian  is  hedging  its  bets,  planning  a  larger  tabloid  format  like  those  popular  in  continental  Europe.  The  Telegraph  Group  was  bought  by  the  Barclay  twins  -  Frederick  and  David  -  last  year,  having  previously  been  owned  by  Lord  Conrad  Black's  Hollinger  International.  The  brothers  are  currently  mulling  the  sale  of  another  of  their  businesses,  retailer  Littlewoods.  |||    Telegraph  executive  Murdoch  MacLennan  said  the  two  newspapers  would  add  eight  colour  pages  in  the  coming  months.  |||    ""Journalists  are  the  lifeblood  of  any  newspaper,  and  maintaining  the  quality  of  The  Daily  Telegraph  and  The  Sunday  Telegraph  for  our  readers  is  vital,""  he  said.  ""However,  action  to  improve  our  production  capability  and  secure  our  titles  against  the  competition  is  also  vital.""  Many  newspapers  are  investing  in  new  printing  machinery  that  enables  them  to  print  more  colour  pages,  or  in  some  cases,  have  colour  on  every  page.  They  are  hoping  that  by  boosting  colour  it  will  make  their  publications  more  attractive  to  advertisers  and  readers  alike.  In  recent  months  News  Corp's  News  International  unit,  which  publishes  The  Sun  and  the  News  of  the  World,  the  Guardian  Media  Group,  Trinity  Mirror  and  the  Daily  Mail  &  General  Trust  have  all  announced  substantial  investments  in  new  printing  plants."

BP  added  that  it  was  increasing  its  fourth-quarter  dividend  by  26%  to  8.5  cents,  and  that  it  would  continue  with  share  buybacks.  BP  chief  executive  Lord  Browne  said  the  results  were  strong  ""both  operationally  and  financially.""  |||    The  company  is  earning  about  $1.8m  an  hour.  |||    Despite  the  record  annual  profits  figure,  BP's  performance  was  below  the  expectations  of  some  City  analysts.  However,  BP's  share  price  rose  4p  or  nearly  1%  in  morning  trading  to  548p.  Its  profit  rise  for  the  year  included  profits  of  $3.65bn  (£1.97bn)  for  the  final  three  months  of  2004  -  up  from  $2.89bn  a  year  ago  but  below  its  third  quarter.  |||    Speaking  on  the  BBC's  Today  programme  on  Tuesday,  Lord  Browne  said  the  profits  were  not  solely  down  to  the  high  oil  price  alone.  |||    ""The  profits  are  up  more  than  the  price  of  oil  is  up,""  he  said.  Lord  Browne  pointed  out  that  BP  was  reaping  the  benefits  of  its  investment  in  oil  exploration.  ""We  have  spent  many  years  buying  (assets)  when  the  price  is  low,""  he  said.  The  company  has  made  new  discoveries  in  Egypt,  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  and  Angola.  |||    However,  Lord  Browne  rejected  calls  for  a  windfall  tax  on  his  company's  huge  profits,  saying  that  in  the  North  Sea  it  paid  progressively  more  tax,  the  more  profits  it  made.  Lord  Browne  believes  oil  prices  will  remain  quite  high.  Currently  above  $40  a  barrel,  he  said:  ""The  price  of  oil  will  be  well  supported  above  $30  a  barrel  for  the  medium  term.""  BP  put  production  for  the  year  at  3.997  billion  barrels  of  oil,  up  10%  on  2003,  but  slightly  lower  than  the  four  billion  barrels  it  had  initially  aimed  for."

Despite  being  told  he  was  a  ""nutter  who  died  at  sea""  she  found  a  reference  to  Mr  Pound  on  Friends  Reunited.  Lucy's  mother  kept  her  pregnancy  secret  and  had  her  adopted  at  four  weeks.  Mr  Pound  found  out  about  it  last  year.  That  happened  when  Lucy  wrote  to  his  Parliamentary  office  saying  she  believed  he  was  her  father.  |||    Mr  Pound,  who  is  now  married  with  two  other  teenage  children,  said:  ""I  was  a  nutter  and  I  was  a  sailor  but  I  wasn't  dead.""  He  said  his  first  reaction  was  to  wonder  if  he  was  victim  of  a  ""set-up""  but  he  then  realised  all  the  dates  fitted.  ""It  was  a  pretty  horrible  thing  with  a  pretty  happy  ending.  I  felt  guilt  in  the  marrow  of  my  bones,""  said  the  Ealing  North  MP.  ""I  don't  blame  Lucy's  mother.  I  was  pretty  much  out  of  control.  I  was  18  when  she  was  conceived.  It  was  a  different  time  -  it  was  pretty  wild.""  |||    Mr  Pound  says  he  rang  Lucy  as  soon  as  he  got  her  letter,  they  met  up  and  have  been  in  contact  ever  since.  Describing  that  first  meeting  at  London's  King  Cross  station,  he  said:  ""The  earth  went  from  under  my  feet  ...  We  were  walking  across  the  Euston  Road  and  I  took  her  arm  to  take  her  across  and  there  was  an  immediate  connection.  ""We  were  finishing  each  other  sentences.""  Lucy,  who  was  adopted  by  a  family  from  Essex,  wants  to  remain  anonymous  for  the  sake  of  her  adoptive  father  and  her  children.

2	"Sport  betting  rules  in  spotlight  |||    A  group  of  MPs  and  peers  has  called  for  a  tightening  of  regulations  controlling  betting  on  sport.  |||    The  Parliamentary  Group  on  Betting  and  Gaming  held  a  substantial  inquiry  into  betting  last  year.  It  followed  fears  that  a  massive  increase  in  betting  on  sport,  such  as  that  done  using  the  internet  and  mobile  phones,  has  led  to  more  cheating.  The  all-party  group  recommended  15  ways  to  protect  punters  and  improve  the  integrity  of  sports  betting.  They  include  a  proposal  for  raising  the  maximum  jail  sentence  for  gambling  cheats  above  the  current  two  years.  Lord  Condon,  head  of  the  International  Cricket  Council's  anti-corruption  unit,  who  originally  made  the  call  for  longer  prison  sentences,  said  the  two-year  penalty  was  ""derisory"".  ""You  could  get  a  bigger  sentence  for  failing  to  pay  your  hotel  bill  criminally  than  you  could  for  corruption  in  major  sports.  ""Symbolically,  a  higher  penalty,  perhaps  as  the  Bill  passes  through  the  two  Houses,  might  be  appropriate.""  |||    The  report  recommended  the  governing  bodies  of  sports  have  a  say  in  the  type  of  bets  offered  to  punters,  and  for  bookmakers  to  set  up  ""audit  trails""  -  something  the  new  betting  exchanges  already  do  -  to  allow  suspicious  betting  patterns  to  be  traced.  |||    Lord  Faulkner  of  Worcester,  who  chaired  the  inquiry,  said:  ""Whilst  we  accept  that  the  greater  part  of  sports  betting  is  neither  corrupt  nor  unfair  to  punters,  the  evidence  convinces  us  that  the  growth  of  betting  exchanges  -  because  of  the  facility  they  provide  to  bet  against  a  result  -  has  increased  the  potential  for  corruption.  ""It  is  important  that  the  government  works  with  sporting  administrators  to  review  the  difficulties  faced  by  governing  bodies  in  convicting  the  guilty  and  penalising  them  appropriately.""  The  panel's  aim  was  to  try  to  define  what  constitutes  cheating,  assess  how  much  might  be  going  on  and  suggest  what  the  government  might  do  to  put  it  right.  As  well  as  the  growth  of  internet  and  mobile  phone  betting,  there  has  been  the  creation  of  betting  exchanges  which  allow  punters  to  fix  odds  between  themselves.  Betting  exchanges  allow  punters  to  back  (to  win)  but  also  lay  (to  lose)  a  horse.  This  means  they  can  control  their  odds  at  winning  by  placing  their  money  both  ways."

The  US  telecoms  market  is  consolidating  fast,  with  former  long-distance  giant  AT&T  being  bought  by  former  subsidiary  SBC  earlier  this  year  for  $16bn.  MCI  exited  bankruptcy  in  April,  having  gone  bust  under  previous  name  WorldCom.  The  bankruptcy  followed  its  admission  in  2002  that  it  illegally  booked  expenses  and  inflated  profits.  |||    Shareholders  lost  about  $180bn  when  the  company  collapsed,  while  20,000  workers  lost  their  jobs.  Former  Worldcom  boss  Bernie  Ebbers  is  currently  on  trial,  accused  of  overseeing  an  $11bn  fraud.  Qwest  has  itself  come  under  suspicion  of  sub-standard  behaviour,  paying  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  $250m  in  October  to  settle  charges  that  it  manipulated  its  results  to  keep  Wall  Street  happy.  |||    MCI  is  the  US's  second-biggest  long  distance  firm  after  AT&T.  Consolidation  in  the  US  telecommunications  industry  has  picked  up  in  the  past  few  months  as  companies  look  to  cut  costs  and  boost  client  bases.  A  merger  between  MCI  and  Verizon  would  be  the  fifth  billion-dollar  telecoms  deal  since  October.  Last  week,  SBC  Communications  agreed  to  buy  its  former  parent  and  phone  trailblazer  AT&T  for  about  $16bn.  Buying  MCI  would  give  either  Qwest  or  Verizon  access  to  MCI's  global  network  and  business-based  subscribers.  The  rationale  is  similar  to  the  one  underpinning  SBC's  AT&T  deal.  Verizon  is  by  far  the  bigger  company  and  has  its  own  successful  mobile  arm  -  factors  which  may  have  swung  the  board  in  its  favour  since  both  suitors  are  offering  a  mixture  of  cash  and  shares." 

0	"GSK  aims  to  stop  Aids  profiteers  |||    One  of  the  world's  largest  manufacturers  of  HIV/Aids  drugs  has  launched  an  initiative  to  combat  the  smuggling  of  cheaper  pills  -  supplied  to  poorer  African  countries  -  back  into  Europe  for  resale  at  far  higher  price.  |||    The  company,  GlaxoSmithKline,  is  to  alter  the  packaging  and  change  the  colour  of  the  pills,  currently  provided  to  developing  nations  under  a  humanitarian  agreement.  It  is  estimated  that  drugs  companies  are  losing  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  each  year  as  a  result  of  the  diversion  of  their  products  in  this  way.  This  is  a  very  sensitive  area  for  the  big  drugs  companies.  They  want  to  maintain  their  profits,  but  have  been  put  under  tremendous  pressure  to  provide  cheap  anti-Aids  drugs  to  the  world's  poorest  nations.  |||    The  result  is  that  drugs  supplied  to  Africa  are  now  more  than  thirty  times  cheaper  than  those  sold  in  Europe;  bringing  these  medicines  within  the  reach  of  millions  of  HIV-positive  Africans  through  their  government's  health  care  systems.  |||    But  the  wide  difference  in  price  also  means  that  there  are  big  gains  to  be  made  from  illegally  diverting  these  cheaper  drugs  back  into  wealthier  countries  and  re-selling  them  at  a  higher  price.  GlaxoSmithKline  believes  that  by  coating  the  pills  destined  for  Africa  in  a  red  dye  and  adding  new  identification  codes  both  onto  the  pills  and  on  the  packaging,  then  this  trade  can  be  substantially  reduced.  The  company  says  that  it  will  then  be  possible  to  identify  specific  distributors  in  Africa  who  have  re-sold  humanitarian  drugs  for  profit,  as  well  as  those  suppliers  in  Europe  that  have  also  been  involved  in  the  trade.  Glaxo  says  distribution  of  the  new-look  drugs  has  already  begun  and  that  their  chemical  content  is  identical  to  those  currently  being  sold  in  Europe."

At  the  same  time,  retail  sales  picked  up  faster  than  at  any  time  since  1997.  The  news  sent  Tokyo  shares  to  an  eight-month  high,  as  investors  hoped  for  a  recovery  from  the  three  quarters  of  contraction  seen  from  April  2004  on.  The  Nikkei  225  index  ended  the  day  up  0.7%  at  11,740.60  points,  with  the  yen  strengthening  0.7%  against  the  dollar  to  104.53  yen.  Weaker  exports,  normally  the  engine  for  Japan's  economy  in  the  face  of  weak  domestic  demand,  had  helped  trigger  a  0.1%  contraction  in  the  final  three  months  of  last  year  after  two  previous  quarters  of  shrinking  GDP.  Only  an  exceptionally  strong  performance  in  the  early  months  of  2004  kept  the  year  as  a  whole  from  showing  a  decline.  The  output  figures  brought  a  cautiously  optimistic  response  from  economic  officials.  ""Overall  I  see  a  low  risk  of  the  economy  falling  into  serious  recession,""  said  Bank  of  Japan  chief  Toshihiko  Fukui,  despite  warning  that  other  indicators  -  such  as  the  growth  numbers  -  had  been  worrying.  |||    Within  the  overall  industrial  output  figure,  there  were  signs  of  a  pullback  from  the  export  slowdown.  Among  the  best-performing  sectors  were  key  overseas  sales  areas  such  as  cars,  chemicals  and  electronic  goods.  With  US  growth  doing  better  than  expected  the  picture  for  exports  in  early  2005  could  also  be  one  of  sustained  demand.  Electronics  were  also  one  of  the  keys  to  the  improved  domestic  market,  with  products  such  as  flat-screen  TVs  in  high  demand  during  January." 

2	"Brown  outlines  third  term  vision  |||    Gordon  Brown  has  outlined  what  he  thinks  should  be  the  key  themes  of  New  Labour's  next  general  election  bid.  |||    He  said  ensuring  every  child  in  Britain  had  the  best  start  in  life  could  be  a  legacy  to  match  the  NHS's  creation.  The  chancellor  has  previously  planned  the  party's  election  strategy  but  this  time  the  role  will  be  filled  by  Alan  Milburn  -  a  key  ally  of  Tony  Blair.  The  premier  insisted  Mr  Brown  will  have  a  key  role  in  Labour's  campaign,  and  praised  his  handling  of  the  economy.  |||    Writing  in  the  Guardian  newspaper,  Mr  Brown  outlined  his  view  of  the  direction  New  Labour  should  be  taking.  ""As  our  manifesto  and  our  programme  for  the  coming  decade  should  make  clear,  Labour's  ambition  is  not  simply  tackling  idleness  but  delivering  full  employment;  not  just  attacking  ignorance,  disease  and  squalor  but  promoting  lifelong  education,  good  health  and  sustainable  communities.""  BBC  political  editor  Andrew  Marr  said  that  Mr  Brown's  article  was  ""a  warning  shot""  to  Mr  Blair  not  to  try  and  cut  him  out  of  the  manifesto  writing  process.  ""It  was,  as  always,  coded  and  careful...  but  entirely  deliberate,""  was  Mr  Marr's  assessment.  The  prime  minister  was  asked  about  Mr  Brown's  article  and  about  his  election  role  when  he  appeared  on  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme.  Mr  Blair  said  a  decision  had  yet  to  be  taken  over  how  the  election  would  be  run  but  the  chancellor's  role  would  be  ""central"".  Mr  Blair  argued  that  under  New  Labour  the  country  had  changed  for  the  better  and  that  was  ""in  part""  because  of  Mr  Brown's  management  of  the  economy.  And  he  pledged  childcare  would  be  a  ""centrepiece""  of  Labour's  manifesto.  He  also  predicted  the  next  general  election  will  be  a  ""tough,  tough  fight""  for  New  Labour.  But  the  prime  minister  insisted  he  did  not  know  what  date  the  poll  would  take  place  despite  speculation  about  5  May.  Mr  Blair  said  he  was  taking  ""nothing  for  granted""  ahead  of  the  vote  -  warning  that  the  Tory  strategy  was  to  win  power  via  the  back  door  by  hinting  they  were  aiming  to  cut  Labour's  majority  instead  of  hoping  for  an  outright  win." 

3	"Robinson  out  of  Six  Nations  |||    England  captain  Jason  Robinson  will  miss  the  rest  of  the  Six  Nations  because  of  injury.  |||    Robinson,  stand-in  captain  in  the  absence  of  Jonny  Wilkinson,  had  been  due  to  lead  England  in  their  final  two  games  against  Italy  and  Scotland.  But  the  Sale  full-back  pulled  out  of  the  squad  on  Wednesday  because  of  a  torn  ligament  in  his  right  thumb.  The  30-year-old  will  undergo  an  operation  on  Friday  but  England  have  yet  to  name  a  replacement  skipper.  |||    Robinson  said:  ""This  is  very  disappointing  for  me  as  this  means  I  miss  England's  last  two  games  in  the  Six  Nations  at  Twickenham  and  two  games  for  my  club,  Sale  Sharks.  ""But  I'm  looking  to  be  back  playing  very  early  in  April.""  |||    Robinson  picked  up  the  injury  in  the  19-13  defeat  to  Ireland  at  Lansdowne  Road  on  Saturday.  And  coach  Andy  Robinson  said:  ""I  am  hugely  disappointed  for  Jason.  ""As  England  captain  he  has  been  an  immense  figure  during  the  autumn  internationals  and  the  Six  Nations,  leading  by  example  at  all  times.  I  look  forward  to  having  him  back  in  the  England  squad.""  The  announcement  is  the  latest  setback  for  Robinson's  injury-depleted  squad.  |||    Among  the  key  figures  already  missing  are  Jonny  Wilkinson,  Mike  Tindall,  Will  Greenwood,  Julian  White  and  Phil  Vickery  -  a  list  which  leaves  Robinson  short  on  candidates  for  the  now  vacant  captaincy  role.  Former  England  skipper  Jeremy  Guscott  told  BBC  Radio  Five  Live  his  choice  would  be  Matt  Dawson,  even  though  he  is  does  not  hold  a  regular  starting  place.  |||    ""The  obvious  choice  is  Dawson""  said  Guscott.  ""Especially  given  that  Harry  Ellis  did  not  have  his  best  game  at  scrum-half  on  Saturday.  ""Dawson  has  the  credentials  and  the  experience,  even  though  his  winning  record  at  captain  is  not  great.  ""The  other  option  in  Martin  Corry,  who  is  the  standout  forward  at  the  moment.  ""Unfortunately  England  cannot  rely  on  leaders  on  the  field  at  the  moment.""  England  will  announce  their  squad  for  the  12  March  game  against  Italy  on  Saturday." 

0	"Yukos  loses  US  bankruptcy  battle  |||    A  judge  has  dismissed  an  attempt  by  Russian  oil  giant  Yukos  to  gain  bankruptcy  protection  in  the  US.  |||    Yukos  filed  for  Chapter  11  protection  in  Houston  in  an  unsuccessful  attempt  to  halt  the  auction  of  its  Yugansk  division  by  the  Russian  authorities.  The  court  ruling  is  a  blow  to  efforts  to  get  damages  for  the  sale  of  Yugansk,  which  Yukos  claims  was  illegally  sold.  Separately,  former  Yukos  boss  Mikhail  Khodorkovsky  began  testimony  on  Friday  in  his  trial  for  fraud  and  tax  evasion.  |||    Mr  Khodorkovsky  -  who  has  been  in  jail  for  more  than  a  year  -  pleaded  not  guilty  to  the  charges  brought  against  him  and  denied  involvement  in  any  criminal  activities.  ""I  pride  myself  on  heading  for  15  years  a  number  of  successful  companies  and  helping  other  enterprises  rise  from  their  knees,""  he  told  a  Russian  court.  |||    Yugansk  was  auctioned  to  help  pay  off  $27.5bn  (£14.5bn)  in  unpaid  taxes.  It  was  bought  for  $9.4bn  by  a  previously-unknown  group,  which  was  in  turn  bought  up  almost  immediately  by  state-controlled  oil  company  Rosneft.  |||    Texas  Judge  Letitia  Clark  said  Yukos  did  not  have  enough  of  a  US  presence  to  establish  US  jurisdiction.  ""The  vast  majority  of  the  business  and  financial  activities  of  Yukos  continue  to  occur  in  Russia,""  Judge  Clark  said  in  her  ruling.  ""Such  activities  require  the  continued  participation  of  the  Russian  government.""  Yukos  had  argued  that  a  US  court  was  entitled  to  declare  it  bankrupt  before  its  Yugansk  unit  was  sold,  since  it  has  local  bank  accounts  and  its  chief  finance  officer  Bruce  Misamore  lives  in  Houston.  Yukos  claimed  it  sought  help  in  the  US  because  other  forums  -  Russian  courts  and  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights  -  were  either  unfriendly  or  offered  less  protection.  Russia  had  indicated  it  would  in  any  case  not  abide  by  the  rulings  of  the  US  courts.  |||    In  her  ruling,  the  judge  acknowledged  that  ""it  appears  likely  that  agencies  of  the  Russian  government  have  acted  in  a  manner  that  would  be  considered  confiscatory  under  United  States  law"".  But  she  said  her  role  was  simply  to  decide  on  jurisdiction.  The  US  court's  jurisdiction  had  been  challenged  by  Deutsche  Bank  and  Gazpromneft,  a  former  unit  of  Russian  gas  monopoly  Gazprom  which  is  due  to  merge  with  Rosneft.  Analysts  said  the  ability  of  Gazprom  and  Rosneft  to  trade  freely  overseas  had  been  stifled  while  the  ownership  of  Yugansk  remained  unclear.  |||    Yukos  said  it  would  consider  its  options  in  light  of  the  ruling.  However,  it  claimed  that  the  court  had  backed  its  argument  in  four  out  of  five  key  issues.  ""We  believe  the  merits  of  our  case  are  strong  and  simple,""  said  chief  executive  Steven  Theede.  ""Our  assets  were  illegally  seized.  We  want  them  back  or  damages  paid.""" 

2	"'Fido'  to  be  taken  off  vote  lists  |||    The  risk  of  pets  and  children  being  given  votes  could  be  cut  by  changing  how  people  register  to  vote,  the  UK  elections  watchdog  has  said.  |||    Those  are  some  of  the  mistakes  found  under  the  current  system,  where  one  person  in  each  household  applies  for  voting  forms  for  the  other  occupants.  The  Electoral  Commission  says  enabling  people  to  register  individually  could  cut  some  errors  and  combat  fraud.  Voters  need  to  register  by  11  March  if  the  next  poll  is  on  5  May  as  expected.  But  any  individual  registration  scheme  would  not  be  introduced  in  Britain  before  that  general  election.  |||    The  proposed  scheme  would  mean  voters  using  individual  ""identifiers""  when  they  vote  -  such  as  their  own  voting  number,  date  of  birth  and  signature.  The  Electoral  Commission  says  having  voters  register  individually  rather  than  the  head  of  household  do  it  for  them  fits  better  with  human  rights  laws.  Chairman  Sam  Younger  told  MPs  on  Tuesday  care  was  needed  to  ensure  that  people  were  not  lost  off  the  register  in  the  process  -  which  happened  when  Northern  Ireland  switched  to  a  similar  system.  There  have  been  rare  cases  when  household  pets  have  been  put  on  the  electoral  roll,  the  MPs  heard.  And  some  people  have  registered  all  their  family,  regardless  of  their  age  -  birth  dates  are  not  included  on  the  forms  so  election  officers  cannot  easily  check.  Non-British  citizens  who  are  not  entitled  to  vote  have  also  been  registered  in  some  cases.  |||    Mr  Younger  said  there  was  anecdotal  evidence  of  inaccuracies  in  the  register,  the  vast  majority  of  which  were  caused  by  genuine  mistakes.  He  argued  local  councils  could  look  harder  at  promoting  targeted  campaigns  at  ""hard  to  reach""  voters,  for  example.  Some  authorities  already  run  such  programmes  but  in  others  councillors  worry  about  the  party  political  impact  of  encouraging  particular  areas  to  turn  out.  Mr  Younger  said  using  the  Royal  Mail's  postal  redirection  service  had  already  helped  election  officers  retrace  about  50,000  voters.  |||    He  argued  individual  registration  would  also  increase  security  for  postal  ballots  and  other  new  ways  of  voting.  There  have  been  fears  there  are  too  few  checks  to  ensure  current  postal  votes  are  cast  by  the  person  on  the  voting  form.  He  said  it  might  also  help  register  students  in  halls  of  residences,  where  the  hall  warden  often  has  to  do  the  job  for  everybody.  The  MPs  on  the  Office  of  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Constitutional  Affairs  select  committees  pressed  Mr  Younger  on  how  to  avoid  losing  voters  in  any  changeover.  He  said  the  Northern  Ireland  example  illustrated  real  difficulties  to  be  confronted.  Currently,  British  voters  have  to  re-register  to  vote  every  year  or  face  being  removed  from  the  electoral  rolls  if  they  fail  to  do  so  two  years  running.  Mr  Younger  suggested  the  re-registration  could  happen  less  frequently  but  argued  efforts  were  needed  to  check  the  electoral  rolls  were  up-to-date."

Producer  Barry  Weissler  said  he  was  ""deeply  proud""  of  the  show,  but  said  the  decision  to  close  it  was  ""painful  but  fiscally  responsible"".  Applegate,  who  starred  in  TV  comedy  Married  With  Children,  had  been  hoping  to  make  her  Broadway  debut  in  the  show.  The  33-year-old  injured  herself  while  performing  in  Chicago,  and  had  been  hoping  to  recover  in  time  for  its  official  New  York  opening  on  21  April.  She  had  received  mixed  reviews  for  performances  in  Minneapolis  and  Chicago.  Previews  of  the  $7.5m  (£4m)  show  were  due  to  begin  on  4  April.  Sweet  Charity  tells  the  story  of  Charity  Hope  Valentine,  a  dancer  who  always  falls  in  love  with  the  wrong  man.  It  was  first  performed  on  Broadway  in  1966  with  Gwen  Verdon  in  the  title  role,  while  Shirley  MacLaine  starred  in  the  1969  film  version." 

2	"Amnesty  chief  laments  war  failure  |||    The  lack  of  public  outrage  about  the  war  on  terror  is  a  powerful  indictment  of  the  failure  of  human  rights  groups,  Amnesty  International's  chief  has  said.  |||    In  a  lecture  at  the  London  School  of  Economics,  Irene  Khan  said  human  rights  had  been  flouted  in  the  name  of  security  since  11  September,  2001.  She  said  the  human  rights  movement  had  to  use  simpler  language  both  to  prevent  scepticism  and  spread  a  moral  message.  And  it  had  to  fight  poverty,  not  just  focus  on  political  rights  for  elites.  |||    Ms  Khan  highlighted  detentions  without  trial,  including  those  at  the  US  camp  at  Guantanamo  Bay  in  Cuba,  and  the  abuse  of  prisoners  as  evidence  of  increasing  human  rights  problems.  ""What's  a  new  challenge  is  the  way  in  which  this  age-old  debate  on  security  and  human  rights  has  been  translated  into  the  language  of  war,""  she  said.  ""By  using  the  language  of  war,  human  rights  are  being  sidelined  because  we  know  human  rights  do  not  apply  in  times  of  war.""  Ms  Khan  said  such  breaches  were  infectious  and  were  now  seen  in  almost  very  major  country  in  the  world.  ""The  human  rights  movement  faces  a  crisis  of  faith  in  the  value  of  human  rights,""  she  said.  That  was  accompanied  by  a  crisis  of  governance,  where  the  United  Nations  system  did  not  seem  able  to  hold  countries  to  account.  |||    The  Amnesty  secretary-general  said  a  growing  gap  between  the  perceived  influence  of  human  rights  group  and  what  they  could  actually  achieve  was  fuelling  scepticism.  ""Public  passivity  on  the  war  against  terror  is  the  single  most  powerful  indictment  on  the  failures  of  human  rights  groups,""  she  said.  Ms  Khan  said  the  movement  had  failed  to  mobilise  public  outrage  about  what  was  happening  to  the  human  rights  system.  There  needed  to  be  a  drive  to  use  simpler  language,  talking  about  the  basic  morality  of  the  issues  rather  than  the  complexity  of  legal  processes.  Such  efforts  could  make  the  issues  more  relevant  to  people  across  the  world,  she  said.  |||    The  human  rights  groups  also  had  to  recognise  there  were  new  groups  which  had  to  be  tackled  in  new  ways  as  power  dripped  away  from  state  governments.  Al-Qaeda,  for  example,  was  not  going  to  be  impressed  by  a  traditional  Amnesty  letter  writing  campaign.  More  also  needed  to  be  done  to  develop  a  human  rights  framework  for  international  business  corporations.  Amnesty  International  members  voted  in  2001  to  extend  the  organisation's  work  from  political  and  civil  rights  to  cover  social  and  economic  rights  too.  Ms  Khan  said  the  human  rights  movement  would  make  itself  irrelevant  if  it  turned  away  from  the  suffering  caused  by  economic  strife.  ""We  would  be  an  elitist  bunch  working  for  the  elites,  for  those  who  cannot  read  the  newspaper  of  their  choice  rather  than  those  who  cannot  read,""  she  said.  Despite  her  concerns,  Ms  Khan  dubbed  herself  a  ""hope-monger"",  saying  she  was  confident  the  passions  of  the  human  rights  movement  could  overcome  the  new  challenges."

Venezuela  has  also  offered  to  supply  120,000  barrels  of  fuel  oil  a  month  to  China.  Venezuela  -  the  world's  fifth  largest  oil  exporter  -  sells  about  60%  of  its  output  to  the  United  States.  Mr  Chavez's  administration,  which  has  a  strained  relationship  with  the  US,  is  trying  to  diversify  sales  to  reduce  its  dependence  on  its  largest  export  market.  |||    China's  quick-growing  economy's  need  for  oil  has  contributed  to  record-high  oil  prices  this  year,  along  with  political  unrest  in  the  Middle  East  and  supply  bottlenecks.  Oil  prices  are  finishing  the  year  roughly  30%  higher  than  they  were  in  January  2004.  |||    In  2004,  according  to  forecasts  from  the  Ministry  of  Commerce,  China's  oil  imports  will  be  110m  tons,  up  21%  on  the  previous  year.  China  has  been  a  net  importer  of  oil  since  the  mid  1990's  with  more  than  a  third  of  the  oil  and  gas  it  consumes  coming  from  abroad.  A  lack  of  sufficient  domestic  production  and  the  need  to  lessen  its  dependence  on  imports  from  the  Middle  East  has  meant  that  China  is  looking  to  invest  in  other  potential  markets  such  as  Latin  America.  Mr  Chavez,  who  is  visiting  China,  said  his  country  would  put  its  many  of  its  oil  facilities  at  the  disposal  of  China.  Chinese  firms  would  be  allowed  to  operate  15  mature  oil  fields  in  the  east  of  Venezuela,  which  could  produce  more  than  one  billion  barrels,  he  confirmed.  The  two  countries  will  also  continue  a  joint  venture  agreement  to  produce  stocks  of  the  boiler  fuel  orimulsion.  Mr  Chavez  has  also  invited  Chinese  firms  to  bid  for  gas  exploration  contracts  which  his  government  will  offer  next  year  in  the  western  Gulf  of  Venezuela.  The  two  countries  also  signed  a  number  of  other  agreements  covering  other  industries  including  mining." 

2	"EU  rules  'won't  stop  UK  spending'  |||    The  shape  of  the  UK's  economy  In  graphics  |||    But  he  denied  that  he  was  ruling  out  British  membership  of  the  euro  despite  saying  there  would  be  no  assessment  of  the  five  economic  tests  this  year.  Mr  Brown  said  that  it  was  vital  the  UK  continued  to  invest  in  infrastructure,  science,  and  education  in  the  future.  Otherwise  it  would  be  overtaken  by  the  likes  of  China,  he  told  MPs.  |||    The  chancellor  said  that  the  EU's  planned  changes  in  the  growth  and  stability  pact  -  designed  to  ensure  that  countries  in  the  euro  zone  do  not  borrow  too  much  -  would  force  Britain  to  run  a  budget  surplus  of  1%  over  the  economic  cycle.  |||    Under  Mr  Brown's  rules,  the  UK  current  budget  must  be  in  balance  over  the  economic  cycle,  but  public  investment  is  not  counted  as  part  of  that  deficit.  He  told  the  House  of  Commons  Treasury  Select  Committee  that  the  EU  rules  ""make  it  difficult  for  a  low  debt  country  to  run  the  investment  programmes  that  are  necessary  to  improve  its  infrastructure"".  But  he  argued  that  the  EU  was  moving  in  the  direction  of  the  UK  principles,  and  would  eventually  recognise  the  need  to  consider  budget  deficits  over  a  longer  period  than  one  year,  to  include  investment,  and  to  take  more  account  of  the  total  size  of  government  debt  as  well  as  the  balance  each  year.  Under  Mr  Brown's  ""sustainable  investment""  rule,  government  debt  should  be  under  40%  -  in  contrast  to  the  60%  allowed  under  the  growth  and  stability  pact.  |||    Mr  Brown  vigorously  denied  Conservative  claims  that  he  had  in  effect  fiddled  the  figures  to  ensure  that  he  met  his  own  fiscal  rules.  In  March  the  Office  of  National  Statistics  (ONS)  reclassified  £3.4bn  of  spending  on  road  repairs  as  public  investment  -  shortly  before  the  chancellor  announced  in  the  Budget  that  he  would  meet  his  own  fiscal  budget  rule  by  only  £6bn.  Conservative  Michael  Fallon  asked  Mr  Brown  whether  the  Treasury  had  leaned  on  ONS  to  make  this  change,  and  said  that  the  ONS  had  received  a  written  paper  from  the  Treasury  on  this  matter.  But  the  chancellor  said  Mr  Fallon  was  ""impugning  the  integrity""  of  the  Office  of  National  Statistics  and  said  the  decision  had  been  made  completely  independently.  Mr  Brown  also  denied  that  he  was  increasing  taxes  to  fund  his  spending  gap.  He  told  the  Treasury  Select  Committee  that  a  growing  economy  meant  more  people  in  work  and  more  profits  for  companies  which  would  boost  Treasury  coffers.  |||    Earlier,  ex-Conservative  chancellor  Ken  Clarke  welcomed  a  relaxation  of  the  rules  governing  the  euro  zone.  Speaking  on  Radio  4's  Today  programme,  Mr  Clarke  said  political  give  and  take  would  replace  more  ""rigid""  rules.  But  fellow  Tory  David  Heathcoat-Amory  said  the  folly  of  the  system  was  in  trying  to  run  Europe's  varied  economies  on  one  set  of  rules.  ""The  essential  point  here  is  that  the  stability  and  growth  pact  has  turned  out  to  be  a  fake,""  he  said.  ""The  warning  is  about  the  European  constitution,  which  we  are  going  to  have  a  vote  on  in  a  year  or  two,  and  that  centralises  and  entrenches  these  rules  in  a  constitution.  It  gives  more  powers  to  Brussels  to  co-ordinate  things  like  employment  and  economic  policy.""  But,  speaking  to  the  Treasury  Select  Committee,  Gordon  Brown  said  that  the  new  stability  pact  rules  were  not  part  of  a  binding  Treaty  and  could  be  changed  again  the  future  -  potentially  opening  the  way  for  future  euro  membership.  ""The  conditions  for  euro  entry  are  unchanged  by  this  new  decision  about  the  stability  and  growth  pact,""  Mr.  Brown  said."

The  settlement  will  be  put  to  the  courts  for  approval  next  week.  Enron  went  bankrupt  in  2001  after  it  emerged  it  had  hidden  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  in  debt.  |||    Before  its  collapse,  the  firm  was  the  seventh  biggest  public  US  company  by  revenue.  Its  demise  sent  shockwaves  through  financial  markets  and  dented  investor  confidence  in  corporate  America.  |||    ""The  settlement  is  very  significant  in  holding  these  outside  directors  at  least  partially  personally  responsible,""  William  Lerach,  the  lawyer  leading  the  class  action  suit  against  Enron,  said.  ""Hopefully,  this  will  help  send  a  message  to  corporate  boardrooms  of  the  importance  of  directors  performing  their  legal  duties,""  he  added.  Under  the  terms  of  the  $168m  settlement  -  $155m  of  which  will  be  covered  by  insurance  -  none  of  the  18  former  directors  will  admit  any  wrongdoing.  The  deal  is  the  fourth  major  settlement  negotiated  by  lawyers  who  filed  a  class  action  on  behalf  of  Enron's  shareholders  almost  three  years  ago.  So  far,  including  the  latest  deal,  just  under  $500m  (£378.8m)  has  been  retrieved  for  investors.  |||    However,  the  latest  deal  does  not  include  former  Enron  chief  executives  Ken  Lay  and  Jeff  Skilling.  Both  men  are  facing  criminal  charges  for  their  alleged  misconduct  in  the  run  up  to  the  firm's  collapse.  Neither  does  it  cover  Andrew  Fastow,  who  has  pleaded  guilty  to  taking  part  in  an  illegal  conspiracy  while  he  was  chief  financial  officer  at  the  group.  Enron's  shareholders  are  still  seeking  damages  from  a  long  list  of  other  big  name  defendants  including  the  financial  institutions  JP  Morgan  Chase,  Citigroup,  Merrill  Lynch  and  Credit  Suisse  First  Boston.  The  University  of  California  said  the  trial  in  the  case  is  scheduled  to  begin  in  October  2006.  It  joined  the  lawsuit  in  December  2001alleging  ""massive  insider  trading""  and  fraud,  claiming  it  had  lost  $145m  on  its  investments  in  the  company." 

1	"Film  star  Fox  behind  theatre  bid  |||    Leading  actor  Edward  Fox  is  one  of  the  men  behind  plans  to  reopen  a  Swansea  theatre  thought  to  be  Wales'  oldest.  |||    The  star  of  film  and  TV  hits  Day  of  the  Jackal  and  Edward  and  Mrs  Simpson  has  joined  forces  with  Swansea-born  actor-director  Terry  Palmer.  They  will  set  up  a  charity  to  raise  money  to  buy  the  Palace  Theatre,  and  hope  to  reopen  it  to  audiences  in  summer  2006.  It  is  estimated  that  £500,000  is  needed  to  buy  the  Grade  II  listed  building.  The  Palace  Theatre,  which  will  be  known  as  The  Pavilion  Repertory  Theatre,  was  sold  to  an  undisclosed  bidder  at  auction  13  months  ago  for  £340,000.  Before  that  it  had  been  used  as  a  nightclub  for  10  years.  |||    Oscar-winner  Sir  Anthony  Hopkins,  who  was  born  in  nearby  Port  Talbot,  made  his  professional  debut  there,  and  Charlie  Chaplin  and  Lily  Langtry  have  also  trodden  its  boards.  Fox  told  the  South  Wales  Evening  Post  that  after  visiting  the  theatre  he  was  surprised  by  its  beauty.  ""A  lot  of  money  needs  to  be  spent  on  it,  but  all  the  bones  are  there  -  it  just  needs  a  beautiful  skin,""  he  said.  |||    ""To  call  it  a  jewel  is  not  an  over-estimation.  There  are  not  many  theatres  left  like  this.  ""The  hope  for  the  immediate  future  is  that  we  can  attract  enough  people  to  come  forward  to  allow  it  to  prosper,""  he  told  the  newspaper.  |||    Fox  first  found  fame  in  the  1960s.  One  of  his  most  memorable  roles  was  as  an  assassin  in  the  Day  of  the  Jackal  in  1973,  and  he  won  a  TV  Bafta  as  the  Prince  of  Wales  in  1980  for  Edward  and  Mrs  Simpson.  He  was  brought  on  board  to  save  the  theatre  by  Mr  Palmer,  a  long-standing  friend  of  40  years.  ""Two  years  ago  I  decided  to  return  to  Swansea  and  do  something  for  the  city,""  said  Mr  Palmer.  He  said  he  was  excited  by  the  idea  of  running  the  Palace  as  a  charity  where  young  actors  could  develop,  and  with  an  annual  Shakespeare  festival  in  the  summer.  ""If  in  five  years'  time  the  theatre  can  function  in  all  areas  without  me,  I  shall  be  well  satisfied  having  helped  to  create  a  vital  living  theatre  for  the  city,""  he  added.  Keith  Poulton,  a  business  adviser  from  Swansea,  has  already  committed  an  undisclosed  amount  of  money  to  the  project.  ""We  need  at  least  £75,000  to  secure  a  deposit  on  the  building  and  we've  only  got  two  months  to  do  that,""  said  Mr  Poulton.  ""A  few  benefactors  have  expressed  their  interest  and  Mr  Fox  is  going  to  give  it  an  awful  lot  of  time,""  he  added.  Last  year,  roads  around  the  theatre  were  cordoned  off  when  masonry  from  its  roof  fell  onto  a  car,  but  engineers  said  they  were  happy  that  it  was  safe."

Christian  Aid  condemned  the  move,  saying  it  would  see  almost  a  million  jobs  in  Bangladesh  alone  being  axed.  However,  supporters  of  the  change  claim  it  will  mean  increased  efficiency  and  lower  costs  for  Western  consumers.  |||    It  will  also  see  more  jobs  created  in  India  and  China,  advocates  argue.  The  WTO  said  that  many  developing  countries  support  the  end  of  quotas  and  stressed  that  funding  was  available  to  countries  such  as  Bangladesh  to  help  them  make  the  transition  to  a  fully  liberalised  market.  ""There  will  be  a  period  of  adjustment  required,""  said  WTO  spokesman  Keith  Rockwell.  ""Some  countries  will  do  better  than  others  but  there  is  no  one  who  is  suggesting  that  no  developing  country  will  do  well  out  of  this.  ""Some  countries  where  it  may  appear  that  orders  will  dry  up  have  seen  orders  surging  and  there  are  many  companies  who  will  continue  with  existing  trading  relationships.""  |||    Christian  Aid  has  called  on  British  firms  not  to  simply  ""cut  and  run""  but  look  after  their  workers,  in  a  new  report  called  Rags  To  Riches  To  Rags.  |||    It  added  that  with  few  employment  alternatives  available  many  sacked  garment  workers  could  end  up  in  far  worse  jobs  -  with  some  of  the  mainly  female  workers  forced  into  the  sex  trade.  The  WTO  itself  has  warned  that  as  many  as  27  million  jobs  could  be  lost  as  a  result  of  liberalisation  in  the  textile  industry.  Some  of  the  world's  fastest  developing  countries  which  rely  on  textile  exports  to  build  growth  -  for  example  in  Bangladesh  textiles  account  for  almost  85%  of  the  country's  exports  and  the  industry  employs  around  1.5  million  people.  The  MFA  pact  has  helped  developing  countries  get  a  bigger  share  of  the  world  market.  ""The  losers  in  this  new  trade  landscape  will  be  some  of  the  most  vulnerable  workers  in  countries  such  as  Bangladesh,  Cambodia,  Sri  Lanka  and  Nepal,""  Andrew  Pendleton,  Christian  Aid's  head  of  Trade  Policy,  said.  ""They  will  be  hard-pressed  to  cope  when  garment  industries  there  lose  their  protection.  ""We  are  deeply  concerned  that  the  New  Year  will  spell  misery  for  huge  numbers  of  garment  workers.""  The  WTO  said  there  was  no  consenus  among  its  members  to  retain  the  quotas  and  emphasised  that  funding  was  available  to  countries  such  as  Bangladesh  to  help  them  adjust  to  the  liberalised  market.  |||    It  added  that  the  impact  of  the  changes  for  workers  most  affected  by  the  shake-up  had  not  been  considered,  adding  such  seismic  changes  to  policy  should  ""put  the  interests  of  poor  people  first  -  rather  than  simply  aiming  to  liberalise  markets  at  any  cost"".  While  the  current  MFA  was  not  perfect,  its  did  allow  Third  World  countries  like  Bangladesh  to  get  onto  the  first  rung  of  industrial  development,  Christian  Aid  said.  ""International  trade  must  not  be  governed  by  a  'race  to  the  bottom'  that  pitches  one  set  of  poor  people  against  another,""  Mr  Pendleton  added." 

0	"Q&A:  Malcolm  Glazer  and  Man  Utd  |||    The  battle  for  control  of  Manchester  United  has  taken  another  turn  after  the  club  confirmed  it  had  received  a  fresh  takeover  approach  from  US  business  tycoon  Malcolm  Glazer.  |||    No  formal  offer  has  been  made  yet,  but  Manchester  United  have  confirmed  they  have  received  a  ""detailed  proposal""  from  the  US  entrepreneur  which  could  lead  to  a  bid.  Reports  have  put  the  offer  at  300p  per  share,  which  would  value  Manchester  United  at  about  £800m  ($1.5bn).  The  approach  by  the  76-year-old  owner  of  the  Tampa  Bay  Buccaneers  American  football  team  is  reportedly  being  led  by  his  two  sons,  Avi  and  Joel.  A  previous  approach  to  the  United  board  by  Mr  Glazer  in  October  last  year  was  turned  down.  However,  the  BBC  has  learnt  that  the  club  is  unlikely  to  reject  the  latest  plan  out  of  hand.  |||    Mr  Glazer's  previous  offer  involved  borrowing  large  amounts  of  money  to  finance  any  takeover.  That  would  have  left  the  club  with  debt  levels  which  were  deemed  ""not...  in  the  best  interests  of  the  company""  by  Manchester  United's  board  when  they  rejected  his  approach  last  year.  However,  Mr  Glazer's  latest  offer  is  reported  to  have  cut  the  amount  of  borrowing  needed  by  £200m.  |||    While  United's  board  may  be  casting  a  serious  eye  over  Mr  Glazer's  latest  proposals,  supporters  remain  fiercely  opposed  to  any  deal.  |||    Supporters'  group  Shareholders  United  -  which  has  proved  adept  in  rallying  opposition  to  Mr  Glazer's  campaign  -  said  it  would  fight  any  move.  ""Manchester  United  are  a  debt-free  company.  We  don't  want  to  fall  into  debt  and  we  don't  need  to  fall  into  debt,""  Shareholders  United's  Sean  Bones  told  the  BBC.  United's  players  also  appear  unhappy  at  the  prospect  of  a  takeover.  ""A  lot  of  people  want  the  club's  interest  to  be  with  people  who  have  grown  up  with  the  club  and  got  its  interests  at  heart,""  Rio  Ferdinand  told  BBC  Radio  Five  Live.  ""No-one  knows  what  this  guy  will  be  bringing  to  the  table.""  |||    The  key  to  any  successful  bid  will  be  attracting  the  support  of  United's  largest  shareholders,  the  Irish  horse  racing  tycoons  John  Magnier  and  JP  McManus.  Through  their  Cubic  Expression  vehicle  they  own  28.9%  of  the  club.  Mr  Glazer  owns  28.1%.  Joe  McLean,  a  football  specialist  at  accountancy  firm  Grant  Thornton,  said  the  support  of  Mr  Magnier  and  Mr  McManus  was  ""utterly  crucial"".  ""Mr  Glazer's  bid  will  not  proceed  without  their  support  and  they  have  previously  indicated  that  they  are  holding  their  stake  as  an  investment.  ""If  that's  the  case,  the  shares  will  therefore  need  a  price  attachment  of  about  300  pence,  maybe  305.  ""If  that's  the  case  then  Mr  Glazer  might  well  secure  their  support  -  if  he  does,  this  bid  could  well  go  ahead.""  |||    Indeed  it  is.  Malcolm  Glazer  was  little-known  in  the  UK  until  he  started  to  build  up  his  stake  in  Manchester  United  in  late  2003.  In  February  2004  he  said  he  was  ""considering""  whether  to  bid  for  the  club.  No  bid  emerged,  but  Mr  Glazer  continued  to  increase  his  holding  in  the  club.  In  October  2004,  Manchester  United  said  they  had  received  a  ""preliminary  approach"",  which  turned  out  to  have  come  from  Mr  Glazer.  However,  the  board  rejected  the  move  because  of  the  amount  of  debt  it  would  involve.  At  the  club's  annual  general  meeting  in  November,  Mr  Glazer  took  revenge  by  using  his  hefty  stake  in  the  club  to  oust  three  directors  from  the  board.  Legal  adviser  Maurice  Watkins,  commercial  director  Andy  Anson  and  non-executive  director  Philip  Yea  were  voted  out,  against  the  wishes  of  chief  executive  David  Gill.  But  the  move  led  to  bankers  JP  Morgan  and  public  relations  firm  Brunswick  withdrawing  from  the  Glazer  bid  team."

Casino  Royale  was  turned  into  a  spoof  spy  movie  by  John  Huston  in  1967,  with  David  Niven  in  the  lead  role.  Pierce  Brosnan  led  the  past  four  Bond  films  but  said  producers  axed  him  after  offering  him  the  chance  to  return.  Among  the  favourites  to  take  over  the  coveted  role  are  Scottish  actor  Dougray  Scott,  Oscar  nominee  Clive  Owen  and  Australian  star  Hugh  Jackman.  Producers  say  no  decision  has  yet  been  made  on  who  will  become  the  seventh  actor,  including  Niven,  to  play  Bond  on  film.  Kill  Bill  director  Quentin  Tarantino  had  talked  of  wanting  to  take  on  the  Casino  Royale  project,  and  said  he  had  spoken  to  Brosnan  about  it.  |||    Shooting  on  Casino  Royale  is  expected  to  begin  once  Campbell  has  finished  work  on  The  Legend  of  Zorro,  a  sequel  to  The  Mask  of  Zorro,  starring  Catherine  Zeta  Jones  and  Antonio  Banderas.  Producers  Barbara  Broccoli  and  Michael  G  Wilson  expect  the  film  to  be  released  in  2006.  |||    The  script  will  once  again  be  developed  by  Neal  Purvis  and  Robert  Wade  who  have  both  worked  on  two  previous  Bond  movies.  Fleming's  book  saw  the  introduction  of  Bond  pitted  against  a  Russian  spy  in  a  game  of  baccarat.  Simultaneously,  a  woman  arrives  on  the  scene  to  take  his  eye  off  the  game.  The  novel  is  one  of  Fleming's  most  violent  and  sadistic  stories,  with  007  suffering  a  savage  beating  from  his  nemesis  Le  Chiffre.  In  addition  to  the  1967  film,  it  was  also  adapted  for  television  in  1954  with  actor  Barry  Nelson  as  an  Americanised  ""Jimmy""  Bond.  MGM  Vice  Chairman  Chris  McGurk  said:  ""Martin  (Campbell)  is  an  incredibly  exciting  film-maker.  Goldeneye  was  a  wonderful  movie  and  helped  reinvigorate  the  Bond  franchise.  We're  thrilled  to  have  him  back  to  direct  the  newest  Bond.""  New  Zealand-born  Campbell  moved  to  the  UK  in  1966  and  directed  TV  series  such  as  The  Professionals,  Minder  and  Bergerac.  His  film  credits  include  Edge  of  Darkness,  Vertical  Limit  and  Beyond  Borders,  which  starred  Angelina  Jolie  and  Clive  Owen." 

1	"Charity  single  for  quake  relief  |||    Singers  including  Sir  Cliff  Richard  and  Boy  George  are  recording  a  charity  single  to  help  raise  funds  for  victims  of  the  Asian  tsunami.  |||    They  hope  the  song  will  raise  more  than  £2m  for  the  relief  fund.  The  song,  titled  Grief  Never  Grows  Old  and  described  as  a  melancholy  ballad,  was  written  by  radio  DJ  Mike  Read.  Former  Boyzone  singer  Ronan  Keating  may  also  take  part  if  a  studio  can  be  found  close  to  where  he  is  holidaying  in  Switzerland.  Other  music  stars  being  approached  include  Robin  and  Barry  Gibb  of  The  Bee  Gees,  jazz  sensation  Jamie  Cullum,  Chris  Rea  and  Olivia  Newton-John.  |||    Sir  Cliff  has  recorded  his  vocal  part  in  Barbados,  while  Boy  George  has  recorded  his  in  New  York.  Read  wrote  the  song  before  the  Boxing  Day  tragedy  but  had  thought  it  was  too  gloomy  to  release.  Now  he  plans  to  have  it  recorded  by  a  collection  of  pop  stars  under  the  name  One  World  Project.  ""It's  a  natural  home  for  it  because  people  kept  saying  to  me,  'it's  such  a  good  song',  but  it's  such  a  sad  song,""  Read  said.  |||    He  said  the  song  was  a  slow  ballad  and  would  work  with  around  10  singers,  rather  than  a  ""sing-along""  like  the  Band  Aid  20  single  raising  money  for  famine  relief  in  Africa.  The  backing  track  has  already  been  recorded  and  organisers  hope  it  can  be  finished  within  the  next  week  to  get  it  into  record  shops  as  soon  as  possible.  Read  went  to  the  Disasters  Emergency  Committee  (DEC),  which  is  co-ordinating  the  British  relief  effort,  with  the  idea  the  day  after  Boxing  Day.  ""I  was  totally  shocked  at  the  enormity  and  suddenness  of  the  disaster  and  in  tears  on  seeing  the  orphaned  children  wandering  aimlessly  in  search  of  their  parents,""  he  said.  Read  said  all  the  funds  raised  by  the  record  would  go  to  the  DEC.  ""I'd  only  be  pleased  in  terms  of  what  it  meant  for  sales  if  it  got  to  number  one,""  he  added.  The  charity  welcomed  the  news  of  the  single  and  said  money  raised  would  help  its  agencies  working  in  the  affected  region  to  rebuild  survivors'  lives  and  livelihoods." 

2	"Labour  faces  'cold  calls'  inquiry  |||    Labour  is  to  be  investigated  by  a  watchdog  over  claims  its  election  campaign  has  broken  the  rules  on  ""cold  calling""  householders.  |||    The  information  commissioner  is  to  look  into  a  complaint  from  the  Lib  Dems  about  how  Labour  uses  its  call  centres.  The  Lib  Dems  say  Labour  is  telephoning  people  who  have  signed  up  to  make  sure  they  do  not  get  marketing  calls.  Labour  denies  breaking  rules.  It  says  calls  are  not  marketing  if  they  just  ask  about  people's  voting  intentions.  The  party  says  it  would  expect  the  watchdog  to  take  complaints  seriously  but  it  has  clear  legal  advice  on  the  issue.  |||    Telephone  call  centres  are  expected  to  be  used  as  never  before  by  all  the  three  major  parties  in  the  run-up  to  the  general  election.  But  seven  million  telephone  numbers  are  on  the  Telephone  Preference  Service  (TPS)  lists,  which  ban  unsolicited  sales  and  marketing  calls.  Lib  Dem  chairman  Matthew  Taylor  has  written  to  the  watchdog  accusing  Labour  of  a  ""flagrant  and  systematic  breach""  of  the  laws  governing  the  TPS.  |||    He  says  the  initial  call  may  not  be  marketing  but  it  identifies  voters  to  whom  the  party  can  send  promotional  material  in  the  future.  His  letter  to  the  commissioner  quotes  from  a  Labour  Party  handbook  about  ""identifying  target  voters"".  And  it  quotes  a  Stevenage  Labour  Party  members'  newsletter  explaining  how  voters  will  be  telephoned  about  their  voting  intentions.  |||    The  voters  are  put  in  24  categories  according  to  their  last  known  voting  intention,  ranging  from  ""Labour  (firm)""  to  ""target  (Conservative)""  -  those  who  supported  the  party  in  the  past  but  this  time  will  be  voting  Tory.  The  newsletter  says:  ""Using  the  information  we  know  about  people,  we  can  send  them  direct  mailings.  ""For  example,  we  could  send  the  target  (Conservative)  people  a  letter  from  someone  who  had  defected  from  the  Tories  to  Labour  explaining  the  reasons  why  voting  Tory  is  a  bad  idea  or  we  could  send  Labour  (weak)  people  a  letter  encouraging  them  to  sign  up  for  a  postal  vote.""  |||    Mr  Taylor  tells  the  commissioner:  ""It  is  clear  beyond  peradventure  from  the  above  that  the  Labour  Party  is  engaging  in  a  large-scale  voter  ID  project  for  subsequent  promotional  purposes  through  targeted  and  segmented  mailings.  ""Insofar  as  this  project  is  directed  at  TPS  subscribers,  it  is  equally  clear  that  it  is  unlawful.""  The  Lib  Dems  raised  worries  about  Labour  and  Conservative  calls  in  February  and  680  people  have  signed  up  to  the  website  they  set  up  to  help  people  to  complain.  A  party  official  said  there  was  only  scattered  evidence  of  the  Tories  breaking  the  rules  but  people  had  complained  every  day  about  Labour.  |||    A  spokeswoman  for  the  Information  Commissioner's  Office  said  it  was  examining  one  complaint  about  political  calls  -  understood  to  be  Mr  Taylor's.  ""We  are  investigating  one  of  the  complaints  where  some  evidence  has  been  given  to  us,""  she  said.  ""Obviously  evidence  is  needed  for  us  to  start  investigations.""  The  commissioner's  office  will  now  examine  the  Lib  Dem  evidence.  ""The  guidance  is  that  cold  calling  can  be  made  as  long  as  no  marketing  is  going  on,""  said  the  spokeswoman.  If  Labour  is  judged  to  have  broken  the  rules,  it  will  be  asked  stop  immediately.  If  it  fails  to  do  so  after  two  or  three  warning  letters,  the  commissioner  can  issue  an  enforcement  notice  spelling  out  what  the  party  needs  to  do  or  stop  doing.  |||    The  party  could  appeal  against  the  decision  to  an  Information  Tribunal.  If  the  appeal  fails  and  it  continues  breaking  the  rules,  it  could  be  fined  up  to  £5,000.  Labour  says  it  avoids  those  on  TPS  lists  when  telephoning  people  about  membership  or  fundraising  but  not  when  making  ""voter  identification""  calls.  Asked  about  the  commissioner's  inquiry,  a  Labour  spokesman  told  BBC  News:  ""We  expect  the  information  commissioner  to  take  any  complaint  seriously.  However,  we  are  absolutely  clear  that  we  haven't  broken  any  rules.  ""As  the  information  commissioner  himself  has  said,  if  people  are  not  marketing  something,  if  they  are  asking  them  which  way  they  are  going  to  vote,  they  are  not  in  breach  of  the  law.  ""We  always  ask  everyone  we  phone  up  whether  they  would  be  happy  to  be  contacted  by  the  Labour  Party  again."""

President  Susilo  Bambang  Yudhoyono's  government  has  said  it  wants  to  curb  fuel  subsidies  and  direct  the  money  into  aid  programmes  for  the  poor.  But  critics  argue  cutting  subsidies  will  hurt  the  poorer  families  that  his  government  says  it  wants  to  help.  Millions  of  people  were  left  homeless  in  Indonesia  Aceh's  region  following  the  earthquake  and  tsunami  disaster  in  late  December.  |||    Indonesia  pays  subsidies  to  importers  in  order  to  stabilise  domestic  fuel  prices,  but  higher  oil  prices  have  forced  the  government  to  spend  more  on  holding  prices  down.  It  spent  59.2  trillion  rupiah  ($6.58bn;  £3.5bn)  on  fuel  subsidies  in  2004,  a  sum  far  in  excess  of  its  original  projection  of  14.5  trillion  rupiah.  Since  President  Yudhoyono's  government  came  to  power  in  October,  it  has  indicated  its  intention  of  raising  domestic  fuel  prices  by  cutting  subsidies.  ""The  (January  to  March)  quarter  of  this  year  is  the  best  time  for  us  to  increase  fuel  prices,""  said  Sri  Mulyani  Indrawati,  State  Minister  for  National  Development  Planning.  ""We  are  still  considering  if  a  30%  hike  is  suitable  at  the  moment.  The  sooner  the  better  for  the  state  budget.""  The  BBC's  correspondent  in  Jakarta,  Rachel  Harvey,  told  World  Business  Report  that  there  was  likely  to  be  a  strong  public  reaction  to  any  price  rise.  ""The  big  question  is  whether  they  go  for  one  big,  short,  sharp  shock  and  raise  prices  between  20%  and  30%  or  whether  they  try  to  stagger  it,""  she  said.  Indonesia's  previous  government,  led  by  President  Megawati  Sukarnoputri,  also  attempted  to  cut  subsidies  in  2003,  but  was  forced  to  back  down  in  the  face  of  public  protests." 

2	"UK  youth  'interested'  in  politics  |||    The  majority  of  young  people  are  interested  in  politics,  holding  ""strong  opinions""  on  policies  and  have  a  ""keen  appetite""  for  direct  action.  |||    Research  undertaken  for  voting  watchdog  the  Electoral  Commission  suggests  81%  of  16  to  20-year-olds  feel  strongly  about  issues  like  crime  and  education.  The  survey  findings  are  being  released  to  coincide  with  the  launch  of  the  Y  Vote  Mock  Elections  2005  initiative.  Mock  elections  are  planned  to  take  place  in  schools  across  the  UK.  |||    Electoral  Commission  boss  Sam  Younger  said:  ""We  know  that  young  people  often  feel  disengaged  from  democratic  life  and  we  believe  in  working  creatively  to  encourage  their  interest  and  participation.  ""Mock  elections  can  play  an  extremely  valuable  role  in  helping  young  people  understand  how  the  democratic  process  works  and  why  it  matters,""  he  said.  The  survey  of  a  sample  of  500  British  16  to  20-year-olds  and  500  21  to  25-year  olds  ""showed  Britain's  young  people  are  far  from  apathetic  about  issues  that  matter  to  most  of  their  lives"".  The  Y  Vote  initiative  is  being  run  jointly  by  the  Electoral  Commission,  the  Hansard  Society  and  the  Department  for  Education  and  Skills  in  the  run-up  to  local  elections  and  the  general  election,  possibly  on  5  May.  Michael  Rafferty,  who  is  mock  elections  project  manager  at  the  Hansard  Society,  said  he  looked  forward  to  seeing  schools  and  colleges  across  the  UK  participating  in  the  mock  votes."

Julia  Roberts  won  her  10th  consecutive  crown  as  favourite  female  movie  star.  Johnny  Depp  was  favourite  male  movie  star  and  Renee  Zellweger  was  favourite  leading  lady  at  Sunday's  awards  in  LA.  |||    Film  sequel  Shrek  2  took  three  prizes  -  voted  top  animated  movie,  top  film  comedy  and  top  sequel.  In  television  categories,  Desperate  Housewives  was  named  top  new  drama  and  Joey,  starring  former  Friends  actor  Matt  LeBlanc,  was  best  new  comedy.  Long-running  shows  Will  and  Grace  and  CSI:  Crime  Scene  Investigation  were  named  best  TV  comedy  and  TV  drama  respectively.  |||    Nominees  for  the  People's  Choice  Awards  were  picked  by  a  6,000-strong  Entertainment  Weekly  magazine  panel,  and  winners  were  subsequently  chosen  by  21  million  online  voters.  Fahrenheit  9/11  director  Michael  Moore  dedicated  his  trophy  to  soldiers  in  Iraq.  His  film  was  highly  critical  of  President  George  W  Bush  and  the  US-led  invasion  of  Iraq,  and  Moore  was  an  outspoken  Bush  critic  in  the  2004  presidential  campaign  inwhich  Democratic  challenger  John  Kerry  lost.  |||    ""This  country  is  still  all  of  ours,  not  right  or  left  or  Democrat  or  Republican,""  Moore  told  the  audience  at  the  ceremony  in  Pasadena,  California.  Moore  said  it  was  ""an  historic  occasion""  that  the  31-year-old  awards  ceremony  would  name  a  documentary  its  best  film.  Unlike  many  other  film-makers,  Passion  of  the  Christ  director  Mel  Gibson  has  vowed  not  to  campaign  for  an  Oscar  for  his  movie.  ""To  me,  really,  this  is  the  ultimate  goal  because  one  doesn't  make  work  for  the  elite,""  Gibson  said  backstage  at  the  event.  ""To  me,  the  people  have  spoken."""

A  last-gasp  touchdown  from  Luke  Narraway  pulled  the  visitors  level.  But  Gloucester  missed  out  on  victory  when  Henry  Paul  fluffed  the  conversion  and  Seti  Kiole  was  denied  a  late  try.  Newcastle  had  a  couple  of  chances  at  the  start  of  the  second  half  with  line-outs  in  the  corner.  But  they  failed  to  make  them  count  until  Joe  Shaw  found  Dave  Walder,  who  released  Mark  Mayerholfer  in  his  own  22.  |||    The  former  All  Black  broke  clear  and  popped  the  ball  up  for  Tait  on  halfway.  He  chipped  ahead  for  Michael  Stephenson  to  scorch  through  for  the  try,  which  Walder  converted  to  give  Newcastle  a  lifeline.  They  grabbed  it  with  both  hands,  Mayerhofler  breaking  through  and  Tait  making  a  brilliant  early  run  to  cut  inside  and  race  30m  to  score.  Walder  converted  to  make  it  22-20  before  he  was  just  wide  with  a  40m  penalty  in  the  70th  minute.  |||    Mayerhofler  then  scythed  through  the  middle  for  a  try  after  Hall  Charlton  popped  the  ball  up,  and  Walder's  conversion  took  Newcastle  27-22  ahead.  With  three  minutes  of  normal  time  left,  Narraway  was  driven  over  for  a  try  in  the  corner  which  levelled  the  scores  at  27-27.

The  ban  threatens  to  reignite  tensions  between  the  regulator  and  British  American  Tobacco,  which  plans  to  become  China's  first  foreign  cigarette  maker.  A  spokeswoman  for  Bat  declined  to  comment  on  the  report.  |||    ""China  won't  allow  any  new  tobacco  factories  to  be  built,  including  joint  ventures"",  said  Xing  Wangli,  a  spokesman  for  the  State  Tobacco  Administration  Monopoly  quoted  in  China  Daily.  He  also  said  that  the  state  would  retain  its  monopoly  on  cigarette  distribution.  China  has  350  million  smokers  who  consumer  1.7  trillion  cigarettes  a  year.  Smoking  is  fashionable  in  China,  where  it  is  seen  as  an  essential  -  and  manly  -  sociable  touch  for  some  jobs,  such  as  salesmen.  More  young,  urban  woman  are  taking  up  smoking  too.  In  July  2004,  Bat  announced  it  had  won  approval  for  to  build  a  $1.5bn  (£800m)  joint  venture  factory  in  China  which  would  make  it  the  first  foreign  cigarette  maker  to  manufacture  there.  |||    The  State  Tobacco  Monopoly  Administration  said  a  week  later  that  it  had  not  approved  the  deal,  leading  to  an  embarrassing  public  row.  Bat  told  the  BBC  at  that  time  that  it  had  not  negotiated  with  the  STMC,  and  secured  approval  from  ""the  highest  levels  of  government"".  Since  then,  the  row  has  flared  occasionally,  most  recently  at  a  forum  in  November.  Bat  consistently  declines  to  comment.  ""Xing's  statement  comes  as  especially  bad  news  for  British  American  Tobacco"",  the  China  Daily  newspaper  said  of  the  latest  development.  The  Bat  spokeswoman  said:  ""There  is  nothing  for  us  to  add...since  our  announcement  in  July  last  year.  The  central  government  of  China  is  the  authority  that  approved  our  strategic  investment.""  The  decision  to  ban  further  tobacco  factories  does  not  apply  to  deals  made  before  2005,  according  to  the  French  news  agency  AFP.  The  joint  venture  factory  was  expected  to  take  till  2006  to  build.  The  Bat  spokeswoman  would  not  comment  on  its  progress.  However,  if  the  STMA  continues  to  take  a  tough  stance,  expansion  opportunities  could  be  limited.  |||    China's  tobacco  market  is  increasingly  valuable  as  anti-smoking  campaigners  target  public  smoking  in  the  West.  China  Daily  said  the  market  was  currently  enjoying  steady  growth,  making  more  than  210bn  yuan  ($25.4bn)  in  pre-tax  profits  last  year,  almost  double  the  figure  in  2000.  The  paper  made  no  mention  of  health  concerns.  The  STMA  is  trying  to  restructure  the  domestic  tobacco  industry,  closing  some  factories,  though  such  moves  can  be  unpopular  with  local  governments." 

2	"Peace  demo  appeal  rejected  |||    Peace  protestors  have  lost  a  landmark  appeal  over  police  actions  in  stopping  an  anti-war  demonstration  days  after  the  start  of  the  Iraq  war.  |||    They  had  appealed  against  a  High  Court  decision  that  it  was  not  unlawful  for  police  to  forcibly  turn  protestors  away  near  RAF  Fairford,  Glos,  in  2003.  The  police  had  also  sought  to  overturn  a  breach  of  human  rights  ruling  arising  from  the  same  case.  Sitting  on  Wednesday,  three  Appeal  Court  judges  dismissed  both  appeals.  They  were  challenging  decisions  by  two  judges  in  the  High  Court  in  February  this  year.  It  followed  action  by  police,  when  three  coachloads  of  people  were  searched  and  detained  on  the  way  to  RAF  Fairford  and  forced  to  return  to  London  under  police  escort.  The  demonstrators  appealed  against  a  finding  by  Lord  Justice  May  and  Mr  Justice  Harrison  that  it  was  not  unlawful  for  the  police  to  turn  the  passengers  away.  |||    The  police  were  urging  Lord  Chief  Justice  and  Lord  Justices  Clarke  and  Rix  to  overturn  the  ruling  that  they  had  breached  the  protestors'  human  rights  by  detaining  them  in  the  coaches.  Craig  Mackey,  assistant  chief  constable  of  Gloucestershire  Police,  said:  ""We  have  always  considered  that  our  responses  were  proportionate  and  all  our  decisions  on  the  day  were  based  on  intelligence.""  He  said  no  one  on  the  coaches  accepted  responsibility  for  items  found  on  the  coaches  including  body  armour,  a  smoke  bomb  and  five  shields.  ""Given  these  circumstances,  and  the  fact  that  RAF  Fairford,  and  other  military  installations  in  the  UK,  had  been  the  scene  of  increasingly  destructive  disorder  in  the  weeks  preceding  this  incident,  the  police  commander  on  the  ground  made  the  decision  to  turn  back  the  coaches.  ""From  day  one  we  have  vigorously  defended  this  decision,  which  was  made  out  of  a  genuine  concern  that  if  the  coaches  were  allowed  to  proceed  it  would  have  resulted  in  disorder  and  criminal  damage  at  RAF  Fairford.""  Fairford  Coach  Action,  representing  more  than  80  people  who  appealed  against  the  police  actions,  say  they  are  prepared  to  take  their  case  to  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights.  Their  action  is  supported  by  Amnesty  International  and  Liberty." 

2	"Guantanamo  pair's  passport  ban  |||    The  government  has  written  to  two  of  the  British  men  freed  from  Guantanamo  Bay  telling  them  they  will  not  be  allowed  passports.  |||    A  letter  sent  to  Martin  Mubanga  said  his  British  passport  would  not  be  issued  in  the  light  of  evidence  gathered  against  him  by  the  US.  This  suggested  he  was  likely  to  take  part  in  action  against  UK  or  allied  targets  if  he  left  Britain,  it  said.  An  identical  letter  has  been  sent  to  Feroz  Abbasi,  the  men's  solicitor  says.  |||    It  is  not  known  whether  the  other  two  men  released  from  the  Cuba  detention  camp  in  January  -  Richard  Belmar  and  Moazzam  Begg  -  have  also  received  letters.  The  government  is  implementing  the  rarely  used  Royal  Prerogative  in  order  to  withdraw  the  men's  passports.  It  is  only  the  13th  time  the  power  has  been  used  since  1947  -  the  last  time  was  in  1976.  The  letter,  from  the  Home  Office,  says:  ""I  am  writing  to  inform  you  that  on  the  basis  of  the  information  which  has  come  to  light  during  your  detention  by  the  United  States,  the  home  secretary  considered  that  there  are  strong  grounds  for  believing  that,  on  leaving  the  United  Kingdom,  you  would  take  part  in  activities  against  the  United  Kingdom,  or  allied  targets.""  |||    The  Home  Office  said  it  could  not  comment  on  individual  cases.  |||    The  Liberal  Democrats  say  they  suspect  the  move  is  part  of  a  package  of  security  measures  agreed  with  the  US  in  order  for  the  men  to  be  allowed  home  from  Guantanamo  Bay.  |||    Home  Affairs  spokesman  Mark  Oaten  also  demanded  assurances  that  the  evidence  against  the  men  was  not  gained  under  torture.  He  added:  ""The  power  should  only  be  used  in  absolute  extreme  circumstances  and  I  find  it  hard  to  believe  that  these  conditions  have  been  met  this  time.""  He  said  the  move  also  raised  complex  questions  about  the  use  of  the  Royal  Prerogative.  The  Liberal  Democrats  have  promised  to  raise  the  issue  in  Parliament.  |||    Amnesty  International  UK  also  questioned  whether  the  decisions  had  been  based  on  ""torture  evidence""  obtained  at  Guantanamo  Bay.  ""Furthermore,  we  believe  there  should  be  an  investigation  into  the  role  played  by  the  UK  in  the  detention  of  UK  residents  and  nationals  and  possibly  many  others  at  Guantanamo  Bay,""  said  director  Kate  Allen.  The  men's  solicitor,  Louise  Christian,  has  raised  questions  about  whether  the  evidence  was  gathered  through  torture.  But  the  Pentagon  told  BBC  News  US  policy  ""condemns  and  prohibits""  torture  and  said  there  was  no  evidence  that  any  British  detainee  was  tortured  or  abused.  Mr  Abbasi,  23,  from  Croydon,  south  London,  was  taken  to  Guantanamo  Bay  after  being  captured  in  Afghanistan  in  2001.  Mr  Mubanga,  29,  from  north  London,  was  originally  detained  in  Zambia." 

1	"No  UK  premiere  for  Rings  musical  |||    The  producers  behind  the  Lord  of  the  Rings  musical  have  abandoned  plans  to  premiere  the  show  in  London  because  no  suitable  theatre  was  available.  |||    The  £11.5m  show  will  make  its  debut  in  Toronto  in  March  2006,  after  it  was  found  that  all  three  West  End  theatres  with  sufficient  capacity  were  booked.  The  musical  is  not  expected  in  London  before  December  2006.  Producer  Kevin  Wallace  said  it  would  be  ""worth  waiting  for"".  ""It  will  be  like  nothing  they  have  ever  seen  before.""  ""I  know  there  will  be  a  lot  of  disappointed  British  Tolkien  fans  who  hoped  to  see  the  show  in  London,  but  we  couldn't  get  a  London  theatre  in  time,""  added  the  British  producer.  The  world  premiere  of  the  stage  musical,  co-produced  by  Canadian  theatrical  impresarios  David  and  Ed  Mirvish,  will  take  place  at  Toronto's  Princess  of  Wales  Theatre  next  year.  |||    ""Toronto  really  wanted  this  premiere.  The  Tolkien  books  and  films  are  hugely  popular  in  Canada,""  said  Mr  Wallace,  shortly  after  signing  the  deal  in  Canada.  ""We  hope  the  anticipation  and  excitement  over  here  will  create  an  even  bigger  buzz  by  the  time  we  open  in  London.""  Auditions  begin  in  Canada  on  Thursday,  but  up  to  five  British  actors  may  join  the  cast,  under  a  deal  struck  with  Canadian  Actors'  Equity.  The  music  for  the  show  is  being  written  by  Bollywood  composer  AR  Rahman,  who  was  behind  Andrew  Lloyd  Webber's  West  End  musical  Bollywood  Dreams,  and  in  conjuction  with  the  Finnish  group  Varttina.  |||    ""There  will  be  no  singing  and  dancing  Hobbits.  The  music  will  be  in  a  very  traditional  mould  and  draw  on  ethnic  traditions,""  assured  Mr  Wallace.  The  musical's  British  director  is  Matthew  Warchus,  best  known  for  staging  the  worldwide  stage  hit  Art.  ""The  production  will  be  a  hybrid  of  text,  physical  theatre,  music  and  spectacle  never  previously  seen  on  this  scale,""  he  said.  ""Only  in  the  theatre  are  we  actually  plunged  into  the  events  as  they  happen.  The  environment  surrounds  us  and  we  are  in  Middle  Earth.""  New  Zealander  Peter  Jackson  took  10  years  to  bring  JRR  Tolkien's  fantasy  trilogy  to  the  big  screen,  winning  Academy  Awards  for  best  film  and  best  director  for  the  final  film  The  Return  of  the  King  in  2004." 

1	"U2's  desire  to  be  number  one  |||    U2,  who  have  won  three  prestigious  Grammy  Awards  for  their  hit  Vertigo,  are  stubbornly  clinging  to  their  status  as  one  of  the  biggest  bands  in  the  world.  |||    The  most  popular  groups  in  the  history  of  rock  all  have  several  things  in  common.  The  music  must  be  inspired  and  appeal  across  generations  and  be  distinctive,  if  not  always  groundbreaking.  But  such  success  is  down  to  more  than  music.  They  have  to  be  compelling  performers,  charismatic  and  intelligent  enough  to  make  good  decisions  and  keep  their  feet  on  the  ground.  They  also  have  to  want  it.  They  have  to  want  to  be  the  biggest  band  ever  and  not  stop  wanting  it.  The  Beatles  had  it,  the  Rolling  Stones  still  have  it,  REM  hold  onto  it  and  Queen  were  it  in  a  catsuit.  And  U2  have  it  in  spades,  and  keep  churning  it  out.  Their  new  album,  How  To  Dismantle  An  Atomic  Bomb,  comes  28  years  after  the  schoolfriends  got  together  in  Dublin  and  17  years  after  The  Joshua  Tree  cemented  their  place  on  the  all-time  rock  A-list.  |||    They  may  have  lost  some  of  the  edginess  and  raw,  youthful  force  that  propelled  them  to  the  top,  but  they  have  lost  none  of  the  desire  or  ability  to  craft  songs  and  albums.  |||    Vertigo,  the  first  single  from  the  new  album,  went  straight  into  the  UK  singles  chart  at  number  one,  knocking  Eminem  off  the  top  spot  and  giving  them  their  26th  top  10  hit.  ""The  challenge  is  to  be  bigger  and  bolder  and  better  -  to  make  records  the  whole  world  will  listen  to,""  Bono  recently  said.  Drummer  Larry  Mullen  Jr  echoed  those  sentiments:  ""We're  very  competitive  -  we  want  to  be  on  the  radio,  have  big  singles.  We  don't  want  to  be  thought  of  as  a  veteran  band.""  The  band  have  done  ""everything  in  their  considerable  powers""  to  ensure  they  remain  the  biggest  band  in  the  world,  according  to  Q  magazine  editor  Paul  Rees.  |||    ""This  makes  them  hugely  determined  and  formidable.""  He  added:  ""They  are  equally  determined  to  push  themselves  to  make  music  that  continues  to  stand  up.  ""As  such,  they've  constantly  re-invented  and  challenged  themselves.  They  are,  perhaps,  alone  as  the  only  rock  band  that  has  got  better  with  age.""  The  other  key  ingredient  was  the  fact  they  were  highly  organised,  Mr  Rees  said.  ""They  do  everything  in  the  right  way.""  The  group  were  born  when  Mullen  put  an  appeal  for  bandmates  on  a  high  school  notice  board,  attracting  fellow  pupils  Paul  Hewson  (Bono,  vocals),  Adam  Clayton  (bass),  David  Evans  (The  Edge,  guitar)  and  his  brother  Dick.  |||    Dick  Evans  soon  dropped  out  and  the  four-piece  were  known  as  The  Feedback  and  The  Hype  before  settling  on  U2.  |||    By  1978,  they  had  won  a  talent  contest  and  got  noticed  by  a  manager,  Paul  McGuinness.  ""They  were  brilliant,  but  very  coarse,""  McGuinness  recently  said.  ""In  a  way,  they  were  doing  exactly  what  they  do  now.  Only  badly.""  They  struggled  to  attract  record  company  attention,  later  being  described  as  ""pretty  damn  average""  and  ""strange  and  eerie""  by  scouts  who  saw  them  live.  They  released  two  Ireland-only  singles,  which  topped  the  national  charts  in  1979  and  1980,  leading  to  a  deal  with  Island  and  their  debut  album  Boy.  The  stadium-filling,  anthemic  sound  was  U2's  aim  from  the  start,  and  their  third  album,  War,  saw  them  make  the  breakthrough  on  both  sides  of  the  Atlantic,  going  to  number  one  in  the  UK  and  12  in  the  US.  Songs  like  Sunday  Bloody  Sunday  and  New  Year's  Day  brought  success  and  an  image  as  a  political  and  spiritual  band  -  which  Bono  rejected  as  a  cliche.  |||    His  stage  performances  -  which  included  flag-waving,  speaker-climbing  and  drum-throwing  -  earned  him  a  reputation  as  an  electric  performer,  and  their  appearance  at  1985's  Live  Aid  is  widely  seen  as  sealing  their  global  stardom.  |||    In  1987,  The  Joshua  Tree  broke  sales  records  and  saw  the  band  reach  the  height  of  their  powers  with  hits  including  Where  the  Streets  Have  No  Name,  I  Still  Haven't  Found  What  I'm  Looking  For  and  With  Or  Without  You.  Those  songs  took  the  band's  epic,  atmospheric  sound  to  a  simple,  powerful  and  popular  pinnacle.  The  end  of  the  decade  marked  a  crucial  point  for  the  band  -  they  had  reached  the  top  but  still  yearned  for  new  challenges  and  achievements.  These  came  in  the  form  of  explorations  of  different  branches  of  rock  and  forays  into  electronic  dance  music,  plus  wildly  extravagant  stage  shows,  while  still  trying  to  retain  their  mass  appeal.  The  Achtung  Baby  album  in  1991  was  followed  by  Zooropa,  Pop  and  their  corresponding  stadium  tours,  which  featured  giant  olives,  flying  cars,  live  phone  calls  to  the  White  House  and  Bono's  transformation  into  alter-egos  The  Fly  and  MacPhisto.  He  was  also  building  a  parallel  reputation  -  not  always  to  the  pleasure  of  his  bandmates  -  as  a  campaigner  on  issues  from  global  debt  to  Aids.  Before  the  release  of  How  To  Dismantle  An  Atomic  Bomb,  they  had  sold  125  million  albums  around  the  world.  But  they  still  want  more." 

0	"WorldCom  director  admits  lying  |||    The  former  chief  financial  officer  at  US  telecoms  firm  WorldCom  has  admitted  before  a  New  York  court  that  he  used  to  lie  to  fellow  board  members.  |||    Speaking  at  the  trial  of  his  former  boss  Bernard  Ebbers,  Scott  Sullivan  said  he  lied  to  the  board  to  cover  up  the  hole  in  WorldCom's  finances.  Mr  Ebbers  is  on  trial  for  fraud  and  conspiracy  in  relation  to  WorldCom's  collapse  in  2002.  He  pleads  not  guilty.  The  firm  had  been  overstating  its  accounts  by  $11bn  (£8.5bn).  Mr  Sullivan,  42,  has  already  pleaded  guilty  to  fraud  and  will  be  sentenced  following  Mr  Ebbers'  trial,  where  he  is  appearing  as  a  prosecution  witness.  Mr  Ebbers,  63,  has  always  insisted  that  he  was  unaware  of  any  hidden  shortfalls  in  WorldCom's  finances.  |||    In  the  New  York  court  on  Wednesday,  Mr  Ebbers'  lawyer  Reid  Weingarten  asked  Mr  Sullivan:  ""If  you  believe  something  is  in  your  interest,  you  are  willing  and  able  to  lie  to  accomplish  it,  isn't  that  right?""  |||    ""On  that  date,  yes.  I  was  lying,""  replied  Mr  Sullivan.  Mr  Weingarten  has  suggested  that  Mr  Sullivan  is  implicating  Mr  Ebbers  only  to  win  a  lighter  sentence,  something  Mr  Sullivan  denies.  Mr  Sullivan  also  rejects  a  suggestion  that  he  had  once  told  fellow  WorldCom  board  member  Bert  Roberts  that  Mr  Ebbers  was  unaware  of  the  accounting  fraud  at  WorldCom.  The  trial  of  Mr  Ebbers  is  now  into  its  third  week.  |||    Under  23  hours  of  questioning  from  a  federal  prosecutor,  Mr  Sullivan  has  previously  told  the  court  that  he  repeatedly  warned  Mr  Ebbers  that  falsifying  the  books  would  be  the  only  way  to  meet  Wall  Street  revenue  and  earnings  expectations.  Mr  Sullivan  claims  that  Mr  Ebbers  refused  to  stop  the  fraud.  Mr  Ebbers  could  face  a  sentence  of  85  years  if  convicted  of  all  the  charges  he  is  facing.  WorldCom's  problems  appear  to  have  begun  with  the  collapse  of  the  dotcom  boom  which  cut  its  business  from  internet  companies.  Prosecutors  allege  that  the  company's  top  executives  responded  by  orchestrating  massive  fraud  over  a  two-year  period.  WorldCom  emerged  from  bankruptcy  protection  in  2004,  and  is  now  known  as  MCI." 

2	"Howard  attacks  'pay  later'  Budget  |||    Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  has  dismissed  Gordon  Brown's  Budget  as  ""vote  now,  pay  later""  spending  plans.  |||    The  simple  fact  was  that  under  a  new  Labour  government  taxes  would  go  up  after  the  election  to  plug  a  financial  black  hole,  Mr  Howard  said.  Everyone  could  see  the  chancellor's  ""sweeteners"",  but  these  hid  tax  rises  for  hard  working  families,  he  said.  Labour's  ""faltering  election  campaign""  would  not  be  helped  by  the  package  of  measures,  Mr  Howard  added.  |||    Mr  Brown's  Budget  was  not  about  what  was  good  for  the  country,  but  ""all  about  the  interests  of  the  Labour  party,""  the  Tory  leader  said  after  mockingly  welcoming  the  chancellor  back  to  the  election  campaign.  He  went  on  to  accuse  Mr  Brown  of  giving  with  one  hand  while  taking  away  with  the  other.  He  urged  the  chancellor  to  admit  he  had  been  responsible  for  dragging  ""millions  of  people  in  to  the  net""  to  pay  stamp  duty  and  inheritance  tax.  ""We  can  all  see  the  sweeteners,  but  they  hide  the  crippling  tax  rises  for  hard-working  families  that  are  inevitable  if  Labour  wins.""  |||    He  also  accused  the  government  and  the  chancellor  of  running  out  of  solutions  to  the  problems  Britain  faced.  ""Their  only  answer  is  to  tax,  to  spend  and  to  waste  -  to  get  people  to  vote  now  and  pay  later.""  Mr  Brown  liked  to  rattle  off  ""magical  balances  conjured  out  of  thin  air""  in  a  bid  to  convince  people  there  was  no  ""black  hole""  in  the  nation's  finances,  the  Tory  leader  said.  ""This  dodgy  government  that  brought  us  the  dodgy  dossier  is  now  publishing  a  dodgy  Budget  based  on  dodgy  numbers,""  he  said.  ""You  now  propose  to  borrow,  over  the  next  six  years,  no  less  than  £168  billion;  so  much  for  prudence.  ""The  chancellor's  forecasts  of  surpluses  are  no  better  than  the  prime  minister's  forecasts  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction.""  |||    Mr  Brown's  council  tax  rebate  for  pensioners  was  £300  less  than  what  the  Tories  were  offering,  Mr  Howard  said.  There  was  nothing  in  the  Budget  that  would  put  more  police  on  the  streets,  make  hospitals  cleaner  or  give  parents  and  teachers  the  discipline  and  skills  they  wanted  in  schools.  People  would  face  a  ""clear  choice""  at  the  election,  either  ""more  waste  and  higher  taxes  under  Labour  or  lower  taxes  and  value  for  money  with  the  Conservatives"",  he  said.  ""That's  the  battleground  of  this  election.  That's  what  this  election  is  going  to  be  all  about  and  I  say  bring  it  on,""  he  concluded,  to  loud  Tory  cheering." 

2	"Gurkhas  to  help  tsunami  victims  |||    Britain  has  offered  to  send  a  company  of  120  Gurkhas  to  assist  with  the  tsunami  relief  effort  in  Indonesia,  Downing  Street  said.  |||    The  deployment  would  involve  troops  from  the  2nd  Battalion  Royal  Gurkha  Rifles,  based  in  Brunei.  Discussions  have  begun  with  Indonesia  on  the  exact  timing  and  location  of  the  deployment,  but  the  government  said  the  offer  was  aimed  at  the  Aceh  province.  Downing  St  said  a  similar  offer  might  be  made  to  the  Sri  Lankan  government.  |||    However  a  spokesman  pointed  out  that  there  were  particular  logistical  difficulties  in  Indonesia  which  the  Gurkhas  might  be  able  to  help  with.  The  spokesman  said:  ""Following  this  morning's  daily  coordination  meeting  on  the  post-tsunami  relief  effort,  the  government  has  formally  offered  the  Indonesian  government  the  assistance  of  a  company  of  British  Army  Gurkhas  from  2nd  Battalion  Royal  Gurkha  Rifles  around  120  personnel  and  two  helicopters.  ""This  is  in  addition  to  the  ships  and  aircraft  we  have  already  committed  to  the  relief  operation  in  the  Indian  Ocean.""  |||    Indonesia  was  by  far  the  country  worst  affected  by  the  tsunami,  with  94,000  of  the  140,000  confirmed  deaths  so  far.  International  Development  Minister  Gareth  Thomas  said  the  assistance  offer  would  most  likely  focus  on  the  northern  province  of  Aceh.  ""We  have  offered  the  Gurkhas  to  help  in  the  process  of  scaling  up  the  relief  effort,  particularly  in  Aceh  which  is  undoubtedly  the  hardest  hit  area  in  the  Indian  Ocean  at  the  moment,""  he  said.  ""We've  also  had  RAF  aircraft  flying  in  equipment  which  the  UN  desperately  need  in  order  to  set  up  a  truly  effective  relief  operation  on  the  ground  in  Aceh  province  as  well.""  The  offer  comes  as  the  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw  arrives  in  Indonesia  for  a  special  summit  meeting  on  the  disaster." 

1	"Branson  show  flops  on  US  screens  |||    Entrepreneur  Sir  Richard  Branson's  US  TV  show,  The  Rebel  Billionaire,  is  proving  a  flop  in  the  ratings.  |||    The  programme  suffered  poor  viewing  figures  on  its  debut  on  the  Fox  network  three  weeks  ago,  and  has  lost  one  in  five  of  its  viewers  since  then.  The  show  is  seen  as  Fox's  answer  to  The  Apprentice  featuring  tycoon  Donald  Trump,  a  ratings  hit  for  rivals  NBC.  Sir  Richard's  show  sees  a  group  of  young  entrepreneurs  compete  to  become  the  president  of  his  business  empire.  The  Rebel  Billionaire  has  averaged  five  million  viewers  and  is  91st  in  the  rankings  of  all  prime-time  shows.  The  Apprentice,  which  has  already  completed  its  first  season,  is  still  managing  to  pull  in  16  million  viewers,  while  its  prime-time  ranking  is  number  four.  |||    But  Fox  has  said  it  plans  to  stick  with  Branson's  show  throughout  its  12-episode  run.  ""It's  going  to  remain  on  the  air,""  said  the  network's  spokesman  Scott  Grogin.  ""Creatively  we're  extremely  pleased  with  the  show  and  hope  the  audience  will  find  it,""  he  added.  Contestants  on  Sir  Richard's  show  are  confronted  with  business  tasks  to  solve,  similar  to  The  Apprentice.  They  are  also  subjected  to  stunts  like  walking  a  plank  suspended  in  mid-air.  The  Rebel  Billionaire  has  marketed  itself  as  a  less  materialistic  version  of  The  Apprentice,  with  Sir  Richard  shown  jumping  out  of  a  taxi,  while  Trump  is  seen  in  a  limousine." 

2	"Kilroy  launches  'Veritas'  party  |||    Ex-BBC  chat  show  host  and  East  Midlands  MEP  Robert  Kilroy-Silk  said  he  wanted  to  ""change  the  face  of  British  politics""  as  he  launched  his  new  party.  Mr  Kilroy-Silk,  who  recently  quit  the  UK  Independence  Party,  said  ""our  country""  was  being  ""stolen  from  us""  by  mass  immigration.  He  told  a  London  news  conference  that  Veritas  -  Latin  for  ""truth""  -  would  avoid  the  old  parties'  ""lies  and  spin"".  UKIP  leader  Roger  Knapman  says  he  is  glad  to  see  the  back  of  Mr  Kilroy-Silk.  |||    Mr  Kilroy-Silk  promised  a  ""firm  but  fair""  policy  on  immigration  and  said  they  hoped  to  contest  most  seats  at  the  forthcoming  general  election.  He  said  Veritas  would  also  announce  detailed  policies  on  crime,  tax,  pensions,  health  and  defence  over  the  next  few  weeks.  Labour  campaign  spokesman  Fraser  Kemp  said  Veritas  was  joining  ""an  already  crowded  field  on  the  right  of  British  politics"".  On  Thursday  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  is  due  to  announce  which  constituency  he  will  run  in  at  the  next  general  election  -  that  will  come  amid  speculation  he  has  his  sights  set  on  Defence  Secretary  Geoff  Hoon's  Ashfield  seat.  He  was  joined  in  the  new  venture  by  one  of  UKIP's  two  London  Assembly  members,  Damien  Hockney  who  is  now  Veritas'  deputy  leader.  UKIP's  chairman  Petrina  Holdsworth  has  said  the  group  will  just  be  a  parody  of  the  party  the  men  have  left.  |||    Mr  Kilroy-Silk  quit  UKIP  last  week  after  months  of  tension  as  he  vied  unsuccessfully  for  the  leadership  of  that  party.  He  said  he  was  ashamed  to  be  a  member  of  a  UKIP  whose  leadership  had  ""gone  AWOL""  after  the  great  opportunity  offered  by  its  third  place  at  last  June's  European  elections.  ""While  UKIP  has  turned  its  back  on  the  British  people,  I  shall  not,""  he  said.  ""I  will  be  standing  at  the  next  general  election.  I  shall  be  leading  a  vigorous  campaign  for  the  causes  I  believe  in.  ""And,  unlike  the  old  parties,  we  shall  be  honest,  open  and  straight.""  |||    Mr  Hockney  also  left  UKIP  saying  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  would  ""deliver  better""  as  the  leader  of  a  Eurosceptic  party.  A  spokesman  for  UKIP  called  on  Mr  Hockney  to  quit  the  London  Assembly.  The  party  asserts  that  Mr  Hockney  ""has  a  moral  obligation,  if  not  a  legal  one""  to  stand  down.  Its  leader,  Roger  Knapman,  has  said  he  is  glad  to  see  the  back  of  Mr  Kilroy-Silk.  ""He  has  remarkable  ability  to  influence  people  but,  sadly,  after  the  [European]  election  it  became  clear  that  he  was  more  interested  in  the  Robert  Kilroy-Silk  Party  than  the  UK  Independence  Party  so  it  was  nice  knowing  him,  now  'goodbye',""  he  said.  UKIP  officials  also  argue  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  has  not  been  ""straightforward""  in  attacking  the  party  he  once  wanted  to  lead.  |||    Veritas?  It's  the  BNP  in  an  expensive  suit!  |||    It's  all  well  and  good  Robert  Kilroy-Silk  claiming,  that  'Veritas'  is  a  party  that  doesn't  believe  in  ""lies  and  spin"",  but  the  truth  of  the  matter  is,  its  completely  useless,  due  to  proportional  representation,  there  is  no  chance  that  'Veritas'  will  have  any  chance  in  claiming  power,  and  change  the  two-horse  race  trend.  In  my  opinion  this  is  just  a  publicity  stunt  which  has  just  been  used  as  a  smoke-screen  for  his  anti-Islamism  slurs  which  got  him  sacked  from  the  television.  |||    I  think  that  his  views  regarding  immigration  are  shared  by  many.  It  really  is  time  that  the  UK  government  ceased  to  be  a  paper  tiger  on  this  issue.  In  addition  as  an  Ashfield  constituent  I  would  be  more  than  interested  in  Kilroy  -Silk  opposing  Geoff  Hoon!!  |||    Good  to  see  the  parties  of  the  right  splintering  in  the  way  the  parties  of  the  left  have  always  done.  Let's  hope  Kilroy-Silk,  UKIP  and  the  euro-sceptic  wing  of  the  Tory  Party  all  fade  further  into  obscurity  so  we  can  have  some  truth  in  the  debate  about  Europe.  We  benefit  enormously  from  our  membership  of  the  EU,  we  need  to  be  at  the  heart  of  Europe,  leading  it  and  driving  it  to  where  we  as  a  country  want  to  go,  not  running  away  from  it.  |||    All  mouth  and  trousers.  A  clown.  Trouble  is,  any  votes  he  collects  may  just  end  up  helping  New  Labour  into  a  third  term.  |||    Whatever  Kilroy-Silk  and  UKIP  do,  none  of  their  anti-European  policies  have  any  relevance  outside  middle  England.  This  new  party  might  gain  support  from  right-wing  England,  but  will  have  little  impact  in  Wales  or  Scotland.  |||    Hopefully  this  all  this  fighting  within  euro-sceptic  parties  will  allow  them  to  slip  out  of  the  way  and  get  people  voting  for  real  political  parties  which  address  more  than  one  issue.  England  needs  Europe  to  survive  and  as  soon  as  people  realise  this  the  better,  we  can't  rely  on  the  USA  forever!  |||    At  last  an  impetus  for  increasing  the  likely  40%  turn  out  for  the  election.  The  electorate  is  disillusioned  with  British  politics.  Kilroy  has  one  agenda  -  the  UK  -  and  I'll  be  voting  for  him.  |||    Both  UKIP  and  RK-S  are  representatives  of  small-mindedness  and  a  lack  of  vision  for  the  whole  of  humankind.  The  interests  of  humanity  and  the  world  lie  so  much  beyond  the  scope  of  these  people's  bickering  that  who,  in  the  overall  scheme  of  things,  really  cares  about  their  petty  tiff?  |||    Many  people  believe  you  Kilroy.  You  may  even  believe  yourself  but  switching  horses  midstream  and  then  bad  mouthing  the  steed  that  got  you  halfway  seriously  diminishes  your  credibility.  |||    The  very  idea  of  political  parties  born  out  of  such  negative  feelings  as  Euroscepticism  or  British  Supremacy  is  nauseating.  One  can  only  hope  the  public  recognise  these  extremists  for  what  they  are  and  shun  them  at  the  polls.  |||    I've  always  thought  that  Kilroy-Silk  was  a  self-publicising,  egotist  and  this  news  does  absolutely  nothing  to  alter  my  opinion.  |||    Brilliant,  about  time  this  country  had  a  plausible  party!  |||    Having  seen  the  recent  BBC  3  documentary  and  witnessed  the  thoroughly  disgraceful  chauvinistic  behaviour  of  a  number  of  senior  UKIP  figures  I  can  well  understand  why  Kilroy-Silk  feels  embarrassed  to  be  associated  with  such  people.  Hopefully  the  UKIP  members  who  are  interested  in  the  political  debate  will  support  his  action.  |||    Fantastic  news.  Pro-Europeans  now  have  far  less  to  worry  about  from  the  right.  The  Conservatives  are  as  confused  as  they  have  been  since  the  mid-1990s,  and  the  extreme  anti-Europeans  are  fracturing  themselves  into  splinter  groups  that  split  any  votes  they  might  get  in  local,  European  and  general  elections.  Robert  Kilroy-Silk's  ego  and  vanity  are  his  own  (and  his  supporters')  worst  enemy.  |||    As  a  euro-enthusiast  I  could  not  be  more  delighted  by  Kilroy-Silk's  behaviour.  He  took  a  party  that  was  just  building  up  a  head  of  steam,  and  having  exposed  it  to  ridicule  by  attempting  a  coup-d'etat,  he  is  now  setting  about  the  serious  business  of  dividing  it  in  two.  The  closer  to  straight-down-the-middle  the  better,  as  far  as  I  am  concerned,  but  in  any  eventuality,  the  two  sceptic  parties  will  exhaust  their  energies  fighting  each  other.  |||    If  every  politician  with  ambitions  to  lead  their  party  resorted  to  forming  their  own  for  that  purpose,  we'd  have  ballot  papers  a  mile  long!  You've  got  to  hand  it  to  Kilroy-Silk  for  his  sheer  arrogance  and  supreme  self-belief.  |||    Whilst  not  being  a  great  fan  of  Kilroy  I  do  agree  with  his  comments  about  the  UKIP  leadership,  and  like  him  I  am  also  leaving  UKIP.  I  believe  countless  opportunities  have  been  lost  to  discredit  the  EU  and  to  show  our  people  what  belonging  to  the  EU  really  means.  The  EU's  comments  last  week  about  Michael  Howard's  plans  to  reform  immigration  show  how  little  we  govern  our  own  country  when  they  can  turn  round  and  say  immigration  is  a  matter  for  the  EU  and  not  individual  member  states.  The  sooner  we  leave  this  corrupt  super-state  the  better  |||    Does  anyone  else  think  that  it  is  ironic  that  Euro-Sceptic  Kilroy-Silk  has  used  a  Latin  name  for  his  new  party,  rather  than  a  'good  old  British'  name?  Is  this  indicative  of  the  man  -  contradictory,  vain  and  pompous?  |||    I  think  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  has  got  a  very  good  point.  British  politics  has  become  too  PC  and  as  a  result  has  no  straight  talking  honest  strong  politicians.  They  are  all  interested  in  their  own  careers  and  not  the  people  who  put  them  in  power.  As  a  result  I  feel  our  democracy  is  being  abused  and  I  want  it  stopped.  If  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  lives  up  to  half  his  promises  he  will  get  my  vote.  |||    Honestly,  who  really  cares?  Man  with  tan  leaves  party  with  no  plan,  to  set  up  party  with  no  idea.  |||    As  one  of  Kilroy-Silk's  East  Midlands  constituents  I  hope  those  who  voted  for  him  are  proud  to  have  been  taken  in  by  such  charming  vacuity.  I  feel  insulted  by  having  him  represent  me  in  the  European  Parliament.  |||    UKIP  tried  hard  to  accommodate  Robert  Kilroy  Silk,  but  he  made  it  clear  that  only  control  of  it  would  satisfy  him.  Someone  so  keen  on  complete  control  was  bound  to  fall  foul  of  UKIP's  democratic  nature.  |||    Kilroy  is  an  able  communicator  and  a  capable  politician,  in  exactly  the  way  those  who  lead  UKIP  are  not.  He  tried  to  make  it  work,  but  they  didn't  seem  to  want  to  grow  up.  He  was  left  in  the  position  of  having  to  defend  their  gaffes  to  the  media.  This  new  party  seems  a  logical  next  step  for  Kilroy.  Good  luck  to  the  man,  I  say.  |||    Oh  please!  This  is  an  amusing  irrelevance.  There  is  absolutely  no  chance  of  either  of  these  parties  communicating  a  sensible  and  constructive  'Eurosceptic'  argument.  They  will  play  a  key  part  in  winning  the  country  round  to  the  idea  of  a  reformed,  more  democratic,  more  dynamic  Europe  Union.  Future  generations  will  thank  him  for  his  ridiculousness.  |||    The  refreshing  thing  about  Robert  is  that  he  is  open,  honest  and  straight.  What  other  politician  can  claim  this.  I  have  a  suspicion  that  he  talks  for  a  larger  part  of  the  electorate  that  his  critics  would  like.  I  shall  be  voting  for  him.  |||    The  electorate  of  the  East  Midlands  voted  not  for  Kilroy-Silk  but  for  the  UKIP.  Kilroy-Silk  was  made  an  MEP  because  of  his  position  on  the  UKIP's  party  list.  He  has  no  mandate  to  represent  the  area  and  should  resign  from  the  European  Parliament.  |||    I  wouldn't  write  off  Kilroy-Silk.  While  he's  a  clown  and  a  one  man  band  at  the  moment,  he's  a  populist  and  that's  always  dangerous.The  man  clearly  has  an  enormous  ego  and  looking  at  our  current  political  masters,  that  seems  to  be  one  of  the  factors  in  success.  |||    Good  luck  to  Kilroy  though  I  think  he  is  doing  more  harm  than  good  for  both  his  new  party  and  UKIP  because  their  vote  base  is  not  strong  enough  for  both  parties  to  be  successful  and  at  the  moment  UKIP  have  the  upper  hand  while  Veritas  are  starting  from  square  one  and  fighting  a  somewhat  uphill  battle.  |||    The  man  I  once  found  cringe  worthy  on  Day  time  TV,  could  well  turn  out  to  be  my  country's  knight  in  shining  armour.  He  expresses  views  which  are  now  more  than  common  amongst  society  today  -  but  people  are  almost  too  scared  to  express  them.  Kilroy  Silk  has  secured  my  vote,  and  many  more  like  me.  What's  more,  I  look  forward  to  the  day  when  he  claims  victory,  wrecks  the  EU,  and  rescues  my  great  nation...  without  a  hair  out  of  place  and  his  tan  as  perfect  as  ever!  |||    Great  Stuff.  The  longer  the  UK  dithers  over  Europe,  the  richer  we  in  Ireland  become,  as  the  only  English-speaking  country  fully  committed  to  Europe.  Oh  and  send  us  over  those  hard-working  immigrants  -  our  economy  needs  them.  |||    This  is  just  what  the  Europhiles  pray  for.  As  the  main  Eurosceptic  party,  UKIP  should  try  to  resolve  its  differences  with  Kilroy  to  show  a  united  front  and  give  the  UK  public  a  serious  political  voice  against  Europe.  Having  multiple  parties  with  the  same  view  point  just  splits  the  vote  further.  |||    Thank  goodness  that  Kilroy-Silk  has  gone  -  now  UKIP  at  least  has  a  chance  in  the  election!  |||    It  is  very  sad  to  see  the  cause  of  Britain  regaining  its  proper  relationship  with  Europe  damaged  by  this  split  within  UKIP.  Robert  Kilroy-Silk  could  have  a  lot  to  offer.  Instead  we  have  a  split  party  and  a  damaged  cause.  Under  the  present  electoral  system,  people  must  work  together,  and  small  parties  have  no  hope  of  representation.  Last  summer,  UKIP  achieved  a  major  advance,  partly  and  only  partly  due  to  Kilroy-Silk.  It  is  a  great  shame  this  has  been  dissipated  in  in-fighting.  |||    UKIP  has  a  wide  platform  of  policies,  not  just  withdrawal  from  the  EU.  This  Kilroy-Silk  conveniently  ignores  in  the  comments  surrounding  the  launch  of  his  own  party.  Neither  the  English  Democrats  nor  the  New  Party  were  interested  in  letting  him  join  them  and  take  over  their  leadership  speaks  volumes.  Veritas  is  the  beginning  of  the  end  for  Kilroy-Silk.  |||    If  he  believes  in  truth  and  democracy  then  he  and  the  two  assembly  members  should  resign  and  force  a  by-elections  to  stand  on  their  own  platform  rather  than  this  backdoor  approach  to  politics  of  being  elected  for  one  party  then  defecting  to  another.  |||    So  UKIP  was  good  enough  for  him  to  lead,  not  good  enough  for  him  to  follow!  |||    Interesting  that  a  party  committed  to  plain  speaking  should  have  a  Latin  name!  |||    Every  opinion  poll  points  to  an  overwhelming  anti-Europe  feeling  in  this  country.  Kilroy-Silk  could  be  on  the  verge  of  something  huge  if  he  can  broaden  his  appeal  beyond  this  one  issue.  He  is  an  extremely  able  communicator  with  years  of  political  experience.  We  wants  quality  schools,  top  hospitals,  clean  and  efficient  public  transport,  punishments  that  fit  the  crime,  limited  asylum,  a  purge  on  bureaucracy  and  less  taxes.  It  needs  courage  and  honesty,  two  qualities  sadly  lacking  in  our  politicians.  Kilroy-Silk  may  just  have  those  very  qualities.  Recruit  the  right  colleagues,  Robert,  and  your  time  may  have  come!  |||    Well  if  you  cannot  get  enough  limelight  being  an  ordinary  MP  then  go  out  and  start  up  your  own  Party.  It's  all  flash  and  no  real  policy  here  |||    Let's  hope  this  is  the  start  of  both  UKIP  and  Kilroy-Silk  slipping  into  obscurity.  |||    Veritas?  The  name  will  doom  it.  But  perhaps  I  am  wrong  for  surely  all  modern  schoolchildren  will  understand  it  since  they  do  still  learn  Latin  in  the  classroom  do  they  not?  The  whole  essence  of  what  RKS  represents  is  Euroscepticism,  so  explain  to  me  how  the  too-twee  label  of  Veritas  symbolises  that?" 

2	"Tory  leader  unveils  spending  plan  |||    Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  says  his  party  can  save  £35bn  in  government  spending  by  tackling  waste.  |||    The  money  would  be  ploughed  back  into  frontline  services  like  the  NHS  and  schools  with  the  rest  used  to  cut  government  borrowing  and  reduce  taxes.  The  Tory  leader  has  also  shrugged  off  the  defection  of  one  of  his  MPs,  Robert  Jackson,  a  former  minister,  to  Labour.  Mr  Howard  said  that  these  things  happened  in  politics  and  it  would  not  affect  the  outcome  of  the  election.  ""Let's  be  realistic  -  the  election  is  not  going  to  be  decided  on  the  basis  of  what  Mr  Jackson  did"",  he  told  BBC  1's  Breakfast  with  Frost  programme.  However  the  defection  on  Saturday  has  cast  a  shadow  over  the  launch  of  the  Conservatives'  spending  plans.  Fuller  details  are  due  to  be  unveiled  on  Monday.  |||    The  bulk  of  the  £35bn  saved  by  tackling  bureaucracy  and  inefficient  systems  will  go  back  into  frontline  services,  Mr  Howard  said.  The  £12bn  left  over  would  then  be  spent  on  reducing  government  borrowing,  he  added.  However,  the  remainder  would  deal  with  some  of  the  ""unfair  taxes"".  ""Almost  every  independent  expert  says  if  you  get  another  Labour  government  you  are  going  to  have  to  pay  higher  taxes,""  Mr  Howard  insisted.  ""Because  borrowing  is  going  up,  it  is  out  of  control,  that  is  bound  to  lead  to  higher  taxes  or  higher  interest  rates  or  both.  ""So  part  of  the  £12bn  we  are  going  to  apply  to  filling  the  government's  black  hole,  reducing  the  borrowing.  ""The  rest  will  be  used  to  reduce  these  unfair  taxes  which  are  bearing  so  heavily  on  the  people  of  our  country  today.""  |||    Mr  Howard  is  expected  to  say  that  around  £6bn  will  be  available  for  tax  cuts  when  he  makes  his  announcement  on  Monday.  The  cuts  will  be  paid  for  out  of  the  savings  identified  by  business  trouble-shooter  David  James.  Home  Office  spending  could  be  cut  by  £1.6bn,  according  to  the  final  instalment  of  his  year-long  review.  Savings  of  £153m  at  the  Foreign  Office  and  £336m  at  the  Department  for  Culture  Media  and  Sport,  have  also  been  identified.  In  all,  almost  a  quarter  of  a  million  jobs  and  168  public  bodies  would  go  under  Mr  James'  proposals.  |||    Mr  Howard  said:  ""All  this  adds  up  to  a  bottom  line  and  the  bottom  line  is  at  this  election  people  will  have  a  clear  choice  between  Mr  Blair,  who  will  waste  more  and  tax  more,  and  a  Conservative  government  that  will  give  them  value  for  money  and  tax  less.""  However,  Chief  Treasury  Secretary  Paul  Boateng  said:  ""None  of  the  Tories'  figures  add  up  so  they  can't  make  these  savings  and  can't  pay  for  any  tax  cuts,  which  means  the  only  guaranteed  cut  from  the  Tories  is  £35bn  of  cuts,  hitting  frontline  public  services  hard.""  Liberal  Democrat  leader  Charles  Kennedy  added:  ""People  will  not  be  taken  in  by  Michael  Howard's  claims  of  £35bn  worth  of  savings.  ""This  can't  be  achieved  without  drastic  cuts  in  local  services  in  their  own  communities.""  A  poll  for  the  News  of  the  World  newspaper  suggests  the  Conservatives  are  on  course  for  their  worst  election  defeat  in  a  century.  Labour  will  hold  key  marginal  constituencies,  winning  a  majority  of  160,  the  Populus  survey  suggests.  And  the  Liberal  Democrats  will  take  three  key  seats  from  the  Conservatives,  leaving  the  Tories  with  just  163  MPs,  two  less  than  they  returned  atLabour's  1997  landslide  and  their  worst  showing  since  1906." 

0	"UK  economy  facing  'major  risks'  |||    The  UK  manufacturing  sector  will  continue  to  face  ""serious  challenges""  over  the  next  two  years,  the  British  Chamber  of  Commerce  (BCC)  has  said.  |||    The  group's  quarterly  survey  of  companies  found  exports  had  picked  up  in  the  last  three  months  of  2004  to  their  best  levels  in  eight  years.  The  rise  came  despite  exchange  rates  being  cited  as  a  major  concern.  However,  the  BCC  found  the  whole  UK  economy  still  faced  ""major  risks""  and  warned  that  growth  is  set  to  slow.  It  recently  forecast  economic  growth  will  slow  from  more  than  3%  in  2004  to  a  little  below  2.5%  in  both  2005  and  2006.  |||    Manufacturers'  domestic  sales  growth  fell  back  slightly  in  the  quarter,  the  survey  of  5,196  firms  found.  Employment  in  manufacturing  also  fell  and  job  expectations  were  at  their  lowest  level  for  a  year.  |||    ""Despite  some  positive  news  for  the  export  sector,  there  are  worrying  signs  for  manufacturing,""  the  BCC  said.  ""These  results  reinforce  our  concern  over  the  sector's  persistent  inability  to  sustain  recovery.""  The  outlook  for  the  service  sector  was  ""uncertain""  despite  an  increase  in  exports  and  orders  over  the  quarter,  the  BCC  noted.  |||    The  BCC  found  confidence  increased  in  the  quarter  across  both  the  manufacturing  and  service  sectors  although  overall  it  failed  to  reach  the  levels  at  the  start  of  2004.  The  reduced  threat  of  interest  rate  increases  had  contributed  to  improved  confidence,  it  said.  The  Bank  of  England  raised  interest  rates  five  times  between  November  2003  and  August  last  year.  But  rates  have  been  kept  on  hold  since  then  amid  signs  of  falling  consumer  confidence  and  a  slowdown  in  output.  ""The  pressure  on  costs  and  margins,  the  relentless  increase  in  regulations,  and  the  threat  of  higher  taxes  remain  serious  problems,""  BCC  director  general  David  Frost  said.

The  firm,  a  market  leader  in  high-speed  internet,  had  an  operating  loss  for  the  three  months  to  December  of  7.5bn  yen  ($71.5m;  £38.4m).  But  without  the  Otoku  marketing  spend  it  would  have  made  a  profit  -  and  expects  to  move  into  the  black  in  2006.  The  firm  did  not  give  a  figure  for  the  extent  of  profits  it  expected  to  make  next  year.  It  was  born  in  the  1990s  tech  boom,  investing  widely  and  becoming  a  fast-rising  star,  till  the  end  of  the  tech  bubble  hit  it  hard.  Its  recent  return  to  a  high  profile  came  with  the  purchase  of  Japan  Telecom,  the  country's  third-biggest  fixed-line  telecoms  firm.  The  acquisition  spurred  its  broadband  internet  division  to  pole  position  in  the  Japanese  market,  with  more  than  5.1  million  subscribers  at  the  end  of  December."

1	"Stern  dropped  from  radio  stations  |||    Controversial  DJ  Howard  Stern  has  been  dropped  from  four  US  radio  stations  because  he  keeps  promoting  his  move  to  a  network  broadcasting  on  satellite.  |||    Cidatel  Broadcasting  said  Stern  had  transformed  his  show  into  a  ""continuous  infomercial  promoting  Sirius,  his  new  satellite  radio  employer"".  Stern  will  join  the  Sirius  subscription  service,  which  is  not  governed  by  US  regulators,  next  year.  Citadel  pulled  Stern's  show  from  stations  in  New  York  and  Pennsylvania.  Stern  had  been  holiday  for  two  weeks  but  his  show  did  not  return  to  the  four  stations  as  expected  on  3  January.  Citadel  said  it  did  not  yet  know  whether  it  would  return  to  its  network.  |||    Stern  announced  in  October  that  he  was  leaving  conventional  radio,  where  his  syndicated  show  goes  out  across  the  US,  for  the  relatively  restriction-free  satellite  service.  The  DJ's  broadcasts  are  well  known  for  landing  in  trouble  with  regulators  for  obscene  and  sexually  explicit  rantings.  Stern  was  dropped  by  six  stations  owned  by  media  giant  Clear  Channel  in  2004  after  it  had  to  pay  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  $1.75m  (£950,000),  over  breaches  indecency  laws.

The  SEC  also  said  it  had  brought  fraud  charges  against  two  ex-senior  executives  of  Columbia  Distributor.  Columbia  Distributor  was  part  of  FleetBoston,  bought  by  BOA  last  year.  Three  other  ex-Columbia  executives  agreed  settlements  with  the  SEC.  |||    The  SEC  has  set  itself  the  task  of  stamping  out  the  mutual  funds'  use  of  market-timing,  a  form  of  quick-fire,  short-term  share  trading  that  harms  the  interests  of  small  investors,  with  whom  mutual  funds  are  particularly  popular.  In  the  last  two  years,  it  has  imposed  penalties  totalling  nearly  $2bn  on  15  funds.  The  SEC  unveiled  two  separate  settlements,  one  covering  BOA's  direct  subsidiaries,  and  another  for  businesses  that  were  part  of  FleetBoston  at  the  time.  In  both  cases,  it  said  there  had  been  secret  deals  to  engage  in  market  timing  in  mutual  fund  shares.  The  SEC  agreed  a  deal  totalling  $375m  with  Banc  of  America  Capital  Management,  BACAP  Distributors  and  Banc  of  America  Securities.  It  was  made  up  of  $250m  to  pay  back  gains  from  market  timing,  and  $125m  in  penalties.  It  is  to  be  paid  to  the  damaged  funds  and  their  shareholders.  Separately,  the  SEC  said  it  had  reached  a  $140m  deal  -  equally  split  between  penalties  and  compensation  -  in  its  probe  into  Columbia  Management  Advisors  (CAM)  and  Columbia  Funds  Distributor  (CFD)  and  three  ex-Columbia  executives.  These  businesses  became  part  of  BOA  when  it  snapped  up  rival  bank  FleetBoston  in  a  $47bn  merger  last  March.  |||    The  SEC  filed  civil  fraud  charges  in  a  Boston  Federal  court  against  James  Tambone,  who  it  says  headed  CFD's  sales  operations,  and  his  alleged  second  in  command  Robert  Hussey.  The  SEC  is  pressing  for  the  highest  tier  of  financial  penalties  against  the  pair  for  ""multiple  violations"",  repayment  of  any  personal  gains,  and  an  injunction  to  prevent  future  breaches,  a  spokeswoman  for  the  SEC's  Boston  office  told  the  BBC.  There  was  no  immediate  comment  from  the  men's'  lawyers.  The  SEC's  settlement  with  CAM  and  CFD  included  agreements  with  three  other  ex-managers,  Peter  Martin,  Erik  Gustafson  and  Joseph  Palombo,  who  paid  personal  financial  penalties  of  between  $50-100,000."

She  watched  Laura  Michelle  Kelly,  23,  reprise  the  role  on  stage.  The  show  has  been  one  of  the  West  End's  hottest  tickets  since  opening  in  December,  winning  two  Olivier  Awards.  Kelly  was  named  best  musical  actress  at  last  month's  ceremony  and  the  musical  also  won  best  choreography.  |||    But  Kelly  said  she  was  ""very  nervous""  about  meeting  Dame  Julie  because  she  was  ""my  absolute  hero"".  The  gala  performance  saw  Dame  Julie,  69,  return  to  the  theatre  where  she  had  her  first  starring  role  in  a  performance  of  Humpty  Dumpty  in  1948.  The  Mary  Poppins  musical  has  been  masterminded  by  theatre  impresario  Sir  Cameron  Mackintosh  and  directed  by  Richard  Eyre  with  choreography  by  Matthew  Bourne.  Sir  Cameron  said  he  hoped  the  production,  which  cost  £9m  to  bring  to  the  stage,  was  a  blend  of  the  sweet-natured  film  and  the  original  book  by  PL  Travers.

2	"Budget  to  set  scene  for  election  |||    Gordon  Brown  will  seek  to  put  the  economy  at  the  centre  of  Labour's  bid  for  a  third  term  in  power  when  he  delivers  his  ninth  Budget  at  1230  GMT.  He  is  expected  to  stress  the  importance  of  continued  economic  stability,  with  low  unemployment  and  interest  rates.  The  chancellor  is  expected  to  freeze  petrol  duty  and  raise  the  stamp  duty  threshold  from  £60,000.  But  the  Conservatives  and  Lib  Dems  insist  voters  face  higher  taxes  and  more  means-testing  under  Labour.  |||    Treasury  officials  have  said  there  will  not  be  a  pre-election  giveaway,  but  Mr  Brown  is  thought  to  have  about  £2bn  to  spare.  |||    -  Increase  in  the  stamp  duty  threshold  from  £60,000      -  A  freeze  on  petrol  duty      -  An  extension  of  tax  credit  scheme  for  poorer  families      -  Possible  help  for  pensioners  The  stamp  duty  threshold  rise  is  intended  to  help  first  time  buyers  -  a  likely  theme  of  all  three  of  the  main  parties'  general  election  manifestos.  Ten  years  ago,  buyers  had  a  much  greater  chance  of  avoiding  stamp  duty,  with  close  to  half  a  million  properties,  in  England  and  Wales  alone,  selling  for  less  than  £60,000.  Since  then,  average  UK  property  prices  have  more  than  doubled  while  the  starting  threshold  for  stamp  duty  has  not  increased.  Tax  credits  As  a  result,  the  number  of  properties  incurring  stamp  duty  has  rocketed  as  has  the  government's  tax  take.  The  Liberal  Democrats  unveiled  their  own  proposals  to  raise  the  stamp  duty  threshold  to  £150,000  in  February.  |||    The  Tories  are  also  thought  likely  to  propose  increased  thresholds,  with  shadow  chancellor  Oliver  Letwin  branding  stamp  duty  a  ""classic  Labour  stealth  tax"".  The  Tories  say  whatever  the  chancellor  gives  away  will  be  clawed  back  in  higher  taxes  if  Labour  is  returned  to  power.  Shadow  Treasury  chief  secretary  George  Osborne  said:  ""Everyone  who  looks  at  the  British  economy  at  the  moment  says  there  has  been  a  sharp  deterioration  in  the  public  finances,  that  there  is  a  black  hole,""  he  said.  ""If  Labour  is  elected  there  will  be  a  very  substantial  tax  increase  in  the  Budget  after  the  election,  of  the  order  of  around  £10bn.""  |||    But  Mr  Brown's  former  advisor  Ed  Balls,  now  a  parliamentary  hopeful,  said  an  examination  of  Tory  plans  for  the  economy  showed  there  would  be  a  £35bn  difference  in  investment  by  the  end  of  the  next  parliament  between  the  two  main  parties.  He  added:  ""I  don't  accept  there  is  any  need  for  any  changes  to  the  plans  we  have  set  out  to  meet  our  spending  commitments.""  |||    For  the  Lib  Dems  David  Laws  said:  ""The  chancellor  will  no  doubt  tell  us  today  how  wonderfully  the  economy  is  doing,""  he  said.  ""But  a  lot  of  that  is  built  on  an  increase  in  personal  and  consumer  debt  over  the  last  few  years  -  that  makes  the  economy  quite  vulnerable  potentially  if  interest  rates  ever  do  have  to  go  up  in  a  significant  way.""  SNP  leader  Alex  Salmond  said  his  party  would  introduce  a  £2,000  grant  for  first  time  buyers,  reduce  corporation  tax  and  introduce  a  citizens  pension  free  from  means  testing.  Plaid  Cymru's  economics  spokesman  Adam  Price  said  he  wanted  help  to  get  people  on  the  housing  ladder  and  an  increase  in  the  minimum  wage  to  £5.60  an  hour."

Meanwhile,  Southwest  Airlines  saw  its  fourth-quarter  2004  profits  fall  15%  to  $56m,  against  $66m  a  year  earlier.  Both  said  high  fuel  bills  would  continue  to  pressure  revenues  in  2005.  American,  the  world's  biggest  airline  by  some  measures,  said  it  expected  to  report  a  loss  for  the  first  quarter  of  2005.  Southwest,  which  has  the  highest  market  value  of  any  US  carrier,  said  it  would  remain  profitable  despite  high  fuel  prices.  |||    AMR's  shares  were  flat  in  Wednesday  morning  trading  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange,  as  the  results  were  slightly  better  than  analysts  had  anticipated.  AMR's  chief  executive  Gerard  Arpey  said  the  airline's  difficulties  reflected  the  situation  within  the  industry.  ""AMR's  results  for  the  fourth  quarter  of  2004  reflect  the  economic  woes  that  plagued  the  airline  industry  throughout  2004  -  in  particular,  high  fuel  prices  and  a  tough  revenue  environment,""  he  said.  For  the  full  year,  AMR  posted  a  loss  of  $761m,  lower  than  2003's  $1.2bn  loss  and  an  indication  that  the  airline  has  successfully  cut  costs.  AMR  added  that  as  part  of  its  cost  cutting  measures,  it  is  postponing  the  delivery  of  54  Boeing  jets.  Shares  in  Southwest  fell  65  cents  to  $14.35  as  analysts  voiced  their  disappointment.  ""The  results  came  in  below  our  already  conservative  estimate  for  the  quarter,""  said  Ray  Neidl,  an  analyst  at  Calyon  Securities.  Both  American  and  Southwest  have  been  squeezed  by  cut-throat  competition  in  the  US  airline  industry,  as  a  glut  of  available  seats  has  led  to  fierce  price  reductions."

Twelve  foreign  nationals  are  being  held  indefinitely  without  trial  in  the  UK  under  anti-terror  laws.  Referring  to  the  detentions  in  Cuba,  Archbishop  Tutu  told  BBC  News:  ""It  is  utterly  unacceptable.  ""The  rule  of  law  is  in  order  to  ensure  that  those  who  have  power  don't  use  their  power  arbitrarily  and  every  person  retains  their  human  rights  until  you  have  proven  conclusively  that  so-and-so  is  in  fact  guilty.""  |||    Moazzam  Begg,  from  Birmingham,  and  Martin  Mubanga,  Richard  Belmar  and  Feroz  Abbasi,  from  London,  have  been  held  by  the  US  at  Guantanamo  Bay  for  almost  three  years.  On  Tuesday  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw  told  the  Commons  that  the  US  had  agreed  to  release  the  four  after  ""intensive  and  complex  discussions""  over  security.  The  Britons  were  detained  as  part  of  the  US-led  ""war  on  terror"".  The  archbishop  added:  ""Whilst  we  are  saying  thank  you  that  these  have  been  released,  what  is  happening  to  those  left  behind?  ""We  in  South  Africa  used  to  have  a  dispensation  that  detained  people  without  trial  and  the  world  quite  rightly  condemned  that  as  unacceptable.  |||    ""Now  if  it  was  unacceptable  then  how  come  it  can  be  acceptable  to  Britain  and  the  United  States.  It  is  so,  so  deeply  distressing.""  Following  Mr  Straw's  announcement,  lawyer  Louise  Christian,  who  represents  Mr  Abbasi  and  Mr  Mubanga,  said  the  government  should  have  acted  sooner.  Foreign  nationals  detained  in  the  UK  are  being  held  at  Belmarsh  and  Woodhill  prisons.  In  December  the  House  of  Lords,  the  UK's  highest  court,  ruled  that  the  anti-terror  measures  broke  human  rights  laws.  But  the  men  are  still  behind  bars.  |||    Archbishop  Tutu  criticised  the  measures,  saying:  ""I  am  opposed  to  any  arbitrary  detention  that  is  happening,  even  in  Britain.""  Shami  Chakrabarti,  director  of  civil  rights  group  Liberty,  has  called  on  the  government  to  ""practise  what  it  preaches""  and  either  free  or  charge  the  detained  men.  But  the  Home  Office  defended  the  measures.  A  spokesman  said:  ""These  individuals  cannot  currently  be  prosecuted  because  some  evidence,  such  as  that  provided  by  third  parties,  cannot  safely  be  disclosed  in  criminal  proceedings  without  putting  others  at  risk.

1	"Briton  wins  short  film  Oscar  |||    Three  of  the  five  nominees  in  the  live-action  short  film  category  at  this  year's  Oscars  were  British.  For  Andrea  Arnold,  who  won  the  category,  Ashvin  Kumar  and  Gary  McKendry  the  past  month  has  thrust  them  from  relative  obscurity  into  the  limelight.  |||    Arnold's  gritty  drama  Wasp  is  about  a  single  mother  living  on  the  breadline,  while  Kumar's  Little  Terrorist  follows  a  young  Pakistani  Muslim  boy,  who  gets  stuck  on  the  wrong  side  of  the  heavily  armed  Indian  border.  McKendry's  entry,  Everything  In  This  Country  Must,  forces  British  soldiers  and  Catholics  to  challenge  their  relationship  during  the  troubles  in  Northern  Ireland.  Last  week,  the  trio  attended  an  official  screening  of  all  the  nominated  short  films  at  the  Academy's  headquarters  in  Beverly  Hills.  ""I  felt  so  privileged  to  have  a  thousand  people  watching  my  film  on  the  biggest  screen  I've  ever  seen,""  says  Arnold.  |||    Set  in  her  native  Dartford,  Wasp  tells  the  story  of  a  young  mum,  who,  unable  to  find  a  babysitter,  leaves  her  four  young  daughters  outside  a  pub  while  she's  on  a  date.  The  image  that  sparked  the  film  was  that  of  a  wasp  crawling  into  a  baby's  mouth.  ""The  other  nominees  said  they  made  their  films  for  this  reason  or  that  -  they  had  something  to  say.  But  I  just  start  with  an  image  I  can't  shake  off,  work  outwards  from  that  and  see  what  comes  out,""  she  explains.  |||    Since  she  presented  children's  TV  shows  Number  73  and  Motormouth  in  the  1980s,  Arnold  has  kept  a  low  profile  and  is  having  trouble  adapting  to  this  sudden  onslaught  of  attention.  ""I'm  not  interested  in  the  publicity.  It's  not  my  personality.  I'm  overwhelmed  by  all  the  fuss,""  she  said.  |||    ""It's  all  a  bit  like  a  beauty  contest  -  all  the  films  are  great  and  so  different.  ""But  even  though  my  film  has  won  30  awards  worldwide  (including  one  at  Sundance  last  month),  I'd  still  be  proud  of  it  -  even  if  it  hadn't  won  any.""  Asked  what  the  nomination  means  to  her,  Arnold  says  she  feels  ""flattered  and  honoured"".  ""We've  all  been  overwhelmed  by  the  response  and  can't  get  it  in  perspective  yet.  I'm  still  reeling.""  |||    And  she  won't  commit  to  an  opinion  of  Hollywood  yet.  ""I'm  just  in  the  middle  of  it,  living  moment  to  moment,  day  to  day.""  But  despite  her  reservations  about  the  Academy  Awards  and  the  media  frenzy  that  surrounds  it,  she  accepts  that  it  has  opened  doors  for  her.  ""People  will  definitely  listen  to  what  I  want  to  do  now,  and  the  phone  didn't  stop  ringing  for  a  week  after  I  got  nominated.""  As  for  the  future,  Arnold  firmly  believes  that  you  often  get  a  stronger  vision  of  the  world  with  short  films.

The  company  recently  warned  it  could  go  under  if  it  did  not  secure  a  refinancing  deal  by  mid-January  2005.  But  now  its  banks  have  agreed  to  extend  its  credit  facilities  until  March  2006.  |||    The  company  also  said  it  had  agreed  terms  over  the  completion  of  14  of  its  biggest  construction  projects  under  the  government's  Private  Finance  Initiative  (PFI).  |||    Jarvis  wants  to  scale  back  the  division,  which  has  proved  too  costly  and  has  been  blamed  for  many  of  its  problems.  Instead,  it  plans  to  focus  on  UK  rail  renewal,  roads  and  plant  hire  work.  Madrid-based  Ferrovial  already  holds  a  33%  stake  in  Tube  Lines,  which  maintains  the  Jubilee,  Northern  and  Piccadilly  lines.  The  Spanish  group  has  been  keen  to  snap  up  more  UK  infrastructure  assets,  having  bought  Amey  in  2003.  Jarvis  said  the  sale,  which  raked  in  more  than  the  £100m  analysts  had  expected,  would  ""substantially""  enhance  its  financial  position.  ""I  am  now  confident  that  we  can  now  move  forward  in  2005  towards  rebuilding  Jarvis  and  return  it  to  growth  as  a  profitable  business,""  said  chief  executive  Alan  Lovell.  Shares  in  Jarvis  were  up  more  than  16%  to  18  pence  by  the  close  of  trade  on  Friday."

However,  shortly  after  the  Bank  made  its  decision,  new  figures  showed  a  fall  in  economic  growth  in  the  last  quarter.  The  Bank  said  it  had  acted  to  curb  inflation  but  the  move  was  criticised  by  some  analysts.  |||    The  rate  hike  was  the  first  since  December  2003  and  had  been  well-flagged  in  advance.  However,  opposition  parties  and  some  analysts  said  the  move  was  ill-timed  given  data  showing  the  Australian  economy  grew  just  0.1%  between  October  and  December  and  1.5%  on  an  annual  basis.  |||    The  figures,  representing  a  decline  from  the  0.2%  growth  in  GDP  seen  between  July  and  September,  were  below  market  expectations.  Consumer  spending  remains  strong,  however,  and  the  Bank  is  concerned  about  growing  inflationary  pressures.  ""Over  recent  months  it  has  become  increasingly  clear  that  remaining  spare  capacity  in  the  labour  and  goods  markets  is  becoming  rather  limited,""  said  Ian  Macfarlane,  Governor  of  the  Reserve  Bank.  |||    At  2.6%,  inflation  remains  within  the  Bank's  2-3%  target  range.  However,  exports  declined  in  the  second  half  of  2004,  fuelling  a  rise  in  the  country's  current  account  deficit  -  the  difference  in  the  value  of  imports  compared  to  exports  -  to  a  record  Australian  dollar  29.4bn.  The  Australian  government  said  the  economy  remained  strong  with  unemployment  at  a  near  30  year  low.  ""The  economy  has  been  strong  and  it  is  properly  moderating  but  it  doesn't  look  to  me  like  it's  slowing  in  any  unreasonable  way,""  said  Treasurer  Peter  Costello.  Stock  markets  had  factored  in  the  likelihood  of  a  rate  rise  but  analysts  still  expressed  concern  about  the  strength  of  the  economy.  ""That  1.5%  annual  growth  rate  is  the  lowest  we  have  seen  since  the  post-election  slump  we  saw  back  in  2000-1,""  said  Michael  Blythe,  chief  economist  at  the  Commonwealth  Bank  of  Australia.  ""This  suggests  the  economy  really  did  slow  very  sharply  in  the  second  half  of  2004.""" 

2	"Terror  suspects  face  house  arrest  |||    UK  citizens  suspected  of  involvement  in  terrorism  could  face  house  arrest  as  part  of  a  series  of  new  measures  outlined  by  the  home  secretary.  |||    It  comes  after  law  lords  ruled  that  the  detention  of  12  foreign  terror  suspects  without  trial  breached  human  rights.  Charles  Clarke's  planned  ""control  orders""  mean  anyone  suspected  of  being  involved  in  terrorism  could  be  subject  to  house  arrest,  curfews  or  tagging.  The  Law  Society  dubbed  Mr  Clarke's  new  proposals  an  ""abuse  of  power"".  Deals  are  already  being  sought  to  deport  some  of  the  foreign  detainees  who  are  mainly  held  in  Belmarsh  Prison  in  London  under  the  current  laws  introduced  after  the  US  terror  attacks  on  11  September  2001.  Mr  Clarke  said  efforts  would  continue  to  deport  them  to  their  countries  of  origin  Algeria,  Tunisia,  Egypt  and  Jordan  without  them  facing  torture  or  death.  |||    Under  the  proposed  changes  -  prompted  by  the  House  of  Lords  ruling  -  the  home  secretary  could  order  British  citizens  or  foreign  suspects  who  could  not  be  deported,  to  face  house  arrest  or  other  measures  such  as  restrictions  on  their  movements  or  limits  on  their  use  of  telephones  and  the  internet.  |||    British  citizens  are  being  included  in  the  changes  after  the  law  lords  said  the  current  powers  were  discriminatory  because  they  could  only  be  used  on  foreign  suspects.  Mr  Clarke  also  said  intelligence  reports  showed  some  British  nationals  were  now  playing  a  more  significant  role  in  terror  threats.  Human  rights  lawyer  Clive  Stafford-Smith  said  the  plans  were  a  ""further  abuse  of  human  rights  in  Britain"".  |||    Mr  Clarke  said  prosecutions  were  the  government's  first  preference  and  promised  the  powers  would  only  be  used  in  ""serious""  cases,  with  independent  scrutiny  from  judges.  |||    He  told  MPs:  ""There  remains  a  public  emergency  threatening  the  life  of  the  nation.""  He  accepted  the  law  lords'  ruling  but  argued  detention  powers  had  helped  prevent  attacks  and  deter  terrorists.  The  current  detainees  would  not  be  freed  until  the  new  powers  were  in  place  as  they  were  still  considered  a  national  security  threat,  he  told  MPs.  |||    There  have  been  calls  for  the  rules  for  wire-tap  and  intercept  evidence  to  be  allowed  to  be  used  in  courts  but  Mr  Clarke  refused  to  back  that  change.  |||    He  said  intercept  evidence  was  only  a  small  part  of  the  case  against  the  men  and  some  of  it  could  not  be  used  because  it  could  put  sources'  lives  at  risk.  Most  of  the  terror  suspects  are  being  held  indefinitely  at  Belmarsh  prison,  in  London.  Conservative  shadow  home  secretary  David  Davis  was  worried  about  extending  special  powers  to  cover  British  citizens.  He  warned:  ""Throughout  history,  internment  has  generally  backfired  because  of  the  resentment  it  creates.  ""So  unless  the  process  is  clearly  just,  the  home  secretary  could  find  himself  confining  one  known  terrorist  only  to  recruit  10  unknown  terrorists.""  He  suggested  changing  the  law  to  let  security-cleared  judges  view  evidence  gathered  by  phone-tapping  could  allow  more  terror  cases  to  come  to  court.  |||    Liberal  Democrat  spokesman  Mark  Oaten  also  backed  use  of  wire-tap  evidence.  He  said  the  standard  of  proof  for  the  new  powers  would  have  to  be  ""very  high  indeed""  and  he  asked  whether  ministers  had  looked  at  measures  which  fitted  with  human  rights  laws.  Shami  Chakrabarti,  from  human  rights  group  Liberty,  joined  calls  for  intercept  evidence  to  be  allowed  in  trials.  She  said:  ""Adherence  to  the  rule  of  law  should  not  be  a  game  of  cat  and  mouse.  The  government  should  not  swap  one  human  rights  'opt  out'  for  another.""" 

2	"UK  'discriminated  against  Roma'  |||    The  government's  immigration  rules  racially  discriminated  against  Roma  (Gypsies)  seeking  entry  into  the  UK,  the  Law  Lords  have  ruled.  |||    It  follows  a  Home  Office  move  to  cut  asylum  claims  by  stopping  people,  mostly  Roma,  from  boarding  flights  to  Britain  from  the  Czech  capital,  Prague.  Civil  rights  group  Liberty  said  it  exposed  ""racism  at  the  heart  of  the  government's  asylum  policy"".  The  Home  Office  said  it  had  not  meant  to  discriminate  against  anyone.  It  said  it  would  look  at  the  implications  of  the  ruling,  but  pointed  out  the  controls  were  no  longer  in  place  because  Czechs  are  now  entitled  to  free  movement  across  Europe.  |||    The  screening  took  place  at  the  airport  in  July  2001,  at  a  time  of  concern  about  the  number  of  asylum  seekers  entering  Britain.  |||    Those  refused  ""pre-clearance""  were  effectively  prevented  from  travelling  to  the  UK,  because  no  airline  would  carry  them.  Lady  Hale,  sitting  with  Lords  Bingham,  Steyn,  Hope  and  Carswell,  said  many  Roma  had  good  reason  to  want  to  leave  the  Czech  Republic  because  of  persecution.  But  she  said  they  were  treated  more  sceptically  than  non-Roma  passengers  by  immigration  officers  ""acting  on  racial  grounds"".  Lady  Hale  said  immigration  officers  should  have  treated  all  would-be  passengers  in  the  same  way,  only  using  more  intrusive  questioning  if  there  was  a  specific  reason.  |||    Liberty  said  statistics  suggested  Roma  Czechs  were  400  times  more  likely  to  be  stopped  by  British  immigration  officials  at  Prague  airport  than  non-Roma  Czechs.  It  took  up  the  case  of  six  unnamed  Roma  Czechs  refused  entry  to  Britain,  and  that  of  the  European  Roma  Rights  Centre,  which  said  the  measures  unfairly  penalised  Roma  people.  It  lost  a  High  Court  action  in  October  2002  when  a  judge  said  the  system  was  ""no  more  or  less  objectionable""  than  a  visa  control  system.  He  ruled  there  was  no  obligation  on  Britain  not  to  take  steps  to  prevent  a  potential  refugee  from  approaching  its  border  to  claim  asylum.  |||    The  Court  of  Appeal  then  decided  the  practice  almost  inevitably  discriminated  against  Roma,  but  that  this  was  justified  because  they  were  more  likely  to  seek  asylum.  Immigration  law  allows  officials  to  discriminate  against  citizens  from  named  countries,  but  it  does  not  allow  officers  to  go  further  than  that.  |||    Responding  to  the  ruling,  a  Home  Office  spokesman  said:  ""The  scheme  was  operated  two  years  ago  as  a  short-term  response  to  the  high  levels  of  passengers  travelling  from  Prague  who  are  subsequently  found  to  be  ineligible  for  entry  to  the  UK.""  |||    Welcoming  the  ruling,  Maeve  Sherlock,  chief  executive  of  the  Refugee  Council,  said:  ""Human  rights  abuses  against  the  Roma  in  Eastern  Europe  are  well  documented,  and  it  is  hugely  troubling  that  the  government  sought  to  deny  entry  to  such  a  vulnerable  group.""  Amnesty  International's  Jan  Shaw  said:  ""That  the  government's  own  asylum  policy  was  being  operated  discriminatorily  is  bleakly  ironic  given  that  discrimination  often  lies  at  the  heart  of  serious  human  rights  abuse,  not  least  in  the  Czech  Republic.""  But  the  chairman  of  Migration  Watch  UK,  Sir  Andrew  Green,  said  the  House  of  Lords  decision  was  a  ""step  in  the  wrong  direction"".  ""The  basic  point  is  that  the  government  has  a  duty  to  control  our  borders  and  this  decision  appears  to  extend  the  race  relations  legislation  beyond  sensible  limits.""" 

0	"US  industrial  output  growth  eases  |||    US  industrial  production  continued  to  rise  in  November,  albeit  at  a  slower  pace  than  the  previous  month.  |||    The  US  Federal  Reserve  said  output  from  factories,  mines  and  utilities  rose  0.3%  -  in  line  with  forecasts  -  from  a  revised  0.6%  increase  in  October.  Analysts  added  that  if  the  carmaking  sector  -  which  saw  production  fall  0.5%  -  had  been  excluded  the  data  would  have  been  more  impressive.  The  latest  increase  means  industrial  output  has  grown  4.2%  in  the  past  year.  Many  analysts  were  upbeat  about  the  prospects  for  the  US  economy,  with  the  increase  in  production  coming  on  the  heels  of  news  of  a  recovery  in  retail  sales.  ""This  is  very  consistent  with  an  economy  growing  at  3.5  to  4.0%.  It  is  congruent  with  job  growth  and  consumer  optimism,""  Comerica  chief  economist  David  Littman  said  of  the  figures.  |||    The  US  economy  grew  at  a  respectable  annual  rate  of  3.7%  in  the  three  months  between  July  and  September,  while  jobs  growth  averaged  178,000  during  the  same  period.  While  the  employment  figures  are  not  spectacular,  experts  believe  they  are  enough  to  whittle  away  at  America's  5.4%  jobless  rate.  A  breakdown  of  the  latest  production  figures  shows  mining  output  drove  the  increase,  surging  2.1%,  while  factory  output  rose  0.3%.  But  utility  output  dropped  1.4%.  Meanwhile,  the  amount  of  factory  capacity  in  use  during  the  month  rose  to  77.6%  -  its  highest  level  since  May  2001.  ""Many  investors  think  that  product  market  inflation  won't  be  a  problem  until  the  utilisation  rates  are  at  80%  or  higher,""  Cary  Leahy,  senior  US  economist  at  Deutsche  Bank  Securities,  said.  ""So  there  is  still  a  lot  of  inflation-fighting  slack  in  the  manufacturing  sector,""  ""Overall  I'd  say  manufacturing  at  least  away  from  autos  continues  to  improve  and  I  would  bet  that  it  improves  at  a  faster  rate  in  coming  months  given  how  lean  inventories  are,""  Citigroup  senior  economist  Steven  Wieting  added."

Umbro,  which  recently  lost  sponsorship  deals  with  Chelsea  and  Celtic,  said  on  Thursday  it  had  signed  a  new  four-year  agreement  with  Scottish  club  Rangers.  It  hopes  2005  sales  will  benefit  from  the  launch  of  a  new  England  replica  shirt  ahead  of  the  2006  World  Cup.  In  January,  Umbro  announced  its  sponsorship  agreement  with  Chelsea,  which  gave  Umbro  the  lucrative  right  to  make  replica  shirts,  would  end  in  2006,  five  years  earlier  than  expected.  The  firm,  which  is  to  receive  a  payment  from  Chelsea  of  £24.5m,  said  it  is  ""appraising  a  number  of  additional  investment  opportunities  as  a  result  of  this  compensation""  .  Chief  executive  Peter  McGuigan  said  the  firm  plans  to  grow  sales  both  in  the  UK  and  internationally.  |||    The  firm,  reporting  its  first  annual  results  since  listing  on  the  London  Stock  Exchange  in  June,  said  the  UK  market  had  seen  sales  growth  of  8%  last  year.  It  said  the  launch  of  its  Evolution  X  fashion  range  had  boosted  sales.  Umbro  supplies  more  than  150  teams  across  the  world  including  the  national  sides  of  Ireland,  Sweden  and  Norway.

2	"Blair  Labour's  longest-serving  PM  |||    Tony  Blair  has  become  the  Labour  Party's  longest-serving  prime  minister.  |||    The  51-year-old  premier  has  marked  his  2,838th  day  in  the  post,  overtaking  the  combined  length  of  Harold  Wilson's  two  terms  during  the  1960s  and  1970s.  If  Mr  Blair  wins  the  next  election  and  fulfils  his  promise  to  serve  a  full  third  term,  he  will  surpass  Margaret  Thatcher's  11  years  by  the  end  of  2008.  In  1997,  Mr  Blair  became  the  youngest  premier  of  the  20th  century,  when  he  came  to  power  at  the  age  of  43.  The  last  prime  minister  to  be  installed  at  a  younger  age  was  Lord  Liverpool,  who  was  a  year  his  junior  in  1812.  |||    Mr  Blair's  other  political  firsts  include  becoming  the  first  Labour  leader  to  win  two  successive  full  terms  in  power  after  the  2001  Labour  landslide.  And  the  birth  of  the  Blairs'  fourth  child,  Leo,  on  20  May,  2000,  was  the  first  child  born  to  a  serving  prime  minister  in  more  than  150  years.  The  last  ""Downing  Street  dad""  was  Lord  John  Russell  in  1848.  Labour  won  a  huge  majority  of  167  over  the  Conservatives  in  2001,  but  Mr  Blair  has  since  been  criticised  by  many  in  his  own  party.  The  war  in  Iraq  and  reforms  of  the  health  service  and  education  system  have  provoked  dissent  from  backbenchers.  |||    Gordon  Brown,  chancellor  of  the  exchequer  under  Mr  Blair,  became  Britain's  longest-serving  chancellor  of  modern  times  in  2004.  Former  Labour  leader  Lord  Kinnock  said  the  chancellor  would  be  best  placed  to  take  over  from  Mr  Blair.  When  asked  about  the  future  leadership  of  the  party,  he  told  ITV  Wales'  Waterfront  programme:  ""That  contest  is  a  long  way  away  and  it  will  occur  only  when  the  Prime  Minister,  Tony  Blair,  decides  he's  subscribed  all  he  can  and  then  wants  to  go.  ""I  think  that  the  main  contender  will  be  Gordon  Brown,  who  is  a  man  of  virtually  unmatched  capability  and  now  great  experience.""  Both  Mr  Brown  and  Mr  Blair  rose  to  prominence  when  Lord  Kinnock  led  Labour  between  1983  and  1992." 

2	"Labour  plans  maternity  pay  rise  |||    Maternity  pay  for  new  mothers  is  to  rise  by  £1,400  as  part  of  new  proposals  announced  by  the  Trade  and  Industry  Secretary  Patricia  Hewitt.  |||    It  would  mean  paid  leave  would  be  increased  to  nine  months  by  2007,  Ms  Hewitt  told  GMTV's  Sunday  programme.  Other  plans  include  letting  maternity  pay  be  given  to  fathers  and  extending  rights  to  parents  of  older  children.  The  Tories  dismissed  the  maternity  pay  plan  as  ""desperate"",  while  the  Liberal  Democrats  said  it  was  misdirected.  |||    Ms  Hewitt  said:  ""We  have  already  doubled  the  length  of  maternity  pay,  it  was  13  weeks  when  we  were  elected,  we  have  already  taken  it  up  to  26  weeks.  ""We  are  going  to  extend  the  pay  to  nine  months  by  2007  and  the  aim  is  to  get  it  right  up  to  the  full  12  months  by  the  end  of  the  next  Parliament.""  She  said  new  mothers  were  already  entitled  to  12  months  leave,  but  that  many  women  could  not  take  it  as  only  six  of  those  months  were  paid.  ""We  have  made  a  firm  commitment.  We  will  definitely  extend  the  maternity  pay,  from  the  six  months  where  it  now  is  to  nine  months,  that's  the  extra  £1,400.""  She  said  ministers  would  consult  on  other  proposals  that  could  see  fathers  being  allowed  to  take  some  of  their  partner's  maternity  pay  or  leave  period,  or  extending  the  rights  of  flexible  working  to  carers  or  parents  of  older  children.  The  Shadow  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Family,  Theresa  May,  said:  ""These  plans  were  announced  by  Gordon  Brown  in  his  pre-budget  review  in  December  and  Tony  Blair  is  now  recycling  it  in  his  desperate  bid  to  win  back  women  voters.""  |||    She  said  the  Conservatives  would  announce  their  proposals  closer  to  the  General  Election.  Liberal  Democrat  spokeswoman  for  women  Sandra  Gidley  said:  ""While  mothers  would  welcome  any  extra  maternity  pay  the  Liberal  Democrats  feel  this  money  is  being  misdirected.""  She  said  her  party  would  boost  maternity  pay  in  the  first  six  months  to  allow  more  women  to  stay  at  home  in  that  time.  |||    Ms  Hewitt  also  stressed  the  plans  would  be  paid  for  by  taxpayers,  not  employers.  But  David  Frost,  director  general  of  the  British  Chambers  of  Commerce,  warned  that  many  small  firms  could  be  ""crippled""  by  the  move.  ""While  the  majority  of  any  salary  costs  may  be  covered  by  the  government's  statutory  pay,  recruitment  costs,  advertising  costs,  retraining  costs  and  the  strain  on  the  company  will  not  be,""  he  said.  Further  details  of  the  government's  plans  will  be  outlined  on  Monday.  New  mothers  are  currently  entitled  to  90%  of  average  earnings  for  the  first  six  weeks  after  giving  birth,  followed  by  £102.80  a  week  until  the  baby  is  six  months  old." 

0	"Bank  set  to  leave  rates  on  hold  |||    UK  interest  rates  are  set  to  remain  on  hold  at  4.75%  following  the  latest  meeting  of  the  Bank  of  England.  |||    The  Bank's  rate-setting  committee  has  put  up  rates  five  times  in  the  past  year  but  rates  have  been  on  hold  since  September  amid  signs  of  a  slowdown.  Economic  growth  slowed  in  the  previous  quarter,  as  manufacturing  output  fell,  while  consumer  confidence  has  slipped.  There  is  also  growing  evidence  that  the  previously  booming  UK  housing  market  is  now  cooling.  |||    House  prices  fell  0.4%  in  October,  according  to  the  Nationwide,  their  biggest  monthly  fall  since  February  2001.  Last  month,  Bank  of  England  governor  Mervyn  King  said  that  the  economy  had  hit  a  ""softer  patch""  after  rapid  economic  growth  in  the  first  half  of  2004.  Richard  Jeffrey,  chief  economist  at  Bridgewell  Securities,  said  it  was  very  unlikely  that  the  Bank  of  England  would  put  rates  up  again  this  time  around.  ""There  have  been  sufficient  signs  in  the  economy  of  a  slowdown  to  stay  the  Bank  of  England's  hand,""  he  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme.  However,  Mr  Jeffrey  said  he  believed  the  slowdown  in  economic  activity  was  temporary  and  it  was  dangerous  to  assume  that  rates  had  peaked.  ""I  still  think  interest  rates  are  going  up,""  he  said.  ""We  are  not  out  of  the  woods.""" 

2	"Defiant  hunts  put  ban  to  the  test  |||    Thousands  of  hunt  supporters  have  been  out  on  the  first  day  of  hunting  in  England  and  Wales  after  the  ban  on  hunting  with  dogs  came  into  force.  |||    The  Countryside  Alliance  called  on  hunt  supporters  to  meet  as  normal,  but  vowed  to  stay  within  the  law.  Although  hunting  with  dogs  is  now  a  criminal  offence,  exercising  hounds,  chasing  a  scent  trail  and  flushing  out  foxes  to  be  shot  are  still  legal.  One  anti-hunt  protester  was  taken  to  hospital  after  a  violent  clash  in  Kent.  |||    The  man  suffered  facial  injuries  after  an  incident  involving  a  group  of  men  at  the  end  of  the  East  Kent  Hunt,  near  Ashford.  In  Wiltshire,  police  arrested  four  men  under  the  new  law  suspected  of  hunting  with  dogs.  The  group,  from  South  Wales  and  Ireland,  have  been  released  on  bail  but  police  say  they  may  face  prosecution  under  new  poaching  laws.  |||    It  is  believed  more  than  270  hunts  went  out  on  Saturday,  just  one  day  after  the  ban  came  in.  |||    They  were  greeted  by  big  crowds  in  many  areas  of  the  country,  with  actor  Jeremy  Irons  and  former  minister  Kate  Hoey  among  the  supporters.  Anti-hunt  groups  -  such  as  the  League  Against  Cruel  Sports  -  deployed  100  monitors  at  hunts  to  check  for  illegal  activity.  |||    Mike  Hobday,  from  the  league,  said  video  evidence  of  the  law  being  broken  was  to  be  passed  onto  police.  ""Our  evidence  suggests  that  most  hunts  did  operate  within  the  law,  many  meeting  and  promptly  going  home  and  others  peacefully  exercising  their  hounds  or  drag  hunting.  ""However,  we  have  received  reports  of  what  we  believe  is  clearly  illegal  activity  by  a  number  of  hunts  across  Britain.""  BBC  correspondent  Simon  Hall  at  Postbridge  on  Dartmoor  in  the  West  Country  said  2,000  people  had  turned  out  to  welcome  the  hunt.  |||    And  the  BBC's  Sarah  Mukherjee,  with  the  Beaufort  Hunt  in  Badminton,  Gloucestershire  said  several  hundred  people  had  gathered  on  foot  to  see  the  hunt,  with  150  on  horseback.  Tom  Heap,  BBC  rural  affairs  correspondent,  said  it  appeared  that  hunstman  had,  for  now,  been  sticking  to  the  new  rules.  And  while  there  was  big  turnout  in  support  of  the  hunts  on  Saturday,  he  said  it  remains  to  be  seen  if  the  level  of  backing  can  be  maintained.  |||    Before  riding  out  with  the  hunt,  former  minister  Kate  Hoey  told  crowds:  ""We  will  prevail  and  this  law  will  have  to  be  overturned.""  Judith  Moritz,  in  Melton  Mowbray,  said  anti-hunt  activists  were  out  to  monitor  the  four  hunts  operating  in  that  part  of  Leicestershire,  but  were  outnumbered  by  large  crowds  of  followers.  The  Countryside  Alliance  said  the  meets  would  show  the  new  law  was  ""impossibly  difficult  to  determine""  and  open  to  different  interpretations.  |||    Chief  executive  Simon  Hart  said:  ""There  has  been  hunting  in  England  for  700  years.  This  [ban]  may  take  two  or  three  years,  perhaps  two  or  three  months,  to  unpick.  ""It  will  be  nothing  more  than  a  temporary  break  in  normal  service,  as  broadcasters  say.""  Conservative  family  spokeswoman  Theresa  May  said  if  the  party  was  in  government  again  it  would  make  sure  the  law  was  repealed.  Suffolk  Chief  Constable  Alastair  McWhirter,  the  Association  of  Chief  Police  Officers'  spokesman  on  rural  policing,  told  the  BBC  the  law  would  be  enforced,  although  the  police  would  not  break  up  hunts.  The  Attorney  General  Lord  Goldsmith  has  so  far  not  issued  any  instructions  to  police  on  how  they  should  deal  with  any  hunters  who  do  violate  the  law.  He  said  he  would  consult  the  director  of  public  prosecutions  and  the  police  ""in  the  near  future""  to  decide  what  measures  to  take  on  hunting  prosecutions." 

1	"Connick  Jr  to  lead  Broadway  show  |||    Singer  and  actor  Harry  Connick  Jr  is  to  star  in  a  Broadway  revival  of  1950s  hit  musical  The  Pajama  Game.  |||    He  will  play  the  supervisor  of  a  US  pyjama  factory  who  has  a  romance  with  a  union  activist  during  labour  unrest.  Jeffrey  Richards,  the  show's  co-producer,  said  Connick  was  ""an  actor  of  enormous  charisma  and  skill,  a  wonderful  singer  and  a  bona  fide  star"".  He  has  recently  starred  in  hit  US  comedy  Will  and  Grace  as  the  husband  of  Grace,  played  by  Debra  Messing.  The  musical  will  open  in  November,  said  Mr  Richards,  who  added  that  no  other  casting  had  been  announced  yet.  |||    The  original  book  by  George  Abbott  and  Richard  Bissell  will  be  revised  by  playwright  Peter  Ackerman,  who  co-wrote  the  screenplay  for  the  movie  Ice  Age.  It  has  a  score  by  Richard  Adler  and  Jerry  Ross,  and  Adler  is  writing  two  new  songs  for  the  score,  which  includes  numbers  including  Hey  There,  Small  Talk  and  Steam  Heat.  Connick  appeared  with  his  band  on  Broadway  in  1990,  and  he  wrote  the  score  for  a  musical  based  on  Emile  Zola's  novel  Therese  Raquin,  called  Thou  Shalt  Not.  It  had  a  three-month  run  on  Broadway  in  2001."

South  Korea,  which  has  about  $200bn  in  foreign  reserves,  said  it  plans  instead  to  boost  holdings  of  currencies  such  as  the  Australian  and  Canadian  dollar.  Analysts  reckon  that  other  nations  may  follow  suit  and  now  ditch  the  dollar.  At  1300  GMT,  the  euro  was  up  0.9%  on  the  day  at  1.3187  euros  per  US  dollar.  The  British  pound  had  added  0.5%  to  break  through  the  $1.90  level,  while  the  dollar  had  fallen  by  1.3%  against  the  Japanese  yen  to  trade  at  104.16  yen.  |||    At  the  start  of  the  year,  the  US  currency,  which  had  lost  7%  against  the  euro  in  the  final  three  months  of  2004  and  had  fallen  to  record  lows,  staged  something  of  a  recovery.  |||    Analysts,  however,  pointed  to  the  dollar's  inability  recently  to  extend  that  rally  despite  positive  economic  and  corporate  data,  and  highlighted  the  fact  that  many  of  the  US's  economic  problems  had  not  disappeared.  The  focus  once  again  has  been  on  the  country's  massive  trade  and  budget  deficits,  with  predictions  of  more  dollar  weakness  to  come.  ""The  comments  from  Korea  came  at  a  time  when  sentiment  towards  the  dollar  was  already  softening,""  said  Ian  Gunner,  a  trader  at  Mellon  Financial.  On  Tuesday,  traders  in  Asia  said  that  both  South  Korea  and  Taiwan  had  withdrawn  their  bids  to  buy  dollars  at  the  start  of  the  session.  Mansoor  Mohi-Uddin,  chief  currency  strategist  at  UBS,  said  that  there  was  a  sentiment  in  the  market  that  ""central  banks  from  Asia  and  the  Middle  East  are  buying  euros"".  A  report  last  month  already  showed  that  the  dollar  was  losing  its  allure  as  a  currency  that  offered  rock-steady  returns  and  stability.  Compiled  by  Central  Banking  Publications  and  sponsored  by  the  UK's  Royal  Bank  of  Scotland,  the  survey  found  39  nations  out  of  65  questioned  were  increasing  their  euro  holdings,  with  29  cutting  back  on  the  US  dollar." 

2	"EU  referendum  question  unveiled  |||    The  question  to  be  asked  in  the  referendum  on  the  EU  Constitution  has  been  unveiled  by  the  government.  |||    It  will  be:  ""Should  the  United  Kingdom  approve  the  treaty  establishing  a  constitution  for  the  European  Union?""  The  constitution  will  be  incorporated  into  UK  law  if  there  is  a  yes  vote  in  the  referendum,  expected  in  2006.  Critics  say  the  constitution  is  a  further  step  towards  a  federal  Europe,  but  advocates  say  it  ensures  effective  operation  of  the  enlarged  25-state  EU.  ""If  we  reject  this  treaty,  Britain  will  be  isolated  and  weak  in  Europe,""  said  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw,  who  along  with  the  rest  of  the  Cabinet,  will  back  a  ""yes""  vote.  |||    Patriots  by  definition  wanted  the  UK  to  be  prosperous  at  home  and  strong  and  influential  abroad,  Mr  Straw  said.  ""Our  role  as  a  leading  member  of  the  EU  is  a  crucial  part  of  securing  that.""  |||    Conservative  shadow  foreign  secretary  Michael  Ancram  said  the  referendum  question  ""seems  straightforward"".  But  he  accused  the  government  of  trying  to  confuse  the  issue  by  putting  the  EU  referendum  question  in  the  same  bill  as  the  ratification  of  the  constitution,  when  they  should  be  treated  as  ""two  separate  issues"".  Despite  this  ""underhand  trick,""  the  referendum  bill  stood  ""no  chance  of  becoming  law  before  the  election,""  he  added.  ""This  is  Tony  Blair's  cheap  gesture  to  the  pro-constitution  lobby  while  he  runs  scared  of  a  debate  on  Europe  he  knows  he  cannot  win.""  Neil  O'Brien,  director  of  anti-constitution  group  Vote  No,  said:  ""The  reality  is  that  the  government  doesn't  want  to  discuss  the  EU  constitution  ahead  of  the  election  because  they  know  it  is  extremely  unpopular  with  voters  and  with  business.""  |||    The  UK  Independence  Party  said:  ""If  the  government  believes  that  a  No  vote  would  mean  that  we  should  leave  the  European  Union,  they  should  just  ask  us  if  we  want  to  leave  the  EU.  Then  we  can  be  out  of  it  and  better  off  much  sooner.""  |||    Liberal  Democrat  leader  Charles  Kennedy,  who  backs  the  constitution,  said  he  expected  the  referendum  would  come  in  the  first  half  of  next  year.  He  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme:  ""The  sooner  we  get  on  with  this,  the  better.""  He  said  the  question  sounded  ""very  neutral""  and  ""balanced,""  adding  it  would  enable  the  argument  ""to  be  enjoined  fairly  and  squarely  on  both  sides"".  Green  MEP  Caroline  Lucas  welcomed  Tony  Blair's  ""courage  in  keeping  his  word""  on  holding  a  referendum.  But  she  added:  ""This  treaty  is  a  flawed  document  that  will  make  the  EU  less  accountable,  less  sustainable,  and  less  just.""  |||    Mr  Blair  signed  the  constitution  at  a  ceremony  in  Rome  in  November,  but  had  already  made  it  clear  the  issue  would  be  put  to  voters  in  a  referendum.  That  promise  came  after  sustained  pressure  from  opposition  parties.  Jack  Straw,  who  argues  the  constitution  reflected  a  ""British  vision  for  Europe""  and  gives  ""national  governments  a  stronger  grip"",  has  said  the  referendum  could  be  held  in  spring  2006.  But  in  an  interview  with  the  Financial  Times,  Mr  Blair  refused  to  be  pinned  down  to  that  date,  saying  Britain  would  hold  a  poll  ""some  time  in  2006  but  when,  I  don't  know"".  The  paper  said  the  prime  minister  ""claimed  ignorance""  of  when  other  countries  were  planning  to  hold  their  referendums." 

1	"Pixies  take  on  Reading  and  Leeds  |||    Pixies,  Foo  Fighters  and  Iron  Maiden  will  headline  this  summer's  Leeds  and  Reading  festivals.  |||    The  trio  of  rock  heavyweights  will  top  the  bill  for  the  three-day  events  at  Bramham  Park,  near  Wetherby,  and  at  Richfield  Avenue,  Reading.  They  are  the  Pixies'  and  Iron  Maiden's  only  UK  festival  gigs,  while  Foo  Fighters  are  also  at  T  In  The  Park.  The  Killers,  Razorlight  and  Queens  of  the  Stone  Age  are  also  playing  the  twin  festivals,  to  be  held  on  26-28  August.  Other  acts  in  this  year's  line-up  include  The  Charlatans,  Marilyn  Manson  and  Kings  of  Leon.  Pete  Doherty's  band  Babyshamblers  will  appear  on  the  NME/Radio  One  stage  along  with  Kasabian,  Black  Rebel  Motorcycle  Club  and  Bloc  Party.  |||    Organiser  Mean  Fiddler  said  more  acts  were  still  to  be  confirmed  for  the  summer  event.  ""We  are  all  very  excited  to  be  going  back  to  Reading  and  intend  to  have  a  fantastic  time,""  said  Iron  Maiden's  Bruce  Dickinson.  ""We're  sure  fans  will  too.""  It  will  the  first  time  the  veteran  British  metal  band  have  played  Reading  in  23  years.

The  Pixies  will  headline  the  first  day  of  Reading,  while  Foo  Fighters  will  play  on  Sunday  and  Iron  Maiden  will  close  the  event.  Weekend  tickets  are  now  on  sale  priced  at  £125  each." 

1	"Beatles  suits  sell  for  $110,000  |||    Four  suits  worn  by  the  Beatles  on  their  Please  Please  Me  album  cover  have  sold  for  $110,00  (£59,000)  at  a  US  auction.  |||    But  some  of  Elvis  Presley's  earliest  recordings  -  including  takes  of  All  Shook  Up  -  failed  to  sell  at  the  Bonhams  and  Butterfields  two-day  sale.  A  private  collection  of  six  tape  recordings  of  Presley  valued  at  between  $30,000  (£16,000)  and  $50,000  (£27,000)  did  not  meet  their  reserve  price.  A  signed  Presley  photograph  managed  to  fetch  $2,115  (£1,140).  |||    Auction  spokesman  Erik  Simon  said  the  Presley  tapes  were  withdrawn  because  ""they  did  not  meet  the  minimum  price  set  by  the  owners"".  |||    He  said  the  family  of  sound  engineer  Thorne  Nogar  did  not  want  to  divulge  the  price  they  had  set  or  the  offers  they  had  received.  The  RCA  tapes  date  from  September  1956  to  September  1957.  The  ""pre-masters""  include  a  take  of  Jailhouse  Rock,  religious  songs,  material  for  his  first  Christmas  album,  and  banter  between  Presley,  members  of  his  band  and  Mr  Nogar.  |||    ""We've  had  them  for  a  lot  of  years,  and  I  think  the  people  should  enjoy  them.  And  frankly,  we  could  use  the  money,""  Mr  Nogar's  son  Stephen,  57,  said  before  the  auction.  Mr  Nogar,  who  died  in  1994  aged  72,  always  used  to  make  two  tapes  of  sessions  as  a  back-up  in  case  RCA  producers  wanted  to  make  late  changes  to  songs.  ""He  called  them  his  'ass-saver'  tapes,""  his  son  said.  The  quality  is  said  to  be  noticeably  crisper  than  that  of  a  new  vinyl  record.  Because  the  family  does  not  own  the  copyright  to  the  music,  the  tapes  could  only  be  sold  for  ""personal  enjoyment""  and  cannot  be  copied  for  commercial  gain.  The  auction  made  a  total  of  $1.1m  (£600,000)." 

2	"Profile:  David  Blunkett  |||    Before  he  resigned  the  position  of  home  secretary  on  Wednesday,  David  Blunkett  had  been  in  charge  of  a  substantial  body  of  government  portfolios  including  race,  policing  and  immigration.  |||    His  responsibilities  in  running  the  Home  Office  included  civil  emergencies,  security,  terrorism  and  expenditure.  Named  home  secretary  after  the  2001  general  election,  Mr  Blunkett  had  seen  the  focus  on  his  office  intensify.  The  attacks  on  the  World  Trade  Center  on  11  September  2001  heightened  concern  for  security  and  immigration  in  particular.  A  Labour  loyalist  from  a  working  class  background  Mr  Blunkett,  57,  had  been  unafraid  of  pushing  for  tough  changes  to  Labour  policy.  |||    Recently  the  issue  of  identity  cards  had  provoked  controversy  with  questions  raised  over  cost  and  invasions  of  civil  liberties.  Mr  Blunkett  was  also  at  the  centre  of  a  humiliating  scandal  involving  the  former  immigration  minister  Beverly  Hughes.  Having  received  his  full  backing,  Ms  Hughes  was  forced  to  resign  in  April  over  abuses  in  the  visa  processing  system,  which  she  claimed  to  be  unaware  of.  Mr  Blunkett's  own  comments  on  immigration  had  prompted  censure  -  he  told  refugees  from  Afghanistan  and  Kosovo  to  ""get  back  home""  to  start  rebuilding  their  countries.  And  he  also  urged  people  from  ethnic  minorities  to  develop  a  ""sense  of  belonging""  in  Britain,  telling  them  to  speak  English  at  home.  Avoiding  political  correctness  is  second  nature  to  the  former  home  secretary,  who  spurns  a  metropolitan  elite  and  ""airy  fairy  libertarians""  and  earlier  in  the  year  coined  the  phrase  ""liberati"",  as  an  amalgam  of  ""glitterati""  and  ""liberal"".  Yet  in  January  of  this  year  he  courted  further  controversy  over  his  seemingly  liberal  reclassification  of  cannabis,  from  a  Grade  B  to  Grade  C  status  drug  .  |||    Before  the  recent  furore,  Mr  Blunkett  had  always  appeared  more  interested  in  politics  than  his  personal  life.  Mr  Blunkett  told  the  Daily  Telegraph  in  2001  that  he  continued  to  wear  his  wedding  ring,  in  spite  of  being  a  divorcee,  as  ""a  useful  way  of  ensuring  that  people  don't  casually  think  I  am  available"".  He  added:  ""I  am  not  available  because  I  am  just  getting  on  with  the  job.""  Mr  Blunkett  entered  Parliament  for  Sheffield  Brightside  in  1987,  after  first  contesting  the  Sheffield  Hallam  seat  in  1974.  He  is  one  of  very  few  blind  MPs,  and  was  the  first  to  reach  the  front  bench  and  the  Cabinet.  His  relaxed  performances  -  with  his  guide  dog  by  his  side  -  at  the  despatch  box,  in  the  Labour  Party's  National  Executive,  and  on  the  conference  platform  made  it  easy  to  forget  his  disability.  Mr  Blunkett  himself  described  not  being  able  to  see  as  simply  ""an  inconvenience"".  Using  Braille  for  speeches,  and  briefed  by  his  officials  on  tape,  he  also  has  a  sharp  tongue  at  times,  and  a  pragmatic  approach  to  politics.  |||    Mr  Blunkett  was  schooled  in  Sheffield  where  he  led  the  city  council  for  seven  years  before  entering  the  Commons.  He  chaired  the  Labour  Party  nationally,  and  was  a  unifying  force  in  the  80s  and  90s,  shadowing  health  and  education.  In  Tony  Blair's  first  government  Mr  Blunkett  was  put  in  charge  of  education  and  employment,  where  he  won  big  increases  in  funds  for  schools,  while  insisting  on  improved  standards  of  literacy  and  numeracy.  He  was  prepared  to  stand  up  to  the  teaching  unions  -  which  sometimes  heckled  his  speeches  -  and  his  policy  of  charging  university  students  for  tuition  fees  was  not  popular.  In  the  Labour  Party  he  has  been  regarded  as  a  loyal  colleague,  a  conciliator  who  avoids  factions,  and  a  man  whose  humour  and  determination  make  him  widely  popular.  There  have  been  wry  smiles  as  well.  In  1999,  his  then  guide  dog  Lucy  threw  up  in  the  Chamber  during  the  speech  of  his  Tory  opponent.  Lucy  was  replaced  by  her  half-sister,  Sadie,  a  black  Labrador-curly-coated  retriever  cross,  in  2003  after  nearly  a  decade  by  Mr  Blunkett's  side." 

2	"'Last  chance'  warning  for  voters  |||    People  in  England,  Scotland  and  Wales  must  have  registered  by  1700  GMT  to  be  able  to  vote  in  the  general  election  if  it  is  held,  as  expected,  on  5  May.  |||    Those  who  filled  in  forms  last  autumn  should  already  be  on  the  register  -  but  those  who  have  moved  house  or  were  on  holiday  may  have  been  left  off.  There  will  also  be  elections  for  local  councils  and  mayors  in  parts  of  England  on  5  May.  The  deadline  for  voters  to  register  in  Northern  Ireland  expired  on  Thursday.  |||    Completed  registration  forms  can  be  handed  into  local  authorities  throughout  the  day  on  Friday,  and  some  will  accept  them  by  fax.  As  well  as  for  English  county  councils,  polls  for  unitary  authorities  at  Bristol,  Isle  of  Wight  and  Stockton-on-Tees  and  mayors  at  Doncaster,  Hartlepool,  North  Tyneside  and  Stoke-on-Trent  are  also  scheduled  for  5  May.  Last  week  Preston  City  Council  reported  that  more  than  14,000  of  its  voters  were  not  registered.  Its  electoral  roll  fell  by  17.5%  in  a  year  -  the  biggest  dip  in  the  UK.  An  Electoral  Commission  spokeswoman  said:  ""Political  decisions  are  made  on  your  behalf  every  day  but  only  by  using  your  right  to  vote  at  an  election  can  you  really  have  a  say  on  the  issues  you  care  about.  ""If  you  want  your  voice  to  be  heard  on  5  May  you  will  need  to  have  registered  by  Friday  11  March.""  Council  tax  payers  are  not  eligible  to  vote  without  registration,  officials  have  stressed." 

2	"Lib  Dems  'to  target  stamp  duty'  |||    The  Liberal  Democrats  are  promising  to  raise  the  stamp  duty  threshold  if  they  win  the  general  election,  in  a  bid  to  court  first-time  house  buyers.  |||    Vince  Cable,  the  party's  Treasury  spokesman,  said  raising  the  threshold  to  £150,000  would  prevent  over  400,000  home-buyers  from  paying  the  tax.  He  said  first-time  buyers  were  being  ""squeezed  out""  of  the  housing  market.  The  Labour  party  said  the  Liberal  Democrats  needed  to  explain  how  they  would  pay  for  the  plan.  The  plan  forms  part  of  a  wider  Lib  Dems  policy  to  encourage  first  time  buyers  and  those  on  lower  incomes  into  the  market.  |||    Under  the  proposals,  the  average  saving  for  a  new  buyer  would  be  more  than  £1,000,  according  to  Mr  Cable.  ""First  time  buyers  are  being  squeezed  out  of  the  housing  market  not  only  by  higher  house  prices  but  also  by  being  swept  into  the  stamp  duty  net,""  he  said.  ""By  failing  to  uprate  the  stamp  duty  threshold  Gordon  Brown  has  hit  first  time  buyers  and  those  on  low  incomes  the  hardest.  ""By  pledging  to  increase  the  threshold  to  £150,000,  the  Liberal  Democrats  will  make  it  possible  for  many  first  time  buyers  to  buy  a  property  without  facing  this  tax.""  Paul  Boateng  MP,  Labour's  Chief  Secretary  to  the  Treasury,  said:  ""The  Lib  Dems'  sums  don't  add  up.

A  member  of  The  Game's  entourage  was  reportedly  shot  outside  a  radio  station  where  50  Cent  was  being  interviewed.  But  the  pair  shook  hands  as  they  handed  over  money  to  music  projects  for  New  York's  deprived  areas  on  Wednesday.  |||    The  Game,  whose  real  name  is  Jayceon  Taylor,  told  a  news  conference:  ""I  want  to  apologise.  I'm  almost  ashamed  to  have  participated  in  the  things  that  went  on  over  the  last  few  weeks.""  Chart-topper  50  Cent,  real  name  Curtis  Jackson,  said  the  truce  came  on  the  anniversary  of  the  death  of  the  Notorious  BIG  in  1997,  who  was  part  of  a  volatile  feud  between  the  east  and  west  coast  rap  scenes.  ""We're  here  today  to  show  that  people  can  rise  above  the  most  difficult  circumstances  and  together  we  can  put  negativity  behind  us,""  50  Cent  said.  |||    ""A  lot  of  people  don't  want  to  see  it  happen,  but  we're  responding  to  the  two  most  important  groups  -  our  family  and  our  fans.""  The  Boys  Choir  of  Harlem  got  a  cheque  for  $150,000  (£77,800)  from  50  Cent,  while  The  Game  handed  over  $103,500  (£53,400).  The  Game  also  made  a  contribution  to  the  Compton  schools  music  programme.  50  Cent  announced  he  has  launched  the  G-Unity  Foundation  ""to  help  people  overcome  obstacles  and  make  a  chance  for  the  better  in  their  lives"".  |||    ""I  realised  that  if  I'm  going  to  be  effective  at  that,  I  have  to  overcome  some  of  my  own,""  he  said.  ""Game  and  I  need  to  set  an  example  in  the  community.""  50  Cent  is  no  stranger  to  feuds,  with  rapper  Ja  Rule  among  the  targets  for  ridicule  in  his  songs.  On  his  latest  album,  released  earlier  this  month,  he  turned  his  attentions  to  Fat  Joe  and  Nas,  who  have  both  worked  with  Ja  Rule.  Both  he  and  The  Game  have  admitted  drug  dealing  in  the  past  and  have  both  been  shot." 

2	"Plaid  MP's  cottage  arson  claim  |||    A  Plaid  Cymru  MP  believes  UK  security  services  were  involved  in  some  arson  attacks  blamed  on  Welsh  extremists.  |||    It  is  25  years  since  the  start  of  12  years  of  fire-bombings,  attributed  to  a  shadowy  group  known  as  Meibion  Glyndwr.  Plaid  Cymru's  Elfyn  Llwyd  has  suggested  the  security  services  could  have  been  involved,  with  the  intention  of  discrediting  the  nationalist  vote.  Ex-Welsh  Office  Minister  Lord  Roberts  of  Conwy  denied  security  services  were  involved.  In  March  this  year,  North  Wales  Police  reopened  the  case,  saying  materials  kept  during  their  investigations  would  be  examined  to  find  whether  it  would  yield  DNA  evidence.  |||    Meibion  Glyndwr  -  which  means  ""sons  of  Glyndwr""  -  began  burning  property  in  December  1979  in  protest  at  homes  in  rural  Wales  being  sold  as  holiday  cottages  to  people  from  England.  The  group  was  linked  to  most  of  the  220  or  so  fire-bombing  incidents  stretching  from  the  Llyn  Peninsula  to  Pembrokeshire.  The  campaign  continued  until  the  early  1990s.  Police  were  accused  in  some  quarters  of  targeting  anyone  who  was  a  nationalist.  Although  one  man,  Sion  Aubrey  Roberts,  was  convicted  in  1993  of  sending  letter  bombs  in  the  post,  the  arson  cases  remain  unsolved.  |||    As  a  solicitor,  Elfyn  Llwyd  represented  Welsh  singer  Bryn  F&#244;n  when  he  was  arrested  on  suspicion  of  being  involved  in  the  arson  campaign.  F&#244;n  was  released  without  charge  .  But  now,  as  MP  for  Merionnydd  Nant  Conwy  and  Plaid  Cymru's  Parliamentary  Leader,  Mr  Llwyd  has  argued  that  some  of  the  terror  attacks  may  have  had  the  involvement  of  the  security  services  and  not  Meibion  Glyndwr.  He  believes  that  elements  of  the  British  security  services  may  have  carried  out  renegade  actions  in  order  to  discredit  Plaid  Cymru  and  the  nationalist  vote  ahead  of  elections.  The  claim  is  made  in  an  interview  for  BBC  Wales'  Maniffesto  programme  to  be  shown  on  S4C  on  Sunday.  |||    Mr  Llwyd  said  that  the  sophistication  of  many  of  the  devices  used  in  the  attacks  compared  to  the  crude  nature  of  many  others,  suggests  a  degree  of  professionalism  which  could  only  have  come  from  individuals  who  knew  exactly  what  they  were  doing.  He  said:  ""What  I'm  saying  is  that  the  role  that  they  took  wasn't  the  appropriate  one,  i.e.  like  an  |||    agent  provocateur  |||    and  perhaps  interfering  and  creating  a  situation  where  it  looked  like  it  was  the  nationalists  that  were  responsible.""  The  programme  also  heard  from  Lord  Roberts  of  Conwy,  who  was  a  Welsh  Office  minister  at  the  time.  He  denied  that  the  security  services  played  any  improper  role.  Mr  Llwyd's  theory  has  also  been  questioned  by  Plaid  Cymru's  former  President,  Dafydd  Wigley.  He  accepted  that  the  fires  damaged  Plaid  Cymru's  public  image  but  believed  that  the  security  services  had  their  hands  full  at  the  time  with  the  IRA  and  animal  rights  activists.  |||        -  Maniffesto  can  be  seen  on  S4C  on  Sunday,  12  December,  at  1200  GMT." 

3	"Campbell  to  be  Lions  consultant  |||    Former  government  communications  chief  Alastair  Campbell  will  act  as  a  media  consultant  to  Sir  Clive  Woodward's  2005  Lions  on  their  tour  to  New  Zealand.  |||    Campbell,  who  left  Downing  Street  earlier  this  year,  will  advise  on  media  strategy  before  and  during  the  tour.  ""I  hope  I  can  contribute  to  the  planning  and  preparation,  and  to  ensuring  the  media  and  public  get  the  most  out  of  the  tour  itself,""  he  said.  ""I  am  also  looking  forward  to  going  out  for  the  later  stages  of  the  tour.""  Woodward's  decision  to  call  in  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair's  former  spin  doctor  springs  from  the  deterioration  in  media  relations  on  the  last  Lions  tour  of  Australia  in  2001,  when  New  Zealander  Graham  Henry  was  the  head  coach.  The  furore  surrounding  the  newspaper  diaries  of  Matt  Dawson  and  Austin  Healey  was  compounded  by  other  disillusioned  players  venting  their  frustration  through  the  media.  ""The  Lions  is  a  massive  media  event,""  said  Woodward,  who  will  be  the  head  coach.  ""There  will  be  a  huge  level  of  interest  from  the  travelling  media,  the  fans  that  will  go  out  in  their  thousands  and  the  New  Zealand  public.  ""We  need  to  have  the  strategy  and  processes  in  place  to  deal  with  the  pressures  that  will  bring.  ""[Alastair]  will  act  as  an  advisor  both  in  the  build  up  to  and  on  the  tour  itself.  His  role  is  to  work  closely  with  not  only  myself  but  (tour  manager)  Bill  Beaumont,  (media  manager)  Louisa  Cheetham  and  (team  manager)  Louise  Ramsay.""  Campbell  is  due  to  resume  working  for  the  government  in  the  new  year  in  the  build-up  to  an  anticipated  May  general  election.  The  Lions  leave  for  New  Zealand  on  24  May,  with  the  first  Test  match  against  the  All  Blacks  in  Christchurch  on  25  June." 

1	"Beastie  Boys  win  sampling  battle  |||    US  rappers  Beastie  Boys  have  won  their  long-running  battle  over  the  use  of  a  sample  in  their  song  Pass  the  Mic.  |||    The  punk-rappers  used  three  notes  of  music  from  flautist  James  Newton's  Choir  in  their  track  from  1992.  Although  the  group  had  paid  a  licence  fee  for  the  sample,  Mr  Newton  said  his  copyright  had  been  infringed.  But  the  US  Court  of  Appeal  upheld  its  original  decision  that  the  group  did  not  have  to  pay  an  additional  fee  to  license  the  underlying  composition.  The  Beastie  Boys  -  Michael  Diamond,  Adam  Horowitz,  and  Adam  Yauch  -  are  considered  to  be  one  of  early  pioneers  of  sampling  music.  |||    Sampling,  now  a  standard  practice  among  musicians,  involves  taking  a  segment  of  one  track  and  using  it  in  a  different  song.  A  three-judge  panel  of  the  court  held  in  2003  that  the  band  had  abided  by  copyright  protections  by  paying  a  licence  fee  for  a  sample  of  Mr  Newton's  recording.  That  finding  upheld  a  lower-court  dismissal  of  the  case  in  favour  of  the  Beastie  Boys.  ""We  hold  that  Beastie  Boys'  use  of  a  brief  segment  of  that  composition,  consisting  of  three  notes  separated  by  a  half-step  over  a  background  C  note,  is  not  sufficient  to  sustain  a  claim  for  infringement  of  Newton's  copyright,""  Chief  Judge  Mary  Schroeder  wrote  in  her  opinion.  Mr  Newton  is  a  critically  acclaimed  jazz  and  classical  flutist,  composer,  performer,  and  university  professor.  Mr  Newton  and  the  Beastie  Boys  were  not  available  for  comment." 

3	"Arnesen  denies  rift  with  Santini  |||    Tottenham  sporting  director  Frank  Arnesen  has  denied  that  coach  Jacques  Santini  resigned  because  of  a  clash  of  personalities  at  White  Hart  Lane.  |||    There  had  been  newspaper  speculation  that  Santini  had  felt  undermined  by  Arnesen's  role  at  the  club.  ""It  is  absolutely  not  true,""  Arnesen  told  BBC  Radio  Five  Live.  ""There  is  only  one  thing  that  made  him  resign  and  that  is  his  own  personal  problems.  ""He  has  talked  to  me  recently  and  said  this  matter  is  absolutely  for  himself.""  Arnesen  said  he  was  unable  to  throw  any  light  onto  the  problems  that  caused  Santini  to  quit  after  just  13  games  in  charge.  He  added:  ""Jacques  has  never  gone  into  exactly  what  it  was.  But  I  trust  him  in  that;  you  have  to  accept  it.  I  think  we  should  respect  it.  |||    ""The  plan  is  now  that  over  the  weekend  we  will  have  talks  with  the  board  and  then  on  Monday  we  will  clarify  the  situation.""  Arnesen  countered  criticism  at  the  timing  of  the  announcement,  coming  less  than  24  hours  before  Tottenham's  Premiership  fixture  with  Charlton.  ""When  it  comes  down  to  personal  problems,  I  don't  think  we  should  talk  about  timing,""  he  said.  And  he  also  denied  reports  that  Santini  had  been  given  a  £3m  pay-off.  ""That  is  absolute  nonsense.  He  is  the  one  who  said  'I  will  go'  and  so  he  went'"",  said  the  Spurs  sporting  director.  Tottenham's  structure  of  having  a  sporting  director  working  alongside  a  coach  is  based  on  a  continental  model  and  Arnesen  sees  no  reason  why  they  should  change  it.  |||    ""I  have  confidence  in  this  structure.  I  am  confident  that  we  have  started  something  here  in  July  and  I  still  have  a  lot  of  confidence  in  Tottenham  and  what  we  are  doing,""  he  said.  However,  former  Spurs  and  England  defender  Gary  Stevens  said  he  would  not  be  surprised  if  the  system  had  caused  a  rift.  ""I  think  the  problems  go  a  lot  deeper,  between  the  director  of  football  at  White  Hart  Lane  and  Santini,""  Stevens  told  Five  Live.  ""On  paper  they  could  have  worked  together.  But  Frank  Arnesen  was  a  very  creative,  forward-thinking  and  expansive  player  -  whereas  I  think  Santini  was  very  much  the  opposite,  more  a  case  of  being  organised,  disciplined  and  happy  not  conceding  goals.  ""That  sort  of  arrangement  can  work  if  the  two  people  have  the  same  principles  and  ideals  and  work  very  closely.  But  it  seems  that  has  not  happened."""

The  German-born  Vaidisova  rallied  well  at  times  but  was  unable  to  find  a  way  back  after  falling  behind  3-2  in  the  opening  set.  Davenport,  who  closed  out  with  an  ace,  plays  Karolina  Sprem  in  the  next  round.

She  made  some  errors  but  probably  some  inexperience  played  a  role  in  that.

Former  world  number  one  |||    powered  her  way  into  the  fourth  round  with  a  straight  sets  win  over  Anna  Smashnova.  The  27th  seed  from  Israel  stuck  with  Williams  until  3-3  in  the  first  set  before  it  became  one-way  traffic.  |||    The  American  made  26  unforced  errors  but  was  still  good  enough  to  romp  through  the  contest  in  exactly  an  hour.

0	"SEC  to  rethink  post-Enron  rules  |||    The  US  stock  market  watchdog's  chairman  has  said  he  is  willing  to  soften  tough  new  US  corporate  governance  rules  to  ease  the  burden  on  foreign  firms.  |||    In  a  speech  at  the  London  School  of  Economics,  William  Donaldson  promised  ""several  initiatives"".  European  firms  have  protested  that  US  laws  introduced  after  the  Enron  scandal  make  Wall  Street  listings  too  costly.  The  US  regulator  said  foreign  firms  may  get  extra  time  to  comply  with  a  key  clause  in  the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act.  |||    The  Act  comes  into  force  in  mid-2005.  It  obliges  all  firms  with  US  stock  market  listings  to  make  declarations,  which,  critics  say,  will  add  substantially  to  the  cost  of  preparing  their  annual  accounts.  |||    Firms  that  break  the  new  law  could  face  huge  fines,  while  senior  executives  risk  jail  terms  of  up  to  20  years.  Mr  Donaldson  said  that  although  the  Act  does  not  provide  exemptions  for  foreign  firms,  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  would  ""continue  to  be  sensitive  to  the  need  to  accomodate  foreign  structures  and  requirements"".  There  are  few,  if  any,  who  disagree  with  the  intentions  of  the  Act,  which  obliges  chief  executives  to  sign  a  statement  taking  responsibility  for  the  accuracy  of  the  accounts.  But  European  firms  with  secondary  listings  in  New  York  have  objected  -  arguing  that  the  compliance  costs  outweigh  the  benefits  of  a  dual  listing.  The  Act  also  applies  to  firms  with  more  than  300  US  shareholders,  a  situation  many  firms  without  US  listings  could  find  themselves  in.  |||    The  300-shareholder  threshold  has  drawn  anger  as  it  effectively  blocks  the  most  obvious  remedy,  a  delisting.  Mr  Donaldson  said  the  SEC  would  ""consider  whether  there  should  be  a  new  approach  to  the  deregistration  process""  for  foreign  firms  unwilling  to  meet  US  requirements.  |||    ""We  should  seek  a  solution  that  will  preserve  investor  protections""  without  turning  the  US  market  into  ""one  with  no  exit"",  he  said.  He  revealed  that  his  staff  were  already  weighing  up  the  merits  of  delaying  the  implementation  of  the  Act's  least  popular  measure  -  Section  404  -  for  foreign  firms.  Seen  as  particularly  costly  to  implement,  Section  404  obliges  chief  executives  to  take  responsibility  for  the  firm's  internal  controls  by  signing  a  compliance  statement  in  the  annual  accounts.  The  SEC  has  already  delayed  implementation  of  this  clause  for  smaller  firms  -  including  US  ones  -  with  market  capitalisations  below  $700m  (£374m).  |||    A  delegation  of  European  firms  visited  the  SEC  in  December  to  press  for  change,  the  Financial  Times  reported.  |||    It  was  led  by  Digby  Jones,  director  general  of  the  UK's  Confederation  of  British  Industry  (CBI)  and  included  representatives  of  BASF,  Siemens  and  Cadbury  Schweppes.  Compliance  costs  are  already  believed  to  be  making  firms  wary  of  US  listings.  Air  China  picked  the  London  Stock  Exchange  for  its  secondary  listing  in  its  $1.07bn  (£558m)  stock  market  debut  last  month.  There  are  also  rumours  that  two  Chinese  state-run  banks  -  China  Construction  Bank  and  Bank  of  China  -  have  abandoned  plans  for  multi-billion  dollar  listings  in  New  York  later  this  year.  Instead,  the  cost  of  Sarbanes-Oxley  has  persuaded  them  to  stick  to  a  single  listing  in  Hong  Kong,  according  to  press  reports  in  China." 

1	"US  composer  recreates  Bach  score  |||    A  US  musicologist  has  recreated  a  lost  musical  score  by  German  composer  Johann  Sebastian  Bach.  |||    The  1728  composition,  called  Wedding  Cantata  BWV  216,  was  found  among  the  papers  of  Japanese  pianist  Chieko  Hara,  who  died  in  Japan  in  2001  aged  86.  The  work,  written  for  the  wedding  of  a  daughter  of  a  German  customs  official,  was  missing  for  80  years.  Joshua  Rifkin  -  a  composer  and  leading  interpreter  of  Bach  -  has  recreated  the  missing  instrumental  parts.  |||    He  said  he  originally  wanted  to  let  the  lost  cantata  lie  in  rest.  ""Maybe  a  fragment  should  stay  a  fragment,""  said  Rifkin.  ""Then  I  thought  of  palaeontologists,  from  one  bone  they  figure  the  entire  dinosaur.  This  is  my  dinosaur.""  The  eight  rediscovered  pages  consist  of  vocal  pieces  in  German  for  soprano  and  alto,  with  the  seven  movements  lasting  for  a  total  of  between  20  and  25  minutes.  The  instrumental  parts  were  entirely  lost  except  for  two  recycled  movements,  a  duet  and  an  aria  which  had  been  used  elsewhere  in  Bach's  work.  Rifkin  likened  the  challenge  to  a  ""musical  Rubik's  cube"".  ""I  could  not  reconstruct  what  Bach  wrote  but  I  could  give  the  people  of  today  an  idea  of  what  his  music  was  like,""  he  said.  ""It  sounds  like  Bach's  music,  but  the  listener  should  not  know  which  part  is  Bach's  and  which  part  is  mine."""

Tacit  approval  from  the  White  House  for  the  weaker  greenback,  which  could  help  counteract  huge  deficits,  has  helped  trigger  the  move.  But  now  Europe  says  the  euro  has  had  enough,  and  Asia  must  now  share  some  of  the  burden.  |||    China  is  seen  as  the  main  culprit,  with  exports  soaring  up  35%  in  2004  partly  on  the  back  of  a  currency  pegged  to  the  dollar.  ""Asia  should  engage  in  greater  currency  flexibility,""  said  French  finance  minister  Herve  Gaymard,  after  a  meeting  with  his  German  counterpart  Hans  Eichel.  Markets  responded  by  pushing  the  euro  lower,  in  the  expectation  that  the  rhetoric  -  and  the  pressure  -  is  unlikely  to  ease  ahead  of  a  meeting  of  the  G7  industrialised  countries  next  week.  Early  on  Tuesday  morning,  the  dollar  had  edged  higher  to  1.3040  euros.  The  yen,  meanwhile,  had  strengthened  to  102.975  against  the  dollar  by  0730  GMT."

Her  departure  will  come  into  effect  on  1  February  and  follows  the  departure  of  co-chief  executive  Rebecca  Navarednam  on  1  January.  Ms  Mohd-Saaid  is  to  be  replaced  by  Lillian  Tan,  presently  a  non-executive  director  of  the  company  and  head  of  a  Malaysian  retailer.  |||    In  a  statement  issued  on  Thursday,  Laura  Ashley  thanked  Ms  Mohd-Saaid  for  her  services  to  the  company.  Its  shares  were  down  8.51%  to  10.75p  in  late  Thursday  morning  trading  on  the  London  Stock  Exchange.  |||    Since  2002,  Ms  Tan  has  been  managing  director  and  chief  executive  of  Metrojaya,  one  of  the  largest  retail  groups  in  Malaysia.  Laura  Ashley,  which  is  due  to  issue  its  next  trading  statement  in  the  next  few  weeks,  has  in  recent  months  been  hit  by  reports  of  poor  sales.  In  October  last  year,  it  announced  the  closure  of  one  of  its  two  Welsh  factories.  In  September,  the  company  had  said  that  its  half-year  clothing  sales  had  been  ""below  expectations"".  In  recent  times,  it  has  put  renewed  focus  on  home  furnishings  rather  than  clothing,  but  last  September  it  reported  that  interim  six  month  losses  had  risen  from  £1m  to  £1.2m,  while  sales  had  fallen  from  £138m  to  £118m.  |||    Laura  Ashley,  which  floated  on  the  London  Stock  Exchange  for  £200m  ($376m)  in  1995,  is  majority-owned  by  Malaysia  entrepreneur  Dr  Khoo  Kay  Peng.  In  1996,  its  share  price  was  more  than  200p.  It  has  long  been  reported  that  Dr  Khoo  intends  to  take  the  company  private,  but  he  has  always  denied  this.  ""Laura  Ashley  is  a  bit  of  a  shrivelled  husk  of  a  company,""  said  retail  analyst  Nick  Bubb  of  Evolution  Securities.  ""It  is  all  pretty  odd  with  its  Malaysian  owners  seemingly  just  shuffling  the  deckchairs.""  Laura  Ashley  was  founded  by  its  late  namesake  in  Kent  in  1955,  before  moving  to  Mid  Wales  in  1961  where  it  still  has  its  main  UK  factory." 

2	"Row  over  'police'  power  for  CSOs  |||    The  Police  Federation  has  said  it  strongly  opposes  giving  Community  Support  Officers  (CSOs)  the  power  to  detain  suspects  for  up  to  30  minutes.  |||    The  powers  -  piloted  in  six  areas  -  were  extended  to  all  police  forces  in  England  and  Wales  on  Thursday.  The  federation  said  CSOs  do  not  have  the  experience,  training  and  safety  equipment  to  deal  with  ""potentially  confrontational""  situations.  But  the  government  said  the  move  would  help  police  ""build  safe  communities"".  Police  Federation  chairman  Jan  Berry  said  civilian  officers  should  act  as  ""eyes  and  ears""  for  the  police.  |||    ""They  should  not  be  placed  in  potentially  confrontational  situations  -  which  detaining  someone  clearly  is,""  she  said.  CSOs  can  now  use  reasonable  force  to  detain  suspects  for  up  to  30  minutes  while  they  wait  for  police  officers  to  arrive.  The  powers  will  be  granted  by  chief  constables  of  local  forces.  Ms  Berry  said  this  ""dramatically  changes""  their  original  purpose  -  to  be  a  visible  presence  combating  low-level  crime  and  anti-social  behaviour.  She  said  more  powers  would  mean  more  paperwork  and  less  time  on  the  street.  |||    But  Home  Office  minister  Hazel  Blears  defended  the  move  saying  it  would  give  the  civilian  officers  ""just  that  little  bit  of  edge"".  She  denied  their  role  was  changing  and  said  the  new  powers  would  not  take  them  away  from  the  streets.  |||    ""The  powers  that  we  are  bringing  in  are  things  that  they  need  to  do  when  they  are  out  patrolling,""  she  said.  The  Home  Office  has  produced  its  own  report  on  CSOs  which  it  describes  as  ""encouraging"".  Ms  Blears  said  the  study  shows  CSOs  are  ""making  a  real  difference""  in  the  fight  against  crime.  But  the  report  also  showed  that  the  public  is  having  difficulties  distinguishing  between  a  civilian  officer  and  a  proper  officer.  |||    Shadow  home  secretary  David  Davis  said  the  research  appeared  to  acknowledge  that  CSOs  were  having  no  discernible  effect  on  crime  figures.  |||    ""While  the  answer  is  a  lot  more  real  police,  the  government  wants  to  recruit  25,000  people  who  can't  arrest  anyone,""  he  said.  BBC  home  affairs  correspondent  Danny  Shaw  said  the  research  is  inconclusive.  There  are  about  3,500  CSOs  in  England  and  Wales  but  the  government  intends  to  have  25,000  on  the  streets  by  2008  at  a  cost  of  £50m.  They  already  have  powers  to  hand  out  fines  for  a  wide  range  of  offences.  The  Serious  Organised  Crime  and  Police  Bill  proposes  extra  powers  to  search  suspects,  enforce  licensing  offences,  direct  traffic  and  deter  begging." 

2	"Lib  Dems  unveil  women's  manifesto  |||    The  Liberal  Democrats  are  attempting  to  woo  female  voters  with  the  launch  of  their  manifesto  for  women.  |||    Charles  Kennedy  is  pledging  a  maternity  income  guarantee  and  a  pension  system  based  on  years  of  residence  rather  than  national  insurance  payments.  He  also  thinks  women  will  back  plans  to  end  university  tuition  fees  and  for  free  long-term  care  for  the  elderly.  Both  Labour  and  the  Conservatives  have  said  they  also  plan  to  boost  pensions  and  to  improve  childcare  support.  Mr  Kennedy  says  he  wants  to  deal  with  policy  areas  that  disadvantage  women.  ""Two  million  pensioners  in  Britain  currently  live  below  the  government's  own  poverty  line  -  two-thirds  of  whom  are  women,""  he  said.  |||    He  says  that  pensions  based  on  the  number  of  years  worked  ignore  the  contribution  women  make  caring  for  children.  The  Lib  Dem's  Citizen's  Pension,  based  on  length  of  residency  not  on  national  insurance  contributions,  would  address  that  imbalance,  Mr  Kennedy  argues.  Under  the  package,  new  mothers  would  be  offered  minimum  guaranteed  maternity  pay  of  £170  a  week  for  the  first  six  months  after  the  birth  of  their  first  child.  Mr  Kennedy  also  believes  the  party's  plans  to  use  the  money  saved  from  not  introducing  ""illiberal""  ID  cards  to  boost  police  numbers  by  10,000  would  appeal  to  women  too.  The  policies  are  not  new  announcements,  but  the  way  they  are  structured  as  a  package  to  appeal  to  women  is.  |||    Mr  Kennedy  also  points  to  the  fact  that  40%  of  the  party's  candidates  set  to  stand  in  winnable  or  target  seats  are  women.  Party  strategists  claim  that  where  women  candidates  replace  men  turnout  rises  by  4%.  Mr  Kennedy  began  the  pitch  for  female  support  with  an  interview  on  BBC  Radio  4's  Women's  Hour  on  Monday.  During  the  interview  Mr  Kennedy  revealed  that  he  planned  to  structure  the  party's  general  election  campaign  around  the  birth  of  his  first  child,  which  is  expected  in  April.  The  baby  and  his  wife  Sarah  would  be  ""priority  number  one""  even  if  it  arrived  in  the  middle  of  the  election  campaign,  he  said.  |||    Party  strategists  believe  winning  over  a  significant  proportion  of  women  voters  is  key  to  electoral  success.  A  party  spokesman  said  it  was  courting  female  votes  because  they  tended  to  vote  more  than  men  and  are  believed  to  be  more  considered  and  open-minded  in  deciding  who  they  vote  for.  Labour's  deputy  minister  for  women  Jacqui  Smith  accused  the  Lib  Dems  of  offering  ""false  promises""  to  women  and  said  their  sums  did  not  add  up.  She  said:  ""These  proposals  would  increase  the  costs  to  the  public  purse  drastically  year  on  year,  and  hard  working  families  will  pay  dearly,  through  either  increased  taxes  or  reduced  spending  on  public  services"".  The  Labour  party  has  committed  itself  to  ""universal,  affordable  and  flexible""  childcare  for  parents  of  all  3  to  14  year-olds,  including  childcare  centred  on  schools  to  be  available  from  8am  to  6pm.  In  September,  Trade  and  Industry  Secretary  Patricia  Hewitt  said  she  would  like  to  see  longer  paid  maternity  leave,  higher  paternity  pay  and  the  extension  of  flexible  working  rights  to  carers,  if  Labour  won  a  third  term.  The  Conservatives  are  yet  to  unveil  their  manifesto  plans  for  childcare  but  said  in  November  they  would  increase  maternity  pay  and  pay  the  child  tax  credit  in  cash  to  parents  to  spend  as  they  like,  on  a  nanny,  au  pair  or  even  a  family  member,  such  as  a  grandparent,  acting  as  a  carer.  They  were  also  consulting  on  making  childcare  costs  tax  deductible." 

3	"Nadal  puts  Spain  2-0  up  |||    Result:  Nadal  6-7  (6/8)  6-2  7-6  (8/6)  6-2  Roddick  |||    Spain's  Rafael  Nadal  beats  Andy  Roddick  of  the  USA  in  the  second  singles  match  rubber  of  the  2004  Davis  Cup  final  in  Seville.  Spain  lead  1-0  after  Carlos  Moya  beat  Mardy  Fish  in  straight  sets  in  the  opening  match  of  the  tie.  |||    Nadal  holds  his  nerve  and  the  crowd  goes  wild  as  Spain  go  2-0  up  in  the  tie.  |||    Roddick  holds  serve  to  force  Nadal  to  serve  for  the  match  but  the  American  surely  cannot  turn  things  around  now.  |||    Nadal  works  Roddick  around  the  court  on  two  consecutive  points  to  earn  two  break  points.  One  is  enough,  the  Spaniard  secures  the  double-break  and  Roddick  is  now  teetering  on  the  edge.  |||    Roddick  is  trying  to  gee  himself  up  but  the  clay  surface  is  taking  its  toll  on  his  game  and  he  is  looking  tired.  Nadal  wins  the  game  to  love.  |||    Nadal  steps  up  the  pressure  to  break  and  Spain  have  the  early  initiative  in  the  fourth  set.  |||    Nadal  also  holds  convincingly  as  both  players  feel  their  way  into  the  fourth  set.  |||    Roddick  shrugs  off  the  disappointment  of  losing  the  third-set  tiebreak  and  breezes  through  his  first  service  game  of  the  fourth  set.  |||    Nadal  earns  the  first  mini-break  in  the  tiebreak  as  the  match  enters  its  fourth  hour.  A  couple  of  stunning  points  follow,  one  where  Nadal  chases  down  a  Roddick  shot  and  turns  into  a  passing  winner.  Then  Roddick  produces  some  amazing  defence  at  the  net  to  take  the  score  to  4-4.  Roddick  has  two  serves  for  the  set  but  double-faults  to  take  the  score  to  5-5.  Nadal  saves  a  Roddick  set  point  then  earns  his  own  with  a  drive  volley  -  and  a  crosscourt  passing  winner  sends  the  crowd  wild.  |||    Nadal  tries  to  up  his  aggression  and  he  passes  Roddick  down  the  line  to  go  15-40  and  two  set  points  up.  Roddick  saves  the  first  with  a  desperate  lunge  volley  and  smacks  a  volley  winner  across  the  court  to  take  the  score  back  to  deuce  before  securing  the  game.  The  set  will  go  to  another  tiebreak.  |||    Nadal  enjoys  another  straightforward  hold  and  Roddick  must  once  again  serve  to  stay  in  the  set.  |||    Roddick  again  holds  on,  despite  some  brilliant  shot-making  from  his  opponent.  |||    Nadal  races  through  his  service  game  to  put  the  pressure  straight  back  onto  Roddick.  |||    Roddick  hangs  in  on  his  serve  to  level  matters  but  Nadal  is  making  him  fight  for  every  point.  |||    Nadal  could  be  suffering  a  disappointment  hangover  from  the  previous  game  as  he  goes  0-30  down  and  then  has  to  save  a  break  point  after  a  tremendous  rally  in  which  he  is  forced  into  some  brilliant  defence.  But  it  pays  off  and  the  Spaniard  edges  ahead  in  the  set.  |||    Roddick's  serve  is  not  firing  as  ferociously  as  usual  and  has  to  rely  on  his  sheer  competitive  determination  to  stay  in  the  set.  Three  times,  Nadal  forces  a  break  point  and  three  times  the  world  number  two  hangs  in.  And  Roddick's  grit  pays  off  as  he  manages  to  hold.  |||    Roddick  still  looks  a  bit  sluggish  but  he  attacks  the  net  and  is  rewarded  with  a  break  point,  which  Nadal  saves  with  a  good  first  serve  and  the  Spaniard  goes  on  to  hold.  |||    There  is  a  disruption  in  play  as  Roddick  is  upset  about  something  in  the  crowd.  The  Spanish  captain  gets  involved  as  does  the  match  referee  but  it  is  unclear  what  the  problem  is.  One  thing  for  certain  is  that  the  crowd  are  roused  into  support  of  Nadal  and  they  go  wild  when  Roddick  loses  the  next  point  and  goes  break  point  down.  Roddick  saves  the  break  point  and  then  bangs  down  his  ninth  ace  before  clinching  the  game  with  a  service  winner.  |||    The  game  passes  the  two-hour  mark  as  Nadal  holds  serve  to  edge  ahead  in  the  third  set.  |||    Now  Roddick  has  to  defend  a  break  point  and  he  produces  a  characteristic  ace  to  save  it.  It  is  immediately  followed  by  another  and  he  holds  with  a  little  dinked  half-volley  winner.  |||    Roddick  is  looking  a  little  leaden-footed  but  does  carve  out  a  break  point  for  himself.  But  he  plays  it  poorly  and  Nadal  avoids  the  danger.  |||    Roddick  has  gone  off  the  boil  and  again  struggles.  He  fails  to  get  down  properly  for  a  low  forehand  volley  and  gives  Nadal  three  break  points.  The  American  blasts  an  ace  to  save  one  but  follows  up  with  a  double  fault  and  the  rubber  is  level.  |||    Nadal  edges  towards  taking  the  second  set  with  a  comfortable  hold.  |||    Two  good  serves  put  Roddick  30-0  up  but  he  then  makes  a  couple  of  errors  to  find  himself  30-40  down.  He  saves  the  break  point  with  an  ace  and  then  manages  to  hold.  |||    Roddick's  level  has  dropped  while  Nadal  is  on  a  hot  streak.  The  Spaniard  includes  a  superb  crosscourt  winner  off  the  back  foot  as  he  races  through  his  service  game  without  dropping  a  point.  |||    Roddick  double-faults  twice  and  Nadal  takes  full  advantage  of  the  break  point  offered,  powering  a  passing  winner  past  Roddick.  |||    Nadal  wins  another  tight  game.  Neither  player  has  dipped  from  the  high  standard  of  play  in  the  first  set.  |||    Nadal  puts  the  American  under  pressure  and  Roddick  saves  a  break  point  with  a  superb  stop  volley  before  going  on  to  hold.  |||    Nadal  puts  the  disappointment  of  losing  the  first-set  tiebreak  to  claim  the  opening  game  in  the  second.  |||    Roddick  double-faults  to  concede  the  first  mini-break  and  then  Nadal  loops  a  crosscourt  winner  to  seize  advantage  in  the  tiebreak.  He  lets  one  slip  but  wins  his  next  serve  to  earn  three  set  points.  But  Roddick  saves  them  and  then  earns  one  himself.  Nadal  comes  up  with  a  down-the-line  winner  but  then  nets  tamely  on  Roddick's  next  set  point.  |||    Nadal's  nerve  is  tested  as  he  tries  to  force  a  tiebreak.  Both  players  come  up  with  some  scintillating  tennis  and  the  Spaniard  has  several  chances  to  clinch  the  game  before  finally  doing  so  when  Roddick  drives  wide.  |||    A  pulsating  game  sees  Nadal  racing  round  the  court  retrieving  and  refusing  to  give  Roddick  any  easy  points.  The  point  of  the  match  so  far  involves  Roddick's  slam-dunk  smash  being  returned  by  Nadal  before  Roddick  finally  manages  to  end  the  rally.  On  the  very  next  point,  Nadal  blasts  a  forehand  service  return  from  right  of  court  that  passes  Roddick  and  even  the  American  is  forced  to  applaud.  But  Roddick  comes  up  with  two  big  serves  to  polish  off  the  game.  |||    Nadal  outplays  Roddick  to  reach  40-0  but  the  American  fights  back  to  40-30  before  Nadal's  powerful  crosscourt  forehand  winner  secures  the  game.  |||    The  crowd  are  getting  very  involved,  cheering  between  Roddick's  first  and  second  serves.  But  the  American  comes  through  to  hold  and  edge  ahead  in  the  set.  |||    Nadal  manages  to  hold  again  despite  Roddick  piling  the  pressure  on  his  serve.  The  Spaniard  wins  the  game  courtesy  of  another  lucky  net  cord.  |||    Roddick  double  faults  buts  manages  to  keep  his  composure.  A  well-placed  serve  is  unreturnable  and  Roddick  holds.  |||    A  powerful  ace  down  the  middle  gives  Nadal  a  simple  love  service  game  -  the  first  time  he  has  held  serve  so  far  in  the  match.  If  Roddick  didn't  know  before,  he  knows  now  that  he  is  in  a  real  contest.  |||    Another  superb  game  as  Nadal  breaks  to  once  again  lift  the  roof.  He  produces  some  fine  groundstrokes  to  leave  Roddick  chasing  shadows.  Four  of  the  first  five  games  have  seen  a  break  of  serve.  |||    Despite  the  disappointment  of  losing  his  serve,  Roddick  is  not  phased  and  storms  into  a  40-15  lead  when  the  umpire  leaves  his  seat  to  confirm  a  close  line-call.  Nadal  takes  the  next  point  but  Roddick  breaks  again  with  a  sharp  volley  at  the  net.  |||    Roddick's  advantage  is  short  lived  as  Nadal  breaks  back  immediately.  A  fortunate  net  cord  helps  the  Spaniard  on  his  way  and  when  Roddick  fires  a  forehand  cross  court  shot  wide  to  lose  his  serve,  Nadal  pumps  his  fist  in  celebration.  |||    The  American  is  pumped  up  for  this  clash  and  takes  on  Nadal's  serve  from  the  start.  Nadal's  drop  shot  is  agonisingly  called  out  and  Roddick  claims  the  vital  first  break.  |||    After  Moya's  win  in  the  opening  rubber,  a  raucous  Seville  crowd  is  buoyed  by  Nadal's  impressive  start  which  sees  him  race  into  a  30-0  lead.  However  Roddick  fights  back  to  hold  his  serve." 

2	"Woolf  murder  sentence  rethink  |||    Plans  to  give  murderers  lighter  sentences  if  they  plead  guilty  have  been  watered  down.  |||    There  was  an  outcry  three  months  ago  when  the  Sentencing  Guidelines  Council  -  led  by  Lord  Woolf  -  published  its  proposals  for  England  and  Wales.  It  had  suggested  judges  should  reduce  sentences  by  a  third  for  murderers  who  confessed  at  the  earliest  opportunity.  But  that  has  now  been  changed  to  one-sixth,  with  no  reduction  for  those  killers  given  a  ""whole  life  tariff"".  At  the  time  Lord  Woolf,  the  Lord  Chief  Justice,  had  said  the  one  third  reduction  would  only  be  in  extraordinary  circumstances  -  for  example,  if  people  gave  themselves  up  before  their  crime  had  even  been  detected.  The  guidelines  were  to  recognise  the  need  to  spare  victims  and  witnesses  the  trauma  of  going  to  court  where  possible,  by  allowing  lighter  sentences  for  guilty  pleas  and  co-operation,  he  said.  |||    But  director  of  the  Victims  of  Crime  Trust,  Norman  Brennan,  accused  Lord  Woolf  of  having  an  ""arrogant  contempt  for  victims  of  crime  and  the  law-abiding  public"".  The  National  Association  of  Probation  Officers  said  the  move  would  be  ""political  suicide"".  In  revised  proposals  from  the  Sentencing  Guidelines  Council  (SGC),  the  section  on  murder  said  possible  reductions  would  have  to  be  ""weighed  carefully""  by  a  judge  so  they  did  not  lead  to  ""an  inappropriately  short  sentence"".  Where  it  was  appropriate  to  reduce  the  minimum  term  having  regard  to  a  plea  of  guilty,  the  maximum  reduction  would  be  one  sixth,  and  should  never  exceed  five  years,  it  said.  |||    In  a  statement  issued  on  Wednesday  Lord  Woolf  said:  ""I  have  no  doubt  that  being  able  to  call  on  the  diverse  backgrounds  and  experiences  of  all  those  that  serve  on  the  SGC  has  vastly  improved  the  final  guidelines.  ""I  am  confident,  as  a  result,  that  judges  will  be  better  placed  to  deliver  sentences  which  are  effective  both  as  punishments  and  deterrents  to  offending  and  reoffending.""  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions,  Ken  Macdonald  QC,  who  sits  on  the  SGC,  said  the  principle  of  discounting  sentences  to  offenders  for  early  guilty  pleas  is  set  down  by  parliament.  ""What  the  new  guideline  on  reduced  sentences  for  guilty  pleas  does  is  increase  the  chances  of  convicting  the  guilty  by  bringing  clarity  to  this  process.  ""It  represents  a  tougher  regime  than  existed  previously,  because  the  discount  is  automatically  reduced  if  a  guilty  plea  is  not  made  at  the  first  available  opportunity,""  he  said." 

0	"Takeover  offer  for  Sunderland  FC  |||    Bob  Murray,  chairman  of  Sunderland  FC,  has  launched  a  £1.5m  ($2.8m)  bid  for  the  club  after  buying  broadcaster  BSkyB's  stake  in  the  business.  |||    Mr  Murray  is  already  Sunderland's  leading  shareholder,  holding  a  37.6%  stake,  and  now  hopes  to  take  full  control  of  the  Championship  side.  Mr  Murray  said  the  club  would  find  it  easier  to  attract  more  investment  by  having  a  single  majority  owner.  Sunderland  delisted  its  shares  from  the  stock  market  in  August.  |||    A  lifetime  Sunderland  supporter  and  board  director  since  1984,  Mr  Murray  agreed  to  buy  BSkyB's  4.76%  holding  in  the  Wearside  club  on  Tuesday  -  taking  his  stake  to  42.3%.  Under  stock  market  rules,  Mr  Murray  is  required  to  make  an  offer  for  the  remaining  shares  that  he  does  not  already  own  at  the  same  price  paid  for  the  BSkyB  holding  of  31p  a  share.  |||    Should  the  offer  be  fully  accepted,  Mr  Murray  said  he  expected  to  pay  a  maximum  of  £1.53m  for  the  remaining  shares.  He  also  stressed  that  fans  who  wanted  to  keep  in  touch  with  the  club's  financial  affairs  could  retain  a  small  number  of  shares,  enabling  them  to  attend  annual  meetings.  ""The  football  sector  is  experiencing  significant  changes  and  uncertainty,""  Mr  Murray  said  in  a  statement.  ""The  recent  speculation  surrounding  Malcolm  Glazer  and  Manchester  United  has  shown  the  unsettling  effect  possible  where  there  are  a  number  of  disparate  interests,""  he  added.  ""I  believe  that  this  offer  will  strengthen  the  company  and  remove  the  potential  for  that  type  of  uncertainty.""  |||    Sunderland  were  relegated  from  the  Premiership  in  2003  but  are  currently  pushing  for  promotion.  The  club  managed  to  reduce  its  losses  last  year  from  £20.6m  to  £1.2m  after  selling  a  host  of  leading  players.  However,  the  club's  turnover  dropped  sharply  from  £42.5m  to  £28.5m  over  the  same  period,  because  of  a  fall  in  broadcast  revenues.  BSkyB  bought  its  stake  in  Sunderland  in  1999  as  part  of  a  five  year  media  partnership  deal.  The  deal  expired  last  month." 

2	"Child  access  laws  shake-up  |||    Parents  who  refuse  to  allow  former  partners  contact  with  their  children  could  be  electronically  tagged  under  plans  being  considered  by  ministers.  Curfews  and  community  service  orders  were  other  options  which  could  be  used  if  court  orders  to  allow  parental  access  were  defied,  Lord  Falconer  said.  The  constitutional  affairs  secretary  outlined  some  of  the  plans  on  Tuesday.  He  denied  fathers'  activists  had  forced  the  changes,  telling  the  BBC  ""there  is  a  recognition  that  something  is  wrong"".  Between  15,000  and  20,000  couples  go  to  court  to  resolve  access  disputes  each  year,  although  in  nine  out  of  10  separations  there  is  no  court  intervention.  |||    Lord  Falconer  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme  he  hoped  voluntary  mediation  could  help  solve  disputes  before  they  reached  court.  But  he  opposed  compulsory  mediation,  saying  that  it  would  lead  to  many  people  taking  part  with  the  wrong  attitude.  Other  plans  include:  |||        -  Parenting  plans  to  give  advice  on  access  arrangements,  based  on  real-life  examples  that  have  worked  in  the  past      -  Extending  in-court  conciliation  -  more  informal  hearings  before  contested  court  cases      -  Better  access  to  legal,  emotional  and  practical  advice  by  telephone  and  internet      -  Legal  aid  changes  to  give  incentives  for  early  resolution  of  disputes.        |||    Judges  can  already  jail  parents  who  breach  contact  orders  but  that  was  a  ""nuclear  option""  which  was  rarely  used  as  it  was  not  seen  as  being  in  the  child's  interests,  a  spokesman  said.  The  aim  of  the  new  legislation  was  to  provide  a  ""medium  range""  of  penalties,  such  as  fines,  community  service  orders,  compulsory  anger  management  or  parenting  classes  or  curfews.  |||    Failure  to  comply  with  these  measures  could  result  in  offenders  being  electronically  tagged.  On  the  possibility  of  tagging  uncooperative  parents,  Lord  Falconer  said:  ""Tagging  may  be  going  too  far,  but  let's  have  a  debate  about  that.""  Full  details  of  the  new  powers  will  not  be  revealed  until  a  bill  is  published  ""in  the  next  two  weeks,""  a  spokesman  said.  |||    The  government's  proposals  have  met  with  disapproval  from  fathers'  rights  groups.  John  Ison,  from  the  controversial  group  Fathers  4  Justice,  said:  ""It  is  very  disappointing.  What  we  have  got  is  a  cynical  case  of  recycling  existing  legislation.""  Jim  Parton,  from  Families  Need  Fathers,  said  the  new  proposals  ""lacked  compulsion"".  |||    ""We  would  like  to  see  couples  develop  a  plan  and  then  have  it  as  a  source  of  a  court  order  -  then  you  know  where  you  stand,  you  know  what  the  minimum  access  is.  ""Otherwise,  you  see  people  make  agreements  which  then  fall  apart.""  Mr  Parton  said  he  had  been  told  by  Children's  Minister  Margaret  Hodge  there  was  not  enough  time  to  pass  the  bill  through  parliament  before  the  general  election,  which  is  likely  to  take  place  in  May.  |||    The  Conservatives  have  called  for  an  equal  split  between  parents  on  access  to  be  made  law.  Theresa  May,  shadow  secretary  for  the  family,  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme  that  the  government's  plans  were  ""inadequate""  and  were  ""papering  over  the  cracks  of  the  current  system"".  She  said  a  Conservative  government  would  bring  a  ""radical  reform""  of  the  family  courts,  as  well  as  enforcing  a  ""legal  presumption  of  co-parenting  and  compulsory  mediation"".  ""We  want  to  make  courts  the  last  resort,  rather  than  the  first  resort,""  she  added.  The  government  says  children  cannot  simply  be  divided  up  ""like  property""  when  a  marriage  collapses.  The  Liberal  Democrats  have  argued  for  flexibility  in  deciding  access  rules,  rather  than  having  ""rigid  targets""." 

2	"Sainsbury's  Labour  election  gift  |||    Science  Minister  Lord  Sainsbury  has  made  a  £2m  donation  to  the  Labour  Party  for  its  General  Election  fund.  |||    It  is  the  latest  hefty  donation  to  the  party  by  the  billionaire  -  he  has  contributed  more  than  £10m  since  1999.  David  Sainsbury  said  he  was  pleased  to  give  cash  to  a  party  that  had  the  ""vision""  to  deliver  economic  prosperity  and  better  public  services  for  Britain.  General  Secretary  Matt  Carter  said  it  was  ""a  fantastic  gift""  that  would  help  Labour  ""fight  and  win  the  election"".  |||    ""Through  the  generosity  of  David  Sainsbury  and  other  Labour  supporters,  Labour  will  be  campaigning  hard  to  take  Britain  forward  and  to  stop  the  Tories  taking  us  back,""  Mr  Carter  said.  Lord  Sainsbury  added:  ""I  am  pleased  to  be  able  to  make  this  contribution  to  the  general  election  funds  of  the  Labour  Party  because  I  believe  that  they  are  the  only  party  that  has  the  vision  to  deliver  both  economic  prosperity  and  better  public  services  for  Britain.""  The  64-year-old  latest  donation  follows  a  £2.5m  gift  to  the  party  in  2003.  Lord  Sainsbury  was  created  a  life  peer  in  1997,  a  year  before  he  was  appointed  as  minister  for  science." 

3	"Thanou  bullish  over  drugs  hearing  |||    Katerina  Thanou  is  confident  she  and  fellow  sprinter  Kostas  Kenteris  will  not  be  punished  for  missing  drugs  tests  before  the  Athens  Olympics.  |||    The  Greek  pair  appeared  at  a  hearing  on  Saturday  which  will  determine  whether  their  provisional  bans  from  athletics'  ruling  body  the  IAAF  should  stand.  ""After  five  months  we  finally  had  the  chance  to  give  explanations.  I  am  confident  and  optimistic,""  said  Thanou.  ""We  presented  new  evidence  to  the  committee  that  they  were  not  aware  of.""  |||    The  athletes'  lawyer  Grigoris  Ioanidis  said  he  believed  the  independent  disciplinary  committee  set  up  by  the  Greek  Athletics  Federation  (SEGAS)  would  find  them  innocent.  ""We  are  almost  certain  that  the  charges  will  be  dropped,""  said  Ioanidis.  |||    ""We  believe  that  we  have  presented  [a  case]  that  the  charges  are  unreasonable.""  Thanou,  the  2000  Olympic  women's  100m  silver  medallist,  and  Sydney  200m  champion  Kenteris  were  suspended  by  the  IAAF  for  missing  three  drugs  tests.  The  third  was  supposed  to  take  place  on  the  eve  of  the  Athens  Games  last  August,  but  the  pair  could  not  be  found  in  the  athletes'  village.  They  were  later  taken  to  hospital  after  claiming  to  have  been  involved  in  a  motorcycle  accident.  Thanou's  coach  Christos  Tzekos  was  also  suspended  by  the  IAAF.  ""We  were  asked  [by  the  disciplinary  committee]  all  kinds  of  questions  about  the  night  of  12  August,""  said  Tzekos.  ""We  did  not  leave  any  gaps.  As  far  as  I  am  concerned  there  is  no  such  issue  [of  refusing  to  be  tested],  and  I  am  very  optimistic.""  Tzekos,  Thanou  and  Kenteris,  who  have  all  denied  the  charges,  can  expect  a  decision  within  a  month.  ""Deliberations  will  start  after  some  additional  documents  are  brought  in  by  Thursday,""  said  committee  chairman  Kostas  Panagopoulos.  ""I  estimate  that  the  final  ruling  will  be  issued  by  the  end  of  February.""" 

3	"Edwards  tips  Idowu  for  Euro  gold  |||    World  outdoor  triple  jump  record  holder  and  BBC  pundit  Jonathan  Edwards  believes  Phillips  Idowu  can  take  gold  at  the  European  Indoor  Championships.  |||    Idowu  landed  17.30m  at  the  British  trials  in  Sheffield  last  month  to  lead  the  world  triple  jump  rankings.  ""It's  all  down  to  him,  but  if  he  jumps  as  well  as  he  did  in  Sheffield  he  could  win  the  gold  medal,""  said  Edwards.  ""His  ability  is  undoubted  but  all  his  best  performances  seem  to  happen  in  domestic  meetings.""  |||    Idowu  made  his  breakthrough  five  years  ago  but  so  far  has  only  a  Commonwealth  silver  medal  to  his  name.  Edwards  himself  kept  Idowu  off  top  spot  at  the  Manchester  Games.  But  he  believes  the  European  Indoors  in  Madrid  represent  a  chance  for  the  26-year-old  to  prove  his  credentials  as  Britain's  top  triple  jumper.  ""He  has  to  start  producing  at  international  level  and  here  is  the  beginning,""  said  Edwards.  ""Phillips  still  needs  to  be  much  more  consistent.  I'm  sure  a  victory  in  Madrid  will  build  up  his  confidence  and  self-belief  that  he  can  be  best  in  the  world.""  The  qualifying  round  of  the  men's  triple  jump  in  Madrid  takes  place  on  Friday  with  the  final  scheduled  for  Saturday.  Olympic  champion  Christian  Olsson  will  not  be  taking  part  as  he  is  out  for  the  entire  indoor  season  with  an  ankle  injury." 

3	"Mido  makes  third  apology  |||    Ahmed  'Mido'  Hossam  has  made  another  apology  to  the  Egyptian  people  in  an  attempt  to  rejoin  the  national  team.  |||    The  21-year-old  told  a  news  conference  in  Cairo  on  Sunday  that  he  is  sorry  for  the  problems  that  have  led  to  his  exclusion  from  the  Pharaohs  since  July  last  year.  Mido  said:  ""There  isn't  much  I  have  to  say  today,  all  there  is  to  say  is  that  I  came  specially  from  England  to  Egypt  to  rejoin  the  national  team  and  to  apologise  for  all  my  mistakes.""  Mido  was  axed  by  former  coach  Marco  Tardelli  after  failing  to  answer  a  national  call-up,  claiming  he  had  a  groin  injury.  But  he  then  played  in  a  friendly  for  his  club  AS  Roma  within  24  hours  of  a  World  Cup  qualifying  match  at  home  to  Cameroon  last  September.  Mido  added:  ""It's  not  my  right  to  give  orders  and  say  when  I  want  to  play  ...  at  the  same  time  I  will  always  make  sure  that  I  put  the  national's  team's  matches  as  my  top  priority.  ""I  feel  that  the  national  players  are  playing  with  a  new  spirit  as  I  saw  them  play  against  Belgium  (Egypt  won  4-0  on  Wednesday)  and  I  simply  want  to  add  to  their  success.  ""I  do  confess  that  I  was  rude  to  the  Egyptian  press  at  times  but  now  I  have  gained  more  experience  and  know  that  I  will  never  go  anywhere  without  the  press's  support.  ""Many  of  the  international  stars  like  David  Beckham  and  (Zinedine)  Zidane  had  the  press  opposing  them.  ""So  I'm  now  used  to  the  fact  that  the  press  can  be  against  me  at  times  and  I  don't  have  to  overreact  when  this  happens.  Meanwhile,  Egypt  FA  spokesman  Methat  Shalaby  welcomed  the  apology  and  said  no  one  had  exerted  pressure  on  Mido  to  apologise.  ""Mido's  apology  today  does  not  negatively  affect  Mido  in  anyway,  on  the  contrary  it  makes  him  a  bigger  star  and  a  role  model  for  all  football  players,""  Shalaby  said.  Shalaby  earlier  said  that  after  an  apology  Mido  would  be  available  for  the  national  side  if  coach  Hassan  Shehata  chose  him.  Mido  joined  Tottenham  in  an  18-month  loan  deal  near  the  end  of  the  January  transfer  window,  scoring  twice  on  his  debut  against  Portsmouth." 

2	"Candidate  resigns  over  BNP  link  |||    A  prospective  candidate  for  the  UK  Independence  Party  (UKIP)  has  resigned  after  admitting  a  ""brief  attachment""  to  the  British  National  Party(BNP).  |||    Nicholas  Betts-Green,  who  had  been  selected  to  fight  the  Suffolk  Coastal  seat,  quit  after  reports  in  a  newspaper  that  he  attended  a  BNP  meeting.  The  former  teacher  confirmed  he  had  attended  the  meeting  but  said  that  was  the  only  contact  he  had  with  the  group.  Mr  Betts-Green  resigned  after  being  questioned  by  the  party's  leadership.  A  UKIP  spokesman  said  Mr  Betts-Green's  resignation  followed  disclosures  in  the  East  Anglian  Daily  Times  last  month  about  his  attendance  at  a  BNP  meeting.  ""He  did  once  attend  a  BNP  meeting.  He  did  not  like  what  he  saw  and  heard  and  will  take  no  further  part  of  it,""  the  spokesman  added.  A  meeting  of  Suffolk  Coastal  UKIP  members  is  due  to  be  held  next  week  to  discuss  a  replacement.  Mr  Betts-Green,  of  Woodbridge,  Suffolk,  has  also  resigned  as  UKIP's  branch  chairman." 

1	"US  box  office  set  for  record  high  |||    Ticket  sales  at  the  US  box  office  are  predicted  to  break  records  this  year,  with  figures  expected  to  reach  $9.4  billion,  beating  2002's  all-time  high.  |||    Overall  figures  could  be  dampened  by  the  lack  of  a  Christmas  hit  like  last  year's  Oscar-winning  Lord  of  the  Rings.  Traditionally,  ticket  sales  during  the  festive  season  account  for  20%  of  the  annual  total.  Although  admissions  have  actually  fallen  this  year,  the  predicted  high  is  down  to  increasing  ticket  prices.  According  to  Exhibitor  Relations  President  Paul  Dergarabedian,  the  average  cost  of  a  cinema  ticket  could  be  as  high  as  $6.25  in  2004,  compared  to  $5.80  in  2002.  This  year  some  of  the  biggest  hits  such  as  The  Passion  of  the  Christ  and  Fahrenheit  9/11  came  from  outside  the  major  studios  which  are  usually  responsible  for  the  key  blockbusters.  |||    ""Many  of  the  films  that  did  well  (with  audiences)  are  not  necessarily  the  films  that  made  a  lot  of  money,""  said  Mr  Dergarabedian.  He  added  that  surprise  hits  had  come  from  some  of  the  more  art-house  offerings  such  as  Napoleon  Dynamite  and  critical  hit  Sideways.  Sony  Pictures,  responsible  for  hits  like  Spiderman  2  and  The  Grudge,  are  expected  to  top  domestic  market  share  for  the  second  time  in  three  years,  with  $1  billion-plus  in  sales  for  the  third  consecutive  year.  Sony  Pictures  Entertainment  vice  chairman.  Jeff  Blake  said:  ""We  had  a  really  diverse  slate  this  year,  and...  certainly  we  pulled  off  one  of  the  surprises  with  Grudge.""  Horror  movie  The  Grudge  cost  Sony  $10  million  to  make  but  brought  in  $110  million.  It's  the  latest  in  a  recent  trend  for  Hollywood  studios  to  back  the  upper  and  lower  ends  of  the  market,  whilst  ignoring  the  middle.  Warner  Inc  are  likely  to  end  the  year  in  second  place  on  market  share  with  around  $1.25  billion,  with  Disney  at  number  three." 

1	"Original  Exorcist  to  be  screened  |||    The  original  version  of  horror  prequel  Exorcist:  The  Beginning,  dropped  by  producers  over  claims  it  was  not  scary  enough,  is  to  have  its  world  premiere.  |||    The  film,  directed  by  Paul  Schrader,  will  be  screened  on  18  March  at  the  International  Festival  of  Fantastic  Film  in  Brussels.  The  psychological  drama  stars  Stellan  Skarsgard  and  foreruns  the  1973  film.  Schrader  was  replaced  by  director  Renny  Harlin  who  made  a  new  version  of  the  film  which  debuted  in  2004.  The  prequel  project  was  originally  announced  in  2001,  with  actor  Liam  Neeson  in  the  lead  role  and  John  Frankenheimer  as  director.  However  Frankenheimer  pulled  out  in  2002,  a  month  before  he  died.  |||    Skarsgard  then  replaced  Neeson  in  the  role  of  Father  Merrin,  made  famous  by  Max  Von  Sydow  in  the  1973  film.  Principal  footage  was  shot  in  Morocco  and  Rome  at  a  reported  cost  of  $32m.  However,  in  August  2003  it  emerged  that  producers  Morgan  Creek  were  shelving  Schrader's  version  of  the  film,  having  complained  it  was  not  scary  enough.  As  well  as  replacing  Schrader  with  Harlin  -  the  director  behind  Die  Hard  2  and  Cliffhanger  -  the  producers  also  changed  most  of  the  cast,  but  Swedish  star  Skarsgard  stayed  in  the  Merrin  role.  Harlin's  film,  released  in  the  UK  in  October  2004,  received  lukewarm  reviews  but  went  on  to  make  over  $76m  (£40.7m)  worldwide.  The  festival  screening  will  be  the  first  time  that  Schrader's  film  has  been  seen  in  public.  Reports  that  it  will  be  released  either  in  cinemas  or  on  DVD  have  yet  to  be  confirmed.  Other  films  at  the  festival  in  the  Belgium  capital,  which  runs  from  11-26  March,  include  the  US  horror  hit  Boogeyman  and  the  forthcoming  sequel  Ring  2,  as  well  as  a  selection  of  films  adapted  from  the  works  of  Jules  Verne."

Increased  take-up  of  broadband  telecoms  services  also  boosted  France  Telecom's  profits,  which  showed  a  5.5%  rise  to  18.3bn  euros  ($23.4bn;  £12.5bn).  France  Telecom  is  to  spend  578m  euros  on  buying  out  minority  shareholders  in  data  services  provider  Equant.  |||    France  Telecom,  one  of  the  world's  largest  telecoms  and  internet  service  providers,  saw  its  full-year  sales  rise  2.2%  to  47.2bn  euros  in  2004.  |||    Orange  enjoyed  strong  growth  outside  France  and  the  United  Kingdom  -  its  core  markets  -  swelling  its  subscriber  base  to  5.4  million.  France  Telecom's  broadband  customers  also  increased,  rising  to  5.1  million  across  Europe  by  the  end  of  the  year.  The  firm  said  it  had  met  its  main  strategic  objectives  of  growing  its  individual  businesses  and  further  reducing  its  large  debt.  An  ill-fated  expansion  drive  in  the  late  1990s  saw  France  Telecom's  debt  soar  to  72bn  euros  by  2002.  However,  this  has  now  been  reduced  to  43.9bn  euros.  ""Our  results  for  2004  allow  us  to  improve  our  financial  structure  while  focusing  on  the  innovation  that  drives  our  strategy,""  said  chief  executive  Thierry  Breton.  |||    Looking  ahead,  the  company  forecast  like-for-like  sales  growth  of  between  3%  and  5%  over  the  next  three  years.  France  Telecom  is  consolidating  its  interest  in  Equant,  which  provides  telecoms  and  data  services  to  businesses.  Subject  to  approval  by  shareholders  of  the  two  firms,  it  will  buy  the  shares  in  Equant  it  does  not  already  own.  France  Telecom  said  it  would  fund  the  deal  by  selling  an  8%  stake  in  telephone  directory  company  PagesJaunes."

A  consortium  of  creditors  and  LG  Group,  a  family  owned  conglomerate,  have  each  put  up  $480m  to  stabilise  the  firm.  LG  Card  has  seven  million  customers  and  its  collapse  would  have  sent  shockwaves  through  the  country's  economy.  |||    The  firm's  creditors  -  which  own  99%  of  LG  Card  -  have  been  trying  to  agree  a  deal  to  secure  its  future  for  several  weeks.  They  took  control  of  the  company  in  January  when  it  avoided  bankruptcy  only  through  a  $4.5bn  bail-out.  |||    They  had  threatened  to  delist  the  company,  a  move  which  would  have  triggered  massive  debt  redemptions  and  forced  the  company  into  bankruptcy,  unless  agreement  was  reached  on  its  future  funding.  ""LG  Card  will  not  need  any  more  financial  aid  after  this,""  Laah  Chong-gyu,  executive  director  of  Korea  Development  Bank  -  one  of  the  firm's  creditors  -  said.  |||    The  agreement  will  see  some  12  trillion  won  of  debt  converted  into  equity.  ""The  purpose  of  the  capital  injection  is  to  avoid  delisting  and  the  goal  will  be  met,""  David  Kim,  an  analyst  at  Sejong  Securities,  told  Reuters.  South  Korea's  consumer  credit  market  has  been  slowly  recovering  from  a  crisis  in  2002  when  a  credit  bubble  burst  and  millions  of  consumers  fell  behind  on  their  debt  repayments.  LG  Card  returned  to  profit  in  September  but  needed  further  capital  to  avoid  being  thrown  off  the  market.  South  Korea's  stock  exchange  can  delist  any  firm  if  its  debt  exceeds  its  assets  two  years  running."

May  said:  ""Suddenly  the  Queen  Phoenix  is  rising  again  from  the  ashes  and  will  take  precedence  over...  our  lives.""  Queen  have  played  with  many  different  singers  since  Mercury's  death  in  1991  but  have  reportedly  not  toured.  May  performed  with  Rodgers  at  a  concert  to  celebrate  the  50th  anniversary  of  the  Fender  Stratocaster  guitar  in  London  in  September.  |||    ""We  were  both  so  amazed  at  the  chemistry  that  was  going  on  in  [Free  hit]  All  Right  Now,  that  suddenly  it  seems  blindingly  obvious  that  there  was  'something  happening  here,'""  May  wrote  on  his  website.  They  teamed  up  again  for  a  concert  to  mark  their  induction  into  the  UK  Music  Hall  of  Fame,  and  were  joined  by  Taylor.  ""The  show  went  so  incredibly  well  from  our  point  of  view,  and  we  got  so  many  rave  reactions  from  out  there,  we  decided  almost  then  and  there  that  we  would  look  at  a  tour  together,""  May  wrote.  |||    Queen  went  to  number  one  in  2000  with  a  version  of  We  Will  Rock  You  sung  by  boy  band  5ive  and  they  have  also  played  with  Robbie  Williams,  Will  Young  and  Bob  Geldof.  Queen  bassist  John  Deacon  has  currently  retired  from  the  stage.  Rodgers  was  singer  with  early  1970s  rockers  Free,  who  had  a  global  hit  with  All  Right  Now,  before  forming  Bad  Company,  a  successful  ""supergroup""  with  members  of  King  Crimson  and  Mott  the  Hoople.  He  has  also  been  in  The  Firm  with  Led  Zeppelin's  Jimmy  Page  and  The  Law  with  The  Small  Faces  and  The  Who  drummer  Kenny  Jones."

The  trouble  is  that  the  high  status  of  car  ownership  is  matched  by  expensive  fees  at  indoor  car  parks,  making  motorists  reluctant  to  use  them.  Instead  roads  are  being  clogged  by  drivers  circling  in  search  of  a  cheaper  outdoor  option.  ""The  price  differences  between  indoor  and  outdoor  lots  are  unreasonable,""  said  Wang  Yan,  an  official  from  the  Beijing  Municipal  Commission  for  Development  and  Reform  quoted  in  the  state-run  China  Daily  newspaper.  Mr  Wang,  who  is  in  charge  of  collecting  car  parking  fees,  said  his  team  would  be  looking  at  adjusting  parking  prices  to  close  the  gap.  Indoor  parking  bays  can  cost  up  to  250%  more  than  outdoor  ones.  |||    Sports  fans  who  drive  to  matches  may  also  find  themselves  the  target  of  the  commission's  road  rage.  It  wants  them  to  use  public  transport,  and  is  considering  jacking  up  the  prices  of  car  parks  near  sports  grounds.  Mr  Wang  said  his  review  team  may  scrap  the  relatively  cheap  hourly  fee  near  such  places  and  impose  a  higher  flat  rate  during  matches.  Indoor  parking  may  be  costly,  but  it  is  not  always  secure.  Mr  Wang's  team  are  also  going  to  look  into  complaints  from  residents  about  poor  service  received  in  exchange  for  compulsory  monthly  fees  of  up  to  400  yuan  ($48;  £26).  The  Beijing  authorities  decided  two  years  ago  that  visiting  foreign  dignitaries'  motorcades  should  not  longer  get  motorcycle  outriders  as  they  blocked  the  traffic.  Unclogging  Beijing's  increasingly  impassable  streets  is  a  major  concern  for  the  Chinese  authorities,  who  are  building  dozens  of  new  roads  to  create  a  showcase  modern  city  ahead  of  the  2008  Olympic  Games." 

2	"'Best  person'  for  top  legal  job  |||    The  ""best  person  for  the  job""  should  be  appointed  lord  chancellor,  and  not  necessarily  a  lawyer  or  MP,  the  courts  minister  has  told  MPs.  |||    Under  reforms,  the  post  of  lord  chancellor  is  to  be  stripped  of  its  judicial  functions.  ""The  lord  chancellor...no  more  needs  to  be  a  lawyer  than  the  Secretary  of  Health  needs  to  be  a  doctor,""  said  courts  minister  Christopher  Leslie.  The  Constitutional  Reform  Bill  was  entering  its  second  reading  on  Monday.  Mr  Leslie  said:  ""The  prime  minister  should  be  able  to  appoint  the  best  person  for  the  job  whether  they  sit  in  the  House  of  Lords  or  the  House  of  Commons.""  Under  the  reforms,  the  Law  Lords  will  also  be  replaced  as  the  UK's  highest  legal  authority  by  a  Supreme  Court  and  judges  will  be  appointed  by  an  independent  panel  rather  than  ministers.  |||    In  December  the  Lords  rejected  a  plea  by  current  Lord  Chancellor  Lord  Falconer  that  the  holder  of  the  job  should  not  necessarily  be  a  lawyer  or  a  peer.  The  peers  voted  by  229  to  206  to  say  in  law  that  lord  chancellors  must  also  be  peers.  The  debate  was  carried  over  from  the  last  Parliamentary  session,  but  with  an  impending  general  election  time  is  crucial  for  the  government  to  get  the  Bill  passed.  Mr  Leslie  said  it  was  irrelevant  whether  the  post  was  called  Secretary  of  State  for  Constitutional  Affairs  or  Lord  Chancellor.  He  said:  ""What  matters  most  is...whether  it  is  reformed  so  that  the  post  holder  no  longer  has  those  conflicting  duties.  ""It  is  no  longer  appropriate  for  a  government  minister  to  have  such  unfettered  discretion  in  the  appointment  of  judges.""  |||    Shadow  attorney  general  Dominic  Grieve  criticised  the  government  on  its  plans  to  change  what  he  said  was  an  ""exceptional  institution,""  providing  a  ""champion  of  the  independence  of  the  judiciary"".  The  government  had  initially  proposed  to  take  this  institution  and  ""smash  it  to  pieces,""  Mr  Grieve  said.  Convention  should  be  ""nurtured  and  celebrated,""  but  the  government  distrusted  and  disliked  it  instead.  He  warned  that  unless  ministers  backed  down  over  the  lord  chancellor  remaining  a  member  of  the  House  of  Lords,  the  government  would  have  ""great  difficulty""  in  getting  the  Bill  through  Parliament.  Former  Cabinet  minister  Douglas  Hogg,  whose  father  and  grandfather  served  as  lord  chancellor,  said  the  Bill  was  ""largely  unnecessary,  bureaucratic  and  expensive"".  But  the  Tory  MP  for  Sleaford  and  North  Hykeham  admitted  the  lord  chancellor's  role  and  office  ""cannot  be  frozen  in  aspic""." 

2	"Crisis  'ahead  in  social  sciences'  |||    A  national  body  designed  to  tackle  skills  shortages  in  key  subjects  should  be  set  up,  a  committee  of  MPs  has  said.  |||    There  was  an  ""absolute  crisis""  in  the  recruitment  of  statisticians  and  other  social  science  experts,  the  Commons  science  and  technology  committee  added.  ""Major  problems""  are  expected  over  the  next  10  years  as  the  social  science  workforce  continues  to  age,  it  said.  The  committee  was  reporting  on  the  work,  strategy  and  spending  plans  of  the  Economic  Social  Research  Council.  |||    The  council  aims  to  promote  and  support  strategic  research  for  social  science  postgraduates  and  provide  social  scientists  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  country.  It  also  liaises  with  the  government  and  industry  over  their  social  science  needs.  In  its  report  on  the  council's  work  the  committee  said:  ""We  are  deeply  concerned  by  the  skills  shortages  afflicting,  in  particular,  the  qualitative  branches  of  social  sciences.  This  mirrored  previous  concerns  the  committee  had  expressed  on  shortages  in  the  fields  of  maths  and  chemistry,  it  said.  ""It  is  hard  to  see  how  significant  progress  towards  rectifying  these  shortages  can  be  made  through  the  deployment  of  Economic  and  Social  Research  Council's  limited  resources.  ""If  the  government  is  serious  about  addressing  skills  shortages  in  key  subjects  it  needs  to  find  a  more  effective  mechanism  to  achieve  this.""  A  national  ""strategic  capabilities  fund""  to  address  shortages  in  key  areas  should  be  set  up  in  response,  the  committee  added."

Yukos  says  the  sale  was  illegal  and  is  pursuing  damages  in  a  US  court.  Its  lawyers  now  accept  ABN  Amro,  BNP  Paribas,  Calyon,  JP  Morgan  Chase  Bank,  and  Dresdner  Kleinwort  Wasserstein  were  not  involved  in  the  sale  financing.  However,  Yukos  still  has  an  outstanding  complaint  against  Deutsche  Bank,  which  it  alleges  to  be  the  leader  of  a  consortium  that  was  behind  a  bid  for  Yugansk  by  state  gas  monopoly  Gazprom.  The  company  has  also  accused  Gazprom,  the  Russian  Federation  and  two  other  Russian  firms.  |||    Gazprom  had  been  expected  to  win  the  December  auction,  but  ended  up  not  bidding.  Yugansk  was  sold  to  a  little-known  shell  company,  which  in  turn  was  bought  by  Rosneft.  Yukos  claims  its  downfall  was  punishment  for  the  political  ambitions  of  its  founder  Mikhail  Khodorkovsky.  The  firm,  whose  finance  chief  is  now  based  in  the  US,  filed  for  bankruptcy  in  Houston,  Texas,  and  sought  a  court  injunction  against  the  sale.  But  Deutsche  Bank  has  suggested  Yukos  artificially  manufactured  a  legal  case  to  stop  the  sale  of  its  main  asset.  A  hearing  scheduled  for  February  16  and  17  will  rule  on  whether  the  US  court  has  jurisdiction  in  the  case." 

0	"Singapore  growth  at  8.1%  in  2004  |||    Singapore's  economy  grew  by  8.1%  in  2004,  its  best  performance  since  2000,  figures  from  the  trade  ministry  show.  |||    The  advance,  the  second-fastest  in  Asia  after  China,  was  led  by  growth  of  13.1%  in  the  key  manufacturing  sector.  However,  a  slower-than-expected  fourth  quarter  points  to  more  modest  growth  for  the  trade-driven  economy  in  2005  as  global  technology  demand  falls  back.  Slowdowns  in  the  US  and  China  could  hit  electronics  exports,  while  the  tsunami  disaster  may  effect  the  service  sector.  |||    Economic  growth  is  set  to  halve  in  Singapore  this  year  to  between  3%  and  5%.  In  the  fourth  quarter,  the  city  state's  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  rose  at  an  annual  rate  of  2.4%.  That  was  up  from  the  third  quarter,  when  it  fell  3.0%,  but  was  well  below  analyst  forecasts.  ""I  am  surprised  at  the  weak  fourth  quarter  number.  The  main  drag  came  from  electronics,""  said  Lian  Chia  Liang,  economist  at  JP  Morgan  Chase.  Singapore's  economy  had  contracted  over  the  summer,  weighed  down  by  soaring  oil  prices.  The  economy's  poor  performance  in  the  July  to  September  period  followed  four  consecutive  quarters  of  double-digit  growth  as  Singapore  bounced  back  strongly  from  the  effects  of  the  deadly  Sars  virus  in  2003." 

0	"Palestinian  economy  in  decline  |||    Despite  a  short-lived  increase  in  Palestinian  jobs  in  2003,  the  economy  is  performing  well  below  its  potential,  said  a  World  Bank  report.  |||    Unemployment  stood  at  25%,  compared  with  10%  before  the  uprising  against  Israeli  occupation  four  years  ago.  Young  people  are  particularly  hard  hit  with  37%  out  of  work,  compared  with  14%  four  years  ago.  But  104,000  new  jobs  were  created  last  year  during  a  brief  easing  of  violence  and  closures.  However,  during  the  first  half  of  this  year,  the  Palestinian  economy  lost  more  than  22,000  jobs.  Last  year's  growth  rate  of  6%  can  also  be  attributed  to  this  temporary  gap  in  violence,  the  report  said.  According  to  the  report,  Intifada,  Closures  and  Palestinian  Economic  Crisis:  An  Assessment,  there  is  a  close  link  between  the  number  of  closures  -  both  border  closures  and  internal  closures  between  cities  -  and  Palestinian  economic  problems.  The  closures  arranged  by  Israel  restrict  the  movement  of  Palestinian  people  and  goods,  slowing  down  trade.  |||    ""Closures  are  a  key  factor  behind  today's  economic  crisis  in  the  West  Bank,""  said  Nigel  Roberts,  World  Bank  country  director  for  the  West  Bank  and  Gaza.  Nearly  half  of  all  Palestinians  -  some  47%  -  live  below  the  poverty  line  and  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  economic  shocks.  The  report  said  even  more  would  be  on  the  poverty  line  without  an  average  of  $950m  a  year  from  international  donors,  some  of  which  goes  towards  job  creation.  It  also  called  on  the  Palestinian  Authority  to  revive  its  reform  programme  and  maintain  financial  discipline  to  create  an  investment-friendly  climate.  This  week  Colin  Powell,  US  Secretary  of  State  was  visiting  the  West  Bank  to  stress  US  support  for  a  smooth  Palestinian  election  in  January."

""Too  few  companies  are  responding  proactively  to  the  social  and  business  threats,""  said  Dr  Kate  Taylor,  head  of  the  WEF's  global  Health  Initiative.  Nearly  9,000  business  leaders  in  104  countries  were  surveyed  for  Business  and  HIV/AIDS:  Commitment  and  Action?  |||    Dr  Taylor  described  the  level  of  action  taken  by  businesses  as  revealed  by  the  report  as  ""too  little,  too  late"".  The  issue  will  be  highlighted  to  business  and  world  leaders  at  the  World  Economic  Forum,  which  meets  in  Davos,  Switzerland,  next  week.  The  WEF  report  shows  that  despite  the  fact  that  14,000  people  contract  HIV/Aids  every  day,  concern  among  businesses  has  dropped  by  23%  in  the  last  12  months.  Most  (71%)  have  no  policies  in  place  to  address  the  disease.  Nor  could  over  65%  of  the  business  leaders  surveyed  say  or  estimate  the  prevalence  of  HIV  among  their  staff.  The  UN  programme  tackling  Aids,  UNAIDS,  pointed  out  that  having  a  clear  strategy  for  dealing  with  HIV/Aids  was  a  good  investment  as  well  as  being  socially  responsible.  |||    One  company  that  does  have  a  plan  is  Anglo-American,  the  international  mining  company,  which  estimates  an  HIV  prevalence  of  24%  among  its  130,000-strong  Southern  African  workforce.  |||    Over  the  last  two  years  the  company  has  implemented  extensive  voluntary  counselling  and  testing  for  HIV  infection,  coupled  with  anti-retroviral  therapy  for  employees  progressing  to  Aids.  Over  90%  of  the  2,200  employees  who  have  accessed  and  remained  on  treatment  are  well  and  have  returned  to  normal  work.  ""Effective  action  on  HIV/Aids  is  synonymous  with  good  business  management  and  leads  to  more  profitable  and  sustainable  operations,""  said  Brian  Brink,  senior  vice-president,  health,  at  Anglo-American.  |||    ""Companies  should  encourage  all  workers  to  know  their  HIV  status,  making  it  as  routine  as  monitoring  blood  pressure  or  cholesterol,""  he  said.  ""Providing  access  to  treatment  is  a  critical  part  of  this.""  Across  sub-Saharan  Africa,  even  in  countries  with  an  HIV  prevalence  of  10-19%,  only  around  7%  of  companies  have  formal  HIV/Aids  policies  in  place,  according  to  the  report.  The  gap  is  even  wider  in  China,  Ethiopia,  India,  Nigeria  and  Russia,  the  so-called  ""next  wave""  countries,  which  are  predicted  to  experience  the  highest  numbers  of  new  HIV/Aids  cases  worldwide  by  2010.  The  report  adds  ""an  important  building  block  to  our  understanding  of  how  the  business  community  is  experiencing  the  HIV/Aids  epidemic  and  to  whether  and  how  it  is  reacting,""  said  David  Bloom,  professor  of  economics  and  demography  at  the  Harvard  School  of  Public  Health.  |||    The  WEF  report  concludes  that  businesses  need  to  understand  their  exposure  to  HIV/Aids  risks  and  come  up  with  good  local  practices  to  manage  them.  A  key  priority,  in  both  high  and  low-prevalence  settings,  said  the  WEF  is  to  establish  a  policy  based  on  non-discrimination  and  confidentiality." 

3	"Chelsea  clinch  cup  in  extra-time  |||    (after  extra-time  -  score  at  90  mins  1-1)  |||    John  Arne  Riise  volleyed  Liverpool  ahead  after  45  seconds  but  Steven  Gerrard  scored  a  79th-minute  own  goal.  Blues  boss  Jose  Mourinho  was  sent  off  for  taunting  Liverpool  fans  after  the  goal  and  he  watched  on  television  as  his  side  went  on  to  win  the  game.  Drogba  and  Kezman  scored  from  close  range  before  Antonio  Nunez's  header  made  for  a  tense  finale.  It  was  an  amazing  climax  which  gave  Mourinho  his  first  silverware  as  Chelsea  manager.  Yet  it  was  controversial  too,  after  Mourinho's  sending  off,  apparently  for  putting  his  finger  to  his  lips  to  hush  the  Liverpool  fans.  There  was  no  hushing  them  after  the  extraordinary  opening  in  which  the  Reds  took  a  stunning  lead  inside  the  first  minute.  |||    Riise  could  not  have  connected  any  better  with  Morientes'  cross  as  he  smashed  a  left-foot  volley  past  Petr  Cech.  The  goal,  the  quickest-ever  in  a  League  Cup  final,  stunned  a  Blues  side  whose  previously  rock-solid  confidence  had  been  shaken  by  consecutive  losses  to  Newcastle  and  Barcelona  in  the  previous  week.  The  Blues'  attacking  chances  were  limited,  and  Jerzy  Dudek  was  equal  to  Frank  Lampard's  powerfully-struck  drive  and  Drogba's  low  shot.  Despite  their  frustration,  Chelsea  began  to  dominate  midfield  without  seriously  threatening  to  break  Liverpool's  well-organised  defence.  |||    Joe  Cole  had  a  shot  blocked  and  a  promising  Damien  Duff  break  was  halted  by  a  good  tackle  from  Djimi  Traore,  but  the  Reds  reached  half-time  without  any  major  scares.  The  Blues  began  the  second  half  with  more  urgency  and  pegged  Liverpool  back.  Nevertheless,  Liverpool  were  living  dangerously  and  they  needed  a  fantastic  double  save  from  Dudek  on  54  minutes,  first  at  full  stretch  from  Gudjohnsen's  header,  then  to  smother  William  Gallas'  follow-up.  And  despite  Chelsea's  possession,  it  was  Liverpool  who  fashioned  the  next  clear  opportunity  as  Luis  Garcia  fed  Dietmar  Hamann  whose  shot  forced  a  superb  save  from  Cech.  And  the  Blues'  increasingly  adventurous  approach  saw  Liverpool  earn  another  chance  on  the  break  on  75  minutes  as  Paulo  Ferreira  denied  Gerrard  with  a  last-ditch  tackle.  But  Gerrard  was  on  the  scoresheet  minutes  later  -  in  the  most  unfortunate  fashion  -  as  he  inadvertently  deflected  Ferrerira's  free-kick  past  his  own  keeper  and  in  off  the  post  to  bring  Chelsea  level.  That  prompted  Mourinho's  reaction  which  saw  him  sent  off,  but  Chelsea  still  pressed  and  Duff  had  a  chance  to  win  the  game  with  seven  minutes  remaining.  Dudek  saved  bravely  at  the  Irishman's  feet,  while  Milan  Baros  shot  wildly  at  the  other  end  to  ensure  extra  time.  Drogba  almost  headed  Chelsea  in  front  two  minutes  into  extra-time  but  the  striker  saw  the  ball  rebound  off  the  post.  But  seconds  after  the  half-time  interval,  Drogba  made  no  mistake,  picking  the  ball  up  from  Glen  Johnson's  long  throw  inside  the  six-yard  box  and  sidefooting  home.  And  Kezman  appeared  to  have  made  the  game  safe  as  he  netted  from  close  range  after  Gudjohnsen's  cross  in  the  110th  minute.  There  was  still  drama  as  Nunez  beat  Cech  to  a  high  ball  with  six  minutes  remaining  to  head  his  side  level,  but  despite  Liverpool's  desperate  attacks,  Chelsea  clung  on  to  win.  |||    Dudek,  Finnan,  Carragher,  Hyypia,  Traore  (Biscan  67),  Luis  Garcia,  Gerrard,  Hamann,  Riise,  Kewell  (Nunez  56),  Morientes  (Baros  74).  |||    Subs  Not  Used:  Pellegrino,  Carson.  |||    Hyypia,  Traore,  Hamann,  Carragher.  |||    Riise  1,  Nunez  113.  |||    Cech,  Paulo  Ferreira,  Ricardo  Carvalho,  Terry,  Gallas  (Kezman  74),  Jarosik  (Gudjohnsen  45),  Lampard,  Makelele,  Cole  (Johnson  81),  Drogba,  Duff.  |||    Subs  Not  Used:  Pidgeley,  Tiago.  |||    Lampard,  Kezman,  Drogba,  Duff.  |||    Gerrard  79  og,  Drogba  107,  Kezman  112.  |||    78,000  |||    S  Bennett  (Kent)."

The  four  companies  named  in  the  law  suit  are  gas  giant  Gazprom,  its  unit  Gazpromneft,  investment  company  Baikal,  and  state  oil  firm  Rosneft.  Yukos  submitted  the  suit  in  Houston,  where  it  filed  for  bankruptcy.  As  well  as  suing  for  damages,  Yukos  has  asked  the  US  court  to  send  its  tax  dispute  with  the  Russian  government  to  an  international  arbitrator.  It  also  has  submitted  a  reorganisation  plan  as  part  of  its  Chapter  11  bankruptcy  filing.  |||    The  clash  between  Yukos  and  the  Kremlin  came  to  a  head  last  year  when  Yukos  was  hit  with  a  bill  of  more  than  $27bn  in  back  taxes  and  unpaid  fines.  To  settle  the  bill,  Russia  forced  Yukos  to  sell  off  Yuganskneftegas.  |||    Yukos  called  the  sale  illegal  and  has  turned  to  courts  in  the  US  in  an  effort  to  regain  control  of  the  oil  production  business.  It  also  has  vowed  to  use  all  legal  means  at  its  disposal  to  go  after  any  firm  that  tries  to  buy  or  take  control  of  its  assets.  Earlier  this  month  it  sued  the  Russian  government  for  $28.3bn.  Analysts  have  questioned  whether  a  US  court  has  any  jurisdiction  over  Russian  companies,  while  Moscow  officials  have  dismissed  Yukos'  legal  wrangling  as  meaningless.  In  Houston,  bankruptcy  Judge  Letitia  Clark  will  start  a  two-day  hearing  on  16  February  to  hear  arguments  on  whether  a  US  court  is  the  proper  forum  for  the  case.  |||    The  threat  of  legal  action  from  Yukos  and  its  bankruptcy  filing  in  Houston  did  have  an  effect  on  last  year's  auction,  however.  Concerned  that  it  would  be  caught  up  in  a  court  battle,  Gazprom  and  Gazpromneft  withdrew  from  the  auction,  and  Yuganskneftegas  was  sold  to  little-known  investment  firm  Baikal  Finance  Group.  A  few  days  later,  Baikal  gave  control  of  the  company  to  state-run  oil  group  Rosneft  for  $9.3bn.  Rosneft,  meanwhile,  has  agreed  to  merge  with  Gazprom,  bringing  a  large  chunk  of  Russia's  very  profitable  oil  business  back  under  state  control.  Yukos  claims  that  the  rights  of  its  shareholders  have  been  ignored  and  that  is  has  been  punished  for  the  political  ambitions  of  its  founder  Mikhail  Khodorkovsky.  Mr  Khodorkovsky,  once  Russia's  richest  man,  is  in  prison,  having  been  charged  with  fraud  and  tax  evasion  and  repeatedly  denied  bail." 

2	"Will  Tory  tax  cuts  lift  spirits?  |||    Michael  Howard  has  finally  revealed  the  full  scale  of  his  planned  Tory  tax  cuts.  |||    Should  he  win  the  next  general  election,  he  has  earmarked  £4  billion  that  will  be  used  to  reduce  taxes  -  although  he  still  will  not  say  which  or  how.  This  was  the  pre-election  message  many  in  his  party  have  been  pressing  for  and  voters,  he  believes,  will  warm  to.  At  its  simplest,  it  is  saying:  ""Vote  Tory  and  you  can  have  it  both  ways"".  Not  only  would  his  government  stick  to  Labour  spending  plans  on  core  public  services,  including  health  and  education,  it  would  increase  spending  on  defence,  police  and  pensions.  And  even  after  that  was  done,  it  would  still  have  enough  left  over  for  a  tax  cut  equivalent  to  about  a  penny  off  the  basic  rate  of  income  tax.  |||    All  the  money  would  come  from  its  £35  billion  efficiency  savings  which  would  see  the  axe  taken  to  bureaucracy,  waste  and  the  civil  service.  Of  that,  £23  billion  would  go  on  spending  plans,  with  £8  billion  to  fill  the  black  hole  left,  they  claim,  by  Gordon  Brown,  and  the  rest  going  in  tax  cuts.  |||    Neither  Mr  Howard  nor  Mr  Letwin  would  say  exactly  how  they  would  use  that  cash,  although  a  cut  in  the  basic  rate  seems  unlikely.  Ideas  already  floated  include  raising  tax  thresholds  and  abolishing  or  reducing  inheritance  tax,  although  some  in  the  Tory  party  are  urging  Mr  Howard  to  announce  something  more  eye-catching  before  the  election.  As  the  Tory  leader  declared,  the  aim  of  the  exercise  is  to  open  up  a  real  economic  policy  divide  between  Labour  and  the  Tories.  ""At  this  election,  people  will  have  a  clear  choice  between  Mr  Blair  who  will  waste  more  and  tax  more  and  the  Conservative  party  which  will  give  value  for  money  and  tax  less,""  he  said.  |||    It  is  a  move  back  towards  an  almost  traditional  Tory  message  which  previously  suggested  Labour  was  the  party  of  tax  rises  and  the  Conservatives  the  party  of  tax  cuts.  |||    The  extension  of  that,  however,  was  that  Labour  was  also  seen  as  the  party  of  big  spending  on  the  public  services  while  the  Tories  were  the  cutters.  And  that  is  where  one  of  the  problems  lies  for  Mr  Howard  -  can  he  persuade  sceptical  voters  that  they  really  can  have  it  both  ways  with  bigger  spending  on  public  services  AND  lower  taxes?  He  insists  he  will  not  promise  anything  before  the  election  that  he  cannot  deliver  if  put  into  Downing  Street.  Labour,  needless  to  say,  claim  his  planned  £35bn  efficiency  savings  simply  don't  add  up  and  that  those  sorts  of  figures  are  fantasy.  |||    One  of  New  Labour's  greatest  successes  before  the  historic  1997  election  was  to  persuade  voters,  business  and  the  City  that  it  could  be  trusted  to  run  the  economy.  So  far  that  has  not  faced  any  real  challenge,  but  independent  analysts  now  claim  a  third  New  Labour  government  would  be  forced  to  either  increase  taxation  or  taxes  to  plug  a  black  hole  it  has  at  the  centre  of  its  finances.  Meanwhile,  the  Liberal  Democrats  are  committed  to  increasing  taxes  for  the  most  well  off  to  finance  their  spending  proposals  launched  earlier  in  the  day.  So,  Mr  Howard  hopes  his  message  will  start  to  hit  home  during  this  unofficial  election  campaign  and  that  his  poll  ratings  might  finally  lift  off  the  floor.  And,  while  other  issues  like  the  Iraq  war  and  trust  will  play  a  major  part  in  that  campaign,  it  is  likely  -  and  the  prime  minister  probably  hopes  -  that  the  economy  will  be  the  deciding  factor." 

0	"Aviation  firms  eye  booming  India  |||    India's  defence  minister  has  opened  the  country's  Aero  India  2005  air  show  with  an  invitation  for  global  aerospace  firms  to  outsource  jobs  to  the  nation.  |||    Pranab  Mukherjee  said  such  companies  could  take  advantage  of  India's  highly  skilled  workers  and  low  wages.  More  than  240  civil  and  military  aerospace  firms  from  31  countries  are  attending  the  show.  Analysts  said  India  could  spend  up  to  $35bn  (£18.8bn)  in  the  aviation  market  over  the  next  20  years.  Giants  such  Boeing  and  Airbus  -  on  the  civil  aviation  front  -  as  well  as  Lockheed  Martin  and  France's  Snecma  -  on  the  military  side  -  are  some  of  the  firms  attending  the  show.  ""There  is  tremendous  scope  for  outsourcing  from  India  in  areas  where  the  companies  are  competitive,""  said  Mr  Mukerjee.  ""We  are  keen  to  welcome  international  collaborations  that  are  in  conformity  with  our  national  goals.""  |||    Lockheed  said  it  had  signed  an  agreement  with  state-owned  Hindustan  Aeronautics  (HAL)  to  share  information  on  the  P-3  Orion  maritime  surveillance  aircraft.  |||    In  fact,  the  Indian  Armed  Force  is  considering  the  buying  of  used  P-3  Orion  as  well  as  F-16  fighter  jets  from  Lockheed.  The  US  military  industry  has  show  a  strong  interest  to  open  a  link  with  India,  now  that  relations  between  the  two  countries  have  improved  a  lot.  In  fact,  it  is  the  first  time  the  US  Air  Force  will  attend  the  air  show  since  sanctions  imposed  in  1998  after  India's  nuclear  tests  were  lifted.  But  the  Indian  Air  Force  is  also  considering  proposals  from  other  foreign  firms  such  as  France's  Dassault  Aviation,  Sweden's  Saab  and  Russia's  Mikoyan-Gurevich.  Meanwhile,  France's  Snecma  has  also  said  it  plans  a  joint  venture  with  HAL  to  make  engine  parts,  with  an  initial  investment  of  $6.5m.  |||    On  the  civilian  front,  Boeing  announced  a  deal  with  India's  HCL  Technologies  to  develop  a  platform  for  the  flight  test  system  of  its  787  Dreamliner  aircraft.  The  US  company  also  said  it  had  agreed  with  a  new  Indian  budget  airline  the  sale  of  10  737-800  planes  for  $630m.  The  airline,  SpiceJet,  will  also  have  the  option  to  acquire  10  more  aircraft.  Airbus  has  also  recently  signed  fresh  deals  with  two  Indian  airlines  -  Air  Deccan  and  Kingfisher.  In  addition,  the  European  company  has  plans  to  open  a  training  centre  in  India.  Meanwhile,  flag  carrier  Air  India  is  considering  to  buy  50  new  aircraft  from  either  Boeing  or  Airbus.  ""No  other  market  is  going  to  see  the  growth  that  will  be  seen  here  in  the  coming  years,""  said  Dinesh  Keskar,  senior  vice  president  Boeing." 

2	"Student  'inequality'  exposed  |||    Teenagers  from  well-off  backgrounds  are  six  times  more  likely  to  go  to  university  than  those  from  the  most  deprived  areas,  a  report  says.  |||    The  Higher  Education  Funding  Council  for  England  said  more  people  went  to  university  between  1994  and  2000.  But  the  percentage  of  poorer  students  ""hardly  changed  at  all"",  said  its  chief  executive,  Sir  Howard  Newby.  Increasingly  more  women  than  men  went  to  university,  while  tuition  fees  and  student  loans  made  no  major  difference.  |||    The  Hefce  report,  drawing  on  child  benefits  data,  said  teenagers  in  the  richest  areas  could  expect  a  better  than  50%  chance  of  going  to  university,  while  in  the  poorest  neighbourhoods  it  was  10%.  Participation  at  constituency  level  ranged  from  69%  in  Kensington  and  Chelsea,  65%  in  the  City  of  London  and  Westminster  and  62%  in  Sheffield  Hallam,  down  to  10%  in  Bristol  South  and  Leeds  Central  and  8%  in  Nottingham  North  and  Sheffield  Brightside.  |||    Sir  Howard  said  the  report  highlighted  the  ""entrenched  divisions""  between  rich  and  poor  areas,  but  added  it  was  a  social  as  much  as  an  educational  problem.  He  told  BBC  News:  ""We  know,  once  children  from  deprived  backgrounds  get  into  university,  they  do  very  well.  In  fact  surprisingly  more  go  into  postgraduate  study  than  those  from  more  affluent  backgrounds.  ""The  issue  is,  I  think,  one  of  raising  aspirations  amongst  those  families  and  those  communities  that  university  is  something  for  them  and  not  for  other  people.""  |||    He  said  by  the  time  universities  traditionally  dealt  with  pupils,  between  the  ages  of  16  and  18,  it  was  too  late.  Instead  they  should  be  reaching  out  to  communities  and  schools  much  earlier,  even  down  to  primary  school  level,  to  persuade  them  a  university  education  was  something  they  could  aspire  to,  he  said.  But  while  the  report  revealed  stark  inequalities  and  exposed  the  extent  of  the  challenge,  there  were  some  encouraging  findings,  he  added.  |||    Tuition  fees  and  student  loans  in  England  and  Wales  -  and  the  different  fee  regime  in  Scotland  -  did  not  seem  to  have  affected  the  choices  of  young  people,  even  the  poorest.  The  report  also  showed  women  were  18%  more  likely  than  men  to  enter  higher  education  in  2000  -  up  from  6%  in  1994.  In  the  poorest  areas,  the  gap  was  30%  in  women's  favour  and  growing  faster  than  anywhere  else.  The  Higher  Education  Minister,  Kim  Howells,  said:  ""We  are  working  in  schools  to  raise  the  attainment  and  aspiration  of  young  people  in  disadvantaged  areas.""  Higher  standards  in  schools  would  lead  to  greater  participation  in  higher  education.  From  2006  upfront  tuition  fees  in  England  would  be  removed,  with  grants  for  the  less  well  off.  The  shadow  education  secretary,  Tim  Collins,  said:  ""It  is  clear  from  this  report  that  children  from  disadvantaged  areas  are  far  more  likely  to  have  encountered  poor  standards  in  their  secondary  education.  ""Tackling  these  must  be  the  top  priority  for  any  government  looking  to  improve  university  access.""  The  group  which  represents  university  vice-chancellors,  Universities  UK,  said  the  new  system  of  deferred  fees  in  England,  due  to  start  in  2006,  with  grants  and  bursaries  for  poorer  students,  would  encourage  more  of  them  to  go  into  higher  education.  The  National  Union  of  Students  argued  the  opposite  -  that  the  situation  was  ""likely  to  get  much  worse,  with  poorer  students  being  restricted  in  choice  and  having  to  make  decisions  based  on  their  financial  situation  rather  than  aspiration"".  |||    The  tables  below  show  the  participation  rate  for  each  Parliamentary  constituency  in  Britain:" 

0	"GM  in  crunch  talks  on  Fiat  future  |||    Fiat  will  meet  car  giant  General  Motors  (GM)  on  Tuesday  in  an  attempt  to  reach  agreement  over  the  future  of  the  Italian  firm's  loss-making  auto  group.  |||    Fiat  claims  that  GM  is  legally  obliged  to  buy  the  90%  of  the  car  unit  it  does  not  already  own;  GM  says  the  contract,  signed  in  2000,  is  no  longer  valid.  Press  reports  have  speculated  that  Fiat  may  be  willing  to  accept  a  cash  payment  in  return  for  dropping  its  claim.  Both  companies  want  to  cut  costs  as  the  car  industry  adjusts  to  waning  demand.  |||    The  meeting  between  Fiat  boss  Sergio  Marchionne  and  GM's  Rick  Wagoner  is  due  to  take  place  at  1330  GMT  in  Zurich,  according  to  the  Reuters  news  agency.  |||    Mr  Marchionne  is  confident  of  his  firm's  legal  position,  saying  in  an  interview  with  the  Financial  Times  that  GM's  argument  ""has  no  legs"".  The  agreement  in  question  dates  back  to  GM's  decision  to  buy  20%  of  Fiat's  auto  division  in  2000.  At  the  time,  it  gave  the  Italian  firm  the  right,  via  a  'put  option',  to  sell  the  remaining  stake  to  GM.  In  recent  weeks,  Fiat  has  reiterated  its  claims  that  this  'put'  is  still  valid  and  legally  binding.  However,  GM  argues  that  a  Fiat  share  sale  made  last  year,  which  cut  GM's  holding  to  10%,  together  with  asset  sales  made  by  Fiat  have  terminated  the  agreement.  |||    Selling  the  Fiat's  car-making  unit  may  not  prove  so  simple,  analysts  say,  especially  as  it  is  a  company  that  is  so  closely  linked  to  Italy's  industrial  heritage.  Political  and  public  pressure  may  well  push  the  two  firms  to  reach  a  compromise.  ""We  are  not  expecting  Fiat  to  exercise  its  put  of  the  auto  business  against  an  unwilling  GM  at  this  point,""  brokerage  Merrill  Lynch  said  in  a  note  to  investors,  adding  that  any  legal  battle  would  be  protracted  and  damaging  to  the  business.  ""As  far  as  we  are  aware,  the  Agnelli  family,  which  indirectly  controls  at  least  30%  of  Fiat,  has  not  given  a  firm  public  indication  that  it  wants  to  sell  the  auto  business.  ""Fiat  may  be  willing  to  cancel  the  'put'  in  exchange  for  money.""" 

2	"'Debate  needed'  on  donations  cap  |||    A  cap  on  donations  to  political  parties  should  not  be  introduced  yet,  the  elections  watchdog  has  said.  |||    Fears  that  big  donors  can  buy  political  favours  have  sparked  calls  for  a  limit.  In  a  new  report,  the  Electoral  Commission  says  it  is  worth  debating  a  £10,000  cap  for  the  future  but  now  is  not  the  right  time  to  introduce  it.  It  also  says  there  should  be  more  state  funding  for  political  parties  and  candidates  should  be  able  to  spend  more  on  election  campaigning.  |||    There  were  almost  £68m  in  reported  donations  to  political  parties  in  2001,  2002  and  2003,  with  nearly  £12m  of  them  from  individual  gifts  worth  more  than  £1m.  The  rules  have  already  been  changed  so  the  public  can  see  who  gives  how  much  to  the  parties  but  the  report  says  there  are  still  public  suspicions.  The  commission  says  capping  donations  would  mean  taxpayers  giving  parties  more  cash  -  something  which  would  first  have  to  be  acceptable  to  the  public  and  shown  to  work.  ""While  we  are  not  in  principle  opposed  to  the  introduction  of  a  donation  cap,  we  do  not  believe  that  such  a  major  departure  from  the  existing  system  now  would  be  sensible,""  says  its  report.  If  there  was  to  be  a  cap,  it  should  be  £10,000  -  a  small  enough  amount  to  make  a  difference  but  which  would  have  banned  £56m  in  donations  between  2001  and  2003.  |||    Even  without  changes  the  commission  does  urge  political  parties  to  seek  out  more  small-scale  donations  and  suggests  there  should  be  income  tax  relief  for  gifts  under  £200.  It  also  suggests  increasing  state  funding  for  parties  to  £3m  so  help  can  be  extended  to  all  parties  with  at  least  two  members  in  the  House  of  Commons,  European  Parliament,  Scottish  Parliament,  Welsh  Assembly  or  Northern  Ireland  Assembly.  And  it  suggests  new  ways  of  boosting  election  campaigning,  seen  as  a  way  of  improving  voter  turnout.  All  local  election  candidates  should  be  entitled  to  a  free  mailshot  for  campaign  leaflets,  says  the  watchdog.  And  there  should  be  a  shift  in  the  amount  of  money  allowed  to  be  spent  at  elections  from  a  national  level  to  a  local  level  to  help  politicians  engage  better  with  voters.  |||    The  report  suggests  doubling  the  money  which  can  be  spent  by  candidates,  while  cutting  national  spending  limits  from  £20m  to  £15m.  The  commission  also  says  the  spending  limits  for  general  elections  should  cover  the  four  months  before  the  poll  -  as  happens  with  other  elections.  Electoral  Commission  chairman  Sam  Younger  said:  ""There  is  no  doubt  that  political  parties  have  a  vital  role  to  play  in  maintaining  the  health  of  our  democracy  and  for  this  they  need  to  be  adequately  resourced.  ""Our  research  has  shown  that  people  want  to  be  more  informed  about  party  politics  and  that  they  want  politicians  to  be  more  visible  and  accessible.  ""The  public  are  reluctant  for  the  state  to  fund  parties  but  at  the  same  time  are  unhappy  with  large  private  donations.""  He  called  for  a  wider  public  debate  on  party  funding  to  find  the  consensus  needed  for  radical  changes  to  the  current  system."

Matt  Lucas  and  David  Walliams  also  jointly  won  best  TV  comedy  actor  over  The  Office  creator  Ricky  Gervais,  who  won  a  special  award  for  writing.  It  was  also  a  good  night  for  Ant  and  Dec  who  clinched  two  awards,  including  best  comedy  entertainment  personality.

Little  Britain  began  life  as  a  radio  series  on  Radio  4,  with  Walliams  and  Lucas  playing  a  range  of  misfit  characters  from  an  alternative  Britain.  It  was  later  commissioned  for  BBC  Three,  where  it  proved  a  huge  success,  with  the  second  series  also  shown  on  BBC  One.

Highfield  said  that  it  intends  to  take  the  Virginia-based  firm  private.  |||    ""Such  a  transformation  would  eliminate  the  public-company  transparency  into  the  company's  operating  strategy  that  is  uniquely  damaging  in  a  highly  competitive  industry  where  Circuit  City  is  going  head-to-head  with  a  tough  and  entrenched  rival,""  Highfield  said.  One  analyst  suggested  that  a  bidding  battle  may  now  begin  for  the  company.  Bill  Armstrong,  a  retail  analyst  at  CL  King  &  Associates,  said  he  expected  to  see  other  private  investment  firms  come  forward  for  Circuit  City.  The  retailer  is  debt  free  with  a  good  cash  flow,  despite  the  fact  that  it  is  said  to  be  struggling  to  keep  up  with  market  leader  Best  Buy  and  cut-price  competition  from  the  likes  of  Wal-Mart,  said  Mr  Armstrong." 

1	"Obituary:  Dame  Alicia  Markova  |||    Dame  Alicia  Markova,  who  has  died  in  Bath  aged  94,  was  the  UK's  first  prima  ballerina  of  the  modern  age,  and,  in  her  heyday,  the  greatest  in  the  western  world.  |||    She  was  born  Lilian  Alicia  Marks  in  London  in  1910.  Her  parents  were  comfortably  off  -  her  father,  a  mining  engineer,  drove  a  Rolls  Royce.  When  she  was  eight,  her  mother  took  a  decision  which  changed  her  life.  Fearing  that  she  had  flat  feet  and  weak  legs,  she  arranged  for  her  to  have  ballet  lessons.  Very  quickly  it  became  apparent  that  she  was  something  special.  She  was  spotted  by  the  Russian  artistic  impresario,  Sergei  Diaghilev,  who  wanted  her  to  dance  for  his  company,  Ballets  Russes.  She  became  ill  with  diphtheria  but  kept  in  touch,  and,  eventually,  with  a  governess  in  tow,  joined  Diaghilev  in  Monte  Carlo  when  she  was  14.  |||    From  here,  she  toured  Europe,  playing  in  all  the  top  venues.  It  was  Diaghilev  who  changed  her  name  without  even  consulting  her.  Her  life  was  one  of  great  excitement.  People  such  as  Matisse  and  Stravinsky  became  like  uncles  to  her,  the  latter  put  in  charge  of  her  musical  education.  Soon  after  Diaghilev's  death  in  1929,  Alicia  Markova  returned  to  England  and  became  Britain's  first  international  ballerina.  She  helped  launch  the  Ballet  Club  at  the  Mercury  Theatre  (later  the  Ballet  Rambert),  the  Vic  Wells  Ballet,  and  then,  with  Anton  Dolin,  the  Markova-Dolin  Ballet  of  1935-37.  She  also  began  working  with  young  choreographers  such  as  Anthony  Tudor  and  Frederick  Ashton  who  became  huge  influences  on  the  direction  of  ballet  in  the  west.  |||    Her  version  of  Giselle,  all  lightness  and  grace,  is  still  considered  to  be  among  the  finest  ever.  She  was  also  outstanding  in  The  Dying  Swan.  She  was  one  of  the  first  British  ballerinas  to  take  a  major  part  in  Les  Sylphides.  She,  above  all,  helped  popularise  ballet  both  in  Britain  and  in  America.  |||    Alicia  Markova  spent  World  War  II  in  the  United  States  where,  in  a  re-formed  Ballets  Russes,  she  played  to  huge  audiences.  She  even  appeared  in  Hollywood  movies.  In  1950,  back  in  England,  she  and  Anton  Dolin  jointly  established  the  Festival  Ballet.  She  retired  in  1963,  an  ""instant  decision""  she  said,  ""largely  because  of  a  leg  injury"".  Created  a  Dame,  she  made  a  new  career  for  herself  as  a  teacher.  She  also  travelled  the  world  directing  ballet  companies  and  putting  on  shows.  She  became  director  of  ballet  for  the  Metropolitan  Opera  Ballet  in  New  York,  and  for  some  years  was  full-time  Professor  of  Ballet  and  Performing  Arts  in  the  University  of  Cincinnati.  A  critic  once  said  of  Dame  Alicia  Markova's  dancing:  ""She  gave  the  illusion  of  moving  as  if  she  had  no  weight  to  get  off  the  ground."""

His  nomination  by  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  came  as  a  surprise,  and  led  to  gains  on  the  Tel  Aviv  stock  market.  Mr  Fischer,  who  speaks  fluent  Hebrew,  will  have  to  become  an  Israeli  citizen  to  take  the  job.  The  US  says  he  will  not  have  to  give  up  US  citizenship  to  do  so.  |||    Previous  incumbent  David  Klein,  who  often  argued  with  the  Finance  Ministry,  steps  down  on  16  January.  Mr  Fischer  will  face  a  delicate  balancing  act  -  both  in  political  and  economic  terms  -  between  Mr  Sharon  and  finance  minister  Binyamin  Netanyahu,  who  also  backed  his  nomination.  But  his  appointment  has  also  raised  hopes  that  it  could  bring  in  fresh  investment  -  and  perhaps  even  an  improvement  in  the  country's  credit  rating  Mr  Fischer  first  went  to  Israel  for  six  months  in  1973,  and  almost  emigrated  there  before  deciding  finally  to  return  to  the  US.  While  teaching  at  the  Massachussetts  Institute  of  Technology  he  spent  a  month  seconded  to  the  Bank  of  Israel  in  1979,  beginning  a  long-time  involvement  in  studying  Israel's  economy.  In  1983  Mr  Fischer  became  adviser  on  Israel's  economy  to  then-US  secretary  of  state  George  Shultz.  At  the  World  Bank  in  1985,  he  participated  in  drawing  up  an  economic  stabilisation  package  for  Israel."

RHB,  Malaysia's  third-biggest  lender,  is  already  scouting  for  a  foreign  partner  for  its  new  Islamic  banking  unit,  the  firm  told  Reuters.  The  moves  put  Malaysia  ahead  of  a  2007  deadline  to  open  up  the  sector.  The  country's  deal  to  join  the  World  Trade  Organisation  set  that  year  as  a  deadline  for  liberalisation  of  Islamic  banking.  Also  on  Tuesday,  the  central  bank  released  growth  figures  showing  Malaysia's  economy  expanded  7.1%  in  2004.  But  growth  slowed  sharply  in  the  fourth  quarter  to  5.6%,  and  the  central  bank  said  it  expected  6%  expansion  in  2005.  |||    Malaysia  changed  the  law  to  allow  Islamic  banking  in  1983.  It  has  granted  licences  to  three  Middle  Eastern  groups,  which  -  along  with  local  players  -  mean  there  are  eight  fully-operational  Islamic  banking  groups  in  the  country.  Islamic  banks  offer  services  which  permit  modern  banking  principles  while  sticking  to  Islamic  law's  ban  on  the  payment  of  interest.  Most  of  the  Malays  which  make  up  half  the  country's  population  are  Muslims."

Revenues  were  £4.3bn  while  the  firm's  operating  margins  were  14.1%,  which  it  said  could  reach  14.8%  by  2006.  During  the  year  WPP  bought  US  rival  Grey  Global,  creating  a  giant  big  enough  to  rival  sector  leader  Omnicom.  |||    Chief  Executive  Martin  Sorrell  on  Friday  told  Reuters  news  agency  that  WPP  had  submitted  a  proposal  for  United  Business  Media's  NOP  World  market  research  unit.  Analysts  say  the  unit  sell  could  sell  for  up  to  £350m.  WPP  in  recent  years  has  also  bought  firms  such  as  Ogilvy  &  Mather  and  Cordiant  Communications.  It  also  includes  the  firms  Young  &  Rubicam  and  J  Walter  Thompson.  Events  such  as  the  Olympics  helped  boost  WPP's  profits  in  2004.  The  company  said  the  US  Congressional  elections  and  the  FIFA  World  Cup  are  likely  to  present  advertising  opportunities  in  the  near  future.  The  long-term  outlook  looks  ""very  favourable""  because  of  media  and  technology  developments  and  the  strength  of  the  US  economy,  WPP  said."

Ocean's  12  fell  to  number  two  while  new  entry  Spanglish  entered  the  chart  at  number  three,  taking  $9m  (£4.6m).  A  Series  of  Unfortunate  Events  also  stars  Scottish  comedian  Billy  Connelly,  while  Carrey  takes  on  a  number  of  different  roles  in  the  surreal  film.  The  only  other  new  entry  in  the  top  10  was  re-make,  Flight  of  the  Phoenix,  at  number  eight,  starring  Dennis  Quaid.  Carrey  entertained  crowds  at  the  UK  premiere  of  Lemony  Snicket  in  London  on  Friday.  The  actor  grabbed  co-star  Meryl  Streep  and  whisked  her  around  Leicester  Square.  Based  on  the  cult  children's  books  by  author  Daniel  Handler,  the  film  follows  three  children  who  are  orphaned  when  their  parents  die  in  a  fire.  They  are  taken  in  by  their  wicked  uncle  Count  Olaf,  played  by  Carrey,  who  schemes  to  get  his  hands  on  their  fortune."

However,  the  country's  vice  president  Jose  Alencar  has  said  the  government  still  is  looking  for  a  solution.  Varig  is  struggling  under  a  huge  debt  burden  of  an  estimated  debt  of  6.5  billion  reais  ($2.3bn  or  £1.2bn).  Asked  whether  a  rescue  was  on  the  cards  following  a  meeting  of  the  country's  Congress  to  discuss  the  airline's  crisis,  Mr  Alencar  replied:  ""No,  I  don't  think  so.  We  will  see.""  |||    Earlier,  Mr  Wilson  had  said  that  president  Luiz  Inacio  Lula  da  Silva  has  decided  to  step  in  and  a  decree  of  some  kind  of  intervention  could  be  signed  this  week.  ""In  practice,  it  will  be  an  intervention,  although  this  is  not  the  technical  name  used"",  he  said.  An  intervention  means  that  the  government  would  take  administrative  control  of  the  company  and  its  finances.  For  that  to  happen  Varig's  main  shareholder,  the  non-profit  Ruben  Berta  Foundation  which  represents  the  airline's  employees,  would  have  to  be  removed,  Mr  Wilson  said.  However,  no  jobs  would  be  lost  and  the  airline  would  keep  on  flying,  he  added.  Varig,  which  operates  in  18  countries  apart  from  Brazil,  has  been  driven  to  the  brink  of  collapse  because  of  the  country's  economic  downturn.  |||    The  depreciation  of  Brazil's  currency  has  had  a  direct  impact  on  the  airline's  dollar  debt  as  well  as  some  of  its  costs.  Business  has  improved  recently  with  demand  for  air  travel  increasing  and  a  recovery  in  the  Brazilian  economy.  The  airline  could  also  win  a  sizeable  windfall  from  a  compensation  claim  against  the  government.  On  Tuesday  the  courts  awarded  Varig  2bn  reais  ($725m),  after  ruling  in  favour  of  its  compensation  claim  against  the  government  for  freezing  tariffs  from  1985  to  1992.  But  the  government  can  appeal  the  decision."

The  island  state  is  asking  for  about  $320m  from  the  International  Monetary  Fund  to  help  pay  for  relief,  he  said.  The  bank  has  5bn  rupees  ($50m;  £27m)  set  aside  to  lend  at  a  lower  interest  rate  to  those  who  lost  property.  According  to  Mr  Mendis,  half  the  IMF  support  could  come  from  a  freeze  on  debt  repayments,  which  would  free  up  resources  immediately.  The  rest  could  come  from  a  five-year  emergency  loan.  Sri  Lanka  is  hoping  for  a  wider  freeze  from  other  creditors.  |||    The  Paris  Club  of  19  creditors  meets  on  12  January  to  discuss  a  debt  moratorium  for  the  nations  hit  by  the  tsunami,  which  ravaged  south  and  east  Asia  on  26  December.  |||    Some  150,000  people  across  the  region  are  feared  to  be  dead  and  millions  have  been  left  homeless  and  destitute.  A  full  reckoning  of  the  economic  cost  to  Sri  Lanka  of  the  tsunami  will  not  be  clear  for  some  time  to  come.  But  already  it  looks  likely  that  growth  in  the  first  half  of  2005  will  slow,  Mr  Mendis  told  reporters,  although  he  would  not  say  by  how  much.  One  side-effect  of  the  disaster  has  been  that  the  value  of  the  rupee  has  risen  as  foreign  funds  have  flooded  into  the  country.  The  currency  has  strengthened  4%  since  late  December,  coming  close  to  100  rupees  to  the  US  dollar  for  the  first  time  in  more  than  six  months." 

2	"Police  urge  pub  closure  power  |||    New  powers  are  needed  to  close  disorderly  pubs,  bars  and  clubs  for  up  to  a  week  or  even  permanently,  police  chiefs  have  told  MPs.  |||    Association  of  Chief  Police  Officers  president  Chris  Fox  said  the  current  24-hour  closure  power  did  not  have  enough  impact  on  bad  landlords.  Mr  Fox's  comments  follow  the  controversy  over  plans  to  allow  pubs  to  open  around  the  clock.  He  rejected  critics'  calls  for  the  law  change  to  be  delayed.  Instead,  the  new  Licensing  Act  could  help  reduce  drunken  disorder  -  but  only  if  it  was  properly  planned,  he  argued.  |||    Acpo  made  its  call  for  stronger  closure  powers  in  a  paper  for  the  Commons  home  affairs  select  committee.  After  the  meeting,  Mr  Fox  said  being  able  to  close  premises  for  only  24  hours  did  not  necessarily  make  an  impact.  ""If  it's  12.30  on  a  Saturday  morning  and  you  close  for  24  hours  there's  not  a  lot  of  pain  for  the  premises  because  they  probably  wouldn't  open  on  Sunday  anyway.  |||    ""This  is  about  getting  through  to  the  management  that  they  can't  run  a  disorderly  house  without  facing  some  immediate  sanctions.""  Under  Acpo's  proposal,  the  closure  orders  would  be  used  only  with  the  agreement  of  the  local  licensing  authority.  The  new  licensing  laws  will  give  police  greater  powers  to  close  pubs  and  clubs  -  but  only  for  24-hour  periods.  |||    Mr  Fox  said  the  drinks  industry  was  currently  not  regulating  itself.  ""It's  making  money  at  the  cost  of  human  misery  and  the  public  purse,  and  the  strategic  planning  process  has  been  less  than  useless,""  he  said.  Mr  Fox  said  the  new  laws,  due  to  start  being  phased  in  next  month,  could  help  if  food  outlets,  public  transport  and  public  toilets  could  cope  with  late-night  drinkers.  ""Staggering  it  (closing  hours)  will  be  a  solution  if  the  infrastructure  is  there,  if  the  premises  are  properly  managed  and  people  aren't  being  served  rolling  drunk  and  underage  and  then  tossed  out  into  the  street,""  he  said.  ""We  have  the  problem  from  11pm  to  2am  in  any  event.  We  have  to  get  a  grip  on  the  underlying  causes  of  this.""  |||    Acpo  wants  pubs  and  clubs  which  cause  extra  work  for  police  and  hospitals  to  have  to  pay  towards  the  costs.  Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  is  currently  looking  at  the  idea  of  a  levy  on  the  drinks  industry  to  pay  for  the  cost  of  extra  policing.  The  licensing  changes  have  sparked  concern  among  some  MPs,  councils  and  some  senior  police  officers  who  fear  they  could  exacerbate  drinking  problems.  Culture  Secretary  Tessa  Jowell  on  Tuesday  said  it  was  not  her  job  to  bow  to  the  campaign  against  the  changes.  It  was  the  status  quo,  not  the  new  laws,  which  were  causing  current  binge  drinking  problems,  she  told  BBC  Two's  Newsnight.  Leaked  documents  have  suggested  ex-Home  Secretary  David  Blunkett  branded  new  opening  hours  as  a  ""leap  in  the  dark"".  But  Ms  Jowell  insisted  his  concerns  had  been  met.  The  police's  job  against  alcohol-related  crime  would  be  made  easier  if  all  pubs  did  not  close  at  the  same  time,  she  added." 

2	"Brown  ally  rejects  Budget  spree  |||    Chancellor  Gordon  Brown's  closest  ally  has  denied  suggestions  there  will  be  a  Budget  giveaway  on  16  March.  |||    Ed  Balls,  ex-chief  economic  adviser  to  the  Treasury,  said  there  would  be  no  spending  spree  before  polling  day.  But  Mr  Balls,  a  prospective  Labour  MP,  said  he  was  confident  the  chancellor  would  meet  his  fiscal  rules.  He  was  speaking  as  Sir  Digby  Jones,  CBI  director  general,  warned  Mr  Brown  not  to  be  tempted  to  use  any  extra  cash  on  pre-election  bribes.  |||    Mr  Balls,  who  stepped  down  from  his  Treasury  post  to  stand  as  a  Labour  candidate  in  the  election,  had  suggested  that  Mr  Brown  would  meet  his  golden  economic  rule  -  ""with  a  margin  to  spare"".  He  said  he  hoped  more  would  be  done  to  build  on  current  tax  credit  rules.  |||    He  also  stressed  rise  in  interest  rates  ahead  of  an  expected  May  election  would  not  affect  the  Labour  Party's  chances  of  winning.  Expectations  of  a  rate  rise  have  gathered  pace  after  figures  showed  house  prices  are  still  rising.  Consumer  borrowing  rose  at  a  near-record  pace  in  January.  ""If  the  MPC  (the  Bank  of  England's  Monetary  Policy  Committee)  were  to  judge  that  a  rate  rise  was  justified  before  the  election  because  of  the  strength  of  the  economy  -  and  I'm  not  predicting  that  they  will  -  I  do  not  believe  that  this  will  be  a  big  election  issue  in  Britain  for  Labour,""  he  told  a  Parliamentary  lunch.  ""This  is  a  big  change  in  our  political  culture.""  |||    During  an  interview  with  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme,  Mr  Balls  said  he  was  sure  Mr  Brown's  Budget  would  not  put  at  risk  the  stability  of  the  economy.  ""I  don't  think  we'll  see  a  pre-election  spending  spree  -  we  certainly  did  not  see  that  before  2001,""  he  said.  |||    His  assurances  came  after  Sir  Digby  Jones  said  stability  was  all  important  and  any  extra  cash  should  be  spent  on  improving  workers'  skills.  His  message  to  the  chancellor  was:  ""Please  don't  give  it  away  in  any  form  of  electioneering.""  Sir  Digby  added:  ""I  don't  think  he  will.  I  have  to  say  he  has  been  a  prudent  chancellor  right  the  way  through.  Stability  is  the  key  word  -  British  business  needs  boring  stability  more  than  anything.  ""We  would  say  to  him  'don't  increase  your  public  spending,  don't  give  it  away.  But  if  you  are  going  to  anywhere,  just  add  something  to  the  competitiveness  of  Britain,  put  it  into  skilling  our  people'.  ""That  would  be  a  good  way  to  spend  any  excess.""  |||    Mr  Balls  refused  to  say  whether  Mr  Brown  would  remain  as  chancellor  after  the  election,  amid  speculation  he  will  be  offered  the  job  of  Foreign  Secretary.  ""I  think  that  Gordon  Brown  wants  to  be  part  of  the  successful  Labour  government  which  delivers  in  the  third  term  for  the  priorities  of  the  people  and  sees  off  a  Conservative  Party  that  will  take  Britain  backwards,""  Mr  Balls  told  Today.  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  has  yet  to  name  the  date  of  the  election,  but  most  pundits  are  betting  on  5  May." 

2	"UK's  'useless'  quangos  under  fire  |||    The  UK  has  529  quangos  financed  with  billions  of  pounds  of  taxpayers'  cash  -  many  of  which  are  useless  or  duplicate  each  other's  efforts,  a  report  claims.  |||    Essential  Guide  to  British  Quangos  2005  author  Dan  Lewis  said  at  least  111  of  the  appointed  bodies  had  been  set  up  since  Labour  won  power  in  1997.  He  urged  a  limit  on  the  number  of  quangos  that  could  be  set  up  by  any  individual  government  department.  Tories  and  Lib  Dems  welcomed  the  report  and  called  for  a  ""slimming  down"".  |||    Conservative  deregulation  spokesman  John  Redwood  said:  ""The  research  endorses  our  policy  of  destroying  unwanted  and  unnecessary  quangos,  and  slimming  down  the  rest.  |||    ""A  Conservative  government  will  axe  162  quangos,  as  part  of  its  drive  for  more  efficient  and  more  accountable  government.""  Lib  Dem  spokesman  Ed  Davey  meanwhile  said  instead  of  the  ""bonfire  of  quangos""  New  Labour  had  promised,  there  had  been  an  ""explosion""  of  them.  ""For  over  two  decades,  under  both  Tory  and  Labour  governments,  these  unaccountable  agencies  have  mushroomed.  ""Liberal  Democrats  would  abolish  many,  merge  others,  and  make  any  that  remain  properly  accountable.""  Labour  representatives  were  unavailable  for  comment.  The  quango  guide  follows  last  year's  government-commissioned  Gershon  Report  which  recommended  significant  cuts  in  bureaucracy  across  the  public  sector.  |||    Mr  Lewis  wants  a  public  inquiry  into  regional  development  agencies  which  cost  £1.8bn  a  year  -  cash  he  says  which  ""appears  to  be  almost  entirely  wasted"".  As  well  as  a  departmental  limit  on  quangos  he  also  wants  a  statutory  five-year  limit  on  any  such  body  with  executive  powers.  He  also  listed  what  he  dubbed  the  nine  ""most  useless  quangos"".  They  were  the  British  Potato  Council,  the  Milk  Development  Council,  the  Energy  Savings  Trust,  Agricultural  Wages  Committees,  the  Wine  Standards  Board,  the  Westminster  Foundation  for  Democracy,  the  Football  Licensing  Authority,  Investors  in  People  UK  and  the  Economic  and  Social  Research  Council.  Mr  Lewis  branded  the  existence  of  the  60-employee  Potato  Council,  set  up  in  1997  to  research  and  promote  overseas  potato  markets,  ""surprising"".  He  said  the  £80m  spent  annually  on  the  Energy  Savings  Trust,  which  promotes  renewable  energy,  would  be  better  spent  on  eight  million  boiler  jackets  for  British  homes.  |||    And  he  argued  it  was  ""absurd""  to  charge  farmers  for  Agricultural  Wages  Committees,  which  set  working  and  wage  standards  in  the  industry,  when  many  were  prepared  to  take  advantage  of  immigrant  labour  prepared  to  work  for  £1  an  hour.  ""If  a  football  team  can  afford  to  pay  £27m  for  Wayne  Rooney,  why  should  the  taxpayer  -  not  all  of  whom  like  football  -  be  forced  to  fund  the  Football  Licensing  Authority  to  the  tune  of  over  £1.1m  a  year?""  Mr  Lewis  asked.  The  report  is  published  by  the  Efficiency  in  Government  Unit  -  a  joint  effort  by  right  of  centre  think  tanks  the  Economic  Research  Council  and  the  Centre  for  Policy  Studies.  It  says  before  a  new  public  body  is  set  up,  an  assessment  should  be  made  whether  its  proposed  role  is  already  carried  out  by  an  existing  charity  or  other  private  organisation."

Splits  were  marketed  as  a  low-risk  way  to  benefit  from  rising  share  prices.  But  when  the  stock  market  collapsed  in  2000,  the  products  left  thousands  of  investors  out  of  pocket.  An  estimated  50,000  people  took  out  split-capital  funds,  some  investing  their  life  savings  in  the  schemes.  The  paying  of  compensation  will  be  overseen  by  an  independent  company,  the  FSA  said.  |||    Further  details  of  how  investors  will  be  able  to  claim  their  share  of  the  compensation  package  will  be  announced  in  the  new  year.  ""This  should  save  investors  from  having  to  take  their  case  to  the  Financial  Ombudsman  Service,  something,  no  doubt,  that  will  be  very  welcome,""  Rob  McIvor,  FSA  spokesman,  told  BBC  News.  Agreeing  to  pay  compensation  did  not  mean  that  the  eighteen  firms  involved  were  admitting  any  guilt,  the  FSA  added.  Any  investor  accepting  the  compensation  will  have  to  waive  the  right  to  take  their  case  to  the  Financial  Ombudsman  Service.  |||    The  FSA  has  been  investigating  whether  investors  were  misled  about  the  risks  posed  by  split-capital  investment  trusts.  The  FSA's  60  strong  investigation  team  looked  into  whether  fund  managers  colluded  in  a  so-called  ""magic  circle"",  in  the  hope  of  propping  up  one  another's  share  prices.  |||    Firms  involved  were  presented  with  780  files  of  evidence  detailing  27,000  taped  conversations  and  over  70  interviews.  In  May,  the  FSA  was  widely  reported  as  having  asked  firms  to  pay  up  to  £350m  in  compensation.  Mr  McIvor  told  the  BBC  that  the  final  settlement  figure  was  smaller  because  two  unnamed  firms  had  pulled  out  of  the  compensation  negotiations.  Investors  in  these  two  firms  may  now  have  to  take  any  compensation  claim  to  the  Financial  Ombudsman  Service  or  the  courts."

The  performance  comes  on  sales  up  21%  at  8.6bn  euros.  The  firm,  formerly  Interbrew,  became  the  world's  biggest  brewer  by  volume  when  it  bought  Ambev  in  August  2004.  The  acquisition  meant  its  sales  by  volume  grew  57%  in  2004,  with  four  months  of  Ambev  sales  accounting  for  almost  all  of  the  increase.  US  beermaker  Anheuser-Busch  sells  less  beer  by  volume  than  Inbev  but  is  bigger  in  terms  of  the  value  of  its  sales.  Continuing  demand  for  Inbev's  products  in  the  South  American  markets  where  its  Brazilian  arm  is  most  popular  means  it  expects  to  keep  boosting  its  turnover.  ""It's  the  Brazil  business  that's  doing  it,""  said  ING  analyst  Gerard  Rijk  of  Inbev's  strong  performance.  Ambev  boosted  its  share  of  Brazil's  beer  market  from  62%  at  the  end  of  2003  to  more  than  68%  by  December  2004,  Inbev  reported.  In  contrast,  Inbev's  European  business  saw  volume  sales  fall  2.5%,  although  Central  and  Eastern  European  sales  rose  12%.  Overall,  net  profits  were  up  42%  to  719m  euros."

Senate  sources  say  the  missing  tapes  may  have  been  stolen  from  a  plane  by  baggage  handlers.  The  bank  gave  no  details  of  how  the  records  disappeared,  but  said  they  had  probably  not  been  misused.  Customers'  accounts  were  being  monitoring  and  account  holders  would  be  notified  if  any  ""unusual  activity""  was  detected,  bank  officials  said.  |||    Bank  of  America  said  the  tapes  went  missing  in  December  while  being  shipped  to  a  back-up  data  centre.  ""We,  with  federal  law  authorities,  have  done  a  very  robust,  thorough  investigation  on  this  and  neither  we  nor  they  would  make  the  statement  lightly  that  we  believe  those  tapes  to  be  lost,""  Alexandra  Tower,  a  spokeswoman  for  the  North  Carolina-based  bank,  told  Time  magazine.  But  although  there  was  no  evidence  of  criminal  activity,  the  bank  said,  the  Secret  Service  -  a  federal  agency  whose  brief  includes  investigations  of  serious  financial  crime  -  is  said  to  be  looking  into  the  loss.  New  York  Senator  Charles  Schumer  said  he  was  told  by  the  Senate  Rules  Committee  that  the  tapes  were  probably  stolen  from  a  commercial  plane.  ""Whether  it  is  identity  theft,  terrorism,  or  other  theft,  in  this  new  complicated  world  baggage  handlers  should  have  background  checks  and  more  care  should  be  taken  for  who  is  hired  for  these  increasingly  sensitive  positions,""  the  Democrat  senator  said.  Details  of  his  Vermont  colleague  Pat  Leahy's  credit  card  account  are  among  those  missing,  Senator  Leahy's  spokeswoman  Tracy  Schmaler  said.  About  900,000  military  and  civilian  staff  at  the  defence  department  are  among  the  1.2  million  affected,  according  to  a  Pentagon  spokesman."

Ms  Druyun  is  currently  serving  a  nine  month  sentence  for  favouring  Boeing  when  awarding  lucrative  contracts.  Boeing  lost  a  $23bn  government  contract  after  a  Pentagon  inquiry  into  the  case.  The  contract,  to  provide  refuelling  tankers  for  the  US  Air  Force,  was  cancelled  last  year.  |||    The  Pentagon  revealed  earlier  this  week  that  it  would  examine  eight  other  contracts  worth  $3bn  which  it  believes  may  have  been  tainted  by  Ms  Druyun's  role  in  the  procurement  process.  Boeing  sacked  Mr  Sears  and  Ms  Druyun  in  November  2003  after  allegations  that  they  had  violated  company  recruitment  policy.  Ms  Druyun  had  talks  with  Mr  Sears  in  October  2002  about  working  for  Boeing,  while  she  was  still  a  top  procurement  official  within  the  Pentagon.  She  subsequently  joined  the  company  in  January  2003.  Ms  Druyun  admitted  that  she  had  steered  multi-billion  dollar  contracts  to  Boeing  and  other  favoured  companies.  |||    In  documents  filed  in  a  Virginia  court  ahead  of  Mr  Sears'  sentencing,  prosecutors  blamed  Boeing's  senior  management  for  failing  to  ask  key  questions  about  the  ""legal  and  ethical  issues""  surrounding  Ms  Druyun's  appointment.  Mr  Sears  told  prosecutors  that  no  other  Boeing  officials  were  aware  that  Ms  Druyun  was  still  responsible  for  major  procurement  decisions  at  the  time  she  was  discussing  a  job  with  Boeing.  However,  analysts  believe  Boeing  may  yet  face  civil  charges  arising  from  the  scandal.  The  Pentagon  has  investigated  400  contracts,  dating  back  to  1993,  since  the  allegations  against  Ms  Druyun  came  to  light.  |||    Boeing's  corporate  ethics  have  come  under  scrutiny  on  several  occasions  in  recent  years.  Boeing  was  sued  by  Lockheed  Martin  after  its  rival  accused  it  of  industrial  espionage  during  a  1998  contract  competition.  Boeing  apologised  publicly  for  the  affair  -  although  it  claimed  it  did  not  gain  any  unfair  advantage  -  and  pledged  to  improve  its  procedures.  The  Pentagon  subsequently  revoked  $1bn  worth  of  contracts  assigned  to  Boeing  and  prohibited  the  Seattle-based  company  from  future  rocket  work."

The  move  follows  News  Corp's  decision  to  register  its  business  in  the  US.  20th  Century  Fox's  recent  film  releases  include  I  Heart  Huckabees  and  I,  Robot,  while  Fox  puts  out  hit  TV  series  24.  |||    Under  the  terms  of  the  offer,  minority  Fox  shareholders  will  receive  1.90  News  Corp  shares  in  return  for  each  Fox  share  they  hold.  Analysts  said  the  decision  to  list  News  Corp  in  the  US  -  which  will  result  in  the  firm's  shares  trading  in  New  York  rather  than  Sydney-  nullified  the  need  to  retain  a  separate  stock  market  listing  for  Fox  Entertainment  shares.  News  Corp  investors  voted  in  October  to  approve  the  transfer  of  the  company's  corporate  domicile  from  Australia  to  the  US  state  of  Delaware.  The  move  is  designed  to  help  News  Corp  attract  more  investment  from  the  largest  US  financial  institutions,  and  make  it  easier  to  raise  capital.  Fox  Entertainment  Group  generated  revenues  of  $12bn  last  year.  News  Corp  shares  fell  25  cents  to  $17.65  after  the  share  offer  was  announced  while  Fox  shares  were  up  19  cents  at  $31.22."

Prime  Minister  Ephraim  Inoni,  who  vowed  to  tackle  corruption  when  he  came  to  office  last  year,  said  those  found  guilty  would  face  tough  punishments.  The  scam  is  believed  to  have  begun  in  1994.  |||    The  prime  minister's  office  said  the  alleged  fraud  was  uncovered  during  an  investigation  into  the  payroll  at  the  ministry.  In  certain  cases,  staff  are  said  to  have  lied  about  their  rank  and  delayed  their  retirement  in  order  to  boost  their  earnings.  The  prime  minister's  office  said  auditors  had  found  ""irregularities  in  the  career  structure  of  certain  civil  servants"".  It  added  that  the  staff  in  question  ""appear  to  have  received  unearned  salaries,  boosting  the  payroll"".  |||    Fidelis  Nanga,  a  journalist  based  in  the  Cameroon  capital  Yaounde,  said  the  government  was  considering  taking  criminal  action  against  those  found  guilty  and  forcing  them  to  repay  any  money  owed.  ""The  prime  minister  has  given  instructions  for  exemplary  penalties  to  be  meted  out  against  the  accused  and  their  accomplices  if  found  guilty,""  he  told  the  BBC's  Network  Africa  programme.  |||    Mr  Inoni  launched  an  anti-corruption  drive  in  December  after  foreign  investors  criticised  a  lack  of  transparency  in  the  country's  public  finances.  In  one  initiative  designed  to  improve  efficiency,  civil  servants  who  arrived  late  for  work  were  locked  out  of  their  offices.  The  government  now  intends  to  carry  out  an  audit  of  payrolls  at  all  other  government  ministries.  In  a  report  compiled  by  anti-corruption  body  Transparency  International  in  2003,  graft  was  said  to  be  ""pervasive""  in  Cameroon."

It  features  the  singer  talking  about  both  his  career  and  his  personal  life,  from  his  days  in  Wham!  through  to  more  recent  events.  Michael  will  attend  the  festival  to  introduce  the  screening  on  16  February.  Director  Southan  Morris  and  executive  producer  Andy  Stephens  will  also  attend  the  festival.  |||    The  93  minute  film  will  see  Michael  discussing  his  early  days  in  Wham!  along  with  his  later  career,  including  his  legal  battles  with  record  label  Sony  and  his  stance  against  the  Iraq  war  and  American  politics.  It  will  also  touch  upon  his  turbulent  personal  life,  including  his  arrest  in  a  Beverly  Hills  park  toilet  in  1998  for  ""lewd  behaviour"",  and  the  death  of  his  boyfriend  Anselmo  Feleppa  from  Aids.  The  film,  which  includes  previously  unseen  footage  of  the  singer  also  features  contributions  from  Michael's  former  Wham!  partner  Andrew  Ridgeley,  as  well  as  ex-Wham!  backing  singers  Pepsi  and  Shirlie.  Other  contributors  include  Sting,  Mariah  Carey,  Elton  John,  Noel  Gallagher,  Geri  Halliwell  and  Simon  Cowell.  This  year's  festival  will  open  with  Man  To  Man,  a  historical  epic  starring  Joseph  Fiennes  and  Kristin  Scott-Thomas.  It  will  be  one  of  21  films  competing  for  the  festival's  top  prize,  the  Golden  Bear.  Other  films  in  competition  will  include  The  Life  Aquatic,  a  quirky  comedy  starring  Bill  Murray,  and  the  biopic  Kinsey,  which  features  Liam  Neeson.

2	"Tories  plan  migrant  health  checks  |||    Non-European  Union  citizens  wanting  to  work  in  the  UK  will  have  to  undergo  tests  for  Tuberculosis  and  HIV,  under  plans  unveiled  by  the  Conservatives.  |||    A  positive  test  for  TB  would  mean  visa  applications  being  turned  down,  while  HIV  would  be  dealt  with  case  by  case.  Leader  Michael  Howard  said  the  checks  on  new  arrivals  would  help  protect  public  health  and  the  NHS.  Labour  said  many  tests  were  already  done.  The  Lib  Dems  warned  both  parties  against  ""pandering  to  prejudice"".  |||    The  proposals,  which  would  be  brought  in  if  the  Conservatives  won  the  General  Election,  would  not  apply  to  people  coming  to  the  UK  for  less  than  six  months  unless  they  intended  to  work  in  health  or  childcare  or  teaching.  Mr  Howard  said  the  plans  were  based  on  policies  already  in  action  in  Canada,  New  Zealand  and  Australia.  ""It's  very  important  that  we  should  safeguard  the  good  standards  of  public  health  that  Britain  enjoys,""  he  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme.  Government  figures  suggest  TB  in  England  has  increased  by  25%  over  the  past  10  years.  ""Nearly  two  thirds  of  people  with  TB  are  born  abroad,""  said  Mr  Howard.  |||    ""I  don't  think  a  responsible  government  can  stand  aside  and  do  nothing  in  the  face  of  this  problem.""  But  Mr  Howard  said  the  plans  would  not  affect  asylum  applicants'  claims.  The  proposals  include:  |||    -  People  coming  to  the  UK  from  outside  the  EU  for  between  six  and  12  months  from  a  ""high  incidence  TB  country""  will  have  to  undergo  a  chest  X-ray.      -  People  coming  to  settle  in  the  UK  permanently  from  outside  the  EU  will  have  to  ""demonstrate  they  have  an  acceptable  standard  of  health"".      -  They  will  also  have  to  show  they  are  unlikely  to  be  a  danger  to  public  health  and  are  unlikely  to  ""impose  significant  costs  or  demands""  on  the  NHS.      -  The  tests  will  include  a  health  check,  chest  X-rays  for  TB  (except  for  children  and  pregnant  women)  and  tests  for  hepatitis  and  HIV  for  over  16-year-olds.  Only  the  discovery  of  TB  will  mean  people  will  be  automatically  denied  a  visa,  other  conditions  will  be  dealt  with  on  a  ""case  by  case  basis"".  |||    There  is  already  some  screening  in  place.  Last  year  185,000  people  were  tested  for  TB  at  Heathrow  and  Gatwick  airports,  only  about  200  were  found  to  be  infected.  And  Dr  John  Moore-Gillon,  of  the  British  Lung  Foundation,  said:  ""TB  is  not  simply  imported,  we  are  seeing  a  rise  in  many  sections  of  the  UK-born  population  as  well.""  The  government  says  the  Tories  are  ""a  bit  late""  to  the  issue.  Immigration  minister  Des  Browne  quoted  its  five-year  plan  for  immigration  and  asylum,  as  saying:  ""We  are  implementing  our  existing  powers  by  targeted  health  screening  for  TB  in  high-risk  areas  at  the  entry  clearance  stage.  ""Those  who  are  diagnosed  would  then  need  to  seek  treatment  at  home  before  being  allowed  to  enter  the  UK.""  Meanwhile  Mark  Oaten,  Liberal  Democrat  home  affairs  spokesman,  said:  ""This  is  another  worrying  step  in  the  war  of  words  over  asylum  and  immigration  between  Labour  and  the  Conservatives.  ""Michael  Howard  knows  perfectly  well  what  bigger  game  he  is  playing,  and  history  proves  it  is  a  very  dangerous  one.""  Lisa  Power,  head  of  policy  at  Aids  charity  the  Terrence  Higgins  Trust  said  the  policy  was  prejudice-based  rather  than  evidence-based.  ""In  fact,  it  would  be  more  likely  to  drive  people  with  health  conditions  to  falsify  tests  while  others  gain  entry  by  simple  dint  of  their  EU  status,""  she  said." 

2	"Labour  in  constituency  race  row  |||    Labour's  choice  of  a  white  candidate  for  one  of  the  UK's  most  multi-racial  seats  proves  the  need  for  all-black  short  lists,  says  a  race  group.  |||    Local  councillor  Lyn  Brown  was  selected  for  West  Ham,  east  London,  in  a  contest  between  two  white  and  five  ethnic  minority  women.  An  Operation  Black  Vote  spokesman  said  they  now  wanted  to  meet  Labour  party  chairman  Ian  McCartney  for  discussions.  Mr  McCartney  recently  announced  party  consultation  on  all-black  shortlists.  However,  Labour  has  so  far  unable  been  unable  to  comment  on  the  implications  of  the  West  Ham  result.  |||    Ashok  Vishwanathan  of  Operation  Black  Vote,  which  aims  to  increase  ethnic  minorities'  participation  in  the  political  process  and  their  representation,  said  the  result  again  showed  all-women  shortlists  were  not  effective  in  getting  minority  women  selected.  ""I  think  all-black  shortlists  are  the  only  way  to  cut  to  the  chase  and  address  the  lack  of  minority  candidates,""  Mr  Vishwanathan  said.  |||    Last  month  the  chairman  of  the  Commission  for  Racial  Equality  (CRE)  also  called  for  ethnic  minority  shortlists  in  certain  circumstances.  A  CRE  spokesman  said  the  organisation  had  nothing  to  add  on  the  shortlist  issue  specifically  but  would  be  working  with  all  the  political  parties  to  address  the  under-representation  of  ethnic  minorities  in  Parliament.  ""We  will  be  raising  it  with  each  of  the  party  leaders  on  a  formal  basis  and  helping  them  find  the  most  appropriate  way  forward,""  the  spokesman  said.  Ethnic  minorities  make  up  8%  of  the  United  Kingdom  population  but  only  2%  of  MPs  -  13  out  of  659  -  are  from  a  visible  minority  group.  Twelve  of  them  represent  Labour,  and  one  is  a  Liberal  Democrat.  If  ethnic  minorities  were  represented  in  the  House  of  Commons  in  proportion  to  their  numbers  in  the  population,  there  would  be  42  ethnic  minority  MPs."

For  the  whole  of  2004,  GM  earned  $3.7bn,  down  from  $3.8bn  in  2003,  while  its  annual  revenue  rose  4.5%  to  $193bn.  GM  said  its  profits  were  also  hit  by  higher  healthcare  costs  in  the  US.  ""GM  reported  solid  overall  results  in  2004,  despite  challenging  competitive  conditions  in  many  markets  around  the  globe,""  GM  chairman  and  chief  executive  Rick  Wagoner  said  in  a  statement.  The  company  recently  announced  that  it  expected  profits  in  2005  to  be  lower  than  in  2004."

But  on  Wednesday  Prime  Minister  Yulia  Tymoshenko  said  the  government  was  planning  to  renationalise  3,000  firms.  The  government  says  many  privatised  firms  were  sold  to  allies  of  the  last  administration  at  rock-bottom  prices.  More  than  90,000  businesses  in  all,  from  massive  corporations  to  tiny  shopfronts,  have  been  sold  off  since  1992,  as  the  command  economy  built  up  when  Ukraine  was  part  of  the  Soviet  Union  was  dismantled.  |||    Ms  Tymoshenko  said  prosecutors  had  drawn  up  a  list  of  more  than  3,000  businesses  which  were  to  be  reviewed.  ""We  will  return  to  the  state  that  which  was  illegally  put  into  private  hands.""  |||    A  day  earlier,  Mr  Yushchenko  -  keen  to  reassure  potential  investors  -  had  said  only  30  to  40  top  firms  would  be  targeted.  The  list  ""will  be  limited  and  final,  and  will  not  be  extended  after  its  completion"",  he  said.  An  open-ended  list  could  further  damage  outside  investors'  fragile  faith  in  Ukraine,  said  Stuart  Hensel  of  the  Economist  Intelligence  Unit.  But  the  government  seemed  keen  not  to  make  the  review  look  like  the  kind  of  wholesale  renationalisation  which  many  fear  in  Russia,  Mr  Hensel  said.  As  a  result,  it  was  planning  to  resell  rather  than  keep  firms  in  state  hands.  ""They're  aware  of  the  need  not  to  scare  investors,  and  to  be  careful  of  internal  divides  within  Ukraine,""  he  said.  ""They  don't  want  to  be  seen  to  be  transferring  assets  from  one  set  of  oligarchs  to  a  new  set.""  Foreign  investment  in  Ukraine,  at  about  $40  a  head  in  2004,  is  one  of  the  lowest  among  ex-Soviet  states.  |||    Mr  Yushchenko  became  president  after  two  elections  in  December,  the  first  of  which  was  annulled  amid  allegations  of  voting  irregularities  and  massive  street  protests.  |||    His  opponent,  Viktor  Yanukovich,  still  has  huge  support  in  the  country's  eastern  industrial  heartland.  Mr  Yushchenko's  administration  has  accused  its  predecessor,  led  by  ex-President  Leonid  Kuchma,  of  corruption.  The  privatisation  review's  number  one  target  is  a  steel  mill  sold  to  a  consortium  which  included  Viktor  Pinchuk,  Mr  Kuchma's  son-in-law,  for  $800m  (£424m)  despite  higher  bids  from  several  foreign  groups.  The  mill,  Krivorizhstal,  is  one  of  the  world's  most  profitable.  ""We  say  Krivorizhstal  was  stolen,  and  at  any  cost  we  will  return  it  to  the  state,""  Mr  Yushchenko  told  an  investors'  conference  in  Kiev.  |||    One  of  the  jilted  bidders,  Netherlands-based  group  LNM,  said  it  welcomed  the  possibility  that  the  mill  might  be  back  on  the  market.  |||    ""If  the  original  privatisation  is  annulled  and  a  new  tender  issued,  then  we  would  look  at  it  with  great  interest,""  a  spokesman  told  BBC  News.  A  resale  of  Krivorizhstal  could  potentially  triple  the  price,  according  to  the  Economist  Intelligence  Unit's  Mr  Hensel.  But  he  warned  that  the  government  could  decide  to  take  the  easy  route  of  revaluing  the  company  and  charging  the  existing  owners  the  revised  price  rather  than  undertaking  a  fresh  sale.  ""That  way,  Mr  Yushchenko  can  go  to  the  public  and  say  he  has  forced  the  oligarchs  to  play  by  the  rules,""  he  told  BBC  News."

The  government  is  cracking  down  on  so-called  latifundios,  or  large  rural  estates,  which  it  says  are  lying  idle.  The  Vestey  Group  said  it  had  not  been  informed  of  any  planned  seizure.  |||    The  firm,  whose  Agroflora  subsidiary  operates  13  farms  in  Venezuela,  insisted  that  it  had  complied  fully  with  Venezuelan  law.  Prosecutors  in  the  south  of  the  country  have  targeted  Hato  El  Charcote,  a  beef  cattle  ranch  owned  by  Agroflora.  According  to  Reuters,  they  plan  to  seize  12,900  acres  (5,200  hectares)  from  the  32,000  acre  (13,000  hectare)  farm.  |||    Officials  claim  that  Agroflora  does  not  possess  valid  documents  proving  its  ownership  of  the  land  in  question.  They  also  allege  that  areas  of  the  ranch  are  not  being  used  for  any  form  of  active  production.  ""The  legal  boundaries  did  not  match  up  with  the  actual  boundaries  and  there  is  surplus,""  state  prosecutor  Alexis  Ortiz  told  Reuters.  ""As  a  consequence  the  government  has  taken  action.""  |||    Controversial  reforms  passed  in  2001  give  the  government  the  right  to  take  control  of  private  property  if  it  is  declared  idle  or  ownership  cannot  be  traced  back  to  the  19th  Century.  |||    Critics  say  the  powers  -  which  President  Chavez  argues  are  needed  to  help  the  country's  poorest  citizens  and  develop  the  Venezuelan  economy  -  trample  all  over  private  property  rights.  The  Vestey  Group  said  it  had  owned  the  land  since  1920  and  would  co-operate  fully  with  the  authorities.  But  a  spokesman  added:  ""Agroflora  is  absolutely  confident  that  what  it  has  submitted  will  demonstrate  the  legality  of  its  title  to  the  land.""  The  company  pointed  out  that  the  farm,  which  employs  300  workers,  provides  meat  solely  for  the  Venezuelan  market.  |||    Last  month,  the  government  said  it  had  identified  more  than  500  idle  farms  and  had  yet  to  consider  the  status  of  a  further  40,000.  The  authorities  said  landowners  whose  titles  were  in  order  and  whose  farms  were  productive  had  ""nothing  to  fear"".  Under  President  Chavez,  the  Venezuelan  government  has  steadily  expanded  the  state's  involvement  in  the  country's  economy.  It  recently  said  all  mining  contracts  involving  foreign  firms  would  be  examined  to  ensure  they  provided  sufficient  economic  benefits  to  the  state." 

3	"Hodgson  relishes  European  clashes  |||    Former  Blackburn  boss  Roy  Hodgson  says  the  Premiership  should  follow  the  rest  of  Europe  and  have  a  winter  break  -  but  insists  that  a  gruelling  domestic  schedule  will  not  damage  the  English  elite's  bid  for  Champions  League  glory.  |||    Hodgson  -  now  in  charge  at  Viking  Stavanger  -  was  at  Liverpool's  clash  with  Bayer  Leverkusen  at  Anfield  on  Tuesday  as  a  member  of  Uefa's  technical  committee.  Hodgson  is  a  fierce  advocate  of  the  winter  break  employed  throughout  Europe,  although  not  in  England  -  where  the  Champions  League  contenders  have  ploughed  through  a  heavy  fixture  list.  But  Hodgson  told  BBC  Sport  that  while  he  believes  the  Premiership  should  embrace  the  idea,  he  does  not  expect  it  to  cost  the  English  representatives  in  the  last  16  of  the  Champions  League.  ""I  just  feel  it  is  very  difficult  to  say  with  certainty  that  teams  who  have  had  the  break  will  have  a  definite  edge.  ""I  am  a  fervent  supporter  of  the  break.  It  gives  players  the  chance  to  recharge  their  batteries  midway  through  the  season,  which  some  suggest  will  give  teams  an  advantage  in  the  Champions  League.  ""The  other  school  of  thought  suggests  having  a  break  then  coming  back  to  it  puts  you  at  a  disadvantage.  ""The  bigger  discussions  around  the  winter  break  should  be  to  do  with  the  nature  of  football  today,  the  needs  of  football  players  and  the  way  the  Premiership  has  developed,  rather  than  one  or  two  matches  in  the  Champions  League  in  February.""  Hodgson  believes  a  winter  break  carries  many  advantages,  explaining:  ""As  I  said,  it  is  the  perfect  chance  to  recharge  batteries.  |||    ""And  certainly  if  I  was  still  a  manager  in  England  I  would  be  supporting  any  calls  for  its  introduction.  ""In  pre-season  you  get  a  lot  of  enthusiasm  and  energy  but  by  the  time  you  get  towards  Christmas  many  players,  having  also  played  plenty  of  international  matches  for  club  and  country  and  travelled  a  lot,  find  themselves  getting  very  jaded.  ""The  break  gives  them  a  chance  to  recover  that  energy  and  enthusiasm  and,  perhaps  more  importantly,  recover  their  mental  strength  during  the  break  and  get  ready  for  the  games  ahead.  ""The  mental  side  is  by  far  the  most  important  thing.""  Hodgson  added:  ""The  length  of  breaks  can  vary.  In  Italy  the  break  was  very  short.  You  just  took  Christmas  and  New  Year.  ""It  was  so  short  you  didn't  do  anything.  You  gave  the  players  a  week  or  10  days  off,  then  you  were  training  for  a  week  or  10  days  and  then  went  into  a  game.  ""If  it  is  longer,  it  is  important  those  responsible  for  physical  fitness  give  the  players  a  programme  to  follow  to  ensure  the  physical  strength  they  have  accumulated  stays  with  them.""  And  Hodgson  believes  a  winter  break  would  be  a  positive  step  in  the  Premiership.  He  said:  ""If  we  talk  about  football  at  elite  level,  which  the  Premiership  is,  then  I  would  support  a  winter  break.  ""If  you  examine  the  demands  of  the  Premier  League  and,  in  particular  on  players  who  play  international  football  for  their  club  and  country,  then  a  break  would  do  them  the  world  of  good  -  physically  and  mentally.""" 

2	"Minimum  rate  for  foster  parents  |||    Foster  carers  are  to  be  guaranteed  a  minimum  allowance  to  help  cover  their  costs,  the  government  has  announced.  |||    Payment  levels  vary  from  area  to  area,  with  some  carers  getting  just  £50  a  week  for  clothes,  food  and  other  costs.  Minister  for  Children,  Young  People  and  Families  Margaret  Hodge  said  new  plans  will  ensure  fosterers'  allowances  would  be  as  fair  as  possible.  However  local  authorities,  which  set  and  pay  the  allowances,  are  concerned  about  how  the  extra  cash  will  be  found.  About  50,000  children  live  with  foster  families  in  the  UK  and  carers  have  said  they  need  more  money  to  make  ends  meet.  |||    Ms  Hodge  said:  ""Foster  carers  must  not  be  out  of  pocket  when  meeting  the  costs  of  caring  for  a  looked  after  child  -  a  crucial  role  in  society.  ""We  need  to  make  sure  that  arrangements  for  paying  foster  carers  are  as  fair  and  transparent  as  possible.  ""Our  proposal  for  a  national  minimum  rate  shows  we  are  serious  about  creating  a  better  deal  for  foster  carers  and  about  encouraging  more  people  to  come  forward  and  consider  fostering  as  a  worthwhile  and  rewarding  opportunity.""  The  government  is  seeking  to  amend  the  Children  Bill,  which  passes  through  the  Commons  next  week,  to  establish  a  national  minimum  payment.  |||    Fostering  Network  executive  director  Robert  Tapsfield  criticised  the  existing  system.  ""There  is  just  no  logic  to  a  system  which  values  children  differently  depending  on  where  they  live.  ""And  with  a  shortage  of  over  8,000  foster  carers  in  England,  it's  not  a  sustainable  situation  to  expect  carers  to  fund  foster  care  from  their  own  pockets.""  The  charity  recommends  a  weekly  payment  of  £108.49  for  looking  after  a  baby.  In  a  survey,  it  discovered  that  rates  paid  by  neighbouring  authorities  could  vary  by  as  much  as  £100  per  week.  |||    The  Association  of  Directors  of  Social  Services  (ADSS)  said  it  agreed  in  principle  with  the  government's  plans.  Tony  Hunter,  the  organisation's  president,  said:  ""There  are  many  devils  and  lots  of  details  hidden  within  the  Government's  proposals.  ""But  ADSS  fully  supports  proper  remuneration  for  valued  foster  carers  and  looks  forward  to  working  with  ministers,  local  government  and  the  fostering  organisations  themselves  in  order  to  make  sure  a  sensible  and  practicable  policy  emerges."""

""And  no  fans  wearing  Cantona  masks  will  be  allowed  entry  to  the  stadium.""  United  fans  had  declared  Saturday  as  'Cantona  Day'  and  had  planned  to  wear  masks,  that  were  popular  during  the  Frenchman's  time  as  a  player  at  the  Old  Trafford  club.  Cantona  received  a  nine-month  ban  following  the  incident  and  Palace  are  keen  to  avoid  an  incident  that  would  stir  up  ill  feeling  between  the  two  sets  of  supporters.

0	"UK  interest  rates  held  at  4.75%  |||    The  Bank  of  England  has  left  interest  rates  on  hold  again  at  4.75%,  in  a  widely-predicted  move.  |||    Rates  went  up  five  times  from  November  2003  -  as  the  bank  sought  to  cool  the  housing  market  and  consumer  debt  -  but  have  remained  unchanged  since  August.  Recent  data  has  indicated  a  slowdown  in  manufacturing  and  consumer  spending,  as  well  as  in  mortgage  approvals.  And  retail  sales  disappointed  over  Christmas,  with  analysts  putting  the  drop  down  to  less  consumer  confidence.  |||    Rising  interest  rates  and  the  accompanying  slowdown  in  the  housing  market  have  knocked  consumers'  optimism,  causing  a  sharp  fall  in  demand  for  expensive  goods,  according  to  a  report  earlier  this  week  from  the  British  Retail  Consortium.  The  BRC  said  Britain's  retailers  had  endured  their  worst  Christmas  in  a  decade.  |||    ""Today's  no  change  decision  is  correct,""  said  David  Frost,  Director  General  of  the  British  Chambers  of  Commerce  (BCC).  ""But,  if  there  are  clear  signs  that  the  economy  slows,  the  MPC  should  be  ready  to  take  quick  corrective  action  and  cut  rates.  ""Dismal  reports  from  the  retail  trade  about  Christmas  sales  are  worrying,  if  they  indicate  a  more  general  weakening  in  consumer  spending.""  |||    Mr  Frost  added:  ""The  housing  market  outlook  remains  highly  uncertain.  ""It  is  widely  accepted  that,  if  house  prices  start  falling  more  sharply,  the  risks  facing  the  economy  will  worsen  considerably.""  CBI  chief  economist  Ian  McCafferty  said  the  economy  had  ""slowed  in  recent  months  in  response  to  rate  rises""  but  that  it  was  difficult  to  gauge  from  the  Christmas  period  the  likely  pace  of  activity  through  the  summer.  ""The  Bank  is  having  to  juggle  the  emergence  of  inflationary  pressures,  driven  by  a  tight  labour  market  and  buoyant  commodity  prices,  against  the  risk  of  an  over-abrupt  slowdown  in  consumer  activity,""  he  said.  ""Interest  rates  are  likely  to  remain  on  hold  for  some  time.""  |||    On  Thursday  there  was  more  gloomy  news  on  the  manufacturing  front,  as  the  Office  for  National  (ONS)  statistics  revealed  British  manufacturing  output  unexpectedly  fell  in  November  -  for  the  fifth  month  in  the  past  six.  The  ONS  said  manufacturing  output  dropped  0.1%  in  November,  matching  a  similar  unrevised  fall  in  October  and  confounding  economists'  expectations  of  a  0.3%  rise.  Manufacturers'  organisation,  the  EEF,  said  it  expected  the  hold  in  interest  rates  to  continue  in  the  near  future.  It  also  said  there  was  evidence  that  manufacturers'  confidence  may  be  waning  as  the  outlook  for  the  world  economy  becomes  more  uncertain.  |||    ""So  far  the  evidence  suggests  that  last  year's  rate  increases  have  helped  to  rebalance  the  economy  without  damaging  the  recovery  in  manufacturing,""  said  EEF  chief  economist,  Steve  Radley.  ""However,  should  the  business  outlook  start  to  deteriorate,  the  Bank  should  stand  ready  to  cut  rates.""  Some  economists  have  predicted  rates  will  drop  later  in  the  year,  although  others  feel  the  Bank  may  still  think  there  is  a  need  for  a  rise  to  5%  before  that  happens.  The  Bank  remains  concerned  about  the  long-term  risks  posed  by  personal  debt  -  which  is  rising  at  15%  a  year  -  if  economic  conditions  worsen."

Eminem  performed  on  HMS  Belfast  on  Friday,  which  is  docked  on  the  River  Thames,  where  he  filmed  two  songs  for  BBC  One's  Top  of  the  Pops.  He  arrived  in  the  UK  on  Friday  following  his  appearance  at  the  MTV  Europe  Music  Awards  in  Rome.  Other  rap  acts  who  may  appear  at  the  Islington  gig  include  Stat  Quo,  Proof,  DJ  Green  Lantern,  Swift  and  Obie  Trice.  |||    Eminem's  latest  album  soared  to  the  top  of  the  US  chart  after  just  three  days  on  sale  in  record  shops.  Encore  is  now  a  chart-topper  on  both  sides  of  the  Atlantic  following  its  debut  at  number  one  in  the  UK.  The  fourth  album  from  the  rap  star  was  on  sale  for  two  days  before  it  outsold  all  of  its  rivals.  The  album  was  released  early  in  an  effort  to  combat  both  physical  and  online  piracy.  |||    Eminem's  album  includes  the  track  Mosh,  which  is  a  tirade  against  US  President  Bush  and  the  presence  of  US  troops  in  Iraq.

The  complaints  about  the  star  grabbing  his  crotch  were  upheld  by  the  BBC.  ""The  performer  had  been  asked  to  tone  his  act  down  after  rehearsal  but  ignored  this  request  during  the  live  broadcast,""  a  BBC  statement  read.

2	"Housing  plans  criticised  by  MPs  |||    ""Irreversible  environmental  damage""  will  be  caused  by  government  plans  to  build  more  than  one  million  homes  in  south-east  England,  MPs  have  warned.  |||    ""Sustainable  communities""  were  being  promoted  without  a  real  understanding  of  what  ""sustainable""  means,  the  Environmental  Audit  Committee  said.  It  said  issues  like  energy  needs  and  transport  were  not  properly  addressed.  Deputy  Prime  Minister  John  Prescott  said  the  report  was  completed  before  new  initiatives  were  announced.  He  said:  ""We  are  working  across  government,  especially  with  our  colleagues  at  Defra,  to  create  cleaner,  safer  and  greener  communities,  while  protecting  and  enhancing  the  environment.""  |||    The  report  said  there  was  far  too  little  attention  paid  to  many  environmental  issues,  including  water,  even  though  supplies  in  parts  of  the  South  East  are  already  too  low.  Regulations  designed  to  ensure  energy-efficient  buildings  are  too  lax,  and  builders  routinely  flout  them  anyway,  it  said.  |||    Financing  for  improving  transport  was  around  one-twentieth  of  what  would  be  required.  The  report  was  a  stinging  rebuke  for  the  government  and  especially  John  Prescott's  department,  BBC  environment  correspondent  Richard  Black  said.  Chairman  of  the  Environmental  Audit  Committee  Peter  Ainsworth  MP,  said:  ""The  government's  housing  policy  is  an  alarming  example  of  disjointed  thinking  in  an  areas  where  joined-up  policy  is  crucial.  ""I  accept  the  need  to  improve  housing  supply  but,  as  things  stand,  the  principal  beneficiary  of  housing  growth  will  be  property  developers,  with  the  environment  we  all  depend  on  being  the  principal  loser.""  Points  raised  in  the  report  included:  |||        -  No  proposals  to  further  increase  housing  supply  should  be  taken  forward  without  strong  supporting  evidence.      -  The  government  should  recognise  shortcomings  of  the  Treasury's  Barker  Review,  which  said  140,000  new  homes  a  year  were  needed  in  Britain.      -  The  government  should  consider  a  ""national  spatial  framework""  for  England  such  as  those  already  in  place  in  Scotland  and  Wales.      -  The  Office  of  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  should  maximise  brown  field  development  and  housing  densities.      -  Measures  to  encourage  improved  energy  efficiency  for  existing  homes  should  be  considered  -  including  reduced  stamp  duty  for  homes  that  achieve  set  standards  and  a  clear  timetable  for  achieving  zero-emissions  homes.      -  The  government  should  make  clear  how  it  intends  to  measure  its  success  at  creating  sustainable  communities.        |||    Conservative  local  government  spokeswoman  Caroline  Spelman  said:  ""There  is  now  growing  evidence  that  John  Prescott's  buildings  programme  is  environmentally  unsustainable,  leaving  a  concrete  scar  across  the  face  of  rural  England."""

The  plan  was  to  ensure  offenders  were  monitored  by  the  same  body  during  and  after  prison,  preventing  many  from  being  lost  in  the  system  and  helping  more  of  them  to  stop  reoffending.  |||    Scotland's  reoffending  rate  is  high,  with  more  than  60%  of  prisoners  reconvicted  within  two  years  of  release  from  jail.  This  is  leading  to  an  ever-expanding  prison  population  and  the  executive  wants  to  tackle  the  problem.  Ministers  thought  merging  the  prison  service  with  the  council-controlled  criminal  justice  social  work  departments,  which  provide  community  sentences,  might  have  provided  an  answer.  However,  following  a  consultation  on  the  idea,  Justice  Minister  Cathy  Jamieson  has  decided  to  drop  the  plans.  Instead,  Ms  Jamieson  will  change  the  law  to  help  produce  a  closer  working  relationship  between  both  elements  of  the  justice  system.  |||    She  will  announce  the  move  in  her  Criminal  Justice  Plan  on  Monday,  aiming  to  ""break  down  the  barriers  between  what  happens  in  prison  and  what  happens  in  the  community"".  The  new  measures  will  place  a  new  statutory  duty  on  the  SPS  to  work  with  local  authorities  and  others  in  area  partnerships.  A  national  advisory  board  on  offender  management  will  also  be  created  to  advise  Ms  Jamieson  on  the  SPS's  role  and  performance  in  reducing  reoffending.  The  minister  said:  ""Better  joint  working  will  help  prisons  play  a  much  stronger  role  in  ending  reoffending  behaviour  and  in  particular  help  address  the  revolving  door  of  reoffending  that  sees  offenders  entering  prison  for  short  periods  during  which  little  is  done  to  address  the  behaviour  that  brought  them  there.  ""Communities  who  are  paying  the  price  for  this  reoffending  -  both  in  terms  of  crime  and  in  terms  of  prison  costs  -  expect  better.  ""It  costs  the  taxpayer  £35,000  a  year  to  provide  each  prison  place  and  that  cost  is  increasing.  ""Taxpayers  who  suffer  the  consequences  of  crime  also  end  up  paying  for  keeping  those  people  in  prison.  ""Therefore,  as  we  continue  to  invest  in  the  service,  it  is  only  right  that  we  seek  to  ensure  that  that  service  becomes  more  accountable  to  the  public  it  serves,  to  ministers  and  to  parliament.""" 

2	"Jamieson  issues  warning  to  bigots  |||    Scotland's  justice  minister  has  warned  bigoted  soccer  fans  that  she  wants  to  hit  them  ""where  it  hurts  most""  by  banning  them  from  matches.  |||    Cathy  Jamieson  said  exclusion  orders  are  one  of  a  series  of  measures  being  considered  in  the  Scottish  Executive  campaign  against  sectarianism.  She  praised  Celtic  and  Rangers  for  their  work  in  tackling  the  problem.  However,  the  minister  said  stopping  sectarian  abuse  associated  with  Old  Firm  matches  is  a  key  objective.  Ms  Jamieson  was  speaking  ahead  of  the  third  round  Scottish  Cup  clash  between  the  Glasgow  clubs  at  Parkhead  on  Sunday.  The  sectarianism  long  associated  with  sections  of  the  support  from  both  clubs  has  become  a  significant  target  for  the  executive.  Last  week  Ms  Jamieson  and  First  Minister  Jack  McConnell  met  supporters'  representatives  from  both  clubs  to  discuss  the  issue.  |||    They  plan  to  hold  an  anti-sectarian  summit  next  month  with  officials  from  the  clubs,  church  leaders,  senior  police  officers  and  local  authority  chiefs  among  those  to  be  invited.  Speaking  on  BBC  Radio  Scotland's  Sunday  Live  programme,  Ms  Jamieson  described  Friday's  meeting  as  ""very  productive""  and  said  putting  the  squeeze  on  the  bigots  would  be  a  key  aim.  Ms  Jamieson  stressed  that  sectarianism  has  not  been  confined  to  football  but  it  can  act  as  a  ""trigger""  for  tensions  and  violence.  Clubs  have  taken  action  in  the  past  to  ban  troublesome  fans  and  supporters'  groups  expressed  their  desire  to  ensure  that  the  game  is  no  longer  tainted  by  the  problem.  |||    Ms  Jamieson  said  the  executive  should  have  a  role  in  tackling  the  soccer  troublemakers.  She  said:  ""We  can't  get  away  from  the  fact  that  in  some  instances  some  of  the  religious  hatred  that  some  people  try  to  associate  with  football  boils  over  into  violence.  ""That  is  the  kind  of  thing  we  want  to  stop  and  that's  the  kind  of  thing  supporters'  groups  are  very  clear  they  don't  want  to  be  part  of  either,  and  they  will  work  with  us  to  try  and  deal  with  that.""  |||    Ms  Jamieson  praised  the  police  for  their  action  and  said:  ""The  police  do  want  to  identify  whether  there  are  particular  individuals  who  are  going  over  the  top  and  inciting  hatred  or  violence  -  they  will  crack  down  very  effectively  on  them.  ""We  have  of  course  already  indicated  that  we  will  consider  the  introduction  of  banning  orders  to  give  additional  powers  to  where  there  are  people  who  are  going  over  the  top,  who  have  made  inappropriate  behaviour  at  football  matches,  to  be  able  to  stop  them  attending  the  games.  ""That's  the  kind  of  thing  that  will  hit  those  kind  of  people  where  it  hurts  the  most  in  not  allowing  them  to  attend  the  games,""  she  said.  Praising  Celtic  and  Rangers  for  their  efforts,  she  said:  ""I  don't  think  there  is  any  doubt  that  we  have  seen  some  positive  moves  from  the  clubs.  ""Both  Rangers  and  Celtic  football  clubs  have  been  involved  in  working  with  the  executive  to  produce,  for  example,  an  educational  pack  for  young  people."""

Shares  in  ACC  fell  5.5%  as  investors,  who  thought  the  offer  was  underpriced,  decided  to  sell.  Meanwhile,  UK-based  firm  Aggregate  Industries  said  it  had  agreed  a  £1.8bn  takeover  by  Holcim.  |||    The  deal  with  Aggregates  will  give  Holcim,  the  world's  second-biggest  cement  maker,  an  entry  into  the  UK  market  and  boost  its  presence  in  the  US.  Peter  Tom,  who  will  remain  as  Aggregate  chief  executive,  said  the  138p  a  share  offer  provided  ""significant  value""  for  shareholders.  The  Markfield,  Leicestershire-based  company  runs  142  quarries  in  the  UK  and  the  US.  It  also  has  164  ready-mixed  concrete  plants,  90  asphalt  plants  and  32  pre-cast  concrete  factories.  |||    If  the  Indian  deals  go  ahead,  it  will  give  Holcim  a  major  presence  in  the  world's  fastest-growing  market  behind  China.

""Holcim  is  looking  to  buy  it  (ACC)  very  cheap,""  said  KK  Mittal,  a  fund  manager  with  Escorts  Mutual  Fund  in  New  Delhi.  ""The  market  is  not  impressed.  If  they  want  a  substantial  chunk,  then  they  should  be  paying  a  premium  over  the  market  price.""

2	"Lib  Dems  target  the  student  vote  |||    Students  can  decide  the  fate  of  MPs  in  some  seats  at  the  next  election,  Liberal  Democrat  leader  Charles  Kennedy  has  claimed.  |||    The  party  says  the  votes  of  students  can  win  it  27  new  seats  at  the  poll.  The  figures  assume  all  students  will  vote  in  their  university  town.  In  fact,  some  may  vote  where  the  parents  live.  The  Lib  Dems  say  scrapping  university  fees  wins  them  student  support.  But  the  Tories  would  also  end  fees  and  Labour  says  both  would  cap  people's  ambitions.  |||    The  Lib  Dems  have  named  the  14  seats  where  there  are  enough  students  to  take  the  Lib  Dems  from  second  place  to  beat  Labour,  and  the  13  where  they  could  go  from  second  to  beat  the  Tories.  Launching  his  campaign  to  win  students'  votes  at  the  London  School  of  Economics,  Mr  Kennedy  urged  students  to  ""make  their  mark"".  He  underlined  Lib  Dem  plans  to  scrap  university  fees  and  reintroduce  maintenance  grants  of  up  to  £2,000.  He  said:  ""Top-up  fees  put  students  off  university,  especially  those  from  a  poorer  background.  ""And  is  it  really  right  that  so  many  young  people  are  starting  out  in  life  with  mortgage-style  debts  hanging  round  their  necks?""  Mr  Kennedy  also  said  students  want  action  on  the  environment  and  see  the  Iraq  war,  which  his  party  opposed,  as  a  defining  issue.  |||    Labour  has  pushed  through  plans  to  let  universities  charge  fees  of  up  to  £3,000  a  year,  with  the  poorest  students  eligible  for  non-repayable  support  of  up  to  £3,000.  Ahead  of  Mr  Kennedy's  launch,  a  Labour  spokesperson  said:  ""Like  the  Tories,  the  Liberal  Democrats  would  restrict  access  to  higher  education  and  put  a  cap  on  aspiration,  closing  the  door  to  students  with  good  grades  and  restricting  their  life  ambitions.  ""They  are  committed  to  abandoning  Labour's  targets  of  getting  50%  of  18  to  30-year-olds  going  into  higher  education  and  under  Lib  Dem  plans  students  would  even  have  to  study  near  home.""  The  Conservatives  say  they  would  abolish  university  tuition  fees  and  instead  offer  large  student  loans  at  commercial  rates  of  interest.  |||    They  say  the  Lib  Dem  policy  would  leave  universities  wholly  dependent  for  their  income  on  the  ""goodwill""  of  the  chancellor.  |||    Shadow  education  secretary  Tim  Collins  is  on  Thursday  setting  out  a  new  scheme  of  vocational  grants  for  14  to  16-year-olds  to  tackle  what  he  says  are  ""crippling  skills  shortages"".  The  Lib  Dem  analysis  of  the  difference  students  could  make  to  its  election  chances  is  based  on  all  students  being  registered  to  vote  near  their  university,  not  in  their  home  towns.  Although  the  expected  5  May  election  would  be  during  term  time,  students  can  vote  by  post.  The  Electoral  Commission  and  National  Union  of  Students  are  worried  students  in  halls  of  residence  can  find  it  hard  to  register  to  vote.  Some  hall  wardens  are  reluctant  to  register  students  because  of  data  protection  fears  -  but  students  can  get  themselves  registered.  If  the  election  is  on  5  May,  voters  need  to  register  by  11  March.  |||        -  The  seats  where  the  Lib  Dems  say  student  votes  can  swing  the  election  for  them  are:  Bristol  West,  Cardiff  Central,  Leeds  North  West,  Cambridge,  Manchester  Gorton,  Sheffield  Central,  Oxford  East,  Newcastle-upon-Tyne  Central,  Liverpool  Riverside,  Holborn  and  St  Pancras,  Oldham  East  and  Saddleworth,  Manchester  Withington,  Islington  South  and  Finsbury,  Birmingham  Yardley,  Surrey  South  West,  Taunton,  Orpington,  Haltemprice  and  Howden,  Eastbourne,  Isle  of  Wight,  Dorset  West,  Bournemouth  East,  Wells,  Canterbury,  Cities  of  London  and  Westminster,  Bournemouth  West,  Westmorland  and  Lonsdale." 

2	"Research  fears  over  Kelly's  views  |||    Scientists  have  expressed  concerns  that  new  education  secretary  Ruth  Kelly's  religious  views  could  hamper  vital  scientific  research.  |||    Ms  Kelly,  who  is  Catholic,  is  reported  to  be  ""pro-life""  and  has  opposed  embryo  research.  Medical  Research  Council  Professor  Nancy  Rothwell  said  Ms  Kelly's  views  mattered  as  she  was  responsible  for  training  future  scientists.  The  Department  for  Education  and  Skills  would  not  comment  on  the  concerns.  |||    A  spokeswoman  said:  ""It  is  not  news  that  Ms  Kelly  is  a  Catholic  but  we  are  not  going  into  any  details  on  this.""  But  she  added  that  claims  Ms  Kelly  was  in  charge  of  a  £1bn  university  research  budget  were  not  true.  It  was  down  to  the  Higher  Education  Funding  Council  and  the  research  councils  to  decide  on  universities'  research  allocations.  British  law  is  open  to  the  cloning  of  human  embryos  to  create  stem  cells,  master  cells  that  can  develop  into  all  the  body's  tissue  types.  This  cloning  activity  is  not  permitted  for  reproductive  purposes  -  only  for  research  into  new  disease  treatments.  However,  it  is  controversial  because  it  involves  the  destruction  of  embryos.  |||    Professor  Rothwell,  who  is  also  vice-president  of  research  at  Manchester  University,  told  the  Times  Higher  Education  Supplement  it  would  worry  her  ""a  great  deal""  if  ministers  were  anti-stem  cell.  She  said:  ""The  views  of  ministers  in  the  DfES  do  matter  as  they  are  responsible  for  training  the  next  generation  of  scientists.  ""You  can't  have  a  higher  education  policy  that  is  at  odds  with  the  government's  science  policy.""  Head  of  developmental  genetics  at  the  National  Institute  of  Medical  Research,  Professor  Robin  Lovell-Badge,  said  he  had  witnessed  the  confused  situation  in  the  US  where  many  religious  groups  opposed  the  practice.  He  said:  ""If  someone  as  senior  as  Ruth  Kelly  is  not  going  to  favour  stem  cell  research  we  will  end  up  with  a  similarly  schizophrenic  system  in  this  country.  It  is  very  worrying.""  But  fertility  expert  Lord  Winston  said  he  thought  it  was  ""rather  good""  ministers  held  ethical  views.  Concerns  have  also  been  raised  by  ""pro-choice""  organisations  that  Ms  Kelly's  views  might  affect  sex  education  policy  in  schools.  |||    Family  Planning  Association  chief  executive,  Anne  Weyman,  said  teaching  pupils  about  contraception  and  abortion  were  key.  ""Young  people  must  be  informed  about  all  the  issues  within  sexual  health,  which  include  contraception  and  abortion.  ""I  think  it  is  very  important  that  the  government  maintains  its  commitment  to  the  teenage  pregnancy  strategy.""  Currently,  individual  schools  devise  their  own  sex  education  policies  based  on  a  framework  provided  by  the  DfES.  Ms  Kelly  has  not  set  out  her  detailed  views  on  either  issue  yet,  but  has  said  she  intends  to  put  parents  first  in  education  policy.  This  would  include  the  quality  of  teaching,  classroom  discipline  and  academic  standards  in  schools,  she  said."

Mr  Dowell  told  a  Los  Angeles  court  the  residue  may  have  come  from  Mr  Blake's  revolver,  his  gun  collection,  his  presence  at  the  crime  scene  or  police.  The  71-year-old  former  star  of  US  TV  drama  Baretta  has  denied  murder.  Mr  Blake  said  he  found  Ms  Bakley,  44,  dead  in  a  car  after  they  left  a  restaurant.  |||    He  said  he  briefly  returned  to  the  restaurant  to  collect  a  gun  he  had  left  behind  and  discovered  her  body  when  he  returned.  The  gun  he  collected  was  not  the  murder  weapon.  It  could  also  have  been  picked  up  if  he  touched  or  leant  on  the  car  when  he  found  the  body,  or  from  a  police  box  in  which  his  clothes  were  later  stored.  The  box  had  come  from  an  area  where  officers  went  after  being  on  the  firing  range.  But  Mr  Dowell  also  said  the  residue  would  have  been  present  if  Mr  Blake  fired  a  gun  that  night.  Witnesses  have  already  told  the  trial  Mr  Blake  ""stood  out  as  being  quite  nervous  and  agitated""  at  the  restaurant  before  the  murder.  The  actor,  who  won  an  Emmy  for  playing  a  maverick  detective  in  the  1970s  TV  cop  drama  Baretta,  could  face  life  in  prison  if  convicted." 

0	"Indonesia  'declines  debt  freeze'  |||    Indonesia  no  longer  needs  the  debt  freeze  offered  by  the  Paris  Club  group  of  creditors,  Economics  Minister  Aburizal  Bakrie  has  reportedly  said.  |||    Indonesia,  which  originally  accepted  the  debt  moratorium  offer,  owes  the  Paris  Club  about  $48bn  (£25.5bn).  Mr  Bakrie  told  the  Bisnis  Indonesia  newspaper  that  a  $1.7bn  donors'  aid  package  meant  that  the  debt  moratorium  was  unnecessary.  This  aid  comes  on  top  of  a  previously-pledged  $3.4bn  package.  Most  of  this  'normal  aid'  would  be  used  to  finance  the  country's  budget  deficit.  The  Indonesian  Economics  Minister  explained  that  the  money  -  $1.2bn  in  grants  and  $500m  in  soft  loans  -  was  for  the  rebuilding  of  Aceh  province,  which  was  badly  hit  by  the  tsunami  of  26  December.  Nevertheless,  one  of  Mr  Bakrie's  deputies,  Mahendra  Siregar,  told  AFP  news  agency  that  Indonesia  was  still  considering  the  offer  by  the  Paris  Club  of  rich  creditor  nations  to  temporarily  suspend  its  debt  payments.  ""What  is  true  is  that  we  are  still  discussing...  the  Paris  Club  decision  to  find  out  more  details  such  as  how  much  of  our  debt  will  be  subject  to  a  moratorium.  That's  how  far  we  are  at  this  stage,""  said  Mr  Siregar.  |||    The  19  member  countries  of  the  Paris  Club  are  owed  about  $5bn  this  year  in  debt  repayments  by  nations  affected  by  the  Indian  Ocean  tsunami.  Indonesia,  Sri  Lanka  and  the  Seychelles  accepted  the  Paris  Club  offer,  which  was  criticised  by  some  aid  groups  as  being  too  little.  Thailand  and  India  have  however  declined  the  offer,  with  Thailand  prefering  to  keep  up  with  its  payments  while  India  said  it  would  prefer  to  rely  on  its  own  resources  rather  than  on  international  aid.  Putting  off  payments  may  lower  a  country's  rating  among  financial  organisations,  making  it  more  expensive  and  more  difficult  for  them  to  borrow  money  in  the  future,  analysts  said.  Separately,  the  Indonesian  government  has  said  it  will  announce  monthly  how  much  it  has  received  in  foreign  donations  and  how  it  has  spent  the  money.  Welfare  Minister  Alwi  Shihab  told  AP  news  agency  that  this  announcement  should  allay  suspicion  of  official  corruption  in  relief  operations."

The  two  companies  held  four  days  of  talks  after  Foster's  bought  an  18.8%  stake  in  Southcorp  on  13  January.  A  merger  would  create  a  global  player  with  worldwide  annual  sales  of  39m  cases  and  revenues  of  A$2.6bn.  |||    Southcorp  said  Foster's  A$4.17-a-share  takeover  proposal  offered  a  ""excellent  strategic  fit""  but  undervalued  the  company.

However,  it  said  that  the  offer  may  represent  an  'opening  bid',  opening  up  the  possibility  of  Foster's  returning  with  an  improved  offer.  |||    Foster's  said  a  combination  of  the  two  companies  would  create  a  global  player  with  an  ""unrivalled""  collection  of  premium  wine  brands.  Despite  being  best  known  for  brewing  Foster's  Lager,  Foster's  is  already  one  of  Australia's  largest  wine  producers,  owning  the  Beringer  and  Wolf  Blass  brands  among  others.  ""The  combination  of  Foster's  and  Southcorp  will  transform  the  global  wine  industry  and  significantly  enhance  Australia's  competitive  position  on  the  global  stage,""  said  Trevor  O'Hoy,  Foster's  chief  executive  officer.  Foster's  spent  A$584m  on  buying  an  18.8%  stake  in  Southcorp  from  the  Oatley  family,  which  founded  the  Rosemount  Estates  business  and  later  merged  it  into  Southcorp.  Shares  in  both  companies  were  suspended  while  the  two  held  talks  about  a  deal.  Southcorp's  shares  rose  12%  to  A$4.76  on  news  of  the  offer  but  Foster's  shares  fell  3.7%  to  A$5.44."

The  Aviator  was  declared  best  film,  and  its  star  Cate  Blanchett  won  best  supporting  actress.  But  Vera  Drake  scored  best  director  for  Mike  Leigh  while  Imelda  Staunton  took  the  hotly  contested  best  actress  award.  Jamie  Foxx  won  best  actor  for  Ray,  while  British  actor  Clive  Owen  took  best  supporting  actor  for  Closer.

But  big  British  hope  Kate  Winslet  walked  away  empty-handed  on  Saturday  despite  two  nominations  for  best  actress.  Celebrating  his  win,  the  Oscar-nominated  Owen  told  reporters:  ""The  whole  award  season  is  new  to  me  because  I  haven't  won  anything  before.  All  of  that  is  a  bit  overwhelming.""  Blanchett,  who  won  a  Bafta  in  1999  for  her  leading  role  in  Elizabeth,  said:  ""Winning  a  Bafta  means  an  enormous  amount  to  me.""

""Thank  you  very  much,  I'm  sure  you're  pleased,  although  you're  not  able  to  see  this,""  she  said.  |||    The  Aviator  took  four  awards  in  all,  also  collecting  best  make-up  and  hair  and  production  design,  while  Vera  Drake  also  scooped  best  costume  design.  Staunton,  who  is  up  for  an  Oscar  for  her  role  in  Vera  Drake,  arrived  wearing  a  green  silk  and  chiffon  beaded  evening  dress.  ""Thank  you  very  much.  I'm  so  thrilled  and  so  grateful  and  I'm  delighted  that  the  success  of  Vera  Drake  has  boosted  sales  of  hair  nets  and  pinnies,  which  is  very  good,""  she  said  on  accepting  her  award.  Her  director  Leigh,  who  beat  Martin  Scorsese  to  the  best  director  award,  told  the  audience:  ""We  always  say  it  was  a  surprise  and  sometimes  I've  said  it  and  not  meant  it.  On  this  occasion,  given  the  other  names,  it's  a  real  surprise  and  an  extraordinary  honour.  ""It's  an  immense  privilege  to  have  been  allowed  the  freedom  to  make  as  uncompromising  a  film  as  I  think  Vera  Drake  is  and  an  epic  with  such  a  small  budget.""  Best  actor  Foxx  could  not  make  the  ceremony,  but  actress  Helen  Mirren  read  out  his  acceptance  speech.  ""I'm  honoured  and  proud  to  receive  this  Bafta.  I'd  like  to  thank  the  late  Ray  Charles  himself.""

""I've  appreciated  British  cinema  for  a  long  time  and  to  be  recognised  like  this  is  a  special  honour.""  Other  winners  included  The  Motorcycle  Diaries  which  took  best  foreign  film  and  best  music,  while  Eternal  Sunshine  of  the  Spotless  Mind  won  best  original  screenplay  and  best  editing.  Best  British  film  was  My  Summer  of  Love,  the  story  of  two  young  women  and  their  developing  relationship,  while  Foxx's  movie  Ray,  a  bio-pic  of  late  singer  Ray  Charles,  also  took  best  sound.  Harry  Potter  and  the  Prisoner  of  Azkaban  won  the  Orange  Film  Of  The  Year,  voted  for  by  the  public.  |||    The  Orange  British  Academy  Film  Awards  are  being  shown  on  BBC  One  from  2010  GMT." 

0	"Christmas  sales  worst  since  1981  |||    UK  retail  sales  fell  in  December,  failing  to  meet  expectations  and  making  it  by  some  counts  the  worst  Christmas  since  1981.  |||    Retail  sales  dropped  by  1%  on  the  month  in  December,  after  a  0.6%  rise  in  November,  the  Office  for  National  Statistics  (ONS)  said.  The  ONS  revised  the  annual  2004  rate  of  growth  down  from  the  5.9%  estimated  in  November  to  3.2%.  A  number  of  retailers  have  already  reported  poor  figures  for  December.  Clothing  retailers  and  non-specialist  stores  were  the  worst  hit  with  only  internet  retailers  showing  any  significant  growth,  according  to  the  ONS.  |||    The  last  time  retailers  endured  a  tougher  Christmas  was  23  years  previously,  when  sales  plunged  1.7%.  |||    The  ONS  echoed  an  earlier  caution  from  Bank  of  England  governor  Mervyn  King  not  to  read  too  much  into  the  poor  December  figures.  Some  analysts  put  a  positive  gloss  on  the  figures,  pointing  out  that  the  non-seasonally-adjusted  figures  showed  a  performance  comparable  with  2003.  The  November-December  jump  last  year  was  roughly  comparable  with  recent  averages,  although  some  way  below  the  serious  booms  seen  in  the  1990s.  And  figures  for  retail  volume  outperformed  measures  of  actual  spending,  an  indication  that  consumers  are  looking  for  bargains,  and  retailers  are  cutting  their  prices.  |||    However,  reports  from  some  High  Street  retailers  highlight  the  weakness  of  the  sector.  Morrisons,  Woolworths,  House  of  Fraser,  Marks  &  Spencer  and  Big  Food  all  said  that  the  festive  period  was  disappointing.  |||    And  a  British  Retail  Consortium  survey  found  that  Christmas  2004  was  the  worst  for  10  years.  Yet,  other  retailers  -  including  HMV,  Monsoon,  Jessops,  Body  Shop  and  Tesco  -  reported  that  festive  sales  were  well  up  on  last  year.  Investec  chief  economist  Philip  Shaw  said  he  did  not  expect  the  poor  retail  figures  to  have  any  immediate  effect  on  interest  rates.  ""The  retail  sales  figures  are  very  weak,  but  as  Bank  of  England  governor  Mervyn  King  indicated  last  night,  you  don't  really  get  an  accurate  impression  of  Christmas  trading  until  about  Easter,""  said  Mr  Shaw.  ""Our  view  is  the  Bank  of  England  will  keep  its  powder  dry  and  wait  to  see  the  big  picture.""" 

3	"Williams  stays  on  despite  dispute  |||    Matt  Williams  insists  he  has  no  thoughts  of  quitting  as  national  coach  as  a  result  of  the  power  struggle  currently  gripping  Scottish  rugby.  |||    The  chairman,  chief  executive  and  three  non-executive  directors  all  departed  in  a  row  over  the  game's  future  direction.  But  Williams  said:  ""I  want  to  make  it  clear  that  I'm  committed  totally  to  Scottish  rugby.  ""I've  brought  my  family  here  and  we've  immersed  ourselves  in  Scottish  life.  There's  no  way  that  I'm  walking  away.""  However,  he  attempted  to  steer  clear  of  taking  sides  in  the  dispute.  ""I'd  like  to  stress  that  the  national  team  is  separate  to  the  political  situation,""  he  said.  |||    ""When  you  come  to  an  undertaking  like  this  and  you  are  trying  to  make  a  difference  then  there  are  always  people  who  will  begrudge  you,  who  are  jealous  and  want  to  try  to  drag  you  down.  ""When  you  have  that  situation,  you  have  to  have  the  courage  of  your  convictions  to  see  it  through.  ""There  was  some  very  unhelpful  and  uninformed  comment  that  the  national  team  had  received  a  massive  increase  in  budget  at  the  expense  of  other  parts  of  Scottish  rugby  and  that  is  simply  not  the  case.  ""Like  all  good  coaches,  you  go  and  ask  for  an  increase.  But  we  were  told  in  no  uncertain  terms  that  the  financial  situation  did  not  allow  that.  ""The  idea  that  we  are  lighting  cigars  with  £20  notes  while  the  rest  of  Scottish  rugby  flounders  is  absolutely  untrue.  ""We  also  attracted  criticism  because  of  the  number  of  days  players  spent  with  the  national  team.  ""But  let  me  give  you  the  truth.  Our  Irish  counterparts,  whom  we  have  to  compete  with  in  a  few  days'  time,  had  70  days  together  at  the  summer.  ""They  are  currently  in  camp  now  and  they  will  have  another  21  days  in  camp  before  the  Six  Nations.  ""That  means  they  will  have  91  days  away  from  their  club  from  July  until  the  Six  Nations.  We,  on  the  other  hand,  will  have  16.  ""There  must  be  a  win-win  philosophy  and  attitude  within  Scottish  rugby  and  that  is  what  we  are  after  -  both  groups  winning,  not  competing.""" 

2	"What  really  divides  the  parties  |||    So  what  is  the  gap  between  Labour  and  the  Tories  nowadays?  |||    One  Starbucks,  one  Rymans  and  one  small  Greek  cafe  as  it  happens.  Both  parties  have  now  completed  their  moves  to  new  headquarters,  with  Labour  creating  its  election  hub  just  three  doors  away  from  the  Tories'  new  headquarters  in  Victoria  Street,  just  down  the  road  from  the  Commons.  That  should  make  things  a  little  easier  if  and  when  the  crack-of-dawn  election  press  conferences  kick  off.  Unlike  2001,  there  should  be  no  need  for  colleagues  to  have  taxis  gunning  their  engines  outside,  or  to  buy  scooters,  to  get  themselves  between  the  tightly-timetabled  events.  |||    And,  to  all  intents  and  purposes,  we  already  appear  to  be  in  that  general  election  campaign.  Certainly  the  press  conference  hosted  by  election  co-ordinator  Alan  Milburn,  in  the  rather  compact  new  conference  room  -  still  smelling  of  new  carpet  and  with  the  garish  New  Labour  coffee  mugs  as  yet  unstained  -  had  all  the  hallmarks  of  an  election  event.  |||    ""Welcome  to  the  unremittingly  New  Labour  media  centre,""  he  said.  And  I'll  bet  he  hadn't  checked  that  one  with  Gordon  Brown.  Along  with  Work  and  Pensions  Secretary  Alan  Johnson  and  Minister  for  Work  Jane  Kennedy,  he  then  went  on  to  tear  into  the  Tory  plans  to  scrap  the  New  Deal  welfare-to-work  scheme,  which  they  claimed  would  lead  to  an  increase  of  almost  300,000  in  unemployment.  And  they  ridiculed  the  claims  made  on  Monday  by  Michael  Howard  that  he  could  save  £35  billion  of  Labour  waste  and  inefficiency  to  spend  on  public  services  while  also  offering  £4  billion  of  tax  cuts.  Labour  has  come  up  with  a  figure  of  £22  billions  worth  of  efficiency  savings  so,  understandably  perhaps,  believe  Mr  Howard  must  be  planning  cuts  to  squeeze  the  extra  £13  billion.  These  figures,  based  on  the  two  parties'  own  detailed  studies,  will  be  battered  to  within  an  inch  of  their  lives  during  the  campaign.  Wednesday  was  just  the  start." 

0	"Worldcom  director  ends  evidence  |||    The  former  chief  financial  officer  at  US  telecoms  firm  WorldCom  has  finished  giving  evidence  at  the  trial  of  his  ex-boss  Bernie  Ebbers.  |||    Scott  Sullivan  admitted  to  jurors  he  was  willing  to  commit  fraud  to  meet  Wall  Street  earnings  projections.  Mr  Ebbers  is  on  trial  for  fraud  and  conspiracy  in  relation  to  WorldCom's  collapse  in  2002.  He  pleads  not  guilty.  Mr  Sullivan  has  spent  two  days  being  cross-examined  by  lawyers  for  former  Worldcom  chief  executive  Mr  Ebbers.  |||    Attorney  Reid  Weingarten  has  attempted  to  portray  Mr  Sullivan  as  a  liar  and  on  Thursday  quizzed  him  about  his  decision  to  commit  fraud  to  meet  analysts'  profit  estimates.  ""At  that  point  in  time,""  Mr  Sullivan  said,  referring  to  the  first  false  entries  in  late  2000,  ""I  knew  it  was  wrong  and  I  knew  it  was  against  the  law,  but  I  thought  we  would  get  through  it  in  the  short  term.""  Mr  Sullivan,  42,  has  already  pleaded  guilty  to  fraud  and  will  be  sentenced  following  Mr  Ebbers'  trial,  where  he  is  appearing  as  a  prosecution  witness.  Mr  Ebbers,  63,  has  always  insisted  that  he  was  unaware  of  any  hidden  shortfalls  in  WorldCom's  finances.  The  former  finance  officer  said  Mr  Ebbers  knew  about  the  improper  accounting  entries  that  were  made  between  2000  and  2002  to  conceal  soaring  expenses  and  inflate  revenue.  |||    Mr  Ebbers  could  face  a  sentence  of  85  years  if  convicted  of  all  the  charges  he  is  facing.  WorldCom's  problems  appear  to  have  begun  with  the  collapse  of  the  dotcom  boom  which  cut  its  business  from  internet  companies.  Prosecutors  allege  that  the  company's  top  executives  responded  by  orchestrating  massive  fraud  over  a  two-year  period.  WorldCom  emerged  from  bankruptcy  protection  in  2004,  and  is  now  known  as  MCI.  On  Monday,  MCI  agreed  to  a  buyout  by  Verizon  Communications  in  a  deal  valued  at  $6.75bn." 

1	"Top  of  the  Pops  leaves  BBC  One  |||    The  BBC's  flagship  pop  music  programme  Top  of  the  Pops  is  to  move  from  BBC  One  on  Fridays  to  Sundays  on  BBC  Two.  |||    The  new  programme  will  combine  with  archive  show  TOTP2,  mixing  new  music  with  footage  of  classic  bands.  The  corporation  said  the  new  show  ""aims  to  appeal  to  a  diverse  audience  of  music  lovers"".  The  move  is  the  biggest  shake-up  in  the  history  of  the  show,  which  was  first  broadcast  in  1964  and  has  always  been  on  BBC  One.  Top  of  the  Pops  was  relaunched  in  a  blaze  of  publicity  in  December  last  year  in  an  attempt  to  reverse  a  long-term  decline  in  audience  figures.  |||    The  All  New  Top  of  the  Pops  was  fronted  by  newcomer  Tim  Kash  and  was  put  together  by  producer  Andi  Peters,  who  was  brought  back  to  the  BBC  from  Channel  4  to  revitalise  the  series.  |||    About  three  million  people  a  week  were  watching  the  show  on  Fridays  -  less  than  half  the  total  it  was  attracting  in  the  mid-1990s  -  as  the  programme  went  up  against  popular  ITV  soap  Coronation  Street.  But  despite  the  relaunch  audience  figures  failed  to  rise  and  still  remain  around  the  three  million  mark.  Tim  Kash  has  since  been  replaced  as  host  by  Fearne  Cotton.  The  new  show  will  launch  in  Spring  next  year  in  an  extended  format.  BBC  Two  controller  Roly  Keating:  ""It's  an  exciting  new  era  for  Top  of  the  Pops.  We  want  to  make  it  bigger  and  better  so  that  it  becomes  the  ultimate  pop  music  show  for  music  lovers  of  every  generation.""  Mr  Keating  described  BBC  Two  as  the  ""natural  home""  of  Top  of  the  Pops.  He  added:  ""The  addition  of  Top  of  the  Pops  will  also  extend  BBC  Two's  offering  to  younger  audiences.""  |||    A  BBC  spokeswoman  said  Andi  Peters  would  continue  as  executive  producer  on  the  show.  She  said  that  issues  over  the  exact  format  of  the  programme  and  a  time  slot  were  still  to  be  decided.  The  programme  will  have  a  close  relationship  with  the  BBC  Radio  1  chart  show,  which  suggests  the  relaunched  show  may  be  transmitted  at  about  1900  on  Sundays.  ""Hopefully  the  audience  for  Top  of  the  Pops  will  find  it  on  BBC  Two.  ""We  think  that  the  new  slot  will  create  a  buzz  around  the  programme  as  for  the  first  time  viewers  will  discover  the  news  of  who  is  number  one  as  it  happens."""

He  kept  Madonna  in  second  place,  as  she  earned  $54.9m  (£29.5m)  while  embarking  on  her  global  Re-Invention  Tour.  Veterans  Simon  and  Garfunkel  were  in  10th  place,  their  comeback  tour  helping  them  earn  $24.9m  (£13.4m)  last  year.  |||    ""Prince  returned  to  centre  stage  after  a  decade  in  the  commercial  wilderness,""  the  magazine  reported.  The  singer's  2004  tour  took  $90.3m  (£48.5m)  in  ticket  sales  and  he  sold  1.9  million  copies  of  his  latest  album  Musicology.  |||    Although  she  grossed  more  than  Prince  last  year,  Madonna  remained  in  second  place  because  of  the  ""monumental""  production  costs  of  her  tour.  Heavy  metal  band  Metallica's  Madly  in  Anger  with  the  World  tour  helped  push  their  2004  earnings  up  to  $43.1m  (£23.1m).  They  were  ahead  of  Sir  Elton  John,  who  took  fourth  place  and  almost  $42.7m  (£23m)  from  performances  including  a  debut  on  the  Las  Vegas  Strip.  Other  seasoned  performers  in  the  list  included  Rod  Stewart,  whose  sold-out  shows  and  third  volume  of  The  Great  American  Songbook  covers  album  helped  net  him  £35m  (£19m).  The  highest-ranking  rap  act  in  the  list  was  50  Cent,  who  at  number  19  took  $24m  (£13m)  to  the  bank." 

1	"Fightstar  take  to  the  stage  |||    Charlie  Simpson  took  his  new  band  Fightstar  to  the  stage  on  Friday  night,  just  hours  after  officially  announcing  his  departure  from  pop  band  Busted.  |||    He  was  greeted  by  a  sell-out  crowd  at  the  University  of  Warwick.  Confirmation  of  Busted's  long-rumoured  split  had  come  earlier  in  the  day,  when  Simpson  held  a  press  conference  in  London  with  bandmates  Matt  Willis  and  James  Bourne.  All  three  band  members  stressed  that  the  break  up  was  amicable,  although  Bourne  admitted  he  was  ""devastated""  to  hear  of  Simpson's  departure.  ""This  has  been  a  really  difficult  decision,""  19-year-old  Simpson  revealed,  ""I  hope  the  fans  will  understand.""  |||    While  Simpson  declared  he  would  look  back  with  pride  on  Busted's  enormous  success,  his  focus  turned  immediately  to  Fightstar,  with  Friday's  press  conference  coinciding  with  the  start  of  the  band's  13-date  tour  of  the  UK.  Fuelled  by  this  news,  all  1,400  tickets  to  see  Charlie's  first  post-Busted  live  appearance  -  at  the  University  of  Warwick's  Student  Union  -  sold  out  rapidly.  Mike  Eccleshall,  the  venue's  Promotions  Coordinator,  said:  ""Tickets  had  been  selling  strongly  over  the  past  few  days,  but  sales  went  mad  after  the  news  broke.  We  had  completely  sold  out  by  4pm.""  |||    With  queues  outside  the  venue  long  and  expectations  high,  the  pressure  was  on  Fightstar  to  impress.  Although  many  dedicated  fans  travelled  to  the  gig  from  around  the  country,  they  faced  a  tough  crowd  made  up  chiefly  of  students,  the  average  age  of  the  audience  far  exceeding  that  of  any  Busted  concert.  Gone  were  the  screaming  girls  to  which  Simpson  had  become  accustomed.  Support  act  Brigade,  fronted  by  Simpson's  brother,  played  a  short  set  first  and  were  met  with  general  approval.  When  Fightstar  eventually  took  to  the  stage  around  11pm,  however,  a  riotous  cheer  easily  drowned  out  any  hecklers  lurking  in  the  crowd.  |||    Unfortunately,  the  band  were  initially  hindered  by  technical  teething  problems  as  Simpson's  guitar  amplifier  failed  to  work.  As  sound  technicians  rushed  to  fix  it,  other  band  members  did  their  best  to  improvise.  When  they  eventually  got  under  way,  Fightstar's  blend  of  emotionally  charged  rock  was  warmly  received.  Far  heavier  and  less  commercial  than  Busted's  chart-topping  pop-punk,  the  band  will  undoubtedly  appeal  to  a  more  mature  fan-base.  Warwick  student  Helen  Clutterbuck  admitted:  ""I  came  to  check  out  Fightstar  because  of  all  the  controversy.  ""I've  never  heard  them  before,  but  I'm  pretty  impressed.""  Less  impressed  were  fellow  students  Ryan  Crabbe  and  Gordon  Rennie,  who  observed,  ""With  Fightstar,  Charlie  has  clearly  progressed  from  Busted's  sound,  but  they're  still  not  very  inspiring.""  Fightstar  played  for  around  45  minutes,  showcasing  material  from  their  forthcoming  EP  called  They  Liked  You  Better  When  You  Were  Dead,  due  for  release  in  February."

The  Xiluodu  dam  is  one  of  30  such  large-scale  construction  projects  called  to  a  halt  because  of  a  lack  of  proper  environmental  checks.  The  Beijing  News  said  the  company  may  instead  choose  to  pay  a  fine.  The  firm  has  also  ignored  orders  to  stop  construction  at  two  of  its  other  projects  -  the  Three  Gorges  Underground  Power  Plant  and  the  Three  Gorges  Project  Electrical  Power  Supply  Plant.  |||    So  far,  only  22  of  the  30  construction  projects  targeted  by  China's  State  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (Sepa)  for  having  not  carried  out  mandatory  environmental  impact  assessments  have  complied  with  its  shutdown  order.  The  China  Three  Gorges  Project  Corp  could  now  face  a  fine  up  to  200,000  yuan  ($24,000;  £12,700).  Last  week,  it  denied  that  its  projects  violated  regulations.  ""The  Three  Gorges  Corporation  has  all  along  abided  by  the  law  and  have  built  our  projects  in  accordance  with  the  law,""  it  said.  |||    The  Sepa  order  comes  as  the  Chinese  government  appears  to  be  trying  to  cool  the  country's  booming  economy.  Previously  it  has  encouraged  construction  of  new  electricity  generating  capacity  to  solve  chronic  energy  shortages,  which  forced  many  factories  into  part-time  working  last  year.  In  2004,  China  increased  its  generating  capacity  by  12.6%  to  440,700  megawatts  (MW).  The  Xiluodu  Dam  is  designed  to  produce  12,600  MW  of  electricity,  and  is  being  built  on  the  Jinshajiang  -  or  ""river  of  golden  sand""  as  the  upper  reaches  of  the  Yangtze  are  known.  It  is  a  sister  project  to  the  main  Three  Gorges  Dam  downstream  where  more  than  half  a  million  people  have  had  to  be  relocated,  drawing  criticism  from  environmental  groups  and  overseas  human  rights  activists."

Fox  TV's  Bill  O'Reilly  said  he  would  be  ""watching  to  see  if  the  money  gets  to  the  tsunami  victims""  and  warned  the  celebrities  taking  part  ""had  better  be  involved  all  the  way  down  the  line"".  But  Clooney  accused  O'Reilly  of  creating  a  fuss  for  his  own  personal  gain,  saying  viewers  may  now  be  ""afraid  that  their  money  will  do  no  good"".  |||    He  urged  O'Reilly  to  co-present  the  TV  special,  adding  in  a  letter:  ""We're  not  playing  games  here,  we're  trying  to  save  lives.  It's  as  simple  as  this  -  you're  either  with  this  joint  effort  or  against  it.""  Organisers  say  all  funds  will  go  to  the  American  Red  Cross.  The  commercial-free  benefit  show  will  also  be  aired  by  a  string  of  cable  broadcasters  and  Clear  Channel's  radio  stations  across  the  US.  In  addition,  performances  will  be  available  to  buy  on  the  internet  as  downloads  from  Sony's  Connect  music  store.  A  similar  TV  benefit  carried  by  all  four  primary  US  TV  networks  after  the  11  September  terror  attacks  raised  more  than  $150m  (£80m).  |||        -  The  Bangkok  International  Film  Festival  got  under  way  on  Thursday  in  the  Thai  capital  in  the  shadow  of  the  country's  5,300  deaths  from  the  tsunami.  The  red  carpet  gala  opening  night  was  ditched  in  favour  of  a  more  subdued  first  night.  Six  different  films  were  shown  at  six  cinemas,  with  all  money  from  ticket  sales  going  to  charity."

Allied  Domecq  shares  in  London  rose  4%  by  1200  GMT,  while  Pernod  shares  in  Paris  slipped  1.2%.  Pernod  said  it  was  seeking  acquisitions  but  refused  to  comment  on  specifics.  |||    Pernod's  last  major  purchase  was  a  third  of  US  giant  Seagram  in  2000,  the  move  which  propelled  it  into  the  global  top  three  of  drinks  firms.  The  other  two-thirds  of  Seagram  was  bought  by  market  leader  Diageo.  In  terms  of  market  value,  Pernod  -  at  7.5bn  euros  ($9.7bn)  -  is  about  9%  smaller  than  Allied  Domecq,  which  has  a  capitalisation  of  £5.7bn  ($10.7bn;  8.2bn  euros).  Last  year  Pernod  tried  to  buy  Glenmorangie,  one  of  Scotland's  premier  whisky  firms,  but  lost  out  to  luxury  goods  firm  LVMH.  Pernod  is  home  to  brands  including  Chivas  Regal  Scotch  whisky,  Havana  Club  rum  and  Jacob's  Creek  wine.  Allied  Domecq's  big  names  include  Malibu  rum,  Courvoisier  brandy,  Stolichnaya  vodka  and  Ballantine's  whisky  -  as  well  as  snack  food  chains  such  as  Dunkin'  Donuts  and  Baskin-Robbins  ice  cream.  The  WSJ  said  that  the  two  were  ripe  for  consolidation,  having  each  dealt  with  problematic  parts  of  their  portfolio.  Pernod  has  reduced  the  debt  it  took  on  to  fund  the  Seagram  purchase  to  just  1.8bn  euros,  while  Allied  has  improved  the  performance  of  its  fast-food  chains."

The  economy  is  benefiting  from  a  quieter  period  in  Palestinian-Israeli  violence  and  a  pick-up  in  global  demand  for  technology  products.  The  outlook  is  better  than  it  has  been  for  a  number  of  years,  analysts  said.  |||    Many  companies  have  focused  on  cost  cutting  and  greater  efficiency,  while  the  government  has  been  trying  to  trim  public  spending  and  push  through  reforms.  The  growth  figures  come  about  despite  a  strike  earlier  this  year  by  about  400,000  public  sector  worker  which  closed  banks,  hospitals,  postal  services  and  transport  facilities.  Growth  did  slow  in  the  second  half,  but  only  slightly.  Exports  for  the  year  rose  by  14%,  while  tourist  revenues  were  up  by  30%.  Imports  gained  by  13%,  signalling  that  domestic  demand  has  picked  up  again.  In  2003,  imports  declined  by  1.8%.  In  2003,  the  economy  expanded  by  1.3%"

Depending  on  how  much  they  borrow  or  invest,  members  earn  ""reward""  points  which  entitle  them  to  a  share  of  the  society's  profits.  The  payouts  are  bigger  than  last  year,  because  of  stricter  eligibility  rules.  Last  year,  Britannia  members  shared  £42m,  but  the  average  payment  was  only  £38.  |||    To  qualify  for  this  year's  payment,  customers  must  have  been  members  for  at  least  two  years  on  31  December  2004.  Britannia  has  also  stopped  making  payments  to  members  if  they  are  worth  less  than  £5.  |||    To  qualify  for  the  profit  share,  members  must  have  either  a  mortgage,  or  an  investment  account  other  than  a  deposit  account.  Customers  can  also  qualify  if  they  have  Permanent  Interest  Bearing  Shares  (PIBS).  The  profit  share  scheme  was  introduced  in  1997  and  has  paid  out  more  than  £370m.  Britannia  will  unveil  its  results  on  Wednesday." 

2	"Blair  sets  date  for  Africa  report  |||    The  Commission  for  Africa's  report  will  be  released  on  11  March  -  Comic  Relief  day,  Tony  Blair  has  said.  |||    July's  G8  summit  in  Gleneagles  in  Perthshire  -  chaired  by  the  prime  minister  -  will  use  the  report  as  the  basis  for  talks  on  Africa.  The  announcement  followed  the  final  meeting  of  the  commission  -  which  includes  singer  Bob  Geldof  -  in  London.  As  well  as  more  aid,  fairer  trade  and  less  debt,  the  commission  is  likely  to  demand  action  on  corruption  in  Africa.  Mr  Blair  told  a  news  conference:  ""It  will  be  a  report  that's  brutally  frank  about  the  reality,  but  I  hope  idealistic  about  what  can  be  done  if  the  will  is  there.  ""It's  an  ambitious  project  we  have  set  ourselves  and  you  will  have  to  judge  on  its  outcome  when  we  publish  it.""  |||    Mr  Blair  has  vowed  to  put  Africa  at  the  top  of  his  agenda  during  his  time  at  the  helm  of  the  G8.  He  acknowledged  he  would  have  a  ""a  job  of  persuading  to  do""  on  other  nations  to  get  the  necessary  commitment  to  debt  relief.  Bob  Geldof,  in  characteristically  blunt  style,  promised  that  the  commission  would  not  just  be  a  talking  shop  but  would  deliver  radical  new  thinking  to  change  direction  for  Africa.  The  former  rock  star's  presence  on  the  commission  has  been  interpreted  as  a  sign  that  it  will  be  uncompromising  in  its  demands.  The  people  involved  include  two  African  government  leaders  and  a  range  of  other  African  politicians,  as  well  as  experts  from  some  other  developed  countries." 

2	"Hunt  ban  support  is  'in  decline'  |||    Support  for  a  ban  on  hunting  has  fallen  in  the  past  six  years,  a  poll  suggests.  |||    Less  than  half  the  UK  wants  a  ban  compared  to  almost  two-thirds  in  1999,  the  Mori  survey  of  2,000  adults  for  BBC  One's  Countryfile  programme  suggests.  The  number  opposed  to  a  ban  remains  constant,  but  those  ""neither  supporting  nor  opposing""  has  increased  by  11%.  Most  city-dwellers  support  the  ban  but  rural  people  were  evenly  split  between  supporters,  opponents  and  undecided.  |||    Polling  company  Mori  carried  out  both  surveys.  In  July  1999  they  asked  801  adults  if  they  supported  the  ban  for  the  Mail  on  Sunday.  For  Countryfile  they  asked  2,234  adults  across  the  country  the  same  question.  The  Mail  on  Sunday  survey  found  that  63%  supported  a  hunting  ban  compared  with  24%  against.  In  the  Countryfile  survey,  47%  said  they  supported  the  legislation,  with  26%  against.  But  the  programme  makers  suggest  the  British  public  are  becoming  ""increasingly  neutral""  to  the  issue  because  around  one  quarter  said  they  ""neither  support  nor  oppose""  a  ban." 

2	"Teenagers  to  be  allowed  to  be  MPs  |||    Teenagers  will  be  able  to  become  MPs  under  plans  unveiled  by  ministers.  |||    In  a  written  statement,  Constitutional  Affairs  Minister  Christopher  Leslie  said  the  current  minimum  age  of  21  for  an  MP  would  be  reduced  to  18.  The  proposals  follow  a  recommendation  last  year  by  elections  watchdog  the  Electoral  Commission.  ""The  government  intends  to  legislate,  when  parliamentary  time  allows,  to  lower  the  age,""  said  Mr  Leslie,  who  was  elected  in  1997  at  the  age  of  24.  Even  if  the  move  does  go  ahead  it  is  unlikely  it  will  be  in  place  before  the  next  general  election,  widely  predicted  for  May.  |||    The  announcement  from  Mr  Leslie  -  who  was  elected  in  1997  in  a  formerly  safe  Tory  seat  -  prompted  calls  for  a  lowering  of  the  voting  age  to  16.  The  Votes  at  16  alliance  said  it  was  a  good  thing  to  ""engage  people""  by  lowering  the  candidacy  age  but  argued  lowering  the  voting  age  would  be  much  more  effective.  ""Candidacy  affects  only  politicians.  The  voting  age  affects  millions  of  younger  people,""  said  spokesman  Alex  Folkes.  ""We  would  hope  that  the  government  will  table  a  bill  that  is  broad  enough  to  allow  for  amendments  to  be  brought  to  test  support  for  a  reduction  in  the  voting  age.""  |||    Currently  candidates  in  both  local  and  national  votes  must  be  21  while  the  voting  age  is  18.  That  is  because  the  age  of  majority  was  reduced  to  18  in  1969  but  laws  dating  from  1695  which  determine  the  current  voting  age  stayed  in  place.  Irish  republican  Bernadette  Devlin  was  one  of  just  a  handful  of  21-year-olds  elected  to  Parliament  in  the  20th  century  winning  a  seat  in  1969.  But  the  youngest  is  understood  to  have  been  Tory  Edward  Turnour,  who  won  the  1904  Horsham  by-election  aged  21  and  144  days  and  served  in  Parliament  for  47  continuous  years.  Last  April's  report  by  the  Electoral  Commission  said  there  was  no  strong  argument  for  leaving  the  age  for  standing  for  election  at  21.  The  commission  found  the  most  common  approach  around  the  world  is  for  the  voting  age  to  be  the  same  as  the  candidacy  age." 

2	"Talks  aim  to  avert  pension  strike  |||    Talks  aimed  at  averting  a  series  of  national  strikes  over  pensions  reforms  will  take  place  this  weekend.  |||    Five  public  sector  unions  will  hold  private  talks  with  Deputy  Prime  Minister  John  Prescott  at  Labour's  spring  conference  in  Gateshead.  They  want  the  government  to  withdraw  regulations  -  due  to  be  introduced  in  weeks  -  which  would  raise  the  pension  age  for  council  workers  from  60  to  65.  Up  to  1.4m  workers  could  take  part  in  a  strike  already  earmarked  for  23  March.  However,  all  sides  are  anxious  to  avoid  a  major  confrontation  in  the  run  up  to  the  general  election,  said  BBC  labour  affairs  correspondent  Stephen  Cape.  In  four  days,  Britain's  biggest  union  Unison  will  start  balloting  800,000  local  government  workers  on  strikes.  Other  public  sector  unions  have  pledged  to  follow.  It  is  just  weeks  before  new  regulations  are  introduced  to  raise  the  pension  age  of  local  government  workers.  |||    The  five  unions  meeting  Mr  Prescott  want  the  government  to  withdraw  these  regulations.  This  would  allow  months  of  tough  negotiations  to  follow,  said  our  correspondent.  But  a  spokesman  for  Mr  Prescott  warned  that  the  changes  to  the  local  government  pension  scheme  would  have  to  go  ahead  in  April.  Privately  ministers  believe  this  will  be  the  ""less  painful""  option,  our  correspondent  added.  The  Public  and  Commercial  Services  Union  (PCS)  will  co-ordinate  any  industrial  action  with  up  to  six  other  public  sector  unions.  PCS  leader  Mark  Serwotka  warned  last  week  that  there  could  be  further  walkouts  unless  there  was  a  government  rethink.  ""For  a  government  that  lectures  everyone  on  choice  -  choice  on  public  service,  choice  on  this  and  choice  on  that  -  isn't  it  ironic  that  they're  saying  to  public  sector  workers  there  is  no  choice,""  he  said.  ""If  you  want  the  pension  you  were  promised  when  you  started  you  must  work  for  an  extra  five  years  -  that  is  working  until  people  drop.  ""In  the  20th  century,  it's  completely  unacceptable.""  |||    Unison's  800,000  workers,  the  Transport  and  General  Workers'  Union's  70,000  and  Amicus'  20,000  are  among  those  being  balloted  about  a  23  March  walkout.  Mr  Prescott  held  a  private  meeting  with  senior  union  figures  last  week.  It  is  understood  no  deal  was  offered  in  that  meeting  but  there  was  room  for  further  negotiations." 

2	"Voters  'reject  EU  by  two  to  one'  |||    British  voters  would  reject  the  European  constitution  by  two  to  one,  according  to  a  poll  posing  the  question  the  government  will  put  to  the  country.  |||    The  Daily  Telegraph  poll  suggests  that  45%  of  people  would  vote  against  the  constitution  and  24%  in  favour.  However  the  YouGov  poll,  which  questioned  1,943  British  adults  online,  found  25%  did  not  know  how  they  would  vote  if  forced  to  decide  tomorrow.  Only  51%  of  those  polled  had  made  up  their  minds  about  the  constitution.  Another  7%  said  they  would  not  vote  at  all.  The  poll  is  believed  to  be  the  first  to  pose  the  question  which  the  government  has  chosen  for  the  upcoming  referendum,  expected  in  2006.  The  constitution  will  be  incorporated  into  UK  law  if  there  is  a  yes  vote.  |||    Ballot  papers  in  the  poll  will  ask:  ""Should  the  United  Kingdom  approve  the  treaty  establishing  a  constitution  for  the  European  Union?""  The  government  unveiled  the  question  which  will  be  asked  earlier  in  the  week.  |||    The  treaty  was  signed  by  all  25  current  EU  members  in  Rome  last  October  and  is  due  to  come  into  force  in  November  2006,  providing  it  is  ratified  by  all  member  states  -  several  of  which  will  hold  a  referendum.  Critics  say  the  constitution  is  a  further  step  towards  a  federal  Europe,  but  advocates  say  it  ensures  effective  operation  of  the  enlarged  25-state  EU.  ""If  we  reject  this  treaty,  Britain  will  be  isolated  and  weak  in  Europe,""  said  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw,  after  the  question  was  unveiled.  Mr  Straw,  along  with  the  rest  of  the  Cabinet,  will  back  a  ""yes""  vote.  Meanwhile,  Conservative  shadow  foreign  secretary  Michael  Ancram  said  the  referendum  question  ""seems  straightforward"".  But  he  accused  the  government  of  trying  to  confuse  the  issue  by  putting  the  EU  referendum  question  in  the  same  bill  as  the  ratification  of  the  constitution,  when  they  should  be  treated  as  ""two  separate  issues""." 

2	"Kilroy-Silk  attacked  with  slurry  |||    Euro  MP  Robert  Kilroy-Silk  has  had  a  bucket  of  farm  slurry  thrown  over  him  by  a  protester  in  Manchester.  |||    The  UK  Independence  Party  member  was  arriving  for  a  BBC  radio  show  when  the  attacker  emerged  from  behind  a  bush.  Fellow  guest  Ruth  Kelly  MP  was  also  hit  by  the  slurry.  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  said  the  man,  who  later  disappeared,  claimed  he  was  ""doing  it  in  the  name  of  Islam"".  In  January,  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  quit  his  BBC  One  show  for  remarks  he  made  about  Arabs,  who  he  called  ""suicide  bombers"".  |||    Mr  Kilroy-Silk  had  already  been  taken  off  air  by  BBC  bosses  for  the  comments,  in  which  he  also  described  Arabs  as  ""limb-amputators,  women  repressors"".  The  remarks  prompted  outrage  among  Muslim  groups.  The  slurry  attack  took  place  on  Friday  as  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  and  Ms  Kelly,  a  Cabinet  Office  minister  and  Bolton  West  MP,  arrived  at  Manchester  High  School  for  Girls  for  the  recording  of  BBC  Radio  4's  Any  Questions.  |||    The  police  were  called  but  the  attacker  had  disappeared  by  the  time  officers  arrived.  They  are  treating  the  incident  as  assault.  The  programme's  host,  Jonathan  Dimbleby,  later  told  the  audience  the  MEP  had  been  covered  from  ""head  to  toe"".  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  was  still  able  appear  to  appear  on  the  show  after  being  loaned  a  change  of  clothes.  |||    He  told  reporters  he  was  ""very  angry""  and  planned  to  press  charges  if  his  attacker  was  caught.  He  said  the  man  shouted:  ""You've  offended  my  religion,  I'm  doing  this  in  the  name  of  Islam.""  ""As  I  started  to  turn  round  a  guy  tipped  a  bucket  of  farmyard  muck  over  me  and  then  threw  the  rest  of  it  over  me  and  the  car,""  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  said.  ""I  was  totally  covered,  it  was  all  through  my  clothes,  and  it  stank  to  high  heaven.  It  went  all  inside  the  car  and  splattered  Ruth  Kelly.""  A  BBC  spokesman  said:  ""He  took  his  seat  as  Jonathan  Dimbleby  was  introducing  the  show.  Fortunately  someone  at  the  school  had  a  change  of  clothes  to  let  him  have.""  Greater  Manchester  Police  said  people  near  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  had  also  been  hit  by  the  waste.  Officers  took  statements  at  the  scene,  but  no  arrests  have  been  made.  Police  say  the  suspect  ran  off  after  towards  Wilmslow  Road  after  committing  the  offence  but  is  believed  to  have  been  driving  a  red  Vauxhall  Corsa  earlier.  The  suspect  is  described  as  white,  aged  30  to  40,  with  a  ginger  beard.  Police  want  to  hear  from  anyone  who  has  any  information.  |||    Mr  Kilroy-Silk,  an  MEP  for  the  East  Midlands,  resigned  the  UK  Independence  Party  whip  in  the  European  Parliament  in  October,  after  criticising  UKIP  and  stating  his  ambition  to  be  leader.  However,  he  remains  a  member  of  the  party.  He  said  on  Friday  he  hoped  to  be  elected  party  leader  before  Christmas.  ""I  think  that  is  sufficient  time  for  us  to  put  in  process  what  is  necessary...  in  time  for  us  to  fight  and  have  a  significant  impact  upon  the  General  Election.""  But  a  UKIP  spokesman  said  that  would  be  impossible  under  the  party's  constitution,  which  requires  70  days  before  any  leadership  ballot  can  take  place."

The  potential  of  the  Indian  market  has  attracted  attention  at  home  and  abroad.  Beer  magnate  Vijay  Mallya  recently  set  up  Kingfisher  Airlines,  while  UK  entrepreneur  Richard  Branson  has  said  he  is  keen  to  start  a  local  operation.  |||    The  country  has  a  population  of  more  than  a  billion  people  and  many  observers  feel  that  it  is  underserved  by  airlines.  Recently  however,  the  booming  economy  has  boosted  personal  spending  power  and  helped  swell  the  middle  classes  and  the  corporate  sector.  India's  government  has  given  its  backing  to  cheaper  and  more  accessible  air  travel.  ""The  days  of  flying  being  a  symbol  of  only  maharajas  or  the  rich  are  over,""  the  minister  for  civil  aviation  Praful  Patel  said  earlier.  Infrastructure  is  being  built  to  handle  the  expected  increase  in  demand  and  on  Tuesday,  Agence  France  Presse  reported  that  a  group  led  by  Germany's  Siemens  won  the  contract  to  build  a  private  airport  near  Bangalore.  India's  airports  authority  and  the  state  government  will  own  13%  each  of  the  finished  transport  hub.  For  its  part,  Air  Deccan,  set  up  by  army  officer  and  silk  farmer  Gorur  Gopinath,  plans  to  increase  its  fleet  to  60  aircraft  within  five  years.  To  help  finance  the  expansion  the  company  may  sell  a  25%  stake  to  an  investor  for  about  $50m.  When  it  was  set  up  the  firm  offered  tickets  that  were  50%  cheaper  than  other  Indian  airlines.  It  said  it  was  basing  its  business  model  on  European  firms  such  as  Ireland's  Ryanair."

Demand  for  the  insurer's  debut  shares  was  strong  -  12  times  what  was  on  sale.  The  listing  was  part  of  the  country's  plans  to  open  up  its  insurance  market  and  boost  demand  in  the  sector.

However,  the  authorities  have  turned  a  blind  eye  to  the  many  other  firms  selling  insurance.  Saudi  Arabia  now  wants  a  fully  functioning  insurance  industry  and  is  introducing  legislation  that  will  clamp  down  on  unauthorised  companies.  Policy-makers  also  want  to  make  having  insurance  more  of  a  requirement,  but  first  have  to  take  steps  to  boost  public  confidence  in  the  system,  analysts  said.  As  a  result,  NCCI  is  being  developed  as  the  industry's  flagship  firm  -  publicly-listed,  with  audited  accounts.  Saudi  Arabia  sold  7  million  NCCI  shares,  or  about  70%  of  the  company's  total  capital  last  month.  More  than  800,000  applicants  got  9  shares  each  for  205  riyals  apiece."

The  LSE,  which  saw  its  shares  rise  25%,  said  the  bid  undervalued  the  business.  Euronext  -  formed  after  the  Brussels,  Paris  and  Amsterdam  exchanges  merged  -  is  reportedly  working  with  three  investment  banks  on  a  possible  offer.  The  LSE,  Europe's  biggest  stock  market,  is  a  key  prize,  listing  stocks  with  a  total  capitalisation  of  £1.4  trillion.  |||    Euronext  already  has  a  presence  in  London  due  to  its  2001  acquisition  of  London-based  options  and  futures  exchange  Liffe.  Trades  on  the  LSE  are  cleared  via  Clearnet,  in  which  Euronext  has  a  quarter  stake.  |||    Euronext,  which  also  operates  an  exchange  in  Lisbon,  last  week  appointed  UBS  and  ABN  Amro  as  additional  advisors.  It  is  also  working  with  Morgan  Stanley.  Despite  the  rejection  of  the  Deutsche  Boerse  bid  last  week,  Werner  Seifert,  chief  executive  of  the  Frankfurt-based  exchange,  may  well  come  back  with  an  improved  offer.  It  has  long  wanted  to  link  up  with  London,  and  the  two  tried  and  failed  to  seal  a  merger  in  2000.  Responding  to  the  LSE's  rebuff,  Deutsche  Boerse  -  whose  market  capitalisation  is  more  than  £3bn  -  said  it  believed  it  could  show  its  proposal  offered  benefits,  and  that  it  still  hoped  to  make  a  cash  bid.  |||    Last  week  the  LSE  said  not  only  was  the  bid  undervalued,  but  that  it  had  ""been  advised  that  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  any  transaction  could  be  successfully  implemented"".  However,  it  has  indicated  it  is  open  for  further  talks.  Meanwhile,  German  magazine  Der  Spiegel  said  part  of  Mr  Seifert's  negotiations  with  the  LSE  were  about  where  to  base  the  future  board  of  any  merged  exchange.  While  Mr  Seifert  has  suggested  a  merged  company  would  be  run  out  of  London,  the  mayor  of  Frankfurt  has  raised  concerns  that  such  a  move  could  cost  German  jobs.  Many  analysts  believe  German  Boerse  has  more  financial  firepower  than  Euronext  if  it  came  to  a  bidding  war."

Other  nominees  include  The  Guardian  news  website,  the  National  Theatre,  MTV,  the  Science  Museum  and  the  London  Stock  Exchange.  The  winners  from  12  different  categories  are  crowned  on  2  March  2005.  There  were  nearly  400  entries  this  year  -  a  third  more  than  last  year.  The  BBC  has  16  nominations  while  The  Guardian  has  three  nominations.  |||    ""This  year's  nominees  are  a  testament  to  the  creative  and  innovative  work  going  on  within  the  industry,""  said  Grant  Dean,  chair  of  the  interactive  committee.  Categories  include  interactive  TV,  film,  digital  TV,  mobile  phones  and  music.  Shaun  of  the  Dead,  Oasis'  Definitely  Maybe,  Really  Bend  It  Like  Beckham,  The  Chaplin  Collection  and  The  Day  Today  will  battle  it  out  in  the  DVD  category.  |||    ITV's  Great  British  Spelling  Test  takes  on  the  BBC's  Olympics  and  Spooks  Interactive  for  the  interactive  TV  award.  And  the  Guardian  takes  three  of  a  possible  five  nominations  in  the  news  and  sport  category  for  its  website  coverage  of  Euro  2004,  the  Tour  de  France  and  the  US  elections.  The  BBC's  iCan  site  is  up  for  the  technical  and  social  innovation  award  alongside  the  likes  of  Nottingham  University's  Uncle  Roy  All  Around  You.  In  2002,  the  British  Academy  of  Film  and  Television  decided  to  split  the  awards  into  separate  games  and  interactive  ceremonies,  to  fully  cover  the  range  of  innovation  outside  the  gaming  industry."

""Godzilla  should  thank  you  for  this  historical  and  monumental  star,""  said  Final  Wars  producer  Shogo  Tomiyama.  ""But  unfortunately,  he  cannot  speak  English,""  he  added.  Hollywood's  honorary  mayor,  Johnny  Grant,  said:  ""I  do  hereby  proclaim  this  Godzilla  Day  in  Hollywood.  |||    ""He's  loose,  he's  wild,  and  I'm  getting  the  hell  out  of  here,""  he  added.  The  premiere  of  Godzilla:  Final  Wars  at  Grauman's  Chinese  Theatre  followed  the  ceremony  on  Hollywood  Boulevard.  The  monster  was  joined  by  co-stars  including  Japanese  pop  star  and  actor  Masahiro  Matsuoka.  Director  Ryuhei  Kitamura  said  it  may  not  be  Godzilla's  final  outing,  as  it  has  been  billed.  ""That's  what  the  producers  say.  But  the  producer's  a  liar,""  he  said.  ""[Godzilla's]  been  working  for  the  last  50  years.  So,  I  think  Godzilla  just  deserves  a  vacation.""  And  producer  Shogo  Tomiyama  added:  ""So  long  as  Godzilla  can  fascinate  people,  I  believe  he  will  be  resurrected  by  new  generations  of  filmmakers  in  the  future.""  Godzilla  first  appeared  in  1954  as  a  prehistoric  lizard  woken  by  atomic  bomb  tests." 

2	"Fox  attacks  Blair's  Tory  'lies'  |||    Tony  Blair  lied  when  he  took  the  UK  to  war  so  has  no  qualms  about  lying  in  the  election  campaign,  say  the  Tories.  |||    Tory  co-chairman  Liam  Fox  was  speaking  after  Mr  Blair  told  Labour  members  the  Tories  offered  a  ""hard  right  agenda"".  Dr  Fox  told  BBC  Radio:  ""If  you  are  willing  to  lie  about  the  reasons  for  going  to  war,  I  guess  you  are  going  to  lie  about  anything  at  all.""  He  would  not  discuss  reports  the  party  repaid  £500,000  to  Lord  Ashcroft  after  he  predicted  an  election  defeat.  |||    The  prime  minister  ratcheted  up  Labour's  pre-election  campaigning  at  the  weekend  with  a  helicopter  tour  of  the  country  and  his  speech  at  the  party's  spring  conference.  He  insisted  he  did  not  know  the  poll  date,  but  it  is  widely  expected  to  be  5  May.  |||    In  what  was  seen  as  a  highly  personal  speech  in  Gateshead  on  Sunday,  Mr  Blair  said:  ""I  have  the  same  passion  and  hunger  as  when  I  first  walked  through  the  door  of  10  Downing  Street.""  He  described  his  relationship  with  the  public  as  starting  euphoric,  then  struggling  to  live  up  to  the  expectations,  and  reaching  the  point  of  raised  voices  and  ""throwing  crockery"".  He  warned  his  supporters  against  complacency,  saying:  ""It's  a  fight  for  the  future  of  our  country,  it's  a  fight  that  for  Britain  and  the  people  of  Britain  we  have  to  win.""  |||    Mr  Blair  said  that  whether  the  public  chose  Michael  Howard  or  Mr  Kennedy,  it  would  result  in  ""a  Tory  government  not  a  Labour  government  and  a  country  that  goes  back  and  does  not  move  forward"".  Dr  Fox  accused  Mr  Blair  and  other  Cabinet  ministers  of  telling  lies  about  their  opponents'  policies  and  then  attacking  the  lies.  ""What  we  learned  at  the  weekend  is  what  Labour  tactics  are  going  to  be  and  it's  going  to  be  fear  and  smear,""  he  told  BBC  News.  The  Tory  co-chairman  attacked  Labour's  six  new  pledges  as  ""vacuous""  and  said  Mr  Blair  was  very  worried  voters  would  take  revenge  for  his  failure  to  deliver.  Dr  Fox  refused  to  discuss  weekend  newspaper  reports  that  the  party  had  repaid  £500,000  to  former  Tory  Treasurer  Lord  Ashcroft  after  he  said  the  party  could  not  win  the  election.  ""We  repay  loans  when  they  are  due  but  do  not  comment  to  individual  financial  matters,""  he  said,  insisting  he  enjoyed  a  ""warm  and  constructive""  relationship  to  Lord  Ashcroft.  |||    Meanwhile  Lib  Dem  leader  Charles  Kennedy  is  expected  to  attack  Mr  Blair's  words  as  he  begins  a  nationwide  tour  on  Monday.  Mr  Kennedy  is  accelerating  Lib  Dem  election  preparations  this  week  as  he  visits  Manchester,  Liverpool,  Leicester,  Somerset,  Basingstoke,  Shrewsbury,  Dorset  and  Torbay.  He  said:  ""This  is  three-party  politics.  In  the  northern  cities,  the  contest  is  between  Labour  and  the  Liberal  Democrats.  ""In  southern  and  rural  seats  -  especially  in  the  South  West  -  the  principal  contenders  are  the  Liberal  Democrats  and  the  Conservatives,  who  are  out  of  the  running  in  Scotland  and  Wales.""  The  Lib  Dems  accuse  Mr  Blair  of  making  a  ""touchy-feely""  speech  to  Labour  delegates  which  will  not  help  him  regain  public  trust."

However,  Nestle's  profits  margins  were  helped  by  a  strong  performance  in  the  Americas  and  China.  Nestle  is  to  raise  its  dividend  by  11%  after  paying  back  some  of  its  debt.  |||    Nestle  said  that  the  strength  of  the  Swiss  franc  against  the  US  dollar,  the  disposal  of  businesses  and  challenging  trading  conditions  in  Europe  all  dented  sales.  A  poor  summer  across  the  continent  -  in  contrast  to  the  prolonged  heat  wave  in  2003  -  ""severely  affected""  demand  for  ice  cream.  Sales  of  bottled  water  also  fell,  although  chocolate,  coffee,  frozen  goods  and  petcare  products  performed  better.  |||    Elsewhere,  Nestle  said  it  had  enjoyed  an  ""exceptional""  year  in  North  America,  outperforming  the  market  in  terms  of  sales  growth.  Nestle  added  that  it  had  performed  strongly  in  Africa  and  Asia  despite  the  impact  of  high  oil  prices  and  political  instability.  Nestle's  total  earnings  before  interest  remained  broadly  flat  over  the  past  year,  despite  the  company  managing  to  boost  profit  margins.  As  well  as  increasing  its  dividend,  Nestle  plans  to  buy  back  shares  worth  1bn  Swiss  francs  ($861m;  £451m).  Looking  forward,  Nestle  forecasts  organic  earnings  growth  of  about  5%  in  2005,  although  it  warned  that  trading  would  remain  just  as  competitive.  |||    Uncertainty  remains  over  the  future  of  Perrier,  the  iconic  French  mineral  water  owned  by  Nestle.  Perrier  has  been  locked  in  a  long-standing  dispute  with  unions  about  productivity  levels  at  the  business,  which  has  lead  Nestle  to  consider  selling  the  firm.  ""The  option  of  selling  is  Perrier  is  still  on  the  table,""  chief  executive  Peter  Brabeck-Letmathe  confirmed  on  Thursday."

Also  in  the  running  for  a  clutch  of  awards  are  My  Summer  of  Love  and  the  stalker  drama  Enduring  Love.  The  winners  will  be  announced  at  a  ceremony  in  London  on  30  November.  The  winners  of  the  awards  will  be  chosen  by  a  jury  chaired  by  Cold  Mountain  director  Anthony  Minghella  and  including  actresses  Cate  Blanchett  and  Helena  Bonham-Carter.  |||    The  awards,  which  recognise  independent  film-making  in  Britain,  were  established  seven  years  ago.  ""This  year's  nominees  reflect  the  growing  strength  and  diversity  of  British  independent  filmmaking,""  said  BIFA  founder  and  director  Elliot  Grove.  Commenting  on  the  diversity  of  the  nominated  films,  he  added:  ""Our  selection  committee  had  a  harder  time  than  ever  narrowing  down  the  field.""  |||    Joining  Vera  Drake  and  Dead  Man's  Shoes  in  the  running  for  best  film  are  My  Summer  of  Love,  climbing  documentary  Touching  the  Void  and  zombie  comedy  Shaun  of  the  Dead.  Geoffrey  Rush  wins  a  best  actor  nomination  for  his  role  as  Peter  Sellers  in  the  recent  biopic  The  Life  &  Death  of  Peter  Sellers.  |||    The  Australian  star  faces  competition  from  Daniel  Craig  (Enduring  Love),  Phil  Davis  (Vera  Drake),  Ian  Hart  (Blind  Fight)  and  Dead  Man's  Shoes'  star  Paddy  Considine.  Considine  is  also  nominated  for  a  best  supporting  actor  award  for  My  Summer  of  Love.  A  rare  US  nominee,  Scarlett  Johansson,  is  among  this  year's  best  actress  contenders  for  her  role  in  Girl  with  a  Pearl  Earring.  |||    Fellow  nominees  include  Imelda  Staunton  (Vera  Drake),  Natalie  Press  (My  Summer  of  Love),  Anne  Reid  (The  Mother)  and  Eva  Birthistle  (Ae  Fond  Kiss...  ).  Shane  Meadows  and  Kevin  McDonald,  both  former  winners  of  the  Douglas  Hickox  Award  (for  Best  Directorial  Debut)  won  best  director  nominations.  Seasoned  film-makers  Roger  Michell,  Mike  Leigh  and  Pavel  Pavlikowsky  challenge  them  to  the  award.  Harry  Potter  author  JK  Rowling  will  receive  a  special  award  for  her  contribution  to  the  industry."

Smith  has  yet  to  decide  the  line-up  for  Meltdown,  which  begins  on  11  June.  ""I  want  to  touch  on  all  aspects  of  our  culture,  perhaps  with  readings  from  Genet,  and  I  have  an  idea  for  Jeremy  Irons  to  read  Proust,""  she  said.  |||    The  58-year-old  US  singer  of  Because  the  Night  told  The  Observer  newspaper  that  the  festival  would  be  her  response  to  these  ""material,  exploitative  and  greedy  times"".  ""It  is  important  we  explore  the  new,  but  we  should  also  salute  the  best  art  there  is,  aesthetically  and  spiritually,""  she  said.  Last  year's  Meltdown  festival,  directed  by  the  ex-Smiths  star  Morrissey,  included  appearances  by  singer  Jane  Birkin,  Nancy  Sinatra  and  playwright  Alan  Bennett.  He  also  persuaded  punk  band  The  New  York  Dolls  to  reform  for  a  reunion  show." 

0	"Iraq  and  Afghanistan  in  WTO  talks  |||    The  World  Trade  Organisation  (WTO)  is  to  hold  membership  talks  with  both  Iraq  and  Afghanistan.  |||    But  Iran's  bid  to  join  the  trade  body  has  been  refused  after  the  US  blocked  its  application  for  the  21st  time.  The  countries  stand  to  reap  huge  benefits  from  membership  of  the  group,  whose  purpose  is  to  promote  free  trade.  Joining,  however,  is  a  lengthy  process.  China's  admission  in  2001  took  15  years  and  talks  with  Russia  and  Saudi  Arabia  have  been  taking  place  for  10  years.  Membership  of  the  Geneva-based  WTO  helps  guarantee  a  country's  goods  receives  equal  treatment  in  the  markets  of  other  member  states  -  a  policy  which  has  seen  it  become  closely  associated  with  globalisation.  |||    Iraq's  Trade  Minister  Mohammed  Mustafa  al-Jibouri  welcomed  the  move,  describing  it  as  significant  as  November's  decision  by  the  Paris  Club  of  creditor  nations  to  write  off  80%  of  the  country's  debts.  Assad  Omar,  Afghanistan's  envoy  to  the  United  Nations  in  Geneva,  said  accession  would  contribute  to  ""regional  prosperity  and  global  security"".  There  are  now  27  countries  seeking  membership  of  the  WTO.  Prospective  members  need  to  enter  into  negotiations  with  potential  trading  countries  and  change  domestic  laws  to  bring  them  in  line  with  WTO  regulations.  Before  the  process  gets  under  way,  all  148  WTO  members  must  give  their  backing  to  applicant  countries.  The  US  said  it  could  not  approve  Iran's  application  because  it  is  currently  reviewing  relations.  But  several  nations  criticised  the  approach,  and  European  Union  ambassador  to  the  WTO,  Carlo  Trojan,  said  Iran's  application  ""must  be  treated  independently  of  political  issues""." 

2	"Kelly  trails  new  discipline  power  |||    Teachers  could  get  more  powers  to  remove  unruly  pupils  from  classes  under  a  ""zero  tolerance""  drive,  Education  Secretary  Ruth  Kelly  has  suggested.  |||    Ms  Kelly  told  the  BBC  progress  had  been  made  against  severely  disruptive  children  but  parents  were  still  worried  about  lower  level  problems.  The  minister  also  confirmed  she  received  ""spiritual  support""  from  the  Catholic  movement  Opus  Dei.  But  she  denied  her  faith  meant  she  would  refuse  key  government  jobs.  |||    The  Conservatives  have  made  school  discipline  one  of  their  five  priority  areas  in  the  run-up  to  the  next  general  election.  Ms  Kelly  is  expected  to  announce  her  plans  on  the  issue  in  the  next  fortnight.  She  told  BBC  One's  Breakfast  with  Frost:  ""It  is  really  important  to  support  head  teachers  and  teachers  in  tackling  disruption  in  the  classroom.  ""We  have  made  huge  progress  on  the  really  difficult  cases,  the  pupils  who  have  severely  disruptive  behaviour.  |||    ""But  quite  rightly  what  teachers  are  concerned  about  and  what  parents  are  concerned  about  is  that  this  lower  level  disruption  that  goes  on  in  the  classroom  now  is  tackled.  ""I  would  like  to  see  the  teacher  being  able  to  remove  disruptive  children  from  the  classroom  completely  and  have  either  alternative  provision  within  the  school  or  indeed  off  the  school  and  may  be  working  together  with  other  schools  in  a  particular  area  to  provide  that  provision.""  It  is  thought  the  plans  may  distinguish  between  excluding  pupils  from  schools  and  taking  them  out  of  mainstream  classes.  Head  teachers  can  currently  exclude  pupils  who  commit  or  threaten  violence  in  school,  who  sexually  abuse  pupils  or  other  people,  who  sell  illegal  drugs  or  who  have  persistent  and  malicious  disruptive  behaviour.  Ms  Kelly  entered  the  Cabinet  last  month  in  the  reshuffle  forced  by  the  resignation  of  the  then  Home  Secretary  David  Blunkett.  Her  links  to  Opus  Dei,  which  means  ""Work  of  God""  in  Latin,  have  provoked  controversy.  |||    Critics  say  the  organisation,  which  adheres  strictly  to  Catholic  teachings,  is  secretive  and  elitist  but  its  members  reject  such  claims.  Asked  if  she  was  a  member  of  the  group,  Ms  Kelly  said:  ""I  do  have  spiritual  support  from  Opus  Dei  and  that  is  right.  ""But  those  are  private  spiritual  matters  and  I'm  sure  you'll  respect  that  politicians  are  entitled  to  a  private  life.""  She  categorically  denied  reports  that  her  beliefs  on  issues  such  as  contraception  would  make  her  refuse  to  serve  as  a  health  or  international  development  minister.  Her  collective  responsibility  as  a  Cabinet  minister  meant  she  also  took  responsibility  for  policies  in  those  areas,  she  argued.  |||    The  government  has  yet  to  issue  its  official  response  to  the  Tomlinson  review,  which  recommended  absorbing  existing  exam  qualifications  into  a  diploma.  Ms  Kelly  said  reforms  should  build  on  GCSEs  and  A-levels.  Her  comments  did  not  impress  Tory  shadow  education  secretary  Tim  Collins.  ""Ruth  Kelly  wants  to  ditch  the  Tomlinson  report  on  exam  structures  but  has  absolutely  no  idea  what  to  put  in  its  place,""  he  said.  ""She  also  talks  of  improving  discipline  but  cannot  make  her  mind  up  how.  This  is  an  all  talk  agenda  that  lets  down  children,  teachers  and  parents.""" 

2	"Guantanamo  four  free  in  weeks  |||    All  four  Britons  held  by  the  US  in  Guantanamo  Bay  will  be  returned  to  the  UK  within  weeks,  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw  told  the  Commons  on  Tuesday.  |||    Moazzam  Begg,  from  Birmingham,  and  Martin  Mubanga,  Richard  Belmar  and  Feroz  Abbasi,  from  London,  have  been  held  by  the  US  for  almost  three  years.  They  were  detained  in  the  Cuban  camp  as  part  of  the  US-led  ""war  on  terror"".  Mr  Straw  said  the  US  had  agreed  to  release  the  four  after  ""intensive  and  complex  discussions""  over  security.  He  said  the  government  had  been  negotiating  the  return  of  the  detainees  since  2003.  All  four  families  have  been  informed  of  their  return  and  have  been  involved  in  regular  discussions  with  the  government,  Mr  Straw  said.  |||    But  he  added:  ""Once  they  are  back  in  the  UK,  the  police  will  consider  whether  to  arrest  them  under  the  Terrorism  Act  2000  for  questioning  in  connection  with  possible  terrorist  activity.""  The  shadow  foreign  secretary,  Michael  Ancram,  welcomed  the  return  of  the  four  detainees.  But  he  said  there  were  still  ""serious  questions""  both  over  the  possible  threat  the  four  pose  to  the  UK,  and  the  treatment  they  received  while  detained.  Liberal  Democrat  foreign  affairs  spokesman  Sir  Menzies  Campbell  said  the  four  had  been  rescued  from  a  ""legal  no-man's  land"".  ""Their  civil  rights  were  systematically  and  deliberately  abused  and  they  were  denied  due  process.""  |||    Azmat  Begg,  father  of  Moazzam,  thanked  his  lawyers  and  the  British  people  for  the  support  he  had  received  while  campaigning  for  his  son's  release.  He  added:  ""If  they  have  done  something  wrong,  of  course  they  should  be  punished,  but  if  they  haven't,  they  shouldn't  have  been  there.""  Lawyer  Louise  Christian,  who  represents  Mr  Abbasi  and  Mr  Mubanga,  said  the  government  should  have  acted  sooner.  She  said:  ""They  should  at  the  outset  have  said  quite  clearly  to  the  American  government  that  they  were  behaving  in  breach  of  international  law  and  that  the  British  government  wanted  no  part  of  it  and  wanted  Guantanamo  Bay  shut  down.  ""They  didn't  do  that.  They  colluded  with  it.""  Moazzam  Begg's  Labour  MP  Roger  Godsiff  welcomed  his  release,  but  said  questions  remained  unanswered,  particularly  about  charges.  Asked  about  possible  damages  Mr  Begg  and  the  other  detainees  could  bring  against  the  US,  Mr  Godsiff  said:  ""People  get  released  from  prison  when  it's  found  that  their  prosecution  was  unsustainable  and  they  are  quite  rightly  awarded  sizeable  sums  of  money.  ""I  don't  see  any  difference  in  this  case.""  Human  rights  campaigners  have  been  outraged  at  the  treatment  of  the  detainees  in  Cuba.  Amnesty  International  has  called  Camp  Delta  a  ""major  human-rights  scandal""  and  an  ""icon  of  lawlessness"".  Both  Amnesty  and  the  lobby  group  Guantanamo  Human  Rights  Commission  described  the  release  as  ""long  overdue"".  Civil  rights  group  Liberty  said  it  was  ""delighted""  but  called  on  the  government  to  release  men  indefinitely  detained  in  the  UK  without  charge  or  trial.  |||    Director  Shami  Chakrabarti  called  on  the  government  to  ""practise  what  it  preaches""  and  either  free  or  charge  12  detainees  at  Belmarsh  and  Woodhill  prisons.  Law  Lords  ruled  last  month  that  the  12  were  being  held  in  contravention  of  human  rights  laws  but  they  are  still  behind  bars.  The  US  has  also  announced  that  48-year-old  Australian  Mamdouh  Habib,  previously  accused  of  terrorist  offences,  will  be  released  without  charge  from  Camp  Delta.  Five  British  detainees  released  from  Guantanamo  in  March  last  year  were  questioned  by  UK  police  before  being  released  without  charge." 

0	"Bush  budget  seeks  deep  cutbacks  |||    President  Bush  has  presented  his  2006  budget,  cutting  domestic  spending  in  a  bid  to  lower  a  record  deficit  projected  to  peak  at  $427bn  (£230bn)  this  year.  |||    The  $2.58  trillion  (£1.38  trillion)  budget  submitted  to  Congress  affects  150  domestic  programmes  from  farming  to  the  environment,  education  and  health.  But  foreign  aid  is  due  to  rise  by  10%,  with  more  money  to  treat  HIV/Aids  and  reward  economic  and  political  reform.  Military  spending  is  also  set  to  rise  by  4.8%,  to  reach  $419.3bn.  The  budget  does  not  include  the  cost  of  running  military  operations  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan,  for  which  the  administration  is  expected  to  seek  an  extra  $80bn  from  Congress  later  this  year.  |||    Congress  will  spend  several  months  debating  George  W  Bush's  proposal.  |||    The  state  department's  planned  budget  would  rise  to  just  under  $23bn  -  a  fraction  of  the  defence  department's  request  -  including  almost  $6bn  to  assist  US  allies  in  the  ""war  on  terror"".  However,  the  administration  is  keen  to  highlight  its  global  effort  to  tackle  HIV/Aids,  the  BBC's  Jonathan  Beale  reports,  and  planned  spending  would  almost  double  to  $3bn,  with  much  of  that  money  going  to  African  nations.  Mr  Bush  also  wants  to  increase  the  amount  given  to  poorer  countries  through  his  Millennium  Challenge  Corporation.  The  scheme  has  been  set  up  to  reward  developing  countries  that  embrace  what  the  US  considers  to  be  good  governance  and  sound  policies.  Yet  Mr  Bush's  proposed  spending  of  $3bn  on  that  project  is  well  below  his  initial  promise  of  $5bn.  |||    A  key  spending  line  missing  from  proposals  is  the  cost  of  funding  the  administration's  proposed  radical  overhaul  of  Social  Security,  the  pensions  programme  on  which  many  Americans  rely  for  their  retirement  income.  |||    Some  experts  believe  this  could  require  borrowing  of  up  to  $4.5  trillion  over  a  20-year  period.  Neither  does  the  budget  include  any  cash  to  purchase  crude  oil  for  the  US  emergency  petroleum  stockpile.  Concern  over  the  level  of  the  reserve,  created  in  1970s,  has  led  to  rises  in  oil  prices  over  the  past  year.  The  Bush  administration  will  instead  continue  to  fill  the  reserve  by  taking  oil  -  rather  than  cash  -  from  energy  companies  that  drill  under  federal  leases.  |||    The  outline  proposes  reductions  in  budgets  at  12  out  of  23  government  agencies  including  cuts  of  9.6%  at  Agriculture  and  5.6%  at  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency.  The  spending  plan  for  the  year  beginning  1  October  is  banking  on  a  healthy  US  economy  to  boost  government  income  by  6.1%  to  $2.18  trillion.  Spending  is  forecast  to  grow  by  3.5%  to  $2.57  trillion.  But  the  budget  is  still  the  tightest  yet  under  Mr  Bush's  presidency.  ""In  order  to  sustain  our  economic  expansion,  we  must  continue  pro-growth  policies  and  enforce  even  greater  spending  restraint  across  federal  government,""  Mr  Bush  said  in  his  budget  message  to  Congress.  Mr  Bush  has  promised  to  halve  the  US's  massive  budget  deficit  within  five  years.  The  deficit,  partly  the  result  of  massive  tax  cuts  early  in  Mr  Bush's  presidency,  has  been  a  key  factor  in  pushing  the  US  dollar  lower.  The  independent  Congressional  Budget  Office  estimates  that  the  shortfall  could  shrink  to  little  more  than  $200bn  by  2009,  returning  to  the  surpluses  seen  in  the  late  1990s  by  2012.  But  its  estimates  depend  on  the  tax  cuts  not  being  made  permanent,  in  line  with  the  promise  when  they  were  passed  that  they  would  ""sunset"",  or  disappear,  in  2010.  Most  Republicans,  however,  want  them  to  stay  in  place.  And  the  figures  also  rely  on  the  ""Social  Security  trust  fund""  -  the  money  set  aside  to  cover  the  swelling  costs  of  retirement  pensions  -  being  offset  against  the  main  budget  deficit."

'  |||    Day-Lewis  has  competed  four  times  at  the  Berlin  Film  Festival,  with  films  In  The  Name  Of  The  Father  (1994),  The  Crucible  (1997),  The  Boxer  (1998)  and  Martin  Scorsese's  Gangs  Of  New  York  (2003).  The  festival  praises  him  for  his  ""sensational  start""  with  roles  in  My  Beautiful  Launderette  and  costume  classic  A  Room  With  A  View,  and  a  ""great  number  of  celebrated  roles""  in  subsequent  productions.  Japan's  oldest  film  studio  will  also  be  honoured  along  with  Day-Lewis.  Shochiku  film  studios,  which  was  founded  110  years  ago,  will  become  the  first  cinematic  institution  to  receive  the  Berlinale  Camera  award.  Famous  Japanese  directors  including  Akira  Hurosawa  have  had  films  produced  at  the  studio."

Its  comments  came  after  the  industry  minister  of  India's  Andhra  Pradesh  state  said  a  team  of  VW  officials  were  due  to  visit  to  discuss  the  plans.  B.  Satyanarayana  said  he  expected  VW  to  co-sign  a  memorandum  of  agreement.  Several  foreign  carmakers,  including  Hyundai,  Toyota,  Suzuki  and  Ford,  already  have  Indian  production  facilities  to  meet  demand  for  automobiles  in  Asia's  fourth-largest  economy.  VW's  proposed  plant  would  be  set  up  in  the  port  city  of  Visakhapatnam  on  India's  eastern  coast.  An  Andhra  Pradesh  official  added  that  VW  had  already  approved  a  factory  site  measuring  250  acres." 

1	"DJ  double  act  revamp  chart  show  |||    DJ  duo  JK  and  Joel  are  taking  over  BBC  Radio  1's  flagship  chart  show  on  Sunday,  adding  showbiz  news,  celebrity  interviews  and  between-song  banter.  |||    They  hope  to  boost  ratings  for  the  long-running  show,  which  has  been  overtaken  in  popularity  by  independent  radio's  Hit  40  UK  rundown.  ""Radio  1's  chart  show  is  an  institution  and  remains  the  station's  single  most  popular  show,""  says  JK,  also  known  as  Jason  King.  ""For  years  people  have  been  tuning  in  at  four  o'clock  with  their  tape  recorders  ready  to  record  their  favourite  tunes.  Not  that  I  ever  did  that.  ""But  things  have  moved  on  a  lot  now  so  it  was  time  for  a  change.""  |||    That  change  involved  ejecting  previous  host  Wes  Butters  and  relocating  King  and  DJ  partner  Joel  Ross  from  their  weekend  afternoon  Radio  1  slot.  The  pair  have  worked  together  for  a  decade  -  meeting  on  Viking  Radio  in  Hull  before  moving  to  Manchester  station  Key  103  and  winning  two  Sony  Radio  awards.  They  also  presented  gadget  series  Playboyz  and  car  show  Motor  Maniacs  for  cable  TV  channel  Granada  Men  and  Motors,  and  Pure  Soap  on  BBC  Three.  |||    On  the  revamped  chart  show  their  cheeky,  laddish  banter  will  punctuate  star  interviews  and  competitions,  film  and  DVD  charts  plus  a  look  at  future  single  releases,  in  addition  to  the  singles  chart  itself.  ""The  chart  rundown  is  no  longer  the  only  point  of  the  programme,""  says  Ross.  ""The  show  used  to  be  the  only  way  to  discover  who  was  in  the  Top  40.  Now  you  can  just  click  on  the  internet  to  find  that  out,  so  the  show  has  plenty  of  extra  items  too.""  The  show's  reduced  reliance  upon  the  Top  40  also  reflects  the  fact  that  music  fans  are  now  more  likely  to  download  songs  in  digital  format  rather  than  buy  them  on  compact  disc,  vinyl  or  cassette.  |||    ""I  personally  buy  downloads  rather  than  CD  singles,""  says  27-year-old  Ross.  ""Even  my  grandma  can  download  songs  now.  JK  is  still  struggling  with  the  technology,  though.""  ""But  it's  premature  for  people  to  say  that  the  singles  chart  is  dead,""  Ross  adds.  ""While  sales  of  singles  on  traditional  formats  are  down,  interest  in  songs  has  been  revived  by  download  sales,  which  will  be  incorporated  into  our  main  chart  rundown  from  April.  ""Music  fans  still  want  to  know  what  is  the  most  popular  song  of  the  week.""  |||    Ross  will  be  plumping  for  chart  success  from  rapper  Verbalicious  and  the  Stereophonics  on  Sunday,  while  King  is  more  of  an  R&B  and  dance  music  fan.  ""So  listeners  will  get  the  advantage  of  both  our  music  tastes,""  says  King,  30,  who  describes  outgoing  host  Butters  as  ""an  extremely  professional  and  competent  broadcaster"".  |||    ""The  advantage  Joel  and  I  have  is  that  we're  a  double  act,  with  a  rapport  between  us  that  makes  the  show  much  more  interactive,""  King  says.  ""Wes  has  a  great  broadcasting  career  ahead  of  him.  And  if  not,  I  could  always  use  a  cleaner,""  he  jokes.  Ross  says  the  pair  have  done  their  best  to  ignore  the  weight  of  expectation  placed  upon  the  revamped  show.  ""Other  people  can  worry  about  that,  we  are  going  to  continue  doing  what  we  do  well,""  he  says.  ""At  the  end  of  the  day  this  is  a  radio  show  that  is  meant  to  be  entertaining.  Nobody  died.""" 

2	"Labour  attacked  on  Howard  poster  |||    Labour  has  been  accused  of  using  anti-Semitic  images  in  posters  which  critics  claim  depict  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  as  Fagin.  |||    The  poster  shows  Mr  Howard  hypnotising  people  with  a  pocket  watch,  saying:  ""I  can  spend  the  same  money  twice.""  The  image  prompted  concern  from  the  editor  of  the  Jewish  Chronicle  but  Labour  insists  it  is  simply  anti-Tory.  Labour  later  took  the  image  off  its  website,  saying  an  alternative  idea  had  proved  more  popular  with  party  members.  The  party  will  now  use  focus  groups  to  test  a  poster  showing  Mr  Howard  and  shadow  chancellor  Oliver  Letwin  with  a  blackboard  reading:  ""2+2=5"".  |||    The  hypnotism  poster  has  been  compared  to  the  portrayal  of  the  Dickens  character  Fagin  in  the  stage  version  of  the  musical  Oliver!  There  was  controversy  over  another  poster  choice  offered  to  Labour  members.  It  showed  Mr  Howard  and  Mr  Letwin  -  who  are  both  Jewish  -  as  flying  pigs.  Mr  Howard  did  not  comment  on  the  anti-Semitism  claims  when  asked  about  the  poster  on  Monday.  Instead,  he  pointed  to  how  Tony  Blair  had  in  1997  complained  about  ""personalised  abusive  campaigning"".  Mr  Howard  told  Greater  Manchester  Radio:  ""It  is  such  a  pity  that  Mr  Blair  doesn't  practise  what  he  preaches.""  |||    Jewish  Chronicle  editor  Ned  Temko  said  there  had  been  a  mixed  reaction  to  the  first  poster  but  e-mails  from  Jewish  Chronicle  readers  showed  deeper  concern  about  the  hypnotism  image.  ""Shylock  and  Fagin  are  inextricably  linked  to  notions  of  centuries-old  prejudice,""  he  told  BBC  Radio  4's  World  At  One.  ""Whatever  the  idea  is,  I  think  it's  a  difficult  exercise  to  use  images  like  that  and  to  argue  that  you  can  divorce  them  from  their  historical  context  or  meaning.""  Mr  Temko  said  he  blamed  ""cock-up  not  conspiracy"",  saying  he  did  not  detect  inherent  anti-Semitism  in  any  of  the  parties'  election  campaigns.  |||    The  poster  is  among  one  of  a  series  of  ideas  shown  to  Labour  members,  who  have  been  asked  to  choose  which  one  should  be  used  ahead  of  the  election.  Labour  MP  Louise  Ellman  said  the  hypnotism  image  was  insensitive  but  urged  people  not  to  rush  to  call  things  anti-Semitic  when  they  only  challenged  Tory  economic  policies.  Labour  campaign  spokesman  Fraser  Kemp  said  the  poster  had  been  misunderstood.  The  image  simply  portrayed  Mr  Howard  as  a  hypnotist,  he  argued.  ""Concern  has  been  expressed  and  clearly  we  have  to  take  those  views  on  board  but  I  would  emphasise  that  if  you  see  the  posters,  the  common  theme...  is  that  the  Tories  are  trying  to  con  you.""  A  Labour  spokesman  later  said  the  timing  of  removing  the  controversial  image  from  the  party's  website  was  not  affected  by  the  row.  ""This  has  been  up  on  the  website  for  two  weeks  and  there  has  only  been  a  fuss  in  the  last  four  days  so  a  substantial  number  of  people  voted  before  there  was  any  fuss,""  he  said.  But  a  Conservative  spokeswoman  said:  ""This  poster  campaign  -  which  was  offensive  to  many  people  -  was  a  big  misjudgement  by  Labour's  campaign  team.""" 

0	"US  insurer  Marsh  cuts  2,500  jobs  |||    Up  to  2,500  jobs  are  to  go  at  US  insurance  broker  Marsh  &  McLennan  in  a  shake  up  following  bigger-than-expected  losses.  |||    The  insurer  said  the  cuts  were  part  of  a  cost-cutting  drive,  aimed  at  saving  millions  of  dollars.  Marsh  posted  a  $676m  (£352m)  loss  for  the  last  three  months  of  2004,  against  a  $375m  (£195.3m)  profit  a  year  before.  It  blamed  an  $850m  payout  to  settle  a  price-rigging  lawsuit,  brought  by  New  York  attorney  general  Elliot  Spitzer.  Under  the  settlement  announced  in  January,  Marsh  took  a  pre-tax  charge  of  $618m  in  the  October-to-December  quarter,  on  top  of  the  $232m  charge  from  the  previous  quarter.  ""Clearly  2004  was  the  most  difficult  year  in  MMC's  financial  history,""  Marsh  chief  executive  Michael  Cherkasky  said.  |||    An  ongoing  restructuring  drive  at  the  group  also  led  to  a  $337m  hit  in  the  fourth  quarter,  the  world's  biggest  insurer  said.  |||    Analysts  expect  its  latest  round  of  cuts  to  focus  on  its  brokerage  unit,  which  employs  40,000  staff.  The  latest  layoffs  will  take  the  total  number  of  jobs  to  go  at  the  firm  to  5,500  and  are  expected  to  lead  to  annual  savings  of  more  than  $375m.  As  part  of  its  efforts  to  cut  costs,  the  company  said  it  was  halving  its  dividend  payment  to  17  cents  a  shares  from  34  cents,  a  move  which  should  enable  it  to  save  $360m.  Looking  ahead,  Mr  Cherkasky  forecast  profitable  growth  for  the  year  ahead  ""with  an  operating  margin  in  the  upper-teens,  and  with  the  opportunity  for  further  margin  expansion"".  Meanwhile,  the  company  also  announced  it  would  spin-off  its  MMC  Capital  private  equity  unit,  which  manages  the  $3bn  Trident  Funds  operation,  to  a  group  of  employees.  Marsh  did  not  say  when  the  move  would  take  place,  but  said  it  had  signed  a  letter  of  intent.  |||    The  insurer  hit  the  headlines  in  October  last  year  when  it  faced  accusations  of  price  rigging.  New  York  Attorney  General  Elliot  Spitzer  sued  the  company,  accusing  it  of  receiving  illegal  payments  to  steer  clients  to  selected  firms  as  well  as  rigging  bids  and  fixing  prices.  In  January,  Marsh  agreed  to  pay  $850m  to  settle  the  suit  -  a  figure  in  line  with  the  placement  fees  it  collected  in  2003  -  and  agreed  to  change  its  business  practices.  In  February,  a  former  senior  executive  pleaded  guilty  to  criminal  charges  in  a  wide-ranging  probe  of  fraud  and  bid-rigging  in  the  insurance  industry.  In  January,  a  former  senior  vice  president  also  pleaded  guilty  to  criminal  charges  related  to  the  investigation.  In  an  effort  to  reform  its  business  practises,  Marsh  said  it  has  already  introduced  new  leadership,  new  compliance  procedures  and  new  ways  of  dealing  with  customers.  ""As  a  result,  we  are  ready  to  put  these  matters  behind  us  and  move  ahead  in  2005  to  restore  the  trust  our  clients  have  placed  in  us  and  to  rebuild  shareholder  value,""  Mr  Cherkasky  said." 

0	"HealthSouth  ex-boss  goes  on  trial  |||    The  former  head  of  US  medical  services  firm  HealthSouth  overstated  earnings  and  assets  to  boost  the  company's  share  price,  it  was  claimed  in  court.  |||    Richard  Scrushy,  52,  is  accused  of  ""directing""  a  $2.7bn  (£1.4bn)  accounting  fraud  at  the  company  he  co-founded  in  Alabama  in  1984.  Prosecutors  said  he  was  motivated  by  wealth  -  spending  about  $200m  between  1996  and  2002  while  earning  much  less.  Defence  lawyers  said  Mr  Scrushy  had  been  deceived  by  other  executives.  Several  former  HealthSouth  employees  have  already  pleaded  guilty  to  fraud  and  are  expected  to  give  evidence  against  Mr  Scrushy.  |||    ""We  will  present  evidence  that  Richard  Scrushy  knew  about  the  conspiracy,  that  he  participated  in  the  conspiracy  and  that  he  profited,""  prosecutor  Alice  Martin  told  the  court.  Mr  Scrushy  is  the  first  chief  executive  to  be  tried  for  breaching  the  Sarbanes  Oxley  Act  -  a  law  introduced  in  the  wake  of  the  Enron  and  WorldCom  frauds  which  obliges  corporate  bosses  to  vouch  for  the  accuracy  of  their  companies'  results.  Among  the  charges  he  faces  are  conspiracy  to  commit  fraud,  filing  false  statements  and  money  laundering.  After  federal  agents  raided  HealthSouth's  offices  in  March  2003,  the  company  said  none  of  its  past  financial  statements  could  be  relied  on.  The  firm  has  since  reorganised  its  board  and  management  team  and  currently  operates  about  1,400  health  clinics." 

2	"EU  China  arms  ban  'to  be  lifted'  |||    The  EU  embargo  on  arms  exports  to  China  is  likely  to  be  lifted  in  the  next  six  months  despite  US  objections,  UK  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw  has  said.  |||    The  15-year-old  ban  was  imposed  in  the  aftermath  of  China's  crackdown  on  protesters  in  Tiananmen  Square.  Mr  Straw  told  a  Commons  select  committee  human  rights  concerns  over  China  remained.  But  he  said  it  was  wrong  to  put  China  under  the  same  embargo  as  countries  such  as  Zimbabwe  and  Burma.  |||    In  December,  the  EU  pledged  to  work  towards  lifting  the  ban  but  said  it  was  not  ready  to  do  so  yet.  The  EU's  move  was  welcomed  at  the  time  by  Beijing,  which  described  the  embargo  as  a  ""product  of  the  Cold  War"".  German  Chancellor  Gerhard  Schroeder  and  French  President  Jacques  Chirac  have  repeatedly  called  for  the  embargo  to  be  lifted.  Britain  has  been  more  cautious  on  the  issue,  but  on  Wednesday  Mr  Straw  said  he  also  wanted  it  to  end.  ""I  have  long  understood  China's  argument,  that  to  lump  them  in  with,  say,  Burma  and  Zimbabwe  is  not  appropriate  and  I  don't  think  it  is,""  he  told  the  joint  committee  on  Strategic  Export  Controls.  He  said  ""it  is  more  likely  than  not""  that  the  ban  would  be  lifted  before  Britain  takes  over  the  presidency  of  the  EU  from  Luxembourg  in  July.  But  he  said  an  EU  code  of  conduct  would  prevent  an  increase  in  the  number  of  arms  being  exported  to  the  country.  ""If  it  is  lifted  we  will  end  up  with  as  effective  arms  controls  in  relation  to  China  as  we  have  now.""  |||    Mr  Straw  said  the  US  government  was  suspicious  of  ""the  motives  of  some  other  countries  within  the  EU""  in  wanting  the  ban  lifted.  But  he  said  many  of  Washington's  objections  were  based  on  a  ""lack  of  information  and  understanding""  of  how  export  control  guidelines  worked  in  EU  countries.  And  ""intense  discussions""  were  taking  place  with  US  officials  to  convince  them  it  was  the  right  thing  to  do.  Washington  is  thought  to  fear  it  would  lead  to  a  buying  spree  for  arms  that  could  be  used  by  China  to  threaten  its  diplomatic  rival  Taiwan.  US  officials  say  they  are  not  satisfied  the  mechanisms  in  the  EU  code  of  conduct  are  robust  enough  to  prevent  abuses.  US  Undersecretary  of  State  John  Bolton  is  meeting  British  officials  this  week  to  press  the  case  for  keeping  the  embargo."

The  KSE  index  closed  at  6709.93  -  an  overall  gain  of  nearly  400  points  in  the  first  two  trading  days  of  the  week.  Energy  and  telecommunication  stocks  performed  particularly  well,  recording  an  8%-10%  rise  since  Monday  morning.  |||    In  2002,  the  KSE  was  the  world's  best  performing  stock  market,  with  the  index  rising  112%.  |||    Pakistani  investors  are  expecting  the  KSE  to  repeat,  if  not  improve  on,  its  2002  performance.  Jubilant  investors  danced  on  the  streets  as  the  market  closed  for  the  day  on  Tuesday,  confident  that  the  boom  will  continue  at  least  until  the  public  holiday  on  22  January.  Others,  however,  who  had  stayed  out  fearing  an  imminent  collapse  because  of  prices  overheating,  continued  to  warn  that  the  ""bubble  may  burst  any  time"".  ""That's  rubbish,""  KSE  chairman  Yaseen  Lakhani  told  the  BBC  News  website.  ""Whenever  the  market  reflects  Pakistan's  true  economic  reality,  it  is  described  as  a  bubble.""  Mr  Lakhani  feels  that  the  market  has  risen  on  the  basis  of  solid  economic  growth  and  its  current  level  rests  on  sound  foundations.  |||    Market  analysts  are  inclined  to  agree  with  Mr  Lakhani,  arguing  that  there  are  a  number  of  major  factors  behind  the  KSE's  performance.  Analysts  argue  that  a  steady  improvement  in  Pakistan's  credit  ratings  by  international  credit  rating  agencies  has  finally  begun  to  register  in  the  market.  Standard  &  Poor's  upgraded  Pakistan  a  few  weeks  ago.  There  are  indications  of  yet  another  upgrade  by  the  end  of  February.  |||    Then,  say  analysts,  there  is  corporate  profitability  in  the  current  fiscal  year,  which  has  gone  up  by  27%  from  last  year.  ""Coupled  with  the  7%  GDP  growth  expected  by  June  this  year,  I  am  least  surprised  at  the  market's  performance,""  says  Mr  Lakhani.  One  leading  Karachi  broker  said  the  real  reasons  may  be  political.  ""If  you  file  a  $1.3  trillion  case  against  Saudi  money  after  9/11,  Arab  money  will  not  go  to  the  US  any  more.""  A  lot  of  Arab  money,  he  says,  has  already  gone  to  Malaysia  and  Indonesia.  Pakistanis  are  now  hoping  that  energy  and  telecoms,  two  of  the  strongest  sectors  in  Pakistan,  draw  some  of  the  Arab  money  to  the  KSE.  |||    Locally,  too,  say  analysts,  recent  political  developments  have  worked  to  the  market's  advantage.  |||    An  anti-Musharraf  campaign  threatened  by  the  MMA,  a  countrywide  alliance  of  religious  parties,  has  fizzled  out.  The  release  of  Asif  Zardari,  former  Prime  Minister  Benazir  Bhutto's  husband,  has  eased  political  tensions  between  the  military-backed  government  and  the  opposition  Pakistan  People's  Party.  Most  importantly,  say  analysts,  the  failure  of  talks  between  India  and  Pakistan  on  the  Baglihar  dam  in  Indian-administered  Kashmir  has  not  automatically  led  to  heightened  tensions.  This,  they  say,  indicates  that  neither  country  is  interested  in  raising  the  temperature  at  this  stage,  irrespective  of  the  state  of  their  disagreements.  The  market  is  abuzz  with  speculation  that  substantial  investment  may  now  start  to  flow  in  from  the  US,  a  country  seen  locally  as  deeply  interested  in  defusing  tensions  between  the  South  Asian  neighbours.  ""You  can  call  it  a  peace  dividend,""  smiles  one  broker.  ""Let  us  see  how  long  one  can  reap  its  benefits."""

In  2000,  EU  leaders  at  a  summit  in  Lisbon  pledged  the  European  economy  would  outstrip  that  of  the  US  by  2010.  Their  economic  targets  became  known  as  the  Lisbon  Agenda.  But  the  Commission  report  says  that,  in  most  EU  countries,  the  pace  of  economic  reform  has  been  too  slow,  and  fulfilling  the  Lisbon  ambitions  will  be  difficult  -  if  not  impossible.  |||    Only  the  UK,  Finland,  Belgium,  Denmark,  Ireland  and  the  Netherlands  have  actually  followed  up  policy  recommendations.  Among  the  biggest  laggards,  according  to  the  report,  are  Greece  and  Italy.  The  Lisbon  Agenda  set  out  to  increase  the  number  of  people  employed  in  Europe  by  encouraging  more  older  people  and  women  to  stay  in  the  workforce.  It  also  set  out  to  raise  the  amount  the  private  sector  spends  on  research  and  development,  while  bringing  about  greater  discipline  over  public  spending  and  debt  levels.  Combined  with  high  environmental  standards  and  efforts  to  level  the  playing  field  for  businesses  throughout  the  EU,  the  plan  was  for  Europe  to  become  the  world's  most  dynamic  economy  by  2010.  Next  week,  the  Commission  will  present  revised  proposals  to  meet  the  Lisbon  goals.  Many  people  expect  the  2010  target  to  be  quietly  dropped."

""The  impact  of  the  development  of  no-frills  airlines  is  being  felt  ever  more  strongly,""  said  chief  executive  Jean-Louis  Raymond.  Income  from  its  vehicle-carrying  shuttle  services  fell  7%,  although  15%  more  passengers  meant  a  2%  rise  in  railway  revenue.  |||    The  cross-Channel  truck  market  is  improving,  Eurotunnel  said,  but  warned  that  it  was  not  benefiting  since  much  of  the  traffic  was  in  containers  destined  for  ports.  The  passenger-only  trains  which  use  the  tunnel  are  run  by  a  separate  company,  Eurostar.  |||    Eurotunnel  is  still  struggling  with  debts  of  more  than  6bn  euros.  The  company  is  currently  kept  afloat  by  the  200-plus  banks  to  whom  it  owes  the  money.  A  shareholder  revolt  threw  out  the  old  board  in  2004.  But  the  BBC's  business  editor,  Jeff  Randall,  said  the  banks  could  yet  step  in  and  take  over  altogether.  ""At  the  moment  it  can't  even  service  the  interest  on  its  debt,""  he  said.  ""This  is  a  company  in  the  departure  lounge  of  life."""

The  concert  was  also  part  of  an  attempt  to  bring  a  broader  range  of  events  to  the  famous  venue.  Money  raised  will  go  to  the  Fondation  pour  l'Enfance  (Foundation  for  Childhood)  which  aims  to  rebuild  a  children's  shelter  in  Sri  Lanka.  Sir  Elton  played  hits  from  his  vast  back  catalogue  to  a  sell-out  crowd  which  included  former  French  president  Valery  Giscard  d'Estaing  and  his  wife  Anne-Aymone.  The  veteran  pop  star  played  piano  accompaniment  throughout  the  concert  which  lasted  for  three  hours  without  an  interval.  |||    He  told  the  crowd:  ""Throughout  the  years,  I've  done  a  lot  of  drugs  and  alcohol.  It's  true  that  I  was  a  nightmare,  impossible.  For  the  last  14  years  I've  been  normal.  Now  my  drug  is  called  David""  -  a  reference  to  David  Furnish,  his  partner.  The  crowd,  who  greeted  each  song  with  a  standing  ovation,  also  included  French  singer  Charles  Aznavour  and  British  ambassador  Sir  John  Holmes.  Sir  Elton  has  also  teamed  up  with  Phil  Collins  to  record  a  version  of  Eric  Clapton's  1991  hit  Tears  In  Heaven  to  raise  money  for  the  relief  fund.  A  release  date  has  yet  to  be  set  for  the  recording,  which  was  organised  by  Sharon  Osbourne."

The  move,  which  was  justified  on  national  security  grounds,  follows  an  earlier  vote  by  MPs  to  give  themselves  a  veto  over  foreign  investments.  Turkcell  said  the  decision  ""increases  the  risks""  attached  to  the  project.  Although  the  company's  statement  said  it  would  continue  to  monitor  developments,  observers  said  they  thought  Turkcell  was  set  to  pull  out  of  the  $3bn  deal.  ""The  possibility  of  carrying  out  this  project  is  next  to  zero,""  said  Atinc  Ozkan,  analyst  at  Finans  Investment  in  Istanbul.  If  Turkcell  does  back  out,  MTN  -  the  South  African  firm  which  lost  out  in  the  original  tender  -  may  well  be  back  in  the  running.  The  company  has  said  it  is  prepared  to  accept  a  minority  stake  if  Iran  will  award  it  the  mobile  deal.  |||    Turkcell's  mobile  deal  is  the  second  Turkish  investment  in  Iran  to  run  into  trouble.  Turkish-Austrian  consortium  TAV  was  chosen  to  build  and  run  Tehran's  new  Imam  Khomeini  International  Airport  -  but  the  army  closed  it  just  hours  after  it  opened  in  May  2004.  In  both  cases,  the  justification  has  been  national  security,  amid  allegations  that  the  Turkish  firms  are  too  close  to  Israel.  The  hardline  posture  taken  by  parliament,  which  is  dominated  by  religious  conservatives,  could  yet  impact  other  inward  investments."

It  also  acquired  67.7%  of  Hexal's  US  affiliate  Eon  Labs,  and  offered  to  buy  the  remaining  shares  for  $31  each.  Novartis  said  that  it  would  be  able  to  make  cost  savings  of  about  $200m  a  year  following  the  acquisitions.  Novartis'  shares  rose  1%  to  57.85  Swiss  francs  in  early  trading.  |||    The  deal  will  see  Novartis'  Sandoz  business  overtake  Israel's  Teva  Pharmaceuticals  as  the  world's  biggest  maker  of  generics.  Based  on  2004  figures  the  newly  merged  producer  would  have  sales  of  more  than  $5bn,  the  company  estimated.  Novartis  said  that  it  would  merge  a  number  of  departments,  adding  that  there  may  be  job  cuts.  |||    ""The  strong  growth  outlook  for  Sandoz,  which  will  create  jobs,  is  expected  to  partially  compensate  for  necessary  reductions  in  the  work  force,""  the  firm  said  in  a  statement.  Generic  drugs  are  chemically  identical  to  their  more  expensive  branded  rivals.  Producers  such  as  Sandoz  can  copy  the  branded  products  usually  after  their  patent  protection  expires  and  can  sell  them  more  cheaply  as  they  do  not  have  to  pay  research  and  development  cost.  |||    There  are  more  than  150  generic  drugmakers  worldwide  and  analysts  have  predicted  consolidation  in  a  market  that  they  call  fragmented.  However,  not  all  analysts  were  initially  convinced  about  the  deal.  ""This  is  a  very  expensive  acquisition,""  Birgit  Kuhlhoff,  from  Sal  Oppenheim  investment  bank,  told  Reuters.  ""I  find  it  strange  that  they  are  making  acquisitions  in  exactly  those  markets  where  they  suffered  price  pressure.""" 

2	"Green  fear  for  transport  ballot  |||    The  Green  Party  is  concerned  thousands  of  residents  may  not  be  able  to  vote  in  Edinburgh's  transport  referendum.  |||    Edinburgh  City  Council  is  to  ballot  constituents  on  proposals  to  introduce  congestion  charging  in  the  capital.  But  Green  MSP  Mark  Ballard  fears  people  not  on  the  council's  edited  electoral  register  may  miss  out.  Local  authorities  can  only  send  ballot  papers  to  those  on  the  edited  list  over  non-statutory  matters,  such  as  the  transport  referendum.  Therefore,  residents  who  have  exercised  their  right  to  have  their  details  left  off  the  list  could  miss  the  chance  to  vote.  |||    However,  there  is  still  time  for  those  who  are  not  on  the  list  to  contact  the  council  and  make  sure  they  are  sent  ballot  forms  ahead  of  February's  voting  deadline.  Mr  Ballard  said:  ""This  vote  will  set  the  future  of  transport  in  Edinburgh  for  decades  to  come.  ""It  is  therefore  vital  that  as  many  residents  as  possible  in  Edinburgh  City  and  the  surrounding  areas,  are  registered  to  vote  in  the  ballot.  ""Many  people  are  not  aware  that  they  may  miss  out  on  their  chance  to  have  a  say.  ""Everyone  involved  in  this  debate  -  both  for  and  against  -  wants  the  ballot  to  be  as  fair  and  representative  as  possible,  and  that  means  encouraging  people  to  take  part.""  The  ballot  will  ask  residents  to  vote  for  or  against  the  council's  proposed  congestion  charge  scheme  and  a  host  of  transport  improvements  to  be  funded  by  it.  The  outcome  of  the  referendum  will  be  known  next  month  after  the  ballot  forms  are  sent  out  and  returned  to  the  council.  Towards  the  end  of  February,  the  council  will  meet  to  decide  whether  to  proceed  with  an  application  to  Scottish  ministers  for  approval  for  its  planned  congestion  charging  scheme  and  the  other  parts  of  its  transport  package." 

2	"Plan  to  give  elderly  care  control  |||    Elderly  and  disabled  people  would  choose  how  their  own  budget  for  personal  care  was  spent  and  organised  under  government  plans.  |||    Ministers  say  elderly  and  disabled  people  themselves,  not  social  workers,  should  be  able  to  decide  on  their  care  and  stay  in  their  own  homes.  They  also  plan  a  supremo  for  adult  services  in  each  English  area  to  get  different  agencies  working  together.  But  the  government  shunned  opponents'  calls  for  free  long-term  care.  |||    There  are  1.7m  people  needing  care  in  England  and  ministers  suggest  the  number  could  quadruple  by  2050.  Monday's  consultation  paper  on  social  care  for  adults  in  England  is  aimed  at  ending  a  system  which  generates  dependency.  Health  Minister  Stephen  Ladyman  said:  ""This  document  is  the  antithesis  of  the  nanny  state.  |||    ""It's  about  taking  power  away  from  the  state  and  giving  it  to  individuals  and  saying  that  we  will  help  you  make  these  decisions  but  we  are  not  going  to  make  them  for  you  any  more.""  The  government  has  already  allowed  local  councils  to  give  people  money  so  they  can  pay  for  their  services  directly  but  take-up  of  the  scheme  has  been  ""disappointing"".  |||    Ministers  say  the  new  plans  would  make  direct  payments  simpler  and  try  to  counter  reluctance  in  some  local  councils  to  use  the  payments.  They  also  want  to  set  up  a  new  ""half-way  house""  where  social  workers  tell  people  how  much  money  is  available  for  their  care  and  help  them  choose  how  to  spend  that  ""individual  budget"".  The  scheme  will  be  funded  on  existing  budgets  set  until  2008.  But  Mr  Ladyman  said  the  plans  could  deliver  savings  in  some  areas,  such  as  freeing  up  NHS  beds  and  preventing  illnesses.  He  ruled  out  free  personal  care  in  England  -  which  is  on  offer  in  Scotland  and  Wales,  saying  it  was  ""unsustainable"".  |||    David  Rogers,  from  the  Local  Government  Association,  said  agencies  were  working  together  on  the  kind  of  innovation  proposed  by  the  government.  And  Tony  Hunter,  president  of  the  Association  of  Directors  of  Social  Services,  said  the  plans  could  improve  dignity  and  well-being  for  thousands  of  people.  But  Age  Concern  argued  social  care  was  chronically  under-funded  and  older  people  were  being  offered  choice  in  principle,  but  not  in  practice.  Its  director  general,  Gordon  Lishman,  said:  ""Direct  payments  will  not  work  if  there  are  no  services  for  people  to  choose  from  locally.""  |||    The  Tories  say  people  who  pay  for  three  years'  long-term  care  directly  or  through  insurance  should  be  guaranteed  free  care  for  the  rest  of  their  lives.  Tory  spokesman  Simon  Burns  said  more  than  80,000  long  term  care  places  had  been  lost  since  1997.  ""After  eight  years  of  persistent  change,  dogmatic  enforcement  of  regulation,  and  overbearing  government  initiatives  -  we  need  action,  not  a  vision,""  said  Mr  Burns.  The  Lib  Dems  say  they  would  fund  free  personal  care  by  a  new  50%  tax  rate  on  incomes  over  £100,000.  Health  spokesman  Paul  Burstow  said:  ""Promoting  independence  sounds  good  and  helping  people  to  live  in  their  own  homes  is  a  goal  we  share.  ""But  the  risk  is  that  independence  can  turn  into  isolation  if  the  right  support  and  care  is  not  available."""

Axa  blamed  a  poor  stock  market  performance  for  the  cut,  adding  that  recent  gains  have  not  yet  offset  the  market  falls  seen  in  2001  and  2002.  The  cut  will  hit  an  estimated  3%  of  Axa's  policyholders.  The  rest  will  know  their  fate  in  March.  |||    The  cuts  on  Axa's  policies  will  mean  a  policyholder  who  had  invested  £50  a  month  into  an  endowment  policy  for  the  past  25  years  would  see  a  final  maturity  payout  of  £46,998.  This  equated  to  a  annual  investment  growth  rate  of  8%  Axa  said.  With-profits  policies  are  designed  to  smooth  out  the  peaks  and  troughs  of  stock  market  volatility.  However,  heavy  stock  market  falls  throughout  2001  and  2002  forced  most  firms  to  trim  bonus  rates  on  their  policies.

Elsewhere  in  the  singles  charts,  the  Scissor  Sisters  went  straight  in  at  number  five  with  Filthy/Gorgeous.  Band  Aid  20  slipped  to  six  after  seven  weeks  in  the  chart  with  Do  They  Know  It's  Christmas.  The  other  two  new  entries  are  Dana  Rayne  with  Object  of  My  Desire  at  seven  and  Kasabian  who  are  at  number  eight  with  Cut  Off.

Operating  profits  were  at  380m  euros,  ten  times  more  than  in  2003.  Lufthansa  was  hit  in  2003  by  tough  competition  and  a  dip  in  demand  following  the  Iraq  war  and  the  killer  SARS  virus.  It  was  also  hit  by  troubles  at  its  US  catering  business.  Last  year,  Lufthansa  showed  signs  of  recovery  even  as  some  European  and  US  airlines  were  teetering  on  the  brink  of  bankruptcy.  The  board  of  Lufthansa  has  recommended  paying  a  2004  dividend  of  0.30  euros  per  share.  In  2003,  shareholders  did  not  get  a  dividend.  The  company  said  that  it  will  give  all  the  details  of  its  2004  results  on  23  March."

However,  chief  executive  Bill  Gammell  cautioned  that  additional  evalution  was  first  needed  at  the  site.  Cairn  has  also  been  granted  approval  to  extend  its  Rajasthan  exploration  area.  This  approval  has  come  from  the  Indian  government.  |||    A  spokesman  said  the  company's  decision  to  carry  out  further  investigations  at  the  new  find  showed  that  it  believed  there  was  significant  gas.  But  he  added:  ""It's  still  too  early  to  say  what  the  extent  of  it  is.""  Cairn's  string  of  finds  in  Rajasthan  last  year  saw  it  elevated  to  the  FTSE  100  index  of  the  UK's  leading  listed  companies.

It  was  one  of  the  last  dates  he  did  in  London.""  |||    :  The  album  Exodus  came  out  in  1977  and  that  provided  five  hits  and  confirmed  his  global  superstar  status.  ""By  1979  he  was  the  biggest  touring  attraction  in  the  world.  I  remember  going  to  see  dates  in  Milan  and  Turin  and  they  were  enormous  concerts.""  |||    :  Bob  was  one  of  the  most  mesmeric  people  I've  ever  had  the  privilege  to  work  with.  ""He  must  have  had  an  iron  will  to  succeed.  Bob  was  a  very  driven  individual.  You  realised  from  the  start  there  was  a  manifest  destiny  within  him  that  he  believed  in.  He  didn't  suffer  fools  gladly.  At  the  risk  of  stating  the  obvious,  he  was  an  extraordinary  song  writer  and  his  stage  act  was  perhaps  the  greatest  I've  ever  seen.  I  saw  him  many  times.""  |||    :  ""I  recall  in  1978  he  came  to  the  UK  for  Top  of  the  Pops  and  a  Daily  Mirror  journalist  did  a  half-hour  interview.  It  was  interrupted  to  do  a  rehearsal.  He  came  back  into  the  dressing  room  to  resume  the  interview  but  saw  a  World  Cup  match  on  TV.  |||    ""He  sat  down  in  front  of  the  TV  and  after  10  minutes  it  was  obvious  he  wasn't  going  to  move.  That  was  the  end  of  it.  The  Mirror  had  a  very  truncated  interview.  ""The  last  time  I  saw  him  was  in  London  in  1980.  I  arranged  for  him  to  play  four  days  of  football  indoors  in  Fulham.  ""Bob  was  a  good  player.  We  are  talking  about  Jamaican-style  football.  He  was  an  attacking  midfield  player.  His  team  assembled  wherever  his  gigs  were.  We  played  in  Brazil  against  some  World  Cup-winning  players.""  |||    :  It  was  always  a  struggle  for  him  to  connect  with  Black  America.  Reggae  did  not  correspond  with  disco  in  the  70s.  But  Bob  in  the  1990s  became  one  of  the  great  icons  in  America  and  the  Third  World.  ""In  1991,  ten  years  after  his  death,  he  sold  more  records  than  at  any  time  during  his  life.

He  had  only  performed  in  Zimbabwe  and  Guinea  before.  ""Of  course  the  1981  tour  never  happened,  but  the  whole  of  Africa  would  have  embraced  him.  We  can't  speculate  but  he  was  at  the  height  of  his  powers  and  just  36  years  old.  I  had  no  sense  his  career  was  going  to  go  downhill.""  |||    :  ""Bob  was  endlessly  optimistic  about  the  way  Africa  would  turn  out.  He  realised  that  nothing  was  perfect  but  he  had  total  belief  in  the  power  of  mankind.  ""I'm  sure  if  he  were  alive  today  he  would  believe  Africa  would  firstly  become  politically  free  and  secondly  be  able  to  defeat  the  Aids  epidemic.""  |||    :  ""The  final  tune  of  his  final  album  was  Redemption  Song  -  one  of  the  most  incredible  classics  of  all  time.""" 

1	"Bets  off  after  Big  Brother  'leak'  |||    A  bookmaker  has  stopped  taking  bets  on  Celebrity  Big  Brother  after  claiming  ""sensitive  information""  about  the  Channel  4  show  had  been  leaked.  |||    William  Hill  made  the  move  after  four  people  tried  to  place  bets  on  Friday's  surprise  double  eviction.  ""This  is  highly  unlikely  to  have  been  an  inspired  guess,""  William  Hill  spokesman  Rupert  Adams  said.  However,  a  Big  Brother  spokeswoman  was  ""satisfied""  that  sensitive  information  about  the  show  remained  confidential.  |||    The  bookmaker  said  its  suspicions  had  been  aroused  by  betting  for  the  last  two  contestant  evictions,  when  people  were  still  trying  to  place  large  sums  despite  odds  as  short  as  1/14.  But  William  Hill's  ""overwhelming  evidence""  came  on  Friday  when  four  unknown  callers  asked  to  place  bets  on  the  show's  surprise  double  eviction.  |||    Shortly  afterwards  model  Caprice  and  actor  Jeremy  Edwards  left  the  show.  Mr  Adams  believed  someone  had  gained  access  to  figures  which  revealed  how  viewers  were  voting,  and  was  using  them  to  predict  which  celebrity  would  be  evicted  next.  ""We  think  somebody  somewhere  has  got  them  and  has  been  trying  very  hard  to  take  us  to  the  cleaners,""  he  said.  The  bets  were  not  taken.  Mr  Adams  did  not  believe  anyone  from  Channel  4  or  Big  Brother  producer  Endemol  had  tried  to  place  the  queried  bets.  But  he  added:  ""They  need  to  look  at  how  many  people  are  privy  to  the  sensitive  information.""  |||    Big  Brother's  spokeswoman  said:  ""Only  a  handful  of  senior  production  executives  are  privy  to  any  sensitive  information  regarding  eviction  voting  and  there  are  strict  procedures  in  place  to  keep  this  information  strictly  confidential.  ""We  do  not  feel  the  need  to  investigate  this  further  as  we  are  satisfied  that  these  measures  are  effective.""  The  show's  independent  adjudicator  -  the  Electoral  Reform  Services  -  was  also  satisfied,  she  added.  The  current  series  of  Celebrity  Big  Brother  ends  on  Sunday,  with  Happy  Mondays  star  Bez,  actress  Brigitte  Nielsen  and  Blazin'  Squad  rapper  Kenzie  competing  for  a  £50,000  charity  prize.  |||    Bookmaker  Ladbrokes  said  it  would  continue  to  accept  bets  on  the  final,  with  Kenzie  its  favourite  at  2/9.  ""We  felt  no  need  whatsoever  to  close  the  book,""  spokesman  Warren  Lush  said.  ""We've  seen  absolutely  no  suspicious  betting  patterns.""  Mr  Lush  added  that  people  sometimes  vote  on  short  odds  ""because  they  think  it's  like  buying  money"".  ""You  do  have  to  risk  quite  a  lot  of  money  for  a  very  small  gain  but  if  they  think  there's  no  chance  of  an  upset  they  will  still  do  it,""  he  said."

""Our  customer  helper  approached  him...  it  was  only  then  we  realised  he  wanted  to  buy  copies  of  the  Band  Aid  single,  rather  than  the  latest  Eminem  album.""  Predicted  chart-topper  Do  They  Know  it's  Christmas?  is  expected  to  sell  at  least  300,000  copies  by  the  time  the  new  chart  is  announced  on  Sunday.  However,  the  new  version  of  the  1984  single  is  not  going  to  be  released  in  the  US,  despite  being  sold  in  many  countries  around  the  world.  US  record  shops  are  stocking  an  import  version  of  Do  They  Know  It's  Christmas,  which  is  said  to  be  selling  very  well  in  Los  Angeles  and  New  York.  The  original  track  was  released  in  the  US,  and  reached  number  13  in  the  singles  chart.  British  stars  who  appear  on  the  current  recording,  such  as  Dido  and  Coldplay's  Chris  Martin,  are  well-known  to  music  fans  across  the  Atlantic,  along  with  U2  frontman  Bono.  |||    Record  company  Universal  is  responsible  for  the  global  distribution  of  the  single,  which  will  be  available  across  Europe,  Asia,  South  America  and  Canada.  But  music  fans  in  the  US  are  still  able  to  access  the  song  and  download  it  on  Band  Aid  20's  official  website.  In  1985,  a  group  of  high-profile  American  stars  known  as  USA  For  Africa  came  together  to  record  their  own  fund-raising  single,  We  Are  The  World.  The  song  was  written  by  Lionel  Richie  and  Michael  Jackson,  with  Quincy  Jones  as  producer.  It  topped  the  US  charts  for  three  weeks  and  went  on  win  Grammy  awards  for  best  record  and  song.  |||    Dionne  Warwick,  Diana  Ross  and  Tina  Turner  were  among  the  line-up  of  performers.  It  is  predicted  that  the  Band  Aid  20  song  will  sell  300,000  copies  in  the  UK  by  the  time  the  new  chart  is  announced  on  Sunday.  The  record  is  also  tipped  to  become  this  year's  Christmas  number  one,  as  the  original  version  did  in  1984.  Proceeds  from  the  sales  are  going  towards  relief  for  the  Darfur  region  of  Sudan  and  to  combat  HIV  and  Aids  across  Africa." 

2	"Tory  'stalking  horse'  Meyer  dies  |||    Sir  Anthony  Meyer,  the  Tory  backbencher  who  challenged  Margaret  Thatcher  for  the  party  leadership  in  1989,  has  died.  |||    He  was  84,  had  been  suffering  from  cancer  for  many  months,  and  died  at  his  London  home.  That  failed  ""stalking  horse""  leadership  challenge  made  it  easier  for  Michael  Heseltine  to  mount  his  own  bid.  That  in  turn  paved  the  way  for  John  Major  to  move  into  10  Downing  Street,  after  the  second  ballot.  Meyer's  constituency  party,  Clwyd  North  West,  which  he  had  represented  as  an  MP  for  more  than  20  years,  deselected  him  as  a  result  of  that  challenge.  Sir  Anthony  John  Charles  Meyer  was  born  on  27  October,  1920.  Educated  at  Eton,  and  at  New  College,  Oxford,  he  served  in  the  Scots  Guards  from  1941  to  1945  and  was  wounded  in  tanks  in  Normandy.  He  worked  under  Edward  Heath  on  Europe  at  the  Foreign  Office  and  subsequently  won  the  Eton  and  Slough  seat  for  the  Tories  in  1964  -  by  11  votes.  Labour  regained  the  seat  two  years  later,  and  Meyer  had  to  wait  until  1970  before  he  could  re-enter  Parliament.  His  prospects  of  a  front  bench  slot  remained  remote  because  he  tended  to  defy  the  party  line."

It  is  the  second  time  Vodafone  has  come  under  the  Commission's  scrutiny.  The  UK  operator  is  already  appealing  against  allegations  that  its  UK  roaming  rates  are  ""unfair  and  excessive"".  Vodafone's  response  to  the  Commission's  letter  was  defiant.  ""We  believe  the  roaming  market  is  competitive  and  we  expect  to  resist  the  charges,""  said  a  Vodafone  spokesman.  ""However  we  will  need  time  to  examine  the  statement  of  objections  in  detail  before  we  formally  respond.""  |||    The  Commission's  investigation  into  Vodafone  and  Deutsche  Telekom's  T-Mobile  centres  on  the  tariffs  the  two  companies  charge  foreign  mobile  operators  to  access  their  networks  when  subscribers  of  those  foreign  operators  use  their  mobile  phones  in  Germany.  |||    The  Commission  believes  these  wholesale  prices  are  too  high  and  that  the  excess  is  passed  on  to  consumers.  ""The  Commission  aims  to  ensure  that  European  consumers  are  not  overcharged  when  they  use  their  mobile  phones  on  their  travels  around  the  European  Union,""  the  Commission  said  in  a  statement.  Vodafone  and  O2,  Britain's  other  big  mobile  phone  operator,  were  sent  similar  statements  of  objections  by  the  Commission  in  July  last  year.  Vodafone  sent  the  Commission  a  response  to  those  allegations  in  December  last  year  and  is  now  waiting  for  a  reply.  The  Vodafone  spokesman  said  a  similar  process  would  be  set  in  motion  with  these  latest  statement  of  objections  about  its  operations  in  Germany.  |||    The  companies  will  have  three  months  to  respond  to  the  Commission's  allegations  and  the  process  ""may  go  on  for  some  time  yet"",  the  spokesman  said.  The  Commission  could  charge  the  companies  up  to  10%  of  their  annual  turnover,  though  in  practice  that  sort  of  figure  is  rarely  demanded.  The  Commission's  latest  move  comes  just  a  few  months  after  national  telecoms  regulators  across  Europe  launched  a  joint  investigation  which  could  lead  to  people  being  charged  less  for  using  their  mobile  phone  when  travelling  abroad.  The  investigation  involves  regulators  assessing  whether  there  is  effective  competition  in  the  roaming  market."

But  a  spokesman  refused  to  comment  on  speculation  that  Mitsubishi  could  end  up  building  cars  for  PSA  and  perhaps  its  Japanese  rival  Nissan.  Mitsubishi  has  been  hit  by  a  recall  scandal  and  the  withdrawal  of  support  from  shareholder  DaimlerChrysler.  The  US-German  firm,  once  a  majority  shareholder,  decided  last  April  to  stop  providing  financial  backing.  Mitsubishi's  sales  have  slid  41%  in  the  past  year,  catalysed  by  the  revelation  that  the  company  had  systematically  been  hiding  records  of  faults  and  then  secretly  repairing  vehicles.  Mitsubishi  is  due  to  unveil  a  recovery  plan  later  in  January.  Analysts  said  that  alliances  with  other  carmakers  would  be  a  necessary  part  of  whatever  it  came  up  with,  not  least  because  its  own  slow  sales  have  left  its  manufacturing  capacity  under-used."

""They  seemed  like  a  perfect  fit  with  our  audience,""  said  Rick  Krim,  VH1's  vice  president  of  music  and  talent.  The  band  recently  released  a  new  album,  Astronaut,  the  first  from  the  original  line-up  since  1983.

2	"'Errors'  doomed  first  Dome  sale  |||    The  initial  attempt  to  sell  the  Millennium  Dome  failed  due  to  a  catalogue  of  errors,  a  report  by  the  government's  finance  watchdog  says.  |||    The  report  said  too  many  parties  were  involved  in  decision-making  when  the  attraction  first  went  on  sale  after  the  Millennium  exhibition  ended.  The  National  Audit  Office  said  the  Dome  cost  taxpayers  £28.7m  to  maintain  and  sell  in  the  four  years  after  it  closed.  Finally,  a  deal  to  turn  it  into  a  sport  and  entertainment  venue  was  struck.  More  than  £550m  could  now  be  returned  to  the  public  sector  in  the  wake  of  the  deal  to  regenerate  the  site  in  Greenwich,  London.  |||    The  NAO  report  said  that  this  sale  went  through  because  it  avoided  many  of  the  problems  of  the  previous  attempt  to  sell  the  Dome.  Deputy  Prime  Minister  John  Prescott  said  a  good  deal  had  been  secured.  ""Delivery  of  the  many  benefits  secured  through  this  deal  will  continue  the  substantial  progress  already  made  at  the  Millennium  Village  and  elsewhere  on  the  peninsula,""  he  said.  But  Edward  Leigh,  who  is  chairman  of  the  Commons  public  accounts  committee,  warned  the  government  would  have  to  work  hard  to  ensure  taxpayers  would  get  full  benefit  from  the  Dome  deal.  He  said:  ""This  report  also  shows  that  the  first  attempt  to  sell  the  Dome  proved  a  complete  fiasco.  Every  arm  of  government  seems  to  have  had  a  finger  in  the  pie.  The  process  was  confused  and  muddled.""  He  added:  ""Four  years  after  the  Millennium  Exhibition  closed,  the  Government  finally  has  a  deal  to  find  a  use  for  what  has  been  a  white  elephant  since  it  closed  in  a  deal  that,  incredible  as  it  may  seem,  should  bring  in  some  money  and  provide  a  benefit  for  the  local  area  and  the  country  as  whole.  However,  it  was  more  a  question  of  luck  that  a  strong  bid  turned  up  after  thefirst  abortive  attempt.""  NAO  head  Sir  John  Bourn  said:  ""In  difficult  circumstances  following  the  failure  of  the  first  competition,  English  Partnerships  and  the  office  of  the  deputy  prime  minister  have  worked  hard  to  get  a  deal."""

Who's  Your  Daddy  promises  $100,000  (£52,000)  to  the  contestant  if  she  correctly  identifies  her  father.  It  was  met  with  protests  by  the  National  Council  for  Adoption,  which  said  it  ""exploits""  sensitive  emotions.  ""It  exploits  the  sensitive  emotions  of  adoption,""  said  Thomas  Atwood,  president  of  the  National  Council  for  Adoption.  ""It  trivialises  them.  Adoption  is  a  very  personal,  meaningful  experience  and  it  should  not  be  commercialised  like  this.""  On  the  pre-taped  programme,  the  contestant  is  presented  with  eight  men  who  may  or  may  not  be  her  natural  father.  |||    If  she  picks  the  correct  man  from  the  line-up,  the  contestant  wins  the  jackpot  prize  of  US$100,000  (£52,590).  However,  if  she  picks  the  wrong  man,  then  the  impostor  takes  the  money.  Fox  producers  defended  the  show,  saying  it  was  a  ""positive  experience"".  They  have  made  six  specials,  though  only  one  episode  has  so  far  been  broadcast.  |||    ""The  special  was  thoroughly  vetted  by  our  standards  and  practices  department  to  ensure  that  it  was  appropriate  for  broadcast,""  said  a  Fox  spokesman.  ""However,  any  network  affiliate  that  feels  the  programming  may  be  inappropriate  for  their  individual  market  has  the  right  to  pre-empt  the  schedule.""  WRAZ-TV  instead  chose  to  air  an  independently-produced  film,  I  Have  Roots  and  Branches...  Personal  Reflections  on  Adoption,  a  documentary  about  families  with  adopted  children.  ""We  just  don't  think  adoption  is  a  game  show,""  said  Tommy  Schenck,  WRAZ-TV's  general  manager,  though  he  said  his  decision  had  not  been  influenced  by  public  protests." 

2	"Prime  minister's  questions  |||    So  who,  if  anyone,  is  playing  politics  with  the  security  of  the  nation?  |||    Michael  Howard  has  no  doubt  it  is  the  prime  minister  who,  he  claims,  is  ""ramming""  through  Parliament  the  controversial  new  anti-terror  measures  without  proper  debate.  He  didn't  say  so,  but  the  Tories  believe  the  prime  minister  is  playing  the  fear  card  on  this  one  so  he  can  look  tough  in  the  run  up  to  the  general  election  And  they  believe  Tony  Blair  is  using  the  issue  to  suggest  the  Tories  are  soft  on  terrorism.  Why  on  earth  will  the  prime  minister  not  simply  take  up  the  Tories'  offer  to  extend  the  existing  powers  temporarily  to  allow  proper  parliamentary  debate  of  the  laws,  he  demanded.  The  prime  minister  claims  this  is  the  clearest  indication  that  it  is  the  Tories  who  are  playing  politics  with  the  issue  by  attempting  to  score  cheap  political  points  in  parliament.  Is  not  the  opposition  against  to  the  proposed  laws  ""in  principle"",  in  which  case  delaying  a  decision  for  further  debate  would  be  pointless?  |||    What  this  is  really  about,  believes  Mr  Blair,  is  the  Tories  spotting  an  opportunity  to  embarrass,  maybe  even  defeat  the  government.  And  that  is  more  important  to  them  than  national  security.  Liberal  Democrat  leader  Charles  Kennedy  avoided  suggesting  anyone  was  playing  politics  with  the  issue.  He  preferred  to  state  that,  as  with  other  issues  like  ID  cards,  the  government's  immediate  instinct  was  authoritarian.  |||    As  is  his  habit  nowadays,  the  prime  minister  was  less  rough  with  Mr  Kennedy  than  he  had  been  with  Mr  Howard  -  he  prefers  a  more  exasperated  tone  suggesting  he  believes  the  Lib  Dems  have,  once  again,  just  missed  the  point.  Apart  from  all  that,  it  was  electioneering  as  usual.  The  very  first  question  to  the  prime  minister  from  Derby  North's  Bob  Laxton  asked  him,  in  effect,  if  he  would  carry  on  the  excellent  policy  of  pouring  more  resources  into  schools.  Later  Birmingham's  Sion  Simon  even  went  so  far  as  to  suggest  the  Tories  were  such  a  shower  that  we  should  have  the  general  election  now.  The  prime  minister  almost  blushed.  This  was  not  the  appropriate  place  to  announce  election  day,  he  stammered.  But  can  anyone  be  in  any  doubt  that  that  announcement  is  just  days  away  -  an  announcement  coming  in  the  week  beginning  4  April  for  an  election  on  5  May  is  where  the  big  money  is  in  the  Commons.  And  perhaps  that  simple  fact  alone  means  everyone  is  seen  to  be  playing  politics  with  just  about  everything  at  the  moment."

1	"Super  Size  Me  wins  writers'  award  |||    Super  Size  Me  director  Morgan  Spurlock  has  won  the  Writers  Guild  of  America's  award  for  documentary  feature  writing.  |||    The  Oscar-nominated  film  followed  Spurlock  as  he  ate  only  McDonald's  fast  food  for  an  entire  month.  Spurlock  was  given  the  award  at  a  special  ceremony  at  the  Roosevelt  Hotel  in  Hollywood  on  Tuesday.  Organisers  said  the  rising  popularity  of  documentary  films  led  them  to  honour  a  writer  for  a  documentary  screenplay  for  the  first  time.  |||    Producer  Brian  Grazer  presented  the  award  to  Spurlock  and  the  film's  backers,  Roadside  Attractions,  Samuel  Goldwyn  Films  and  Showtime  Independent  Films.  Spurlock  set  out  to  discover  the  effect  of  living  on  nothing  but  McDonald's  for  a  month,  upgrading  to  supersize  portions  when  offered.  The  film  followed  his  25lb  weight  gain  and  the  health  effects  on  his  body,  including  his  liver  and  cholesterol  levels.  McDonald's  announced  it  was  to  scrap  its  ""supersized""  meals  last  year,  but  denied  the  move  was  as  a  result  of  the  negative  publicity  created  by  Spurlock's  film.  Spurlock  was  given  his  award  on  the  same  day  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights  ruled  that  two  UK  activists  should  have  been  given  legal  aid  in  their  long  fight  against  a  McDonald's  libel  action.

2	"More  reforms  ahead  says  Milburn  |||    Labour  will  continue  to  pursue  controversial  reforms  if  it  wins  a  third  term  in  power,  the  party's  election  chief  Alan  Milburn  has  said.  |||    He  pledged  Labour  would  encourage  more  people  to  achieve  their  aspirations.  ""What  we  want  is  for  more  people  to  earn  and  own,""  Mr  Milburn  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  show.  Tory  Shadow  Chancellor  Oliver  Letwin  called  Labour  ""a  brilliant  machine  for  talking  about  things""  but  said  it  did  not  deliver  policies  the  country  needs.  Meanwhile,  the  Liberal  Democrats'  President  Simon  Hughes  said:  ""New  Labour  has  lost  people's  confidence  in  a  way  Old  Labour  never  did.""  Mr  Milburn  told  Today  that  Labour  wanted  policies  which  encouraged  increased  social  mobility  in  Britain.  |||    Pressed  on  incapacity  benefits,  he  said  the  tax  and  welfare  system  must  ""provide  the  right  incentives  to  people"".  ""No-one  is  talking  about  driving  people  into  work  but  what  we  do  know  is  there  are  one  million  people  on  incapacity  benefit  who  want  the  opportunity  to  work,  providing  the  right  level  of  support  is  there  for  them"".  However,  backbench  Labour  MP  Karen  Buck  warned  against  proposed  changes  in  such  benefits.  She  told  the  Today  programme:  ""If  the  policy  is  seen  as  being  about  how  do  you  make  the  feckless  poor  go  back  to  work  then  it  is  not  going  to  work,  on  the  one  hand.  And  it  is  not  going  to  improve  our  electoral  chances  on  the  other.""  Mr  Milburn  also  sought  to  draw  a  line  under  the  controversy  about  reports  of  a  feud  between  Gordon  Brown  and  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair.  |||    He  stressed  that  Mr  Brown  would  play  the  same  role  that  he  did  in  the  last  election.  Mr  Milburn  gave  more  details  of  planned  reforms  in  a  speech  to  Labour's  Fabian  Society,  in  which  he  also  praised  Mr  Brown  as  one  of  the  leaders  of  the  party's  reform  process.  In  the  speech,  he  backed  choice  in  schools  and  hospitals,  wider  home  ownership  and  changes  to  the  welfare  system.  Mr  Milburn  insisted  that  government  reform  must  continue.  ""Our  task  is  to  rebuild  the  New  Labour  coalition  around  'one  nation  politics'  that  recognise,  while  life  is  hard  for  many,  all  should  have  the  chance  to  succeed,""  he  said.  ""There  is  a  glass  ceiling  on  opportunity  in  this  country.  In  our  first  two  terms  we  have  raised  it.  In  our  third  term  we  have  to  break  it.""  Voters  turned  on  the  party  when  it  failed  to  reform  industrial  relations  in  the  1960s,  he  also  told  his  audience.  |||    Oliver  Letwin  said  the  government  had  failed  to  deliver  in  any  of  the  key  public  services,  such  as  cleaner  hospitals,  discipline  in  schools  and  putting  more  police  on  the  streets.  He  said  ministers  had  not  delivered  cleaner  hospitals,  with  5,000  people  dying  from  infections  last  year.  New  Labour  had  failed  on  school  discipline  because  it  had  not  implemented  serious  reforms  so  that  teachers  could  run  schools,  and  which  would  give  parents  choice,  he  went  on.  For  the  Lib  Dems,  Simon  Hughes  said  many  pensioners  are  means  tested  for  the  money  they  needed  and  students  who  were  told  there  wouldn't  be  tuition  fees  and  more  debt  ""have  been  given  exactly  the  opposite"".  He  added:  ""Under  New  Labour,  all  households  are  still  paying  unfair  council  tax  rather  than  a  fairer  alternative."""

But  36  people  accused  in  connection  with  the  blasts  said  it  should  not  be  screened  until  the  trial  is  over.  Mumbai  High  Court  postponed  the  film's  launch  until  3  February.  |||    Black  Friday  is  based  upon  the  novel  of  the  same  name  written  by  journalist  S  Hussain  Zaidi,  which  looks  at  the  15  explosions  which  rocked  Mumbai  on  12  March  1993.  Director  Anurag  Kashyap  said  the  film's  release  should  not  be  delayed  as  the  book  has  already  been  on  sale  for  two  years.  ""If  you  have  not  gone  against  the  book,  then  how  can  you  go  against  the  movie?""  Mr  Kashyap's  lawyer  Mihir  Desai  said.  This  is  the  second  time  that  those  accused  in  connection  with  the  blasts  have  sought  legal  intervention  regarding  the  film.  |||    They  previously  asked  that  a  line  from  the  movie's  poster,  which  claimed  the  film  portrayed  ""the  true  story  of  the  Bombay  bomb  blasts"",  be  removed.  Their  lawyer,  Majeed  Memon,  said:  ""We  had  argued  that  how  can  a  film  say  it  is  telling  the  true  story  when  the  court  itself  is  struggling  to  find  the  truth?  ""So  we  said  they  should  remove  the  line  from  their  promotional  posters  and  they  did  give  us  an  assurance  that  they  would  do  so.""  The  Mumbai  bombings  case  is  one  of  India's  longest-running  trials.  A  special  court  was  set  up  to  hear  the  case  and  regular  hearings  have  taken  place  there  for  the  last  nine  years,  with  more  than  six  hundred  witnesses  questioned."

Sales  in  what  is  traditionally  a  strong  month  rose  by  0.5%  on  a  like-for-like  basis,  compared  with  a  year  earlier.  Consumers  remain  cautious  over  buying  big-ticket  items  like  furniture,  said  BRC  director  general  Kevin  Hawkins.  Higher  interest  rates  and  uncertainty  over  the  housing  market  continue  to  take  their  toll  on  the  retail  sector,  the  BRC  said.  But  clothing  and  footwear  sales  were  said  to  be  generally  better  than  December,  while  department  stores  also  had  a  good  month.  |||    In  the  three-months  to  January,  like-for-like  sales  showed  a  growth  rate  of  -0.1%,  the  same  as  in  the  three  months  to  December,  the  BRC  said.  ""Following  a  relatively  strong  New  Year's  bank  holiday,  trading  then  took  a  downward  turn,""  said  Mr  Hawkins.  ""Even  extending  some  promotions  and  discounts  and  the  pay-day  boost  later  in  the  month  could  not  tempt  customers.""  The  previous  BRC  survey  found  Christmas  2004  was  the  worst  for  10  years  for  retailers.

The  deal  would  create  the  world's  biggest  bank  with  assets  of  about  189  trillion  yen  ($1.8  trillion).  Sumitomo's  exit  ends  the  most  high  profile  fight  in  Japanese  bank  history.  |||    UFJ  Holdings,  Japan's  fourth-largest  bank,  has  been  at  the  centre  of  a  fierce  bid  battle  over  the  last  year.

The  two  are  set  to  merge  their  venture  capital  operations  and  there  has  been  speculation  that  this  could  lead  to  a  full-blown  merger.

But  the  group  had  to  stop  during  the  next  song  to  persuade  fans  not  to  push  forward  and  allow  security  guards  to  pull  people  out  of  the  crush.  Doherty  appealed  to  fans  to  calm  down,  saying:  ""There's  a  few  people  getting  hurt  down  the  front,  you've  got  to  move  back.""  |||    The  music  resumed  minutes  later  but  after  several  more  songs,  the  singer  appeared  to  accidentally  disconnect  Walden's  guitar,  leading  the  pair  to  trade  kicks  and  punches.  Bouncers  stepped  in  and  the  band  left  the  stage,  but  returned  after  five  minutes  and  finished  their  50-minute  performance  with  no  further  trouble.  Doherty,  25,  had  to  be  home  by  midnight  to  observe  the  curfew,  which  is  one  of  the  conditions  of  his  bail.  On  Monday,  the  judge  agreed  to  allow  him  to  perform  on  condition  that  requests  for  changes  to  his  bail  terms  were  ""not  too  regular  an  occurrence"".  The  singer  was  arrested  with  fellow  musician  Alan  Wass  on  2  February  after  an  alleged  dispute  with  documentary-maker  Max  Carlish  at  a  London  hotel.  They  are  next  due  in  court  on  18  April."

US  light  crude  traded  in  New  York  lost  more  than  $2  to  $43.25,  its  lowest  close  since  10  September.  The  price  of  both  benchmark  crudes  has  dropped  12%  in  two  days.  The  falls  were  triggered  when  the  Energy  Information  Administration  (EIA)  said  on  Wednesday  that  US  crude  stocks  were  3.5%  higher  than  a  year  ago.  The  news  calmed  worries  about  winter  shortages.  Weak  US  fuel  and  heating  oil  stocks  have  been  a  persistent  factor  in  pushing  up  oil  prices.  ""It's  amazing  how  quickly  sentiment  changed,""  said  Rick  Mueller,  an  analyst  at  Energy  Security  Analysis.  Analysts  also  attributed  the  fall  to  mild  early-winter  weather,  which  has  tempered  demand  for  heating  oil.  |||    The  stronger  fuel  inventories  helped  boost  US  stock  markets  to  nine-month  highs  on  Wednesday,  though  only  the  Nasdaq  index  had  hung  onto  those  gains  by  the  end  of  Thursday.  |||    In  London,  the  FTSE  100  index  closed  15  points  higher  at  4,751.  The  long-awaited  drop  in  oil  prices  helped  to  ease  persistent  investor  jitters  over  the  impact  of  energy  costs  on  company  profits  and  economic  growth.  However,  traders  warned  that  the  fall  could  be  short-lived  if  there  is  a  cold  snap  in  North  America  this  winter  or  any  major  supply  problems  in  other  parts  of  the  world.  |||    The  price  of  crude  is  still  up  about  30%  on  the  start  of  2004,  but  has  fallen  from  the  record  of  $55.67  set  in  late  October.  Opec  nations  have  increased  production  to  25-year  highs  to  meet  global  demand  and  this  has  helped  rebuild  US  stocks  hit  by  supply  disruptions  after  Hurricane  Ivan  in  September.  Traders  were  also  encouraged  by  comments  on  Wednesday  from  the  energy  minister  of  Opec  member  Algeria.  Chakib  Khelil  said  the  cartel  was  likely  to  keep  output  unchanged  when  it  meets  next  week.  However,  some  analysts  believe  the  sharp  fall  in  crude  prices  may  harden  Opec's  attitude  to  over-production,  leading  to  a  scaling  back  of  oil  output.  |||    Fears  still  remain  over  the  level  of  US  heating  oil  stocks,  which  are  rising  but  remain  down  on  2004  levels.  A  cold  spell  in  north  America  would  start  to  deplete  supplies  and  could  spark  further  price  rises.  Analysts,  however,  say  prices  will  fall  further  if  inventories  continue  to  rise.  ""Mother  Nature  is  going  to  be  huge  in  the  next  several  weeks,""  said  Kyle  Cooper,  at  Citigroup  Global  Markets.  ""Long  term  I  think  we're  headed  to  $30-35  but  I  don't  think  we're  doing  that  yet.  We  have  a  lot  of  winter  left.""  John  Person,  president  of  National  Futures  Advisory  Services,  said  the  EIA  data  indicated  there  should  be  adequate  supplies  for  the  next  three  months  in  the  US.  ." 

2	"Citizenship  event  for  18s  touted  |||    Citizenship  ceremonies  could  be  introduced  for  people  celebrating  their  18th  birthday,  Charles  Clarke  has  said.  |||    The  idea  will  be  tried  as  part  of  an  overhaul  of  the  way  government  approaches  ""inclusive  citizenship""  particularly  for  ethnic  minorities.  A  pilot  scheme  based  on  ceremonies  in  Australia  will  start  in  October.  Mr  Clarke  said  it  would  be  a  way  of  recognising  young  people  reaching  their  voting  age  when  they  also  gain  greater  independence  from  parents.  Britain's  young  black  and  Asian  people  are  to  be  encouraged  to  learn  about  the  nation's  heritage  as  part  of  the  government's  new  race  strategy  which  will  also  target  specific  issues  within  different  ethnic  minority  groups.  Officials  say  the  home  secretary  wants  young  people  to  feel  they  belong  and  to  understand  their  ""other  cultural  identities""  alongside  being  British.  The  launch  follows  a  row  about  the  role  of  faith  schools  in  Britain.  On  Monday  school  inspection  chief  David  Bell,  accused  some  Islamic  schools  of  failing  to  teach  pupils  about  their  obligations  to  British  society.  |||    The  Muslim  Council  of  Britain  said  Ofsted  boss  Mr  Bell's  comments  were  ""highly  irresponsible"".  The  Home  Office  started  work  on  its  Community  Cohesion  and  Race  Equality  Strategy  last  year  and  the  outcome,  launched  on  Wednesday,  is  called  'Improving  Opportunity,  Strengthening  Society'.  It  is  aimed  at  tackling  racism,  exclusion,  segregation  and  the  rise  in  political  and  religious  extremism.  ""It  represents  a  move  away  from  the  one-size-fits-all  approach  to  focus  on  specifics  within  cultural  groups,""  said  a  Home  Office  spokesman.  ""It  is  not  right  to  say  that  if  you  are  from  a  black  or  ethnic  minority  group  you  must  be  disadvantaged.""  The  spokesman  highlighted  specific  issues  that  affect  particular  communities  -  for  example  people  of  south  Asian  origin  tend  to  suffer  from  a  high  incidence  of  heart  disease.  |||    ""It  is  about  drilling  down  and  focusing  on  these  sorts  of  problems,""  the  spokesman  added.  Launching  the  initiative  Mr  Clarke  said  enormous  progress  had  been  made  on  race  issues  in  recent  years.  He  added:  ""But  while  many  members  of  black  and  minority  ethnic  communities  are  thriving,  some  may  still  find  it  harder  to  succeed  in  employment  or  gain  access  to  healthcare,  education  or  housing.  ""This  strategy  sets  out  the  government's  commitment  to  doing  more  to  identify  and  respond  to  the  specific  needs  of  minorities  in  our  society.""  Some  8%  of  the  UK  population  described  themselves  as  coming  from  a  non-white  ethnic  minority  in  the  2001  Census.  |||    The  Downing  Street  Strategy  Unit  in  2003  said  people  from  Indian  and  Chinese  backgrounds  were  doing  well  on  average,  often  outperforming  white  people  in  education  and  earnings.  But  those  of  Pakistani,  Bangladeshi  and  black  Caribbean  origin  were  significantly  more  likely  to  be  unemployed  and  earn  less  than  whites,  it  said.  The  Home  Office  wants  more  initiatives  which  try  to  promote  a  sense  of  belonging  by  encouraging  young  people  to  take  part  in  voluntary  work.  The  programmes  are  designed  to  support  the  citizenship  lessons  already  taking  place  in  schools." 

2	"Lib  Dems  target  first-time  buyers  |||    The  Liberal  Democrats  have  unveiled  plans  to  build  100,000  new  ""affordable""  homes  on  publicly  owned  land.  |||    The  party's  scheme  would  allow  people  to  buy  a  share  in  a  home  through  a  mutual  home  ownership  trust,  as  a  way  of  getting  onto  the  housing  ladder.  The  Lib  Dems  would  also  encourage  the  conversion  of  existing  buildings  in  an  effort  to  protect  greenfield  sites.  Labour  has  already  announced  plans  to  help  first-time  buyers  and  the  Tories  would  extend  right-to-buy  schemes.  |||    All  the  major  parties  are  focusing  on  the  issue  in  the  run-up  to  the  election  after  a  survey  suggested  first-time  buyers  could  not  afford  a  home  in  92%  of  UK  towns.  The  Lib  Dems  say  their  ""mutual  homes""  would  let  people  buy  a  share  of  a  property,  usually  worth  about  5%  of  the  building  costs.  Party  leader  Charles  Kennedy  said  the  homes  would  be  affordable  because  they  would  be  built  on  surplus  public  sector  land,  donated  by  central  or  local  government.  People  would  also  only  have  to  pay  for  the  cost  of  the  building  and  not  the  land,  he  added.  |||    They  would  spend  about  30%  of  their  monthly  salary  on  rent  and  buying  extra  shares  in  the  property.  When  they  moved  house,  they  would  be  able  to  cash  in  on  any  rise  in  property  prices  by  selling  their  share.  It  would  also  allow  councils  to  vary  discounts  to  tenants  given  the  right  to  buy  their  council  homes  so  local  needs  were  taken  into  account.  Mr  Kennedy  said:  ""Mutual  homes  will  offer  people  the  opportunity  to  build  up  an  equity  stake  in  a  home  gradually,  investing  only  as  much  as  they  can  afford.""  |||    There  are  also  plans  to  prevent  high  house  prices  forcing  people  out  of  their  local  communities.  The  kind  of  ""golden  share""  used  by  the  Lib  Dems  in  South  Shropshire  could  be  rolled  out  more  widely.  Under  the  plan,  councils  secure  deals  with  developers  where  they  keep  a  1%  share  in  a  property  scheme  so  properties  cannot  be  sold  on  the  open  market.  Instead,  they  are  sold  at  ""build  cost""  to  people  who  the  local  council  decides  have  local  needs.  The  party  says  its  help  for  first-time  buyers  can  be  funded  at  no  extra  cost  to  the  taxpayer.  But  the  plans  involve  changing  the  VAT  system,  which  the  party  says  often  makes  it  too  expensive  to  renovate  existing  buildings.  |||    The  Conservatives  claimed  the  plans  would  amount  to  an  extra  tax  of  up  to  £11,000  on  every  new  house.  ""This  is  typical  of  Lib  Dem  hypocrisy,""  said  Tory  shadow  local  government  secretary  Caroline  Spelman.  ""They  claim  that  they  want  to  help  people  on  to  the  property  ladder,  but  the  small  print  of  their  policies  reveal  how  they  intend  to  price  even  more  people  out  of  the  housing  market.""  The  flagship  Tory  proposal  on  housing  policy  is  to  give  a  million  more  housing  association  tenants  the  right  to  buy  their  homes.  Labour  has  said  it  will  allow  300,000  council  and  housing  association  tenants  to  buy  a  share  in  their  homes.  Housing  Minister  Keith  Hill  said  much  of  the  Lib  Dem  plans  mimicked  the  government's  strategy.  ""However,  as  usual,  the  Lib  Dems'  proposals  are  completely  uncosted,""  he  said.  Mr  Hill  said  he  also  asked  whether  the  Lib  Dems  would  match  Labour's  promise  to  spend  £42bn  on  making  refurbishing  and  repair  council  homes  by  2010." 

0	"J&J  agrees  $25bn  Guidant  deal  |||    Pharmaceutical  giant  Johnson  &  Johnson  has  agreed  to  buy  medical  technology  firm  Guidant  for  $25.4bn  (£13bn).  |||    Guidant  is  a  key  producer  of  equipment  that  combats  heart  problems  such  as  implant  defibrillators  and  pacemakers.  Analysts  said  that  the  deal  is  aimed  at  offsetting  Johnson  &  Johnson's  reliance  on  a  slowing  drug  business.  They  also  pointed  out  that  more  mergers  are  likely  because  the  drug  and  healthcare  industries  are  fragmented  and  are  under  pressure  to  cut  costs.  A  number  of  Johnson  &  Johnson's  products  are  facing  patent  expirations,  while  the  company  is  also  battling  fierce  competition  from  generic  products.  Meanwhile,  demand  for  defibrillators,  which  give  the  heart  a  small  electric  shock  when  an  irregular  heartbeat  or  rhythm  is  detected,  is  expected  to  increase,  analysts  said.  The  move  by  Johnson  &  Johnson  has  been  widely  expected  and  the  firm  will  pay  $76  for  each  Guidant  share,  6%  more  than  Wednesday's  closing  price.  Analysts  say  that  US  antitrust  regulators  could  force  the  firms  to  shed  some  overlapping  stent  operations.  Stents  are  tubes  that  are  used  to  keep  an  artery  open  after  it  has  been  unblocked." 

0	"India  unveils  anti-poverty  budget  |||    India  is  to  boost  spending  on  primary  schools  and  health  in  a  budget  flagged  as  a  boost  for  the  ordinary  citizen.  |||    India's  defence  budget  has  also  been  raised  7.8%  to  830bn  rupees  ($19bn).  The  priority  for  Finance  Minister  Palaniappan  Chidambaram  is  to  fight  poverty  and  keep  the  government's  Communist  allies  onside.  But  his  options  are  limited  by  a  new  law  which  makes  him  cut  the  budget  deficit,  which  he  said  would  be  4.5%  of  GDP  in  the  year  to  March  2005.  The  country's  overall  deficit  is  thought  to  be  more  than  10%,  if  the  spending  of  India's  35  states  and  territories  is  included.  Under  the  fiscal  responsibility  law,  Mr  Chidambaram  has  to  trim  the  deficit  by  0.3  percentage  points  each  year,  a  target  he  says  he  has  now  met  for  the  current  year.  |||    But  the  heavy  spending  on  poverty  reduction  means  the  2005-6  target  for  the  deficit  will  be  4.3%,  Mr  Chidambaram  said  -  falling  short  of  the  new  law's  requirement.  ""I  was  left  with  no  option  but  to  press  the  pause  button  vis  a  vis  the  act,""  he  said.  The  following  year,  though,  would  have  to  be  back  on  track,  he  warned.  |||    ""I  may  add  that  we  are  perilously  close  to  the  limits  of  fiscal  prudence  and  there  is  no  more  room  for  spending  beyond  our  means,""  he  said.  The  coming  year's  reduction  has  meant  bringing  more  of  the  businesses  in  India's  burgeoning  services  sector  into  the  tax  system  and  restructuring  the  personal  tax  system,  although  there  are  numerous  corporate  tax  and  duty  reductions  built  into  the  budget.  |||    Presenting  his  budget  in  the  lower  house  of  parliament,  Mr  Chidambaram  said  the  Indian  economy  was  performing  strongly  and  that  inflation  has  been  reined  in.  He  said  India's  economy  grew  6.9%  in  2004.  In  his  budget  Mr  Chidambaram  has:  |||    -  Increased  spending  on  primary  education  to  71.56bn  rupees  ($1.6bn)      -  Increased  spending  on  health  to  102.8bn  rupees  ($2.35bn)      -  Announced  that  80bn  rupees  ($1.8bn)  will  be  spent  on  building  rural  infrastructure      -  Pledged  102.16bn  rupees  ($2.3bn)  for  tsunami  victims      -  Increased  flow  of  funds  to  agriculture  by  30%      -  Announced  a  package  for  the  sugar  industry  |||    In  addition,  up  to  100bn  rupees  ($2.3bn)  to  be  spent  on  infrastructure  will  be  sourced  by  borrowing  against  the  country's  foreign  exchange  reserves,  keeping  budgeted  spending  under  control.  ""Given  the  resilience  of  the  Indian  economy...  it  is  possible  to  launch  a  direct  assault  on  poverty,""  Mr  Chidambaram  said.  ""The  whole  purpose  of  democratic  government  is  to  eliminate  poverty.""  The  new  Indian  government,  led  by  the  Congress  Party,  was  voted  into  power  last  May  after  it  pledged  to  introduce  economic  reforms  with  a  ""human  face"".  |||    The  finance  minister  says  he  is  committed  to  continue  reforming  India's  tax  system  while  expanding  the  tax  base.  As  part  of  his  reforms  he  has  announced:  |||    -  Duty  cuts  on  capital  goods  and  raw  materials      -  Expanded  service  tax  net      -  Raised  the  income-tax  threshold  to  100,000  rupees  ($2,300)      -  Reduced  income  tax  for  those  earning  less  than  250,000  rupees  ($5,700)  to  20%      -  Reduced  corporate  tax  rates  to  30%  |||    An  annual  economic  survey  released  on  Friday  said  India  needed  to  ease  limit  restriction  on  foreign  investment,  reform  labour  laws  and  cut  duties  apart  from  widening  the  tax  base  for  long-term  economic  growth.  But  Mr  Chidambaram  is  under  pressure  from  the  Communist  parties  to  focus  on  increasing  social  spending.  The  Communists  are  also  hostile  to  measures  seeking  to  increase  foreign  investment  and  allow  companies  to  hire  and  fire  employees  at  will.  In  recent  months,  they  have  expressed  their  displeasure  at  the  government's  economic  reform  plans  including  increasing  foreign  direct  investment  in  telecommunication  and  aviation.  In  his  last  budget,  Mr  Chidambaram  had  pledged  billions  of  dollars  for  improving  education  and  health  services  for  the  poor  as  well  as  special  assistance  for  farmers." 

0	"BMW  to  recall  faulty  diesel  cars  |||    BMW  is  to  recall  all  cars  equipped  with  a  faulty  diesel  fuel-injection  pump  supplied  by  parts  maker  Robert  Bosch.  |||    The  faulty  part  does  not  represent  a  safety  risk  and  the  recall  only  affects  pumps  made  in  December  and  January.  BMW  said  that  it  was  too  early  to  say  how  many  cars  were  affected  or  how  much  the  recall  would  cost.  The  German  company  is  to  extend  a  planned  production  break  at  one  of  its  plants  due  to  the  faulty  Bosch  part.  The  Dingolfing  site  will  now  be  closed  all  next  week  instead  of  for  just  two  days.  The  additional  three-day  stoppage  will  mean  a  production  loss  of  up  to  3,600  vehicles,  BMW  said,  adding  that  it  was  confident  it  could  make  up  the  numbers  later.  |||    Bosch  has  stopped  production  of  the  part  but  expects  to  restart  by  2  February.  The  faulty  component  does  not  represent  a  safety  risk  but  causes  the  motor  to  stall  after  a  significant  amount  of  mileage.  When  asked  if  BMW  would  be  seeking  compensation  from  Bosch,  the  carmaker's  chief  executive  Helmut  Panke  said:  ""we  will  first  solve  the  problem  before  talking  about  who  will  pay"".  Audi  and  Mercedes  Benz  were  also  supplied  with  the  defective  diesel  fuel-injection  pumps  but  neither  of  them  have  to  recall  any  vehicles.  A  spokesman  for  DaimlerChrysler,  parent  company  of  Mercedes  Benz,  said  it  will  however  have  to  halt  some  production.  It  is  to  close  the  Mercedes  factory  in  Sindelfingen  on  Monday  and  Tuesday.  Audi  said  it  had  been  hit  by  production  bottlenecks,  due  to  a  shortage  of  unaffected  Bosch  parts."

The  move  follows  a  decision  earlier  this  month  by  Anil  -  the  younger  brother  of  Reliance  Group  president  Mukesh  Ambani  -  to  resign  from  his  post.  His  resignation  was  not  accepted  by  his  brother,  who  is  also  the  boss  of  IPCL.  The  IPCL  board  met  in  Mumbai  to  discuss  the  company's  results  for  the  October-to-December  quarter.  |||    It  is  understood  that  the  board  also  considered  Anil's  resignation  and  asked  him  to  reconsider  his  decision.  However,  Anil's  demand  that  Anand  Jain  -  another  IPCL  board  member  accused  by  Anil  of  creating  a  rift  in  the  Ambani  family  -  be  thrown  out,  was  not  met.  Anil  has  accused  Anand  Jain,  a  confidant  of  his  brother  Mukesh,  of  playing  a  negative  role  in  the  Ambani  family,  and  being  responsible  for  the  trouble  between  the  brothers.  On  Wednesday,  the  board  of  Reliance  Energy,  another  Reliance  Group  company,  reaffirmed  its  faith  in  Anil,  who  is  the  company's  chief.  Reliance  Group  acquired  the  government's  26%  stake  in  IPCL  -  India's  second-largest  petrochemicals  company  -  in  2002,  as  part  of  the  privatisation  drive.  Meanwhile,  the  group's  flagship  company,  Reliance  Industries,  has  its  board  meeting  on  Friday  to  consider  its  financial  results.  Mukesh  is  the  company's  chairman  and  Anil  its  deputy,  and  it  is  expected  that  both  brothers  will  come  face  to  face  in  the  meeting.  The  Ambani  family  controls  48%  of  the  group,  which  is  worth  $17bn  (£9.1bn;  745bn  Indian  rupees).  It  was  founded  by  their  father,  Dhiru  Bhai  Ambani,  who  died  two  years  ago." 

1	"Ocean's  Twelve  raids  box  office  |||    Ocean's  Twelve,  the  crime  caper  sequel  starring  George  Clooney,  Brad  Pitt  and  Julia  Roberts,  has  gone  straight  to  number  one  in  the  US  box  office  chart.  |||    It  took  $40.8m  (£21m)  in  weekend  ticket  sales,  according  to  studio  estimates.  The  sequel  follows  the  master  criminals  as  they  try  to  pull  off  three  major  heists  across  Europe.  It  knocked  last  week's  number  one,  National  Treasure,  into  third  place.  Wesley  Snipes'  Blade:  Trinity  was  in  second,  taking  $16.1m  (£8.4m).  Rounding  out  the  top  five  was  animated  fable  The  Polar  Express,  starring  Tom  Hanks,  and  festive  comedy  Christmas  with  the  Kranks.  |||    Ocean's  Twelve  box  office  triumph  marks  the  fourth-biggest  opening  for  a  December  release  in  the  US,  after  the  three  films  in  the  Lord  of  the  Rings  trilogy.  The  sequel  narrowly  beat  its  2001  predecessor,  Ocean's  Eleven  which  took  $38.1m  (£19.8m)  on  its  opening  weekend  and  $184m  (£95.8m)  in  total.  A  remake  of  the  1960s  film,  starring  Frank  Sinatra  and  the  Rat  Pack,  Ocean's  Eleven  was  directed  by  Oscar-winning  director  Steven  Soderbergh.  Soderbergh  returns  to  direct  the  hit  sequel  which  reunites  Clooney,  Pitt  and  Roberts  with  Matt  Damon,  Andy  Garcia  and  Elliott  Gould.  Catherine  Zeta-Jones  joins  the  all-star  cast.  ""It's  just  a  fun,  good  holiday  movie,""  said  Dan  Fellman,  president  of  distribution  at  Warner  Bros.  However,  US  critics  were  less  complimentary  about  the  $110m  (£57.2m)  project,  with  the  Los  Angeles  Times  labelling  it  a  ""dispiriting  vanity  project"".  A  milder  review  in  the  New  York  Times  dubbed  the  sequel  ""unabashedly  trivial""."

Miner  Highland  Gold  said  it  regretted  any  limit  on  privatisation  while  BP,  a  big  investor,  declined  to  comment.  Only  firms  at  least  51%  Russian-owned  will  be  permitted  to  bid.  |||    The  Federal  Natural  Resources  Agency  said  ""the  government  is  interested  in  letting  Russian  companies  develop  strategic  resources"".  The  foreign  ownership  issue  will  be  dealt  with  according  to  Russia's  competition  law,  natural  resources  minister  Yuri  Trutnev  was  quoted  as  saying  by  the  Interfax  news  agency.  No  further  details  were  given,  with  Mr  Trutnev  suggesting  that  Russia  may  decide  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  Observers  said  that  the  move  may  represent  a  shift  in  policy,  as  the  administration  of  Vladimir  Putin  puts  the  protection  of  national  interests  above  free  market  dynamics.  Russia  recently  wrested  back  control  of  a  large  chunk  of  its  oil  industry  from  stock-market  listed  company  Yukos,  a  move  that  prompted  calls  of  outrage  from  many  investors.  |||    Analysts  warned  that  it  was  still  too  early  to  draw  too  many  conclusions  from  this  new  set  of  proposals.  |||    Companies  echoed  this  sentiment,  saying  that  they  would  require  more  information  before  ringing  the  alarm  bells.  ""It's  not  good.  But  it  is  very  understandable,""  said  Al  Breach,  an  economist  at  UBS  Brunswick.  ""But  if  the  investment  climate  is  stable  -  that's  much  more  important.  ""Foreigners  of  course  would  like  to  have  free  entry  but...  this  is  not  the  end  of  the  world.""  A  number  of  other  nations,  including  Mexico,  Saudi  Arabia  and  Kuwait,  protect  their  national  resources  from  foreign  firms.  What  has  surprised  observers  is  that  since  the  collapse  of  communism  Russia  has  been  courting  foreign  investment.  |||    BP  spent  $7.5bn  to  create  Russian-registered  oil  company  TNK-BP,  and  has  a  partnership  to  develop  the  Sakhalin  5  petroleum  field  with  state-owned  Rosneft.  Exxon,  the  world's  largest  oil  company,  has  signed  preliminary  agreements  to  develop  the  Sakhalin  3  field.  Company  spokesman  Glenn  Waller  said  Exxon  still  considered  the  deal  valid,  despite  Russia  inviting  new  offers  for  the  land  block.  According  to  Mr  Waller,  Exxon  ""were  not  planning  to  bid  at  a  new  tender  anyway"".  ""We  regret  the  ministry  has  taken  such  a  decision,""  said  Ivan  Kulakov,  deputy  chairman  of  Highland  Gold  -  a  mining  firm  that  has  the  motto  ""Bringing  Russia's  Gold  to  Market"".  ""It  would  be  a  shame  if  that  has  a  negative  impact  on  the  investment  climate.""  Other  firms  that  have  been  linked  with  investment  in  Russia  include  France's  Total,  the  US-based  ChevronTexaco,  and  miner  Barrick  Gold."

The  German  economy  has  been  faltering,  with  unemployment  levels  rising  to  a  seventy-year  high  of  5.2  million.  Its  sluggish  performance  continues  to  hamper  the  entire  eurozone.  |||    The  IMF's  draft  World  Economic  Outlook  -  due  to  be  published  in  April  -  would  point  to  a  marked  deterioration  in  Germany's  economy,  the  FT  report  said.  |||    In  September,  the  IMF  had  said  that  German  growth  for  the  current  year  would  be  1.8%.  The  IMF  has  also  revised  eurozone  forecasts,  the  paper  said,  taking  into  account  high  oil  prices,  the  strength  of  the  euro  and  weak  demand  in  many  of  the  world's  leading  economies.  Europe's  economic  difficulties  have  been  highlighted  by  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development,  which  argued  in  a  report  published  on  Tuesday  that  the  continent  could  only  achieve  US  living  standards  by  freeing  up  its  labour  markets.  ""The  eurozone  does  not  look  like  it  has  a  self-sustaining  recovery,""  James  Carrick,  an  economist  with  ABN  Amro,  told  the  newspaper.  ""It  is  too  dependant  on  the  rest  of  the  world.""" 

2	"Tories  opposing  24-hour  drinking  |||    The  Tories  say  plans  to  extend  pub  opening  times  should  be  put  on  hold  until  binge  drinking  is  under  control,  despite  backing  a  law  change  last  year.  |||    Spokesman  David  Davis  said  ministers  had  failed  to  make  his  party  aware  of  concern  among  senior  police  that  plans  would  cause  more  anti-social  behaviour.  Notts  police  chief  Steve  Green  said  innocent  people  would  suffer.  But  Culture  Secretary  Tessa  Jowell  said  a  delay  would  be  ""disastrous""  and  she  accused  the  Tories  of  opportunism.  The  government  would  go  ahead  with  the  changes  which  would  give  police  more  power  to  tackle  excessive  drinking,  she  added.  Earlier  chief  constable  Green  questioned  how  his  officers  would  be  able  to  practically  apply  powers  allowing  them  to  shut  down  problem  premises.  ""If  you  look  at  the  Market  Square  in  Nottingham,  if  a  fight  takes  place  which  licensed  premises  do  you  go  and  lay  the  responsibilty  at  the  door  of?""  he  asked  on  BBC  Radio  4's  World  at  One  programme.  |||    He  warned  that  if  drinking  establishments  were  allowed  to  open  until  three  or  four  in  the  morning  the  police  would  have  to  take  officers  off  day  shifts  in  order  to  do  their  job  effectively  at  night.  Earlier  this  year  the  Royal  College  of  Physicians  said  it  opposed  the  plan  to  extend  drinking  hours  when  there  was  already  an  ""epidemic""  of  binge  drinking.  Minister  Richard  Caborn  said  the  government  was  tackling  the  causes  and  the  symptoms  of  the  problem  by  allowing  more  powers  to  close  down  problem  premises.  It  is  hoped  that  allowing  pubs  and  clubs  to  stay  open  longer  will  stagger  closing  times  and  end  the  current  situation  where  drinkers  spill  on  to  the  streets  all  at  once.  Earlier  Tony  Blair  defended  the  plans  against  criticism  from  one  of  his  own  backbenchers.  |||    ""My  view  of  this  is  very  clear:  we  should  have  the  same  flexibility  that  other  countries  have  and  then  we  should  come  down  really  hard  on  those  who  abuse  that  freedom  and  don't  show  the  responsibility,""  he  told  MPs.  ""The  law-abiding  majority  who  want  the  ability,  after  going  to  the  cinema  or  theatre  say,  to  have  a  drink  at  the  time  they  want  should  not  be  inconvenienced,  we  shouldn't  have  to  have  restrictions  that  no  other  city  in  Europe  has,  just  in  order  to  do  something  for  that  tiny  minority  who  abuse  alcohol,  who  go  out  and  fight  and  cause  disturbances.  ""To  take  away  that  ability  for  all  the  population  -  even  the  vast  majority  who  are  law  abiding  -  is  not,  in  my  view,  sensible.""  This  week  a  judge  claimed  easy  access  to  drink  was  breeding  ""urban  savages""  and  turning  town  centres  into  no  go  areas.  Judge  Charles  Harris  QC  made  his  remarks  as  he  sentenced  three  men  for  assaults  carried  out  while  drunk  and  high  on  drugs  after  a  night  out." 

2	"Galloway  targets  'New  Labour'  MP  |||    George  Galloway  is  to  stand  against  pro-Iraq  war  Labour  MP  Oona  King  at  the  next  general  election.  |||    Mr  Galloway,  who  on  Thursday  won  £150,000  in  libel  damages  from  the  Daily  Telegraph  said  he  would  contest  Bethnal  Green,  in  London,  for  Respect.  The  Glasgow  Kelvin  MP,  who  was  expelled  from  Labour  over  his  anti  Iraq  war  stance,  accused  Ms  King  of  being  a  ""New  Labour  stooge"".  Ms  King  said  she  was  ""delighted""  at  the  chance  to  take  on  Mr  Galloway.  |||    Mr  Galloway's  current  constituency  is  set  to  disappear  under  planned  boundary  changes  in  Scotland.  |||    The  50-year-old  MP  launched  Respect,  the  Unity  Coalition,  in  January  along  with  1,000  anti-war  activists,  and  the  Muslim  Association  of  Britain.  The  party's  declared  aims  are  an  end  to  the  occupation  of  Iraq,  the  repeal  of  anti-union  laws  and  the  end  of  privatisation.  Speaking  from  a  cafe  in  Brick  Lane,  east  London,  Mr  Galloway  said  he  had  accepted  the  party's  invitation  to  stand  with  ""great  honour  and  pride"".  |||    He  added:  ""Here  in  this  constituency  of  Bethnal  Green  and  Bow  there  is  a  New  Labour  stooge  MP.  ""A  stooge  who  will  sing  any  song,  make  any  speech,  do  any  dance,  do  anything  she  is  told  to  by  Tony  Blair  -  irrespective  of  how  her  constituents  are  adversely  affected  or  how  strongly  they  feel  to  the  contrary.""  Ms  King  has  represented  the  constituency  since  1997.  She  said:  ""I'm  delighted  I've  been  given  the  chance  to  finish  him  (Mr  Galloway)  off,  and  believe  me  I  will.  ""I  know  many  people  around  the  country  will  be  grateful,  not  least  his  constituents  in  Scotland  who  he  has  shamelessly  abandoned.""  In  June's  European  Parliament  elections,  Respect  failed  to  gain  enough  votes  for  an  MEP  but  did  come  first  in  Tower  Hamlets  borough,  most  of  which  is  covered  by  the  Commons  constituency  of  Bethnal  Green  and  Bow.  |||    A  month  later  it  gained  a  council  seat  in  a  by-election  in  St  Dunstan's  and  Stepney  Green  ward,  Tower  Hamlets.  Mr  Galloway  said  that  in  next  year's  expected  general  election  and  local  elections  a  year  later,  the  party  would  ""turn  the  East  End  of  London  into  a  fortress"".  Both  the  Conservatives  and  the  Liberal  Democrats  have  chosen  prospective  parliamentary  candidates  for  Bethnal  Green  and  Bow  from  the  Bangladeshi  population,  which  makes  up  almost  half  the  electorate.  The  Telegraph  was  sued  for  libel  by  Mr  Galloway  after  the  newspaper  claimed  he  received  money  from  Saddam  Hussein's  regime  in  Iraq.  The  newspaper  said  it  was  in  the  public  interest  to  publish  the  claims,  based  on  documents  found  in  Baghdad.  Mr  Justice  Eady  said  he  was  ""obliged  to  compensate  Mr  Galloway...  and  to  make  an  award  for  the  purposes  of  restoring  his  reputation""." 

0	"Ebbers  denies  WorldCom  fraud  |||    Former  WorldCom  chief  Bernie  Ebbers  has  denied  claims  that  he  knew  accountants  were  doctoring  the  books  at  the  firm.  |||    Speaking  in  court,  Mr  Ebbers  rejected  allegations  he  pressured  ex-chief  financial  officer  Scott  Sullivan  to  falsify  company  financial  statements.  Mr  Sullivan  ""made  accounting  decisions,""  he  told  the  federal  court,  saying  his  finance  chief  had  ""a  keen  command  of  the  numbers"".  Mr  Ebbers  has  denied  charges  of  fraud  and  conspiracy.  During  his  second  day  of  questioning  in  the  New  York  trial  Mr  Ebbers  played  down  his  working  relationship  with  Mr  Sullivan  and  denied  he  frequently  met  him  to  discuss  company  business  when  questioned  by  the  prosecution.  |||    ""In  a  lot  of  weeks,  we  would  speak  ...  three  or  four  times,""  Mr  Ebbers  said,  adding  that  conversations  about  finances  were  rarely  one-on-one  and  were  usually  discussed  by  a  ""group  of  people""  instead.  |||    Mr  Ebbers  relationship  to  Mr  Sullivan  is  key  to  the  case  surrounding  financial  corruption  that  led  to  the  collapse  of  the  firm  in  2002  following  the  discovery  of  an  $11bn  accounting  fraud.  The  prosecution's  star  witness  is  Mr  Sullivan,  one  of  six  WorldCom  executives  indicted  in  the  case,  He  has  pleaded  guilty  to  fraud  and  appeared  as  a  prosecution  witness  as  part  of  an  agreement  with  prosecutors.  During  his  time  on  the  witness  stand  Mr  Sullivan  repeatedly  told  jurors  he  met  frequently  with  Mr  Ebbers,  told  him  about  changes  made  to  WorldCom's  accounts  to  hide  costs  and  had  warned  him  such  practises  were  improper.  However  during  the  case  on  Tuesday  Mr  Ebbers  denied  the  allegations.  ""I  wasn't  advised  by  Scott  Sullivan  of  anything  ever  being  wrong,""  he  told  the  court.  ""He's  never  told  me  he  made  an  entry  that  wasn't  right.  If  he  had,  we  wouldn't  be  here  today.""  Mr  Ebbers  could  face  a  jail  sentence  of  up  to  85  years  if  convicted  of  all  the  charges  he  is  facing.  Shareholders  lost  about  $180bn  in  WorldCom's  collapse,  20,000  workers  lost  their  jobs  and  the  company  went  bankrupt.  The  company  emerged  from  bankruptcy  last  year  and  is  now  known  as  MCI." 

2	"Guantanamo  four  questioned  |||    The  four  Britons  freed  from  US  custody  in  Guantanamo  Bay  are  expected  to  be  allowed  a  visit  by  one  relative.  |||    Moazzam  Begg,  Martin  Mubanga,  Feroz  Abbasi  and  Richard  Belmar  were  held  for  three  years,  accused  of  al-Qaeda  links.  Mr  Begg's  father,  Azmat,  said  he  had  been  told  he  could  see  his  son  for  20  minutes  and  would  say  he  was  ""a  hero"".  The  men  are  being  held  at  London's  Paddington  Green  police  station,  where  they  are  expected  to  be  questioned  by  UK  anti-terror  officers.  But  Louise  Christian,  the  lawyer  representing  Mr  Abbasi  and  Mr  Mubanga,  said  the  families  would  be  reunited  with  the  men  away  from  the  station.  Before  being  driven  by  police  from  Birmingham  to  London,  Azmat  Begg  said  he  was  concerned  for  his  son  Moazzam's  mental  state  and  was  looking  forward  to  giving  him  a  hug.  As  Azmat  Begg  arrived  at  the  London  police  station,  there  appeared  to  be  some  confusion  as  to  the  visiting  arrangements.  Police  have  said  they  have  a  duty  to  investigate  the  men,  who  were  arrested  on  their  return  to  the  UK.  But  Metropolitan  Police  Commissioner  Sir  John  Stevens  said  evidence  obtained  by  MI5  while  the  four  were  in  Cuba  was  ""absolutely""  inadmissible  in  UK  courts.  In  an  interview  with  the  Independent,  Sir  John  said  his  officers  would  have  to  find  other  evidence  before  the  suspects  could  be  tried  in  the  UK.  |||    He  told  the  newspaper:  ""If  an  admission  is  made,  it  is  a  totally  different  ball  game...  it  could  be  used  as  evidence.  ""The  options  are:  if  there  is  enough  evidence  they  will  be  charged.  If  not  they  will  be  released  as  soon  as  possible.""  The  men  have  been  allowed  to  meet  their  lawyers.  Louise  Christian  said  that  after  being  ""tortured  and  abused""  at  Guantanamo  Bay,  the  men's  arrest  was  unfair  and  inappropriate.  She  told  BBC  News  she  remained  very  concerned  about  their  psychological  state.  Gareth  Peirce,  lawyer  for  Mr  Begg,  said  she  was  shocked  at  the  condition  of  the  men  and  appalled  that  the  authorities  felt  the  need  to  detain  them.  Washington  has  claimed  all  four  were  ""enemy  combatants""  who  trained  at  camps  run  by  al-Qaeda.  The  Pentagon  says  they  were  freed  after  the  UK  government  promised  they  would  not  be  a  threat  to  the  national  security  of  the  US  or  any  of  its  allies.  |||    The  detainees  were  immediately  arrested  under  Section  41  of  the  Terrorism  Act  2000  when  they  landed  at  RAF  Northolt,  west  London,  on  Tuesday.  Massoud  Shadjareh,  from  the  Muslim  Safety  Forum,  said:  ""What  sort  of  homecoming  is  this?  They  are  innocent  people.""  The  Muslim  Council  of  Britain  urged  that  the  men  should  receive  counselling  and  medical  help.  ""We  want  these  men  to  be  returned  into  the  arms  of  their  waiting  family,""  said  Iqbal  Sacranie,  secretary  general  of  the  council." 

2	"UKIP  MEP  attacked  German  'empire'  |||    A  UK  Independence  Party  MEP  suggested  Germany  saw  the  EU  as  an  'empire'  and  was  cheaper  than  using  tanks,  a  new  documentary  has  revealed.  Mike  Nattrass,  UKIP's  deputy  leader,  made  the  comments  to  an  audience  at  a  meeting  during  last  September's  Hartlepool  by-election  campaign.  But  challenged  on  the  remark,  he  denied  accusing  Germany  of  using  the  EU  as  cover  for  a  ""4th  German  Reich"".  He  says  he  was  not  ""German-bashing""  but  saying  peace  was  the  EU's  founding  aim.  The  meeting  was  shown  in  a  BBC  3  film  on  ex-UKIP  MEP  Robert  Kilroy-Silk.  The  former  chat  show  host  quit  the  party  earlier  this  month,  calling  it  a  joke.  |||    The  documentary  showed  Mr  Nattrass,  apparently  talking  about  the  EU,  telling  the  meeting:  ""The  Germans  are  the  big  losers  here  but  they  don't  care  because  to  them  the  project  is  worthwhile.  ""It's  like  an  empire  for  them  spreading  in  all  directions  away  from  Germany  into  Hungary,  into  what  they  call  the  Sudetenland  -  Czechoslovakia,  places  like  that.  ""So  it's  cheaper  for  them  to  do  it  this  way  than  roll  the  tanks  in.""  On  Tuesday,  he  told  the  BBC  News  website  he  did  not  think  the  comments  were  offensive  and  worked  happily  with  MEPs  of  different  nationalities  in  the  European  Parliament.  He  argued  that  peace  was  the  only  reason  for  having  the  ""outdated""  EU  as  there  was  no  economic  justification.  Pointing  to  Germany's  trade  interests  as  a  country  in  the  centre  of  Europe,  Mr  Nattrass  said:  ""The  fact  is  that  the  EU  benefits  Germany  but  it  does  not  benefit  Britain.  ""I'm  not  at  all  German-bashing.  It's  the  truth.""  A  UKIP  spokesman  said:  ""Mike  has  some  passionate  beliefs  and  sometimes  uses  excessively  colourful  language  with  which  to  express  them.""  |||    The  documentary  showed  some  of  the  tensions  between  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  and  his  fellow  MEPs  after  UKIP  took  third  place  in  last  year's  European  elections.  He  denied  wanting  to  be  leader  until  October  2004,  when  he  told  BBC  One's  Breakfast  with  Frost  programme  he  aspired  to  the  job.  Asked  by  the  documentary  makers  why  he  had  lied  about  his  leadership  ambitions,  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  said:  ""There  was  one  thing  I  said  that  I  shouldn't  have  said  at  the  time.  ""I  was  trying  to  be  helpful  to  the  party  and  it  was  the  wrong  thing  to  do,  I  should  have  told  the  truth.""  The  film  also  included  footage  of  a  row  between  Mr  Kilroy-Silk,  MEP  Nigel  Farage  and  party  leader  Roger  Knapman  about  rumours  that  he  was  about  to  resign  the  UKIP  whip  in  the  European  Parliament.  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  told  them  he  had  not  left  the  UKIP  group  -  a  move  he  announced  shortly  after  the  meeting.  He  told  Mr  Farage:  ""Don't  tell  lies  Nigel,  now  you've  told  too  many.  Most  of  the  trouble  had  been  caused  by  you.""  UKIP  officials  claim  it  was  in  fact  Mr  Kilroy-Silk,  not  Mr  Farage,  who  briefed  newspapers  he  was  leaving  the  group  of  MEPs.  |||    Later  in  unguarded,  off-air  comments  in  a  television  studio,  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  was  heard  saying  he  was  irritated  by  ""defending  some  of  these  right-wing  fascist  nutters"".  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  separately  said  he  had  argued  against  UKIP  working  with  such  groups  which  believed  homosexuality  was  a  sin.  A  UKIP  spokesman  said  there  were  more  than  40  MEPs  in  the  same  group  in  the  European  Parliament.  They  were  from  a  broad  spectrum  -  some  right-wing,  some  left-wing  -  but  with  a  shared  belief  in  the  ""unfeasibility  of  the  EU  as  it  is  now"".  He  did  not  defend  other  groups'  religious  beliefs  but  argued  it  was  their  right  to  hold  such  views  -  just  as  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  had  a  right  to  criticise  Arab  states.  London  UKIP  MEP  Gerard  Batten  said:  ""Robert  has  made  a  variety  of  comments  about  UKIP  and  its  MEPs.  ""There  are  of  course  two  sides  to  every  story.  What  Robert  does  not  say  is  that  he  was  offered  several  positions  which  would  have  given  him  effective  control  of  the  party,  but  not  the  title  of  leader.""  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  is  to  launch  his  own  parry,  Veritas,  in  Westminster  on  Wednesday." 

1	"Spector  facing  more  legal  action  |||    Music  producer  Phil  Spector  is  facing  legal  action  from  the  mother  of  the  actress  he  has  been  accused  of  killing.  |||    Donna  Clarkson,  whose  daughter  Lana  was  found  dead  in  Mr  Spector's  home  in  February  2003,  is  seeking  unspecified  damages  in  a  civil  action.  The  legal  action  accuses  Mr  Spector  of  murdering  the  actress  at  his  LA  home.  Mr  Spector  is  currently  free  on  $1m  (£535,000)  bail  and  is  awaiting  trial.  The  64-year-old  has  denied  the  killing,  saying  her  death  was  accidental.  |||    Ms  Clarkson's  legal  action,  filed  in  Los  Angeles  Superior  Court,  also  accuses  Mr  Spector  of  negligence  and  battery,  alleging  he  ""grabbed,  hit,  fought  with  and  restrained""  Lana  Clarkson  before  shooting  her  to  death.  Her  lawyers  said  in  a  statement:  ""The  Clarkson  family  had  hoped  that  there  would  be  some  resolution  with  regard  to  the  criminal  proceedings  before  moving  forward  with  the  civil  action.  ""However,  Ms  Clarkson  and  her  family  understand  that  the  fair  administration  of  justice  takes  time  and  in  light  of  the  numerous  changes  Mr  Spector  has  made  in  his  legal  defence  team  over  the  last  two  years,  Ms  Clarkson  was  forced  to  file  the  action  before  (the  statute  of  limitations  expired)  on  3  February  2005.""  Mr  Spector,  known  for  his  work  with  the  Beatles,  has  claimed  that  Lana  Clarkson  committed  suicide.

Born  in  Runcorn,  Cheshire,  she  also  starred  in  numerous  films  including  1989's  Shirley  Valentine.  She  played  Nellie  in  Mike  Leigh's  latest  film  Vera  Drake,  which  won  the  Golden  Lion  prize  for  best  film  at  this  year's  Venice  Film  Festival.  |||    And  most  recently  she  appeared  alongside  Richard  Wilson  in  ITV's  King  of  Fridges  and  with  Martin  Clunes  in  Doc  Martin.  Other  TV  appearances  included  the  part  of  Matron  in  ITV  drama  Footballers'  Wives  and  a  cameo  role  as  Tom  Farrell's  mother  Sheila  in  BBC  comedy  Gimme  Gimme  Gimme.  Keaveney's  career  also  included  stage  performances  in  Neaptide  for  the  National  Theatre,  Private  Lives  and  The  Rise  and  Fall  of  Little  Voice.  The  actress  died  in  hospital.  Her  agent  Barry  Brown  said:  ""Anna  was  due  to  have  had  another  operation  on  Friday  but  unfortunately  she  was  too  weak.""" 

1	"Tough  schedule  delays  Elliot  show  |||    Preview  performances  of  the  £3m  musical  Billy  Elliot  have  been  delayed  to  give  the  child  actors  a  less  arduous  rehearsal  schedule.  |||    Director  Stephen  Daldry  made  the  decision  to  re-schedule  the  previews  to  protect  the  young  stars.  Three  boys  will  rotate  the  demanding  role  of  ballet  dancer  Billy,  which  requires  them  to  sing,  dance  and  act.  The  show's  opening  night  on  12  May  at  the  Victoria  Palace  Theatre  in  London  remains  unaffected  by  the  changes.  Preview  performances  will  now  be  held  on  14,  20  and  27  April.  ""This  is  one  of  the  most  ambitious  projects  I  have  been  involved  with,""  said  Daldry.  ""The  decision  has  been  made  to  push  back  our  preview  performances  in  order  to  give  our  company,  with  a  cast  including  45  children,  a  little  extra  time  so  they  are  as  fully  prepared  as  possible.""  |||    He  added:  ""The  young  Billy  Elliots  in  particular,  making  their  professional  stage  debuts  in  the  West  End,  will  benefit  from  a  little  extra  time  to  familiarise  themselves  with  all  aspects  of  the  production.""  |||    The  three  boys  playing  Billy  are  James  Lomas,  15,  George  Maguire,  14,  and  Liam  Mower,  12.  The  other  major  child  parts  will  also  be  rotated  between  young  actors.  Such  are  the  demands  of  the  show  that  producers  set  up  a  stage  school  in  Newcastle  to  train  potential  stars  for  the  show.  Child  labour  laws  also  mean  the  young  actors  can  only  work  for  a  limited  period  each  week.  Adult  actors  in  the  show  include  Tim  Healy  as  Billy's  father  and  Haydn  Gwnne  as  his  dance  teacher  Mrs  Wilkinson.  Sir  Elton  John  has  composed  the  music.  Daldry  directed  the  successful  film  version  of  Billy  Elliot,  adapted  from  Lee  Hall's  script.  Both  were  nominated  for  Oscars,  alongside  Julie  Walters,  who  played  Billy's  teacher."

""I  told  the  club  I  would  like  to  stay  for  one  more  year.  They  promised  me  an  answer  within  the  next  month  so  I  am  waiting  to  see,""  he  said.  ""The  main  concern  is  my  age  but  I  think  I  have  proved  I  am  fit  enough.  Bosvelt  joined  City  from  Feyenoord  in  2003  and  at  first  he  struggled  to  adapt  to  life  in  England.  But  his  professionalism  and  dedication  impressed  manager  Kevin  Keegan.  ""He  realised  the  pace  of  the  game  was  faster  than  anything  he  was  used  to  but  he  drove  himself  back  into  the  team.  He  is  an  unsung  hero,""  said  Keegan."

Mull  Historical  Society,  Deacon  Blue,  Idlewild,  Texas,  Mogwai  and  Teenage  Fanclub  are  among  the  other  acts  performing  at  the  concert.  Organisers  hope  to  raise  at  least  £250,000  from  the  show.  |||    It  follows  a  Cardiff  gig  starring  Eric  Clapton,  Keane  and  Jools  Holland,  which  raised  more  than  £1.25m.  And  it  is  taking  place  on  the  same  night  as  a  tsunami  benefit  show  in  Bristol,  which  will  see  Massive  Attack  and  Portishead  share  a  stage  for  the  first  time.  Colin  MacIntyre,  of  Mull  Historical  Society,  was  playing  another  gig  on  the  same  day  but  said  he  was  determined  to  make  the  Glasgow  benefit.  He  said:  ""I  think  we  were  all  affected  by  seeing  the  reports  coming  from  the  Far  East.

0	"Aids  and  climate  top  Davos  agenda  |||    Climate  change  and  the  fight  against  Aids  are  leading  the  list  of  concerns  for  the  first  day  of  the  World  Economic  Forum  in  the  Swiss  resort  of  Davos.  |||    Some  2,000  business  and  political  leaders  from  around  the  globe  will  listen  to  UK  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair's  opening  speech  on  Wednesday.  Mr  Blair  will  focus  on  Africa's  development  plans  and  global  warming.  Earlier  in  the  day  came  an  update  on  efforts  to  have  3  million  people  on  anti-Aids  drugs  by  the  end  of  2005.  The  World  Health  Organisation  (WHO)  said  700,000  people  in  poor  countries  were  on  life-extending  drugs  -  up  from  440,000  six  months  earlier  but  amounting  to  only  12%  of  the  5.8  million  who  needed  them.  A  $2bn  ""funding  gap""  still  stood  in  the  way  of  hitting  the  2005  target,  the  WHO  said.  |||    The  themes  to  be  stressed  by  Mr  Blair  -  whose  attendance  was  announced  at  the  last  minute  -  are  those  he  wants  to  dominate  the  UK's  chairmanship  of  the  G8  group  of  industrialised  states.  Other  issues  to  be  discussed  at  the  five-day  conference  range  from  China's  |||    economic  power  to  Iraq's  future  after  this  Sunday's  elections.  Aside  from  Mr  Blair,  more  than  20  other  world  leaders  are  expected  to  attend  including  French  President  Jacques  Chirac  -  due  to  speak  by  video  link  after  bad  weather  delayed  his  helicopter  -  and  South  African  President  Thabo  Mbeki,  whose  arrival  has  been  delayed  by  Ivory  Coast  peace  talks.  The  Ukraine's  new  president,  Viktor  Yushchenko,  will  also  be  there  -  as  will  newly  elected  Palestinian  leader  Mahmoud  Abbas.  Showbiz  figures  will  also  put  in  an  appearance,  from  U2  frontman  Bono  -  a  well-known  campaigner  on  trade  and  development  issues  -  to  Angelina  Jolie,  a  goodwill  campaigner  for  the  UN  on  refugees.  |||    Unlike  previous  years,  protests  against  the  WEF  are  expected  to  be  muted.  Anti-globalisation  campaigners  have  called  off  a  demonstration  planned  for  the  weekend.  At  the  same  time,  about  100,000  people  are  expected  to  converge  on  the  Brazilian  resort  of  Porto  Alegre  for  the  World  Social  Forum  -  the  so-called  ""anti-Davos""  for  campaigners  against  globalisation,  for  fair  trade,  and  many  other  causes.  |||    In  contrast,  the  Davos  forum  is  dominated  by  business  issues  -  from  outsourcing  to  corporate  leadership  -  with  bosses  of  more  than  a  fifth  of  the  world's  500  largest  companies  scheduled  to  attend.  A  survey  published  on  the  eve  of  the  conference  by  PricewaterhouseCoopers  said  four  in  ten  business  leaders  were  ""very  confident""  that  their  companies  would  see  sales  rise  in  2005.  Asian  and  American  executives,  however,  were  much  more  confident  than  their  European  counterparts.  But  the  political  discussions,  focusing  on  Iran,  Iraq  and  China,  are  likely  to  dominate  media  attention." 

2	"UKIP's  secret  weapon?  |||    By  any  measure,  New  Yorker  Dick  Morris  is  that  thing  Americans  love  over  everything  else  -  a  winner.  |||    This  is  the  man  who,  some  pundits  believe,  was  almost  single-handedly  responsible  for  Bill  Clinton's  sensational  1992  comeback  victory.  But  Morris  is  no  ideologue.  He  has  worked  as  election  strategist  for  any  number  of  Republicans  as  well  and,  more  recently,  politicians  from  Mexico  to  Uruguay.  Now  he  is  back  in  London  as  the  UK  Independence  Party's  not-so-secret  electoral  weapon  after  returning  from  the  Ukraine  where  he  helped  -  you  guessed  it  -  opposition  candidate  Viktor  Yushchenko.  If  there  is  one  regular  criticism  levelled  at  Morris,  it  is  that  he  is  too  ready  to  switch  allegiances.  That  he  enjoys  the  game  more  than  the  politics.  |||    So  why  Britain  and  why  UKIP  which,  despite  its  recent  EU  election  successes,  is  not  likely  to  pull  off  a  sensational  victory  in  the  looming  general  election.  On  this  subject,  Morris  appears  almost  evangelical.  |||    ""I  was  on  a  cruise  in  the  Mediterranean  and,  coincidentally,  so  was  UKIP  leader  Roger  Knapman.  ""I  had  just  written  a  piece  saying  how  the  English  Channel  was  now  wider  than  the  Atlantic  which  he  liked  and  it  went  from  there"".  But  what  is  it  about  UKIP  that  particularly  attracts  him?  Many  might  think  it  is  simply  another  chance  to  practice  his  art,  irrespective  of  the  politics.  ""I  think  the  greatest  threat  to  democracy  in  the  world  is  not  terrorism  but  bureaucratism"".  A  great  soundbite,  but  a  surprise  coming  from  a  New  Yorker  post  11  September.  ""It  is  the  growth  of  these  bodies  composed  of  experts  who  know  better,  who  don't  believe  in  letting  democracy  govern  but  believe  in  letting  the  correct  solution  be  determined.  ""That's  international  bankers,  the  World  Trade  Organisation,  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  the  World  Bank  and,  primarily,  the  European  Union"".  |||    So  he  is  out  to  help  UKIP  take  Britain  out  of  this  organisation  which  he  believes  is  unreformable  and  inherently  undemocratic.  And  he  is  scathing  of  the  Tory  party  which  he  also  appears  to  believe  is  unreformable.  ""The  Tory  party  is  schizophrenic  about  Europe.  But  until  somebody  says  they  are  willing  to  leave  the  EU  they  can't  possibly  re-negotiate  anything  (as  Michael  Howard  is  pledged  to  do).  ""It's  like  walking  into  a  liquor  store  with  a  gun  to  rob  it  and  saying:  'before  I  can  proceed  with  the  robbery  I  want  to  make  clear  I  am  not  going  to  shoot  anybody'"".  Possibly  a  very  American  analogy,  but  another  great  soundbite.  ""The  basic  point  is  that  the  EU  seeks  political  integration  to  move  the  entire  nexus  of  decision  making  away  from  Britain  -  and  we  oppose  that  and  the  Tories  cannot  be  trusted  to  oppose  it"".  |||    So  is  UKIP's  job  to  destroy  the  Tories,  as  former  member  Robert  Kilroy-Silk  once  notoriously  declared?  ""No.  The  aim  of  UKIP  is  to  withdraw  from  the  EU  and  if  it  has  any  relation  to  the  Tories  it  is  to  stiffen  the  Tories'  spine  on  the  issue  by  having  a  large  enough  UKIP  vote  so  that  we  move  the  Tories  in  the  direction  they  are  refusing  to  move.  |||    ""But  it's  not  just  to  shift  the  Tories.  I  think  UKIP  had  a  huge  amount  to  do  with  Tony  Blair's  decision  to  hold  a  referendum  on  the  European  constitution  and  I  think  it  had  a  huge  amount  to  do  with  his  refusal  to  go  into  the  euro"".  And,  while  we  are  on  the  subject  of  Mr  Kilroy-Silk,  Mr  Morris  despatches  him  with  another  of  his  neat  soundbites.  ""Robert  Kilroy  Silk  is  not  a  team  player  -  it  is  a  good  idea  our  party  stands  for  some  thing  and  not  some  one"".  |||    So  what  is  the  big  plan  for  the  general  election.  How  will  he  achieve  the  breakthrough?  ""Look,  we  are  not  going  to  be  forming  the  next  government,""  he  said.  Neither  does  UKIP  have  to  fight  every  seat.  As  with  the  2004  US  presidential  election,  he  says,  the  outcome  will  be  decided  by  a  small  number  of  swing  seats  -  just  as  he  believes  it  will  in  Britain.  So,  with  limited  resources,  the  aim  is  to  target  those  seats  and  end  the  day  with  a  significant  group  in  the  Commons.  He  also  believes  it  is  possible  the  internet  could  have  a  big  part  in  the  poll.  ""The  internet  was  a  decisive  factor  in  the  2004  presidential  election  -  through  blogs  (individuals  posting  their  views  in  online  diaries).  People  just  did  it"".  ""Anything  can  happen  in  the  next  general  election.  There  is  an  inherent  instability  at  the  moment.  ""Labour  and  the  Tories  have  drawn  the  consensus  so  tightly  and  to  the  left  there  is  room  for  another  voice"".  |||    That  might,  he  suggests,  lead  to  a  hung  parliament  with  UKIP  and  others  holding  the  balance  of  power.  It  is  a  huge  task,  surely.  But  there  is  undoubtedly  a  sense  that  the  next  general  election  may  indeed  produce  some  surprises  -  even  while  most  still  believe  it  is  Labour's  for  the  taking.  UKIP's  performance  in  last  year's  European  elections  was  just  such  a  shocker  and  showed  that  Mr  Morris  may  have  a  point  about  the  new  consensus.  And  after  all,  he  has  a  reputation  to  sustain." 

2	"Ministers  'naive'  over  phone-taps  |||    The  government  is  being  naive  by  refusing  to  allow  phone-tap  evidence  in  court,  a  senior  EU  politician  says.  |||    Javier  Solana,  EU  foreign  policy  chief,  says  phone-tap  evidence  works  in  the  courts  of  other  European  countries.  Human  rights  groups,  top  police  officers  and  many  MPs  say  allowing  the  evidence  would  remove  the  need  to  detain  terror  suspects  without  charge.  But  Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  says  the  evidence  would  not  make  much  difference  to  these  cases.  Mr  Solana  told  ITV1's  Jonathan  Dimbleby  programme:  ""[Phone-tap  evidence  in  court]  works,  it  is  normal  that  it  is  done,  it  would  be  naive  not  to  do  it.  ""It  would  be  naive  not  to  use  this  technological  thing  that  we  have  at  our  disposal.""  Mr  Solana's  comments  come  the  day  after  Sir  Ian  Blair,  the  newly-appointed  Metropolitan  Police  commissioner,  said  he  was  in  favour  of  phone-tap  evidence.  |||    Under  the  Anti-Terrorism  Crimes  and  Security  Act  2001,  foreign  terror  suspects  can  be  detained  in  British  jails  without  trial  or  charge.  Several  suspects  have  been  detained  under  these  powers  because  evidence  against  them  was  deemed  too  sensitive  to  be  heard  in  court.  |||    Some  of  this  evidence  is  believed  to  be  telephone  intercepts.  Human  Rights  group  Liberty  has  argued  that  if  intercept  evidence  could  be  heard,  these  detainees  could  be  brought  to  trial.  But  critics  of  phone-tap  trials  say  the  evidence  is  often  weak  and  can  expose  the  methods  of  the  security  services.  The  home  secretary  says  intercepts  would  not  make  much  difference  because  cases  against  terror  suspects  frequently  rely  on  other  kinds  of  surveillance.  But  Mr  Clarke  has  been  forced  to  change  the  regime  of  detention  without  trial  after  Law  Lords  ruled  it  illegal.  He  has  opted  for  a  system  of  ""control  orders""  whereby  suspects,  both  British  and  foreign,  can  be  held  under  house  arrest  or  surveillance.  These  orders  will  again  involve  a  UK  opt-out  of  parts  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights.  While  accepting  that  people  ""have  to  be  prepared""  for  a  possible  terrorist  attack,  Mr  Solana  said  he  had  ""qualms""  about  the  home  secretary's  new  plans.  ""We  have  to  fight  terrorism  with  all  our  means,  but  not  so  far  as  to  change  our  way  of  life,""  he  said." 

0	"Soros  group  warns  of  Kazakh  close  |||    The  Open  Society  Institute  (OSI),  financed  by  billionaire  George  Soros,  has  accused  Kazakhstan  officials  of  trying  to  close  down  its  local  office.  |||    A  demand  for  unpaid  taxes  and  fines  of  $600,000  (£425,000)  is  politically  motivated,  the  OSI  claimed,  adding  that  it  paid  the  money  in  October.  The  organisation  has  found  itself  in  trouble  after  being  accused  of  helping  to  topple  Georgia's  former  president.  It  denies  having  any  role,  but  offices  have  had  to  close  across  the  region.  |||    The  OSI  shut  its  office  in  Moscow  last  year  and  has  withdrawn  from  Uzbekistan  and  Belarus.  In  the  Ukraine  earlier  this  year,  Mr  Soros  -  who  took  on  the  Bank  of  England  in  the  1990s  -  and  won,  was  pelted  by  protestors.  ""This  legal  prosecution  can  be  considered  an  attempt  by  the  government  to  force  Soros  Foundation-Kazakhstan  to  cease  its  activities  in  Kazakhstan  and  shut  its  doors  for  Kazakh  citizens  and  organisations,""  the  OSI  said.  |||    The  OSI  aims  to  promote  democratic  and  open,  market-based  societies.  Since  the  break  up  of  the  Soviet  Union  in  1991,  Kazakhstan  has  been  dominated  by  its  president  Nursultan  Abish-uly  Nazarbayev.  He  has  powers  for  life,  while  insulting  the  president  and  officials  has  been  made  a  criminal  offence.  The  government  controls  the  printing  presses  and  most  radio  and  TV  transmission  facilities.  It  operates  the  country's  national  radio  and  TV  networks.  Recent  elections  were  criticised  as  flawed  and  the  opposition  claimed  there  was  widespread  vote  rigging.  Supporters,  however,  say  he  brings  much  needed  stability  to  a  region  where  Islamic  militancy  is  on  the  rise.  They  also  credit  him  with  promoting  inter-ethnic  accord  and  pushing  through  harsh  reforms." 

2	"Strike  threat  over  pension  plans  |||    Millions  of  public  service  workers  could  strike  if  ministers  scrap  their  final  salary  pension  scheme  and  make  them  work  longer,  warn  union  leaders.  |||    The  Cabinet  Office  has  confirmed  it  is  reviewing  the  current  pension  system,  prompting  unions  representing  4.5m  workers  to  threaten  united  action.  They  believe  the  plans  include  raising  the  mandatory  retirement  age  for  public  service  workers  from  60  to  65.  The  government  says  unions  will  be  consulted  before  any  changes  are  made.  |||    It  is  thought  the  proposed  overhaul,  due  on  Thursday,  could  mean  pensions  could  be  based  on  a  ""career  average""  salary.  For  each  year  served,  staff  currently  get  one  eightieth  of  their  highest  salary  in  the  final  three  years.  Ministers  will  be  anxious  to  avoid  mass  strike  action  in  the  lead-up  to  the  next  general  election,  which  is  widely  expected  next  May.  In  a  statement  on  Sunday,  the  Cabinet  Office  said  it  was  reviewing  the  Civil  Service  Pension  Scheme,  and  hoped  to  announce  proposals  soon.  ""Unions  will  of  course  be  consulted  about  any  proposed  changes.  ""Public  sector  pension  schemes  need  to  remain  affordable  and  sustainable.  People  are  living  longer  and  pensions  are  getting  more  expensive.  ""To  maintain  the  long-term  affordability  of  our  pension  scheme,  the  government  announced  in  its  Green  Paper  on  pensions  that  pension  age  would  rise  from  60  to  65.""  On  Monday,  Tony  Blair's  official  spokesman  declined  to  say  whether  the  prime  minister  backed  the  plans.  He  said:  ""What's  important  is  that  there's  a  process  going  on,  it's  out  for  consultation  at  the  moment,  let's  wait  for  that  process  to  complete  itself.""  |||    There  is  already  widespread  anger  over  the  chancellor's  plans  to  get  rid  of  more  than  100,000  civil  servants.  Now  public  service  unions  are  united  against  the  plans  and  the  Trades  Union  Congress  is  discussing  the  issue  next  Monday.  Dave  Prentis,  general  secretary  of  Unison,  said  changes  to  pension  provisions  for  workers  in  the  public  sector  would  mean  they  had  to  pay  in  more  but  would  still  face  a  raw  deal.  ""Members  working  in  the  NHS  or  for  local  government  have  never  had  high  pay  or  city  bonuses,  but  they  could  look  forward  to  a  decent  pension  -  now  all  that  is  being  taken  away,""  he  said.  ""What  really  riles  me  is  the  breathtaking  hypocrisy  of  MPs  who  recently  voted  themselves  the  best  pension  scheme  in  Europe,  but  say  they  can't  afford  it  for  anyone  else.  ""This  is  a  position  that  Unison  cannot  accept  and  will  oppose.  It  will  lead  to  conflict  between  Unison  and  the  government,  if  not  this  year  then  next.""  |||    Mr  Prentis  said  workers  did  not  want  to  go  on  strike  and  called  for  talks  between  unions  and  the  highest  level  of  government.  Mark  Serwotka,  from  the  Public  and  Commercial  Services  union  said  there  should  be  a  co-ordinated  one  day  strike  unless  there  was  a  government  rethink.  The  Fire  Brigades  Union  said  the  government  was  planning  to  cut  ill  health  retirement  benefits  for  firefighters  and  other  measures  to  chip  away  at  pensions.  Pensions  officer  Paul  Woolstenholmes  said:  ""The  pensions  of  millions  of  public  sector  workers  are  under  threat  -  apart  from  MPs  and  judges  who  have  the  most  generous  pensions  arrangements  in  the  country.""" 

2	"Tories  reject  rethink  on  axed  MP  |||    Sacked  MP  Howard  Flight's  local  Conservative  association  has  insisted  he  will  not  be  its  candidate  at  the  general  election.  |||    Russell  Tanguay,  agent  for  Arundel  and  South  Downs  Tories,  said  Mr  Flight  was  ineligible  to  be  a  candidate  and  the  association  was  seeking  a  substitute.  The  news  comes  despite  Mr  Flight's  allies  saying  they  had  enough  support  to  hold  a  meeting  to  discuss  his  fate.  Mr  Flight  landed  in  trouble  over  remarks  on  Tory  tax  and  spending  plans.  He  quit  as  Tory  deputy  chairman  after  apparently  suggesting  the  Tories  planned  extra  spending  cuts  -  but  he  wants  to  continue  as  an  MP.  |||    Tory  headquarters  says  he  cannot  stand  as  a  Conservative  candidate  because  he  is  no  longer  an  approved  candidate.  Mr  Tanguay  backed  that  view  on  Tuesday,  saying:  ""Howard  Flight  is  ineligible  to  stand  as  a  Conservative  Party  candidate.  ""The  association  is  in  the  process  of  selecting  a  new  candidate.""  |||    But  the  local  Tory  chairman  made  similar  comments  on  Friday  and  dissent  continues.  Two  local  councillors  who  back  Mr  Flight  met  Mr  Tanguay  and  the  local  association's  chairman  in  Arundel  on  Tuesday  afternoon  but  did  not  comment  as  they  left  the  meeting.  Mr  Flight  says  he  will  not  stand  down  as  a  candidate  unless  his  local  party  instructs  him  to  do  so  at  an  extraordinary  general  meeting  (EGM).  The  MP,  who  is  consulting  his  lawyers,  told  BBC  News:  ""They  selected  me  and  they,  if  you  like,  dispose  of  me  or  keep  me.""  Mr  Flight's  supporters  also  say  they  have  the  50  signatures  needed  to  trigger  the  EGM.  |||    At  a  news  conference,  Mr  Howard  insisted  he  had  played  by  the  party's  rules.  The  Tory  leader,  who  argues  he  is  ensuring  honesty,  said:  ""We  do  not  say  one  thing  in  private  and  another  thing  in  public.""  |||    Labour  election  campaign  coordinator  Alan  Milburn  said  the  Tories  were  in  ""turmoil""  because  Mr  Flight  had  exposed  their  hidden  plans.  The  comments  were  not  a  ""one-off"",  he  said,  claiming  Mr  Howard  and  other  senior  Tories  were  obsessively  committed  to  cutting  public  spending.  Liberal  Democrat  chairman  Matthew  Taylor  said:  ""Whilst  I  disagree  with  Howard  Flight's  views,  it  seems  extraordinary  to  sack  somebody  for  telling  the  truth.""  |||    It  has  also  emerged  Mr  Howard  has  suspended  Slough's  constituency  Conservative  association  for  refusing  to  deselect  its  candidate.  Adrian  Hilton  was  abandoned  after  suggesting  the  signing  of  the  Maastricht  Treaty,  under  John  Major's  government,  was  an  act  of  treason.  The  Catholic  Herald  also  highlighted  articles  he  wrote  about  the  role  of  Catholicism  in  the  European  Union.  Mr  Hilton  was  chosen  to  fight  the  seat  after  the  previous  candidate,  Robert  Oulds,  was  sacked  for  being  pictured  with  a  range  of  guns  and  a  hunting  knife.  Slough  Conservative  Association  has  now  been  placed  on  ""support  status""  and  is  being  run  from  Conservative  campaign  headquarters,  says  a  senior  party  spokesman.  |||    Mr  Hilton  on  Tuesday  said  he  was  considering  taking  legal  action  against  his  deposal.  He  said  the  local  party  had  only  learned  of  the  final  decision  on  the  BBC  News  website  on  Monday  evening.  ""There  are  people  at  Central  Office  who  are  behaving  like  little  dictators  and  seemingly  people  who  are  ordinary  members  are  being  treated  with  contempt,""  he  said.  The  party  says  it  did  try  to  contact  the  local  Conservative  chairman."

For  many  economists  and  analysts  they  are  about  ensuring  Europe  doesn't  become  a  global  economic  laggard.  They  are  also  about  ensuring  Europe  can  continue  to  compete  as  an  equal  with  the  growing  economic  giants  of  Asia,  India  and  China,  as  well  as  with  the  economic  might  of  the  United  States.  That's  why  there  was  a  tone  of  urgency  in  the  report,  out  on  Wednesday,  by  the  former  Dutch  prime  minister  Wim  Kok.  Mr  Kok  was  commissioned  by  the  European  Commission  in  March  this  year  to  assess  how  far  the  EU  has  come  towards  meeting  the  Lisbon  targets,  five  years  on  from  their  inception.  His  conclusion  was  simple:  too  many  of  the  targets  will  be  seriously  missed.  |||    Lisbon  risks  becoming  a  ""synonym  for  missed  objectives  and  failed  promises"",  his  report  said.  ""The  status  quo  is  not  an  option.""  |||    At  risk  in  the  medium  to  long  run  is  nothing  less  than  the  sustainability  of  the  society  Europe  has  built,  it  said.  The  report  comes  at  a  time  when  Europe's  competitive  position  is  waning.  The  EU's  economic  growth  rate  is  projected  to  be  2%  this  year  and  2.4%  next.  While  there  has  been  growth  in  overall  employment  rates  in  Europe,  productivity  lags  behind  that  of  the  US.  But  meeting  the  Lisbon  targets  requires  a  political  commitment  that  no  EU  member  state  has  volunteered  so  far.  That  has  in  part  been  due  to  the  state  of  the  global  economy  in  the  past  few  years.  |||    As  Mr  Kok's  report  noted:  ""The  ink  had  scarcely  dried  on  the  [Lisbon]  agreement  before  the  worldwide  stock  market  bubble  imploded.""  ""The  US  suffered  two  years  of  economic  slowdown  and  recession  and  the  European  economy  followed  suit.""  |||    The  circumstances  weren't  conducive  to  creating  the  20  million  new  jobs  promised  by  EU  leaders  in  Lisbon  in  2000.  Neither  were  they  conducive  to  getting  governments  to  spend  more  on  research  and  development,  money  needed  if  the  EU  was  to  meet  its  target  of  becoming  a  so-called  ""knowledge-based  economy"".  ""The  [Lisbon]  vision  is  a  compelling  one,  but  in  order  to  do  it  society  has  to  change,""  said  Paul  Hofheinz  of  the  Lisbon  Council,  a  Brussels-based  citizen  action  group.  ""What  you  find  is  that  a  lot  of  people  have  been  fighting  change.  You  find  trade  unions  fighting  change.  But  also  the  employers'  associations.  ""Even  though  they  tell  you  they're  in  favour  of  change,  many  are  actually  pushing  for  less  competition,  more  subsidy  and  less  free  market  activity.""  |||    But  part  of  the  problem  was  also  linked  to  the  original  targets  set  out  in  Lisbon  five  years  ago.  Targets  have  a  habit  of  coming  back  to  haunt  you  and  in  the  Lisbon  case,  they  covered  too  much,  according  to  the  Wim  report.  Economic  growth  and  job  creation  were  linked  to  issues  ranging  from  environmental  protection  to  social  inclusion,  and  even  safety  at  sea.  The  agenda  was  just  too  broad  and  as  a  result  nothing  was  prioritised.  |||    ""Lisbon  is  about  everything  and  thus  about  nothing,""  the  Kok  report  said.  ""Everybody  is  responsible  and  thus  no  one.""  That's  why  the  Kok  report  recommends  that  the  Lisbon  targets  be  narrowed  down  to  14  key  indicators,  with  an  emphasis  on  creating  jobs  and  economic  growth.  It  also  recommends  that  the  European  Commission  draw  up  a  league  table  which  ranks  countries  according  to  the  steps  they're  taking  towards  meeting  the  targets,  effectively  ""naming,  shaming  and  faming"".  ""Rhetoric  and  delivery  don't  necessarily  go  hand  in  hand,""  Mr  Kok  said  in  a  press  conference  alongside  the  publication  of  his  report.  ""We  don't  have  the  luxury  anymore  just  to  exchange  politeness  with  one  another.""  |||    On  one  point  Mr  Kok  was  very  clear:  The  European  Union  should  not  try  to  emulate  the  US  economy.  The  European  economic  and  social  model  needs  to  change,  but  not  so  much  so  that  social  and  environmental  issues  take  a  backseat  to  economic  growth.  In  that  sense,  the  Lisbon  agenda  is  sailing  into  unchartered  waters.  The  Kok  report  tries  to  do  away  with  a  belief  that  jobs  need  to  be  sacrificed  at  the  altar  of  economic  growth.  ""It's  very  ambitious,""  said  John  Palmer,  political  director  at  the  European  Policy  Centre,  a  Brussels-based  think-tank.  ""This  is  something  that  no  advanced  economy  in  the  world  has  tried  to  do.  It's  going  to  require  quite  new  and  innovative  policies.""  But  some  analysts  believe  that  the  Kok  report  doesn't  come  up  with  the  sort  of  innovative  policies  and  thinking  needed  to  make  the  Lisbon  targets  a  reality.  For  example,  it  recommends  putting  in  place  policies  which  encourage  women  and  older  people  to  remain  in  the  workforce.  But  it  doesn't  say  how  companies  should  be  convinced  to  do  this.  It  will  be  up  to  the  incoming  president  of  the  European  Commission,  Jose  Manuel  Barroso,  to  adopt  Mr  Kok's  recommendations  and  press  them  on  EU  governments.  Mr  Barroso  has  said  that  the  EU's  competitiveness  will  be  his  top  priority.  He  expects  his  five-year  term  in  office  to  be  judged  on  Europe's  success  in  meeting  the  Lisbon  agenda."

After  topping  the  chart  for  two  consecutive  weeks,  Smith's  romantic  comedy  Hitch  dropped  to  second  place  with  takings  of  $21m  (£10.9m).  Keanu  Reeves'  supernatural  thriller  Constantine  dropped  a  place  to  three.  Based  on  the  Hellblazer  comics,  the  film  took  $11.8m  (£6.1m)  on  its  second  week  of  release.

Morrison  is  seen  quizzing  a  college  administrator  on  why  he  was  refused.  ""But  what  happened?  How  come  my  parents  and  the  state  and  the  university  didn't  look  ahead?""  he  is  seen  asking.  |||    ""It's  incredible.  He's  so  clean  cut  and  soft-spoken,""  said  Florida  state  archivist  Jody  Norman.  ""We  know  he  was  at  Florida  State  University  for  a  period  of  time  and  he  did  some  acting  when  he  was  there,""  Norman  added.  The  Doors  were  one  of  the  most  influential  bands  of  the  1960s,  with  hits  including  Light  My  Fire  and  Riders  On  The  Storm.  Morrison  was  notorious  for  his  wild  lifestyle  -  and  was  accused  of  exposing  himself  and  simulating  a  sex  act  at  a  Miami  concert  in  1969.  He  was  found  dead  in  the  bath  of  his  Paris  apartment  and  died  from  heart  problems,  aggravated  by  alcohol.

Last  year,  Crown  Prince  Abdullah,  the  de-facto  ruler,  told  government  departments  to  put  plans  in  place  for  employing  women.  But  progress  has  been  slow,  reports  from  the  country  say.  |||    Earlier  this  week,  the  local  Arab  News  said  Labour  Minister  Ghazi  al-Gosaibi  had  ""caused  uproar""  when  he  said  his  ministry  was  having  difficulty  hiring  women  because  they  demanded  segregated  offices.  The  newspaper  said  many  Saudi  women  found  his  explanation  ""a  pitiful  excuse  for  not  employing  women"".  Women  now  make  up  more  than  half  of  all  graduates  from  Saudi  universities  but  only  5%  of  the  workforce.

The  remaining  $36m  will  be  paid  by  the  directors'  insurers.  But,  a  spokesman  for  the  prosecutor,  New  York  State  Comptroller  Alan  Hevesi,  said  no  formal  agreement  had  been  made.  |||    Corporate  governance  experts  said  that  if  the  directors  do  dip  into  their  own  pockets  for  the  settlement,  it  will  set  a  new  standard  for  the  accountability  of  bosses,  when  the  firms  they  oversee  face  problems.  |||    ""Directors  very  rarely  pay,""  said  Charles  Elson,  chairman  of  the  Center  for  Corporate  Governance  at  the  University  of  Delaware.  He  added  that  the  settlement  ""sends  a  pretty  strong  shockwave  through  the  director  world"".  A  formal  agreement  on  the  payout  is  expected  to  be  signed  on  Thursday  in  a  US  district  court  in  Manhattan.  Earlier,  the  New  York  Times  had  reported  that  the  personal  payments  were  required  as  part  of  any  deal  at  the  start  of  negotiations.  The  ten  former  outside  directors  are  James  Allen,  Judith  Areen,  Carl  Aycock,  Max  Bobbitt,  Clifford  Alexander,  Stiles  Kellett,  Gordon  Macklin,  John  Porter,  Lawrence  Tucker  and  the  estate  of  John  Sidgmore,  who  died  last  year.  It  has  not  yet  been  determined  how  much  each  director  will  have  to  pay.  ""None  of  the  10  former  directors  was  a  direct  participant  in  the  accounting  machinations  of  the  WorldCom  fraud,""  said  the  Wall  Street  Journal  (WSJ).  |||    Two  other  outside  former  directors,  Bert  Roberts  and  Francesco  Galesi,  remain  defendants  in  the  lawsuit,  said  the  newspaper.

The  second-largest  US  long-distance  telecoms  operator  filed  for  bankruptcy  in  2002  when  an  $11bn  accounting  scandal  was  unearthed.

1	"Media  seek  Jackson  'juror'  notes  |||    Reporters  covering  singer  Michael  Jackson's  trial  in  California  have  asked  to  see  questionnaires  completed  by  potential  jurors.  |||    Lawyers  for  news  organisations  said  it  was  ""really  vital""  for  the  responses  of  250  potential  jurors  to  be  made  public  ""to  serve  as  a  check  on  the  process"".  Santa  Barbara  County  Superior  Court  is  due  to  consider  the  request  on  Monday.  Mr  Jackson  denies  child  molestation.  It  is  estimated  his  trial  will  cost  Santa  Barbara  county  up  to  $4m  (£2.13m).  |||    Meanwhile  Michael  Jackson's  mother  has  said  she  is  ""100%  certain""  her  son  did  not  commit  the  child  abuse  charges  he  faces.  The  court  is  currently  selecting  12  jurors  and  eight  stand-by  jurors  for  the  trial,  a  process  delayed  until  at  least  Thursday  after  a  member  of  the  star's  legal  team  was  hit  by  family  illness.  Defence  lawyers  argued  against  the  bid  by  Associated  Press  and  other  news  organisations  to  have  potential  jurors'  responses  made  public.  |||    ""The  release  of  the  completed  jury  questionnaires  does  not  serve  any  purpose  other  than  to  add  to  the  sensationalist  coverage  of  this  case,""  a  motion  by  Mr  Jackson's  lawyers  stated.  The  estimated  total  costs  of  the  trial,  expected  to  last  five  months,  range  from  $2.5m  (£1.33m)  to  $4m  (£2.13m)  of  local  taxpayers'  money.  Those  estimates  do  not  include  costs  to  the  city  of  Santa  Maria,  the  Superior  Court  or  for  the  investigation  and  prosecution  of  the  case.  The  cost  of  security  and  other  needs  around  the  courthouse  has  been  estimated  at  $40,000  (£21,000)  per  day,  said  Jason  Stilwell,  a  special  projects  manager  at  the  county  administrator's  office.  |||    Mr  Jackson,  46,  denies  plying  a  boy  with  alcohol  and  molesting  him.  His  mother  Katherine  Jackson  told  US  TV  network  Fox  News  on  Sunday  that  her  pop  star  son  told  her  he  was  innocent.  ""I  believe  that  for  one  reason  -  I  know  his  character,""  she  said.  ""He  loves  children.  You  don't  molest  anything  that  you  love.""  Describing  Mr  Jackson  as  ""a  good  person"",  the  mother-of-nine  said  she  feared  he  would  not  be  given  a  fair  trial.  ""I  can't  sleep  thinking  about  what  these  wicked  people  might  try  to  do  to  him,""  she  said."

It  is  also  a  debut  nomination  for  Staunton,  49,  who  told  BBC  News  24  she  had  not  thought  the  film  would  appeal  to  Academy  voters.  ""It  was  an  extraordinary  time  making  the  film  and  I  can't  believe  what  has  happened  this  morning,""  she  said.

John  Woodward,  chief  executive  of  the  UK  Film  Council,  said  it  was  ""extremely  heartening""  to  see  British  filmmaking  talent  recognised  on  the  global  stage.  ""Britain  has  a  hugely  talented  industry  and  these  nominations  show  why  National  Lottery  investment  in  film  pays  major  dividends  for  our  culture  and  economy.""  Among  a  total  of  24  British  nominees,  composer  Andrew  Lloyd  Webber  and  lyricist  Charles  Hart  are  up  for  best  original  song  for  Learn  To  Be  Lonely,  from  The  Phantom  of  the  Opera  movie.  |||    Cinematographer  John  Mathieson,  who  was  nominated  for  Gladiator  in  2001,  is  also  up  for  The  Phantom  of  the  Opera.  And  Finding  Neverland  has  garnered  two  more  nominations  for  Brits.  Gemma  Jackson,  who  has  also  worked  on  Bridget  Jones's  Diary  and  Iris,  is  up  for  art  direction  while  costume  designer  Alexandra  Byrne,  whose  previous  films  have  included  Captain  Corelli's  Mandolin  and  Elizabeth,  is  in  the  running.  The  UK  has  two  contenders  in  the  best  live  action  short  film  category.  Wasp  was  made  by  ex-children's  TV  presenter  Andrea  Arnold  while  Little  Terrorist  is  the  work  of  Ashvin  Kumar.  This  year's  awards  will  be  handed  out  in  Hollywood  on  27  February."

The  Mid-Bedfordshire  MP  had  denied  a  claim  that  he  was  paid  for  guiding  visitors  around  the  Palace  of  Westminster.  Conservative  leader  Michael  Howard  has  now  accepted  the  MP's  resignation,  it  has  been  announced.  |||    Mr  Sayeed  was  suspended  from  Parliament  for  two  weeks  last  month  after  the  Commons  standards  and  privileges  committee  said  his  conduct  had  fallen  ""well  below  the  standards  expected"".  The  Conservative  Party  had  already  been  withdrawn  the  whip  for  a  month.  But  his  constituency  association  voted  against  a  move  to  deselect  him,  with  Mr  Sayeed  winning  173  of  the  299  votes.  After  the  vote,  Mr  Sayeed  said  only  a  fifth  of  association  members  had  voted  against  him  and  he  intended  to  get  on  with  winning  the  election.  But  the  vote  prompted  constituency  association  president  Sir  Stanley  Odell  to  resign  in  protest.  The  Standards  and  Privileges  Committee  inquiry  was  launched  after  the  Sunday  Times  alleged  English  Manner  Limited  charged  clients  for  access  to  Westminster  through  Mr  Sayeed.  Mr  Sayeed  had  denied  the  claims,  saying  the  suspension  was  ""unjust  and  wrong""  but  he  made  an  ""unreserved""  apology  to  MPs  in  the  Commons  chamber.  He  insisted  that  the  committee's  report  had  contained  a  ""few  errors  of  fact"".  Mr  Sayeed  has  been  MP  for  Mid-Bedfordshire  since  1997.  He  represented  Bristol  East  from  1983  to  1992."

Swank  triumphed  for  playing  a  gutsy  female  boxer  in  Million  Dollar  Baby.  Modest  wine  country  comedy  Sideways  knocked  out  favourites  Million  Dollar  Baby  and  The  Aviator  by  taking  the  top  prize  for  best  cast  performance.  |||    The  Screen  Actors  Guild  (SAG)  represents  US  film  and  TV  actors.  Its  winners  often  go  on  to  win  Oscars.  In  other  nominations,  Cate  Blanchett  triumphed  as  the  best  supporting  actress  for  her  role  as  Katharine  Hepburn  in  The  Aviator.  Veteran  actor  Morgan  Freeman  took  the  best  supporting  actor  award  for  playing  a  prize-fighter  turned  gym  manager  in  Million  Dollar  Baby.  |||    ""Thank  you  for  Ray  Charles  for  just  living  so  complex  and  so  interesting,  and  making  us  all  just  come  together,""  said  Foxx,  accepting  his  award  in  Los  Angeles  on  Saturday.  |||    He  also  praised  the  film  director:  ""Thank  you  for  Taylor  Hackford  for  taking  a  chance  with  an  African-American  film.  Taylor,  you're  my  director  of  the  year.""  Swank,  too,  was  full  of  praise  for  her  director  and  co-star  Clint  Eastwood.  ""I  bow  down  to  you,""  Swank  said  to  the  74-year-old  Eastwood.  ""You  are  a  talent  beyond  compare.  If  I'm  half  the  person  you  are  and  half  the  talent  you  are  when  I'm  74,  I  will  know  that  I've  accomplished  something  great.""  |||    Both  Foxx  and  Swank  are  now  considered  to  be  among  the  favourites  to  get  Oscars  -  the  Hollywood's  ultimate  prize.  However,  Swank  has  to  overcome  a  strong  challenge  from  Annette  Bening,  a  nominee  for  the  theatre  farce  Being  Julia.  Meanwhile,  ballots  for  Oscars  -  the  Hollywood's  top  honours  -  were  mailed  earlier  this  week  to  members  of  the  Academy  of  Motion  Picture  Arts  and  Sciences.  The  voting  is  due  to  end  on  22  February  -  five  days  before  the  ceremony." 

2	"Hewitt  decries  'career  sexism'  |||    Plans  to  extend  paid  maternity  leave  beyond  six  months  should  be  prominent  in  Labour's  election  manifesto,  the  Trade  and  Industry  Secretary  has  said.  |||    Patricia  Hewitt  said  the  cost  of  the  proposals  was  being  evaluated,  but  it  was  an  ""increasingly  high  priority""  and  a  ""shared  goal  across  government"".  Ms  Hewitt  was  speaking  at  a  gender  and  productivity  seminar  organised  by  the  Equal  Opportunities  Commission  (EOC).  Mothers  can  currently  take  up  to  six  months'  paid  leave  -  and  six  unpaid.  Ms  Hewitt  told  the  seminar:  ""Clearly,  one  of  the  things  we  need  to  do  in  the  future  is  to  extend  the  period  of  payment  for  maternity  leave  beyond  the  first  six  months  into  the  second  six  months.  ""We  are  looking  at  how  quickly  we  can  do  that,  because  obviously  there  are  cost  implications  because  the  taxpayer  reimburses  the  employers  for  the  cost  of  that.""  |||    Ms  Hewitt  also  announced  a  new  drive  to  help  women  who  want  to  work  in  male  dominated  sectors,  saying  sexism  at  work  was  still  preventing  women  reaching  their  full  potential.  Plans  include  funding  for  universities  to  help  female  science  and  engineering  graduates  find  jobs  and  ""taster  courses""  for  men  and  women  in  non-traditional  jobs.  Women  in  full-time  work  earn  19%  less  than  men,  according  to  the  Equal  Opportunities  Commission  (EOC).  |||    The  minister  told  delegates  that  getting  rid  of  ""career  sexism""  was  vital  to  closing  the  gender  pay  gap.  |||    ""Career  sexism  limits  opportunities  for  women  of  all  ages  and  prevents  them  from  achieving  their  full  potential.  ""It  is  simply  wrong  to  assume  someone  cannot  do  a  job  on  the  grounds  of  their  sex,""  she  said.  Earlier,  she  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme:  ""What  we  are  talking  about  here  is  the  fact  that  about  six  out  of  20  women  work  in  jobs  that  are  low-paid  and  typically  dominated  by  women,  so  we  have  got  very  segregated  employment.  ""Unfortunately,  in  some  cases,  this  reflects  very  old-fashioned  and  stereotypical  ideas  about  the  appropriate  jobs  for  women,  or  indeed  for  men.  ""Career  sexism  is  about  saying  that  engineering,  for  instance,  where  only  10%  of  employees  are  women,  is  really  a  male-dominated  industry.  Construction  is  even  worse.  ""But  it  is  also  about  saying  childcare  jobs  are  really  there  for  women  and  not  suitable  for  men.  Career  sexism  goes  both  ways.""  |||    She  added  that  while  progress  had  been  made,  there  was  still  a  gap  in  pay  figures.  ""The  average  woman  working  full-time  is  being  paid  about  80p  for  every  pound  a  man  is  earning.  For  women  working  part-time  it  is  60p.""  The  Department  for  Trade  and  Industry  will  also  provide  funding  to  help  a  new  pay  experts  panel  run  by  the  TUC.  |||    It  has  been  set  up  to  advise  hundreds  of  companies  on  equal  wage  policies.  Research  conducted  by  the  EOC  last  year  revealed  that  many  Britons  believe  the  pay  gap  between  men  and  women  is  the  result  of  ""natural  differences""  between  the  sexes.  Women  hold  less  than  10%  of  the  top  positions  in  FTSE  100  companies,  the  police,  the  judiciary  and  trade  unions,  according  to  their  figures.  And  retired  women  have  just  over  half  the  income  of  their  male  counterparts  on  average."

Another  1,700  will  go  from  its  sales  department,  3,400  from  business  operations  and  2,600  across  legal,  advertising  and  public  relations.  SBC  currently  employs  163,000  people  while  AT&T  employs  47,000.  The  takeover  was  announced  on  Monday.  The  deal  will  be  financed  with  $15bn  of  shares  as  well  as  a  $1bn  special  dividend  paid  to  AT&T  shareholders.  |||    It  effectively  marks  the  end  of  AT&T,  which  was  founded  in  1875  by  telephone  pioneer  Alexander  Graham  Bell  and  is  one  of  the  US's  best-known  companies.  SBC  and  AT&T  said  estimated  cost  savings  of  at  least  $2bn  from  2008  were  a  main  driver  for  the  merger.  AT&T  is  a  long-distance  telecoms  firm,  while  SBC  is  mainly  focused  on  the  local  market  in  the  western  US.  Both  also  have  data  network  businesses.  The  takeover  is  subject  to  approval  by  AT&T's  shareholders  and  regulators.  The  companies  said  they  expected  to  complete  the  agreement  during  the  first  half  of  2006."

The  full  economic  costs  of  the  disaster  remain  unclear.  In  part,  this  is  because  of  its  scale,  and  because  delivering  aid  and  recovering  the  dead  remain  priorities.  But  Indonesian,  Indian  and  Hong  Kong  stock  markets  reached  record  highs  on  Wednesday,  suggesting  that  investors  do  not  fear  a  major  economic  impact.  |||    The  highs  showed  the  gap  in  outlook  between  investors  in  large  firms  and  individuals  who  have  lost  their  livelihoods.  |||    Investors  seemed  to  feel  that  some  of  the  worst-affected  areas  -  such  as  Aceh  in  Indonesia  -  were  so  under-developed  that  the  tragedy  would  little  impact  on  Asia's  listed  companies,  according  to  analysts.  ""Obviously  with  a  lot  of  loss  of  life,  a  lot  of  time  is  needed  to  clean  up  the  mess,  bury  the  people  and  find  the  missing.  But  it's  not  necessarily  a  really  big  thing  in  the  economic  sense,""  said  ABN  Amro  chief  Asian  strategist  Eddie  Wong.  India's  Bombay  Stock  Exchange  inched  slightly  above  its  previous  record  close  on  Wednesday.  Expectations  of  strong  corporate  earnings  in  2005  drove  the  Indonesian  stock  exchange  in  Jakarta  to  a  record  high  on  Wednesday.  In  Hong  Kong,  the  Hang  Seng  index  may  be  benefiting  in  part  from  the  potential  for  its  listed  property  companies  to  gain  from  rebuilding  contracts  in  the  tsunami-affected  regions  of  South  East  Asia.  In  Sri  Lanka,  some  economists  have  said  that  as  much  as  1%  of  annual  growth  may  be  lost.  Sri  Lanka's  stock  market  has  fallen  about  5%  since  the  weekend,  but  it  is  still  40%  higher  than  at  the  start  of  2004.  |||    Thailand  may  lose  30bn  baht  (£398m;  $768m)  in  earnings  from  tourism  over  the  next  three  months,  according  to  tourism  minister  Sontaya  Kunplome.  |||    In  the  affected  provinces,  he  expects  the  loss  of  tourism  revenue  to  be  offset  by  government  reconstruction  spending.  Thailand  intends  to  spend  a  similar  sum  -  around  30bn  baht  -  on  the  rebuilding  work.  ""It  will  take  until  the  fourth  quarter  of  next  year  before  tourist  visitors  in  Phuket  and  five  other  provinces  return  to  their  normal  level,""  said  Naris  Chaiyasoot,  director  general  at  the  ministry's  fiscal  policy  office.  In  the  Maldives  the  cost  of  reconstruction  could  wipe  out  economic  growth,  according  to  a  government  spokesman.  ""Our  nation  is  in  peril  here,""  said  Ahmed  Shaheed,  the  chief  government  spokesman.  He  estimated  the  economic  cost  of  the  disaster  at  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars.  The  Maldives  has  gross  domestic  product  of  $660m.  ""It  won't  be  surprising  if  the  cost  exceeds  our  GDP,""  he  said.  ""In  the  last  few  years,  we  made  great  progress  in  our  standard  of  living  -  the  United  Nations  recognised  this.  Now  we  see  this  can  disappear  in  a  few  days,  a  few  minutes.""  Shaheed  noted  that  investment  in  a  single  tourist  resort  -  the  economic  mainstay  -  could  run  to  $40m.  Between  10  and  12  of  the  80-odd  resorts  have  been  severely  damaged,  and  a  similar  number  have  suffered  significant  damage.  However,  many  experts,  including  the  World  Bank,  have  pointed  out  that  it  is  still  difficult  to  assess  the  magnitude  of  the  disaster  and  its  likely  economic  impact." 

1	"Brits  return  Keane  to  number  one  |||    Brits  success  has  helped  return  Keane's  award-winning  album  Hopes  and  Fears  back  to  the  top  of  the  UK  album  chart.  |||    The  debut  album,  which  took  the  best  British  album  title  at  the  Brits  on  Tuesday,  moved  up  seven  places  from  number  eight  to  number  one.  Also  capitalising  on  Brits  success  were  the  Scissor  Sisters  whose  eponymous  album  moved  three  places  to  number  two.  U2's  latest  single  Sometimes  You  Can't  Make  It  On  Your  Own  took  the  top  spot  in  the  singles  chart,  ahead  of  Elvis.  The  track,  from  their  current  album  How  To  Dismantle  An  Atomic  Bomb,  pushed  Eminem's  Like  Toy  Soldiers  from  number  one  to  number  three.  |||    Elvis'  Wooden  Heart,  which  entered  the  chart  at  number  two,  is  the  sixth  in  a  series  of  18  reissues  to  mark  the  70th  anniversary  of  Presley's  birth.  There  are  currently  six  re-released  Elvis'  tracks  occupying  spots  in  the  top  40  singles  chart  including  Are  You  Lonesome  Tonight  at  number  20,  It's  Now  or  Never  at  number  27  and  Jailhouse  Rock  at  number  37.  Soldier,  by  Destiny's  Child,  Ti  and  Lil  Wayne,  debuted  at  number  four,  while  Almost  Here,  the  duet  from  former  Westlife  star  Brian  McFadden  and  Delta  Goodrem,  fell  from  number  three  to  number  five.  There  was  more  follow  up  to  Brits  success  for  Franz  Ferdinand  won  best  rock  act  and  best  British  group  last  week.  Their  self-titled  album  moved  from  13  to  number  four.  Last  week's  number  one  album  Tourist,  by  Athlete,  fell  to  number  three." 

2	"UK  rebate  'unjustified'  -  Chirac  |||    French  president  Jacques  Chirac  has  called  the  UK's  £3bn  rebate  from  the  European  Union  ""unjustified"".  |||    Speaking  after  a  summit  meeting  he  said  unless  it  was  put  up  for  discussion  the  EU  would  never  be  able  to  reach  agreement  on  its  medium  term  finances.  Earlier  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw  said  the  UK  was  prepared  to  veto  any  bid  to  reduce  the  rebate  secured  by  Margaret  Thatcher  in  1984.  He  said  it  remained  justified  because  less  EU  farm  money  came  to  the  UK.  |||    Mr  Chirac  told  reporters  in  Brussels:  ""One  can  only  have  a  reasonable  budgetary  balance  if  we  put  back  on  the  table  the  British  cheque.  It  can  no  longer  be  justified.  It  was  from  the  past.""  But  a  UK  Government  official  responded:  ""Even  with  the  rebate,  the  UK  pays  two  and  a  half  times  more  than  France  contributes  to  the  EU  budget.  Without  it  we  would  pay  14  times  as  much  as  France.  ""There  can  be  no  deal  on  future  financing  which  does  not  protect  the  rebate.""  |||    The  25-member  EU  is  gearing  up  for  tough  negotiations  on  its  budget  plans  for  the  period  2007-2013,  with  the  bloc's  Luxembourg  presidency  hoping  to  strike  a  deal  at  a  June  summit.  Earlier  Conservative  Graham  Brady  said  the  rebate  was  a  ""crucial  test""  of  how  firmly  ministers  were  prepared  to  stand  up  for  Britain.  EU  Commission  president  Jose  Manuel  Barroso  has  indicated  he  wants  the  rebate  to  come  to  an  end.  Mr  Straw  said  that  as  well  as  the  veto  over  the  rebate  the  UK  wanted  to  keep  a  tight  rein  on  national  contributions.  |||    The  UK,  France,  Germany,  Austria,  the  Netherlands  and  Sweden  want  the  EU  budget  to  be  capped  at  1%  of  member  states'  combined  national  incomes  -  the  European  Commission  has  urged  an  increase  to  1.26%.  Mr  Straw  has  said  the  EU  commission's  proposal  would  mean  a  35%  hike  in  the  budget.  Shadow  Europe  minister  Mr  Brady  said:  ""I  believe  it  is  essential  that  Britain  keeps  the  rebate  and  I  think  it's  a  crucial  test  of  how  firmly  the  British  government  is  prepared  to  stand  up  for  Britain  internationally  in  Europe.  |||    ""The  UK  is  already  one  of  the  biggest  net  contributors  to  the  EU  .""  The  foreign  secretary  meanwhile  said  the  ""justice""  of  the  rebate  remained.  ""We  have  one  of  the  lowest  net  receipts  of  any  EU  country  because  of  the  relatively  small  size  of  our  agriculture  sector  and  its  efficiency.  ""That  continues  to  be  the  case.""  |||    UK  Independence  Party  leader  Roger  Knapman  said  the  rebate  was  ""set  in  stone""  and  there  was  no  reason  to  negotiate  about  it.  ""It  is  extraordinary  to  do  it  at  this  time,  just  as  we  are  becoming  the  biggest  contributor  to  the  EU.  If  we  lose  our  rebate  as  well,  the  British  taxpayer  is  going  to  be  bled  at  such  a  rate  that  I  think  everyone  will  go  off  the  European  project.""  EU  leaders  are  holding  talks  in  Brussels  on  how  to  re-energise  the  sluggish  European  economy.  UK  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  is  meeting  his  EU  counterparts  to  finalise  a  package  of  measures  aimed  at  stimulating  growth  and  boosting  employment  ahead  of  a  series  of  referendums  on  the  European  Constitution.  The  plans  could  introduce  a  free  market  into  everything  from  computer  services  to  construction.  Critics  -  including  Germany  and  France  -  believe  liberalisation  could  result  in  companies  shifting  staff  to  cheaper  bases  in  Eastern  Europe,  undercutting  large  EU  economies  and  undermining  social  protections.  There  are  also  concerns  about  the  number  of  workers  from  eastern  European  countries  who  will  head  west,  exacerbating  the  already  high  unemployment  levels  in  Germany.  |||    Mr  Straw  insisted  there  was  nothing  to  fear  from  the  services  directorate.  ""European  countries  overall  have  benefited  hugely  from  the  free  market  in  goods,""  he  said.  ""What  we  are  now  talking  about  is  developing  that  market  into  an  internal  market  in  services.""  Britain's  low  unemployment  meant  there  was  less  ""neurosis""  about  people  coming  from  eastern  European  countries.  ""In  countries  like  Germany  and  France,  where  frankly  because  of  a  tighter  social  market  they  have  much  higher  levels  of  unemployment,  there  is  increasing  anxiety  about  other  people  coming  in,""  he  said." 

3	"Italy  aim  to  rattle  England  |||    Italy  coach  John  Kirwan  believes  his  side  can  upset  England  as  the  Six  Nations  wooden  spoon  battle  hots  up.  |||    The  two  sides,  both  without  a  win,  meet  on  12  March  at  Twickenham  and  Kirwan  says  his  side  will  be  hoping  to  make  the  most  of  England's  current  slump.  ""We  have  to  make  sure  the  England  and  France  games  are  tough  for  them.  ""England  have  not  been  having  the  best  of  championships.  That  is  a  big  one  for  us  and  them  and  I  am  sure  my  players  will  rise  to  the  occasion,""  he  said.  But  Kirwan  admits  that  a  lot  of  hard  work  will  be  needed  with  his  kickers  before  the  trip  to  London.  Roland  de  Marigny  and  Luciano  Orquera  had  a  miserable  time  with  the  boot  in  the  dire  defeat  to  Scotland  as  Chris  Paterson  stole  the  show  to  give  the  hosts  a  much-needed  18-10  victory.  Kirwan  said:  ""The  kicking  was  the  decisive  factor  in  Scotland  which  cost  us  and  it  could  go  down  to  the  kicking  again  next  time.  ""But  I  have  a  lot  of  confidence  in  my  players  and  I  am  positive  we  can  put  everything  together  against  England.""  England,  meanwhile,  are  licking  their  wounds  and  rueing  what  might  have  been  had  two  decisions  from  referee  Jonathan  Kaplan  not  gone  against  them  in  the  second  half  in  Dublin.  First  Mark  Cueto  was  judged  offside  as  he  chased  fly-half  Charlie  Hodgson's  kick,  and  then  Kaplan  opted  not  to  call  upon  video  evidence  to  see  if  Josh  Lewsey  had  touched  down  after  being  driven  over  Ireland's  line.  |||    But  centre  Jamie  Noon  believes  the  side  at  least  showed  better  form  than  their  previous  two  defeats.  ""We  definitely  improved  against  an  in-form  Irish  side,""  he  said.  ""We  went  to  Dublin  quietly  confident  that  we  would  be  able  to  compete,  and  I  think  we  showed  that.  ""We  have  got  to  make  sure  we  now  take  the  form  and  positives  into  the  Italy  game.  We  are  under  no  illusions  that  it  is  going  to  be  easy,  but  we  definitely  need  a  win.""  England  have  now  equalled  an  18-year  low  of  four  successive  championship  defeats,  including  France  in  Paris  last  season,  and  have  lost  four  in  a  row  under  Andy  Robinson.  His  predecessor,  Sir  Clive  Woodward,  began  his  seven-year  reign  with  three  defeats  and  two  draws."

He  said  not  holding  the  awards  would  be  counter  to  the  work  the  magazine  has  done  to  promote  hip  hop  music.  Rapper  Young  Buck  has  been  charged  after  allegedly  stabbing  a  man  who  hit  Dr  Dre  as  he  was  about  to  receive  a  lifetime  achievement  award.  |||    The  rapper,  whose  real  name  is  David  Darnell  Brown,  is  due  in  court  on  20  December  after  being  arrested  on  one  charge  of  attempted  murder  and  a  second  charge  of  assault  with  a  deadly  weapon.  The  performer  is  one  of  the  members  of  50  Cent's  G-Unit  group,  which  is  signed  to  Dr  Dre's  record  label.  The  man  who  was  stabbed,  Jimmy  James  Johnson,  suffered  a  collapsed  lung  and  is  in  a  stable  condition  at  a  Los  Angeles  hospital.  Mr  Johnson  allegedly  approached  Dr  Dre,  who  was  seated  at  a  table  in  front  of  the  stage,  and  appeared  to  ask  for  an  autograph  before  punching  him.  During  the  ensuing  scuffle  -  which  involved  many  of  the  1,000-strong  crowd  -  Mr  Johnson  was  stabbed  as  he  was  being  dragged  away  by  security  staff,"

Mr  Brown  has  just  returned  from  a  tour  of  African  nations.  The  £1bn  commitment  is  part  of  a  five-point  plan  on  debt  relief,  trade,  aid,  education  and  health.  |||    The  chancellor  was  speaking  at  an  event  jointly  organised  by  the  UK's  Department  for  International  Development  and  the  UN  Development  Programme  on  Wednesday.  Mr  Brown  welcomed  news  that  the  Bill  Gates  Foundation  and  Norway  are  joining  up  to  put  an  extra  £0.53bn  ($1bn  )  into  the  Global  Alliance  for  Vaccines  and  Immunisation  (Gavi).  Britain,  France,  Gavi  and  the  Gates  Foundation  have  drawn  up  proposals  to  apply  the  principles  of  the  International  Finance  Facility  (IFF)  to  the  area  of  immunisation.  That  could  see  donors  making  long-term,  legally  binding  financial  commitments  which  can  then  be  used  as  collateral  for  raising  extra  funds  from  international  capital  markets.  As  well  as  pledging  £960m  over  15  years  to  the  immunisation  IFF,  Britain  urged  other  donors  to  contribute.  |||    If  Gavi  could  increase  its  funding  for  immunisation  by  an  extra  £4bn  ($7.4bn)  over  10  years,  then  an  extra  five  million  lives  could  have  been  saved  by  2015  and  five  million  thereafter,  Mr  Brown  argued.  Campaign  groups  including  Friends  of  the  Earth,  the  World  Development  Movement,  and  War  on  Want  said  UK  government  policy  on  free  trade  was  a  major  barrier  to  fighting  poverty.  War  on  Want's  John  Hilary  said:  ""Compassionate  rhetoric  cannot  disguise  the  reality  of  the  government's  neo-liberal  policies.  ""As  long  as  Mr  Blair  and  Mr  Brown  continue  to  push  free  trade  and  privatisation  on  developing  countries,  more  and  more  people  will  be  pushed  deeper  into  poverty,  not  lifted  out  of  it.""" 

1	"Pop  band  Busted  to  'take  a  break'  |||    Chart-topping  pop  band  Busted  have  confirmed  that  they  plan  to  ""take  a  break"",  following  rumours  that  they  were  on  the  verge  of  splitting.  |||    A  statement  from  the  band's  record  company  Universal  said  frontman  Charlie  Simpson  planned  to  spend  some  time  working  with  his  other  band,  Fightstar.  However  they  said  that  Busted  would  ""reconvene  in  due  course"".  The  band  have  had  eight  top  three  hits,  including  four  number  ones,  since  they  first  hit  the  charts  in  2002.  Their  singles  include  What  I  Go  To  School  For,  Year  3000,  Crashed  The  Wedding,  You  Said  No,  and  Who's  David?  |||    The  band,  which  also  includes  members  Matt  Jay  and  James  Bourne,  made  the  top  ten  with  their  self-titled  debut  album,  as  well  as  the  follow-up,  A  Present  For  Everyone,  in  2003.  They  won  best  pop  act  and  best  breakthrough  act  at  the  2004  Brit  Awards  and  were  nominated  for  best  British  group.  Most  recently  they  topped  the  charts  with  the  theme  from  the  live-action  film  version  of  Thunderbirds,  which  was  voted  Record  Of  The  Year  on  the  ITV1  show.  The  band  have  capitalised  on  a  craze  for  artists  playing  catchy  pop  music  with  rock  overtones.  The  trio  are  seen  as  an  alternative  to  more  manufactured  artists  who  are  not  considered  credible  musicians  because  they  do  not  write  their  own  songs  or  play  their  own  instruments.  However,  recent  rumours  have  suggested  that  Simpson  has  been  wanting  to  quit  the  band  to  focus  on  Fightstar.  He  now  plans  to  take  Fightstar  on  tour."

He  plans  to  stand  in  the  next  general  election  but  refused  to  confirm  he  is  setting  up  a  new  political  party  called  Veritas  -  Latin  for  truth.  UKIP  leader  Roger  Knapman  said  he  would  ""break  open  the  champagne"",  adding:  ""It  was  nice  knowing  him,  now  'goodbye'.""  However,  he  did  say  the  ex-chat  show  host  had  been  ""quite  useful  initially"".  ""He  has  remarkable  ability  to  influence  people  but,  sadly,  after  the  (European)  election  it  became  clear  that  he  was  more  interested  in  the  Robert  Kilroy-Silk  Party  than  the  UK  Independence  Party  so  it  was  nice  knowing  him,  now  'goodbye',""  Mr  Knapman  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme.  Mr  Knapman  rejected  the  idea  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  posed  a  threat  to  UKIP  and  queried  why  he  had  failed  to  confirm  rumours  he  was  starting  a  new  political  party.  |||    Mr  Kilroy-Silk  explained  his  reasons  to  his  East  Midlands  constituents  at  a  meeting  in  Hinckley,  Leicestershire.  His  decision  came  as  UKIP  officials  began  a  process  which  could  have  triggered  Mr  Kilroy-Silk's  expulsion.  It  marks  the  end  of  his  membership  of  UKIP  after  just  nine  months.  It  began  with  a  flood  of  publicity  which  helped  UKIP  into  third  place  in  last  June's  European  elections  but  became  dominated  by  rancour  as  he  tried  to  take  over  the  party  leadership.  |||    Mr  Kilroy-Silk  accused  his  fellow  UKIP  MEPs  of  being  content  with  growing  fat  ""sitting  on  their  backsides""  in  Brussels.  He  told  BBC  News  24:  ""I  tried  to  change  the  party,  I  nagged  all  the  way  through  the  summer  to  do  things,  to  get  moving  because  I  thought  it  was  criminal  what  they  were  doing,  it  was  a  betrayal.""  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  also  told  Sky  News  there  was  ""masses  of  support""  for  him  to  form  a  new  party  -  something  he  has  yet  to  confirm  will  happen.  |||    UKIP  won  12  seats  and  16.1%  of  the  vote  at  the  European  elections  on  the  back  of  its  call  for  the  UK  to  leave  the  European  Union  In  his  speech,  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  says  the  result  offered  UKIP  an  ""amazing  opportunity""  but  the  party's  leadership  had  done  nothing  and  ""gone  AWOL"".  There  were  no  policies,  no  energy,  no  vision  and  no  spokespeople,  he  said.  ""The  party  is  going  nowhere  and  I'm  embarrassed  with  its  allies  in  Europe  and  I'm  ashamed  to  be  a  member  of  the  party,""  said  Mr  Kilroy-Silk.  |||    He  said  his  conviction  in  Britain's  right  to  govern  itself  had  not  changed.  He  would  continue  that  campaign  outside  UKIP  when  he  contested  the  general  election  in  an  East  Midlands  constituency.  Reports  of  his  new  party  plans  have  prompted  a  formal  complaint  to  UKIP's  disciplinary  committee  for  bringing  the  party  into  ""disrepute"".  On  Thursday,  the  party  challenged  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  to  stand  down  as  an  MEP  so  voters  can  get  a  genuine  UKIP  candidate."

The  original  film,  released  in  1980,  has  spawned  ten  sequels  based  around  mask-wearing  murderer  Jason  Voorhees.  The  most  recent,  Freddy  Vs  Jason,  was  released  in  summer  2003.  That  film  saw  Jason  battle  Freddy  Krueger,  star  of  the  Nightmare  on  Elm  Street  franchise.  According  to  the  industry  newspaper,  New  Line  had  been  trying  to  make  another  sequel  involving  Ash,  the  hero  of  the  Evil  Dead  movies,  but  was  unable  to  agree  terms  with  director  Sam  Raimi.  Tarantino  is  said  to  be  intrigued  by  the  prospect  of  building  a  new  film  around  one  of  the  horror  genre's  most  recognised  figures.  First,  however,  he  is  scheduled  to  direct  the  season  finale  of  US  television  series  CSI:  Crime  Scene  Investigation.  Filming  is  due  to  start  in  early  April.  Tarantino's  episode,  for  which  he  also  wrote  the  original  story,  will  be  broadcast  in  the  US  on  19  May." 

1	"The  Sound  of  Music  is  coming  home  |||    The  original  stage  production  of  The  Sound  of  Music  is  to  be  performed  for  the  first  time  in  the  Austrian  capital,  40  years  after  the  film  was  released.  |||    The  first  full-scale  theatrical  production  of  the  musical  will  make  its  debut  in  Vienna  on  Saturday.  Julie  Andrews  starred  in  the  1965  film  version  of  the  Rogers  and  Hammerstein  classic  set  in  the  Alpine  country.  But  despite  being  one  of  the  most  successful  musicals  of  all  time,  it  is  barely  known  inside  Austria.  |||    The  film  was  never  shown  in  any  cinema  in  Austria  and  was  not  broadcast  on  television  until  the  early  1990s.  The  musical  is  based  on  the  true  story  of  the  von  Trapp  family  who  formed  a  singing  troupe  and  escaped  from  Nazi-occupied  Austria  in  1938.  |||    Sensitivities  about  Nazism  during  wartime  Austria  and  issues  towards  the  von  Trapp  family  themselves  could  explain  Austria's  reluctance  to  embrace  the  musical.  Another  source  of  irritation  for  Austrians  is  the  song  Edelweiss,  which  is  considered  an  traditional  folk  song  by  many  filmgoers.  The  song  was  actually  an  invention  by  Rodgers  and  Hammerstein.  Many  also  consider  the  film  to  portray  a  kitsch  image  of  Austria,  including  yodelling,  goat-herds  and  lederhosen.  The  production  is  being  staged  at  a  Viennese  opera  house,  the  Volksoper,  beginning  on  Saturday.  Maria,  the  novice  nun  who  falls  in  love  with  Baron  von  Trapp,  will  be  played  by  Austro-Australian  actress  and  singer  Sandra  Pires." 

1	"Star  Trek  fans  fight  to  save  show  |||    Star  Trek  fans  have  taken  out  a  full-page  ad  in  the  Los  Angeles  Times  in  an  attempt  to  persuade  TV  executives  not  to  scrap  Star  Trek:  Enterprise.  |||    Made  by  the  UPN  TV  network,  the  latest  spin-off  from  the  hit  sci-fi  show  is  due  to  end  in  May  after  four  series.  But  fans  around  the  world  have  pitched  in  to  pay  for  the  advert,  which  had  the  headline  ""Save  Star  Trek"".  They  are  also  asking  the  Sci-Fi  Channel  to  pick  it  up  from  UPN  and  will  stage  a  rally  in  Los  Angeles  on  25  February.  |||    The  advert  described  the  Star  Trek  franchise  as  a  ""cultural  icon"".  Enterprise  stars  former  Quantum  Leap  actor  Scott  Bakula  as  Captain  Archer  and  is  set  before  the  original  1960s  Star  Trek  series.  ""Captain  Archer  and  the  crew  of  the  NX-01  need  your  help  to  continue  their  journeys!""  the  advert  said.  It  also  included  a  cut-out  coupon  for  fans  to  send  to  UPN's  parent  companies  Paramount  and  Viacom  plus  the  Sci-Fi  Channel.  It  also  urged  supporters  to  join  the  rally  outside  the  Paramount  studios.  |||    Fan  website  Trek  United  is  hoping  to  raise  $32m  (£17m)  from  donations  by  the  end  of  March  to  pay  for  a  fifth  series.  More  than  $23,000  (£12,000)  has  been  pledged  so  far,  according  to  the  site.  The  98th  and  final  episode  of  Star  Trek:  Enterprise  will  air  in  the  US  on  13  May.  The  fourth  series  has  averaged  2.9  million  viewers  per  episode  -  half  the  amount  it  got  in  its  first  series.  Star  Trek:  Enterprise  began  in  2001  following  other  Star  Trek  spin-off  series  The  Next  Generation,  Deep  Space  Nine  and  Voyager."

And  its  owner,  P&O  Cruises  -  now  part  of  the  huge  US  Carnival  Corporation  -  was  looking  at  a  significant  slice  chopped  off  this  year's  profits  and  a  potential  PR  fiasco.  No-one,  however,  seems  to  have  told  the  stock  markets.  The  warning  of  a  five-cent  hit  to  2005  earnings  came  just  24  hours  after  one  of  the  world's  biggest  investment  banks  had  upped  its  target  for  Carnival's  share  price,  from  £35  to  £36.20.  Other  investors  barely  blinked,  and  by  1300  GMT  Carnival's  shares  in  London  were  down  a  single  penny,  or  0.03%,  at  £32.26.  |||    Why  the  mismatch  between  the  public  perception  and  the  market's  response?  ""The  Aurora  issue  had  been  an  ongoing  one  for  some  time,""  says  Deutsche  Bank's  Simon  Champion.  ""It  was  clearly  a  source  of  uncertainty  for  the  company  -  it  was  a  long  cruise,  after  all.  But  the  stock  market  is  very  good  at  treating  these  issues  as  one-off  events.""  |||    Despite  its  string  of  bad  luck,  he  pointed  out,  Aurora  is  just  one  vessel  in  a  large  Carnival  fleet,  the  UK's  P&O  Princess  group  having  been  merged  into  the  much  larger  US  firm  in  2003.  And  generally  speaking,  Carnival  has  a  reputation  for  keeping  its  ships  pretty  much  on  schedule.  ""Carnival  has  an  incredibly  strong  track  record,""  Mr  Champion.  |||    Similarly,  analysts  expect  the  impact  on  the  rest  of  the  cruise  business  to  be  limited.  The  hundreds  of  disappointed  passengers  who  have  now  had  to  give  up  the  opportunity  to  spend  the  next  three  months  on  the  Aurora  have  got  both  a  refund  and  a  credit  for  another  cruise.  That  should  mitigate  some  of  the  PR  risk,  both  for  Carnival  and  its  main  competitor,  Royal  Caribbean.  ""While  not  common,  cancellations  for  technical  reasons  are  not  entirely  unusual  in  the  industry,""  wrote  analysts  from  Citigroup  Smith  Barney  in  a  note  to  clients  on  Friday.  ""Moreover,  such  events  typically  have  a  limited  impact  on  bookings  and  pricing  for  future  cruises.""  After  all,  the  Aurora  incident  may  be  big  news  in  the  UK  -  but  for  Carnival  customers  elsewhere  it's  unlikely  to  make  too  much  of  a  splash.  |||    Assuming  that  Citigroup  is  right,  and  demand  stays  solid,  the  structure  of  the  industry  also  works  in  Carnival's  favour.  In  the  wake  of  P&O  Princess's  takeover  by  Carnival,  the  business  is  now  to  a  great  extent  a  duopoly.  Given  the  expense  of  building,  outfitting  and  running  a  cruise  ship,  ""slowing  supply  growth""  is  a  certainty,  said  David  Anders  at  Merrill  Lynch  on  Thursday.  In  other  words,  if  you  do  want  a  cruise,  your  options  are  limited.  And  with  Carnival  remaining  the  market  leader,  it  looks  set  to  keep  selling  the  tickets  -  no  matter  what  happens  to  the  ill-fated  Aurora  in  the  future."

Instead  of  taxpayers  having  to  pick  up  the  bill,  the  FER  wants  Congressmen  to  change  the  PBGC's  funding  rules.  The  FER  says  firms  should  not  have  been  allowed  to  reduce  the  insurance  premiums  they  pay  into  the  PBGC  fund.  The  FER  blames  this  on  a  2004  law,  in  a  statement  signed  by  several  members,  who  include  Nobel  economics  laureate  William  Sharpe.  It  said  it  was  ""dismayed""  at  the  situation  and  wants  Congress  to  overturn  the  legislation.  |||    Cash-strapped  US  companies,  including  those  in  the  airline,  car-making  and  steel  industries,  had  argued  in  favour  of  the  2004  rule  change,  claiming  that  funding  the  insurance  premiums  adequately  would  force  them  to  have  to  cut  jobs.  ""With  a  little  firmer  hand  on  the  pensions  issues  in  the  US,  I  think  that  Congress  could  avoid  having  to  turn  to  the  taxpayer  and  instead  turn  the  obligations  back  onto  the  companies  that  deserve  to  pay  them,""  said  Professor  Dennis  Logue,  dean  of  Price  College  of  Business  at  the  University  of  Oklahoma.  The  PBGC  was  founded  in  1974  to  protect  workers'  retirement  rights.  Its  most  recent  action  came  last  week  when  it  took  control  of  the  pilots'  pension  scheme  at  United  Airlines.  With  United  battling  bankruptcy,  the  carrier  had  wanted  to  use  the  money  set  aside  for  pensions  to  finance  running  costs.  The  company  has  an  estimated  $2.9bn  hole  in  its  pilots'  pension  scheme,  which  the  PBGC  will  now  guarantee."

He  won  a  Grammy  in  1998  and  is  nominated  for  two  more  this  year.  The  13  February  ceremony  will  also  include  a  rendition  of  The  Beatles'  Across  The  Universe  by  Bono,  Stevie  Wonder,  Norah  Jones  and  Brian  Wilson.  The  song  will  go  on  sale  online  to  raise  money  for  the  tsunami  aid  effort.  The  awards  show  will  also  feature  performances  from  U2,  Green  Day,  Alicia  Keys  and  Kanye  West  -  but  the  Lopez  and  Anthony  duet  is  likely  to  be  one  of  the  biggest  talking  points.  |||    Anthony,  born  in  New  York  to  a  Puerto  Rican  family,  is  reported  to  be  the  biggest-selling  salsa  artist  of  all  time.  He  is  nominated  this  year  for  best  Latin  pop  album  and  best  salsa/merengue  album.  The  tsunami  tribute  song  will  also  feature  Alicia  Keys,  Velvet  Revolver  and  Tim  McGraw.  Fans  will  be  able  to  download  it  for  $0.99  (£0.53)  from  iTunes,  or  purchase  the  video  from  the  CBS  TV  network's  site.  Kanye  West,  the  rapper  who  leads  the  awards  with  10  nominations,  will  perform  alongside  John  Legend,  Mavis  Staples  and  the  Blind  Boys  of  Alabama.  There  will  also  be  a  tribute  to  Ray  Charles  featuring  Bonnie  Raitt  and  Billy  Preston  and  a  celebration  of  southern  rock  with  Tim  McGraw,  Gretchen  Wilson,  Lynyrd  Skynyrd,  Dickie  Betts  and  Elvis  Bishop.

2	"Mandelson  warns  BBC  on  Campbell  |||    The  BBC  should  steer  away  from  ""demonising""  ex-Downing  Street  media  chief  Alastair  Campbell,  Peter  Mandelson  has  said.  |||    The  European  commissioner  and  former  Labour  minister  was  speaking  amid  claims  that  Mr  Campbell  is  part  of  a  Labour  ""dirty  tricks""  campaign.  That  charge  was  denied  by  Mr  Mandelson,  who  said  the  Tories  were  afraid  of  Mr  Campbell's  campaigning  skills.  He  warned  the  BBC  that  attacking  Mr  Campbell  had  brought  it  trouble  before.  That  was  a  reference  to  the  Hutton  inquiry  following  a  BBC  story  claiming  Downing  Street  ""sexed  up""  Iraq's  weapons  of  mass  destruction  dossier.  |||    The  affair  prompted  the  resignation  of  BBC  chairman  Gavyn  Davies,  director-general  Greg  Dyke  and  reporter  Andrew  Gilligan.  Labour  has  attracted  media  criticism  for  using  new  freedom  of  information  laws  to  dig  up  information  about  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard's  past.  |||    Mr  Mandelson,  a  former  Labour  communications  director,  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme:  ""I  understand  why  the  Tories  will  be  gunning  for  Alastair  Campbell  because  they  fear  his  campaigning  skills.  ""What  I  understand  less  is  why  the  BBC  should  be  joining  with  the  Tories  in  driving  that  agenda.  ""In  my  experience  of  these  things,  parties  which  shout  about  dirty  tricks  and  the  like  tend  to  do  so  because  they  fear  a  direct  hit  in  some  vulnerable  part  of  their  political  anatomy.  ""I  suggest  the  BBC  concentrates  on  the  issues  and  helps  the  public  to  understand  the  policies  and  the  choices  that  are  at  stake  in  the  election  rather  than  engages  in  the  process  politics,  the  trivialisation  of  the  campaign.  ""I  think  the  BBC  would  be  much  better  advised  to  leave  all  this  stuff  well  alone,  concentrate  on  the  issues  as  I  say,  not  resume  their  demonisation  of  Alastair  Campbell  -  we  all  know  where  that  led  before.""  |||    Mr  Campbell  is  acting  as  an  adviser  for  Labour,  which  denies  engaging  in  personal  campaigning.  Conservative  co-chairman  Liam  Fox  said  Mr  Campbell's  return  and  Labour  poster  plans  attacking  Mr  Howard  -  recently  withdrawn  from  the  party's  website  -  were  a  sign  of  ""abusive  politics"".  ""The  government,  despite  the  fact  that  they  would  say  want  to  go  forward,  not  back,  seem  intent  on  talking  about  history  rather  than  their  own  record  or  even  more  importantly,  about  the  future,""  he  said  on  Sunday.  Labour  peer  Baroness  Kennedy,  who  is  chairing  the  Power  Inquiry  into  political  disengagement,  said  people  already  thought  politicians  engaged  in  dirty  tricks.  ""This  feeling  of  distrust  is  going  to  be  enlarged  if  this  campaigning  on  all  sides  is  conducted  in  the  way  that  it  looks  as  if  it  just  might,""  she  said."

It  blamed  poor  sales  since  Christmas  and  delays  to  the  releases  of  new  albums  by  Coldplay  and  Gorillaz.  By  1200  GMT  on  Monday,  EMI  shares  were  down  16.2%  at  235.75  pence.  |||    EMI  said  two  major  albums  scheduled  for  release  before  the  end  of  the  financial  year  in  March  -  one  by  Coldplay  and  one  by  Gorillaz  -  have  now  had  their  release  dates  put  back.  |||    ""EMI  Music's  sales,  particularly  re-orders,  in  January  have  also  been  lower  than  anticipated  and  this  is  expected  to  continue  through  February  and  March,""  the  company  added.  ""Therefore,  for  the  full  year,  at  constant  currency,  EMI  Music's  sales  are  now  expected  to  be  8%  to  9%  lower  than  the  prior  year.""  The  company  said  it  expected  profits  to  be  about  £138m  ($259.8m).  Alain  Levy,  chairman  and  chief  executive  of  EMI  Music,  described  the  performance  as  ""disappointing"",  but  added  that  he  remained  optimistic  over  future  trends  in  the  industry.  ""The  physical  music  market  is  showing  signs  of  stabilisation  in  many  parts  of  the  world  and  digital  music,  in  all  its  forms,  continues  to  develop  at  a  rapid  pace,""  he  said.  |||    Commenting  on  the  delay  to  the  release  of  the  Coldplay  and  Gorillaz  albums,  Mr  Levy  said  that  ""creating  and  marketing  music  is  not  an  exact  science  and  cannot  always  coincide  with  our  reporting  periods"".  ""While  this  rescheduling  and  recent  softness  is  disappointing,  it  does  not  change  my  views  of  the  improving  health  of  the  global  recorded  music  industry,""  he  added.  Paul  Richards,  an  analyst  at  Numis  Securities,  said  the  market  would  be  focusing  on  the  slump  in  music  sales  rather  than  the  timing  of  the  two  albums.  ""It's  unusual  to  see  this  much  of  a  downgrade  just  because  of  phasing,""  he  said."

The  average  UK  house  price  fell  from  £180,126  in  November  to  £178,906,  reflecting  recent  Land  Registry  figures  confirming  a  slowdown  in  late  2004.  All  major  UK  regions,  apart  from  Northern  Ireland,  experienced  a  fall  in  annual  growth  during  December.  |||    December  is  traditionally  a  quiet  month  for  the  housing  market  because  of  Christmas  celebrations.  However,  recent  figures  from  the  Land  Registry  -  showing  a  big  drop  in  sales  between  the  last  quarter  of  2004  and  the  previous  year  -  suggested  the  slowdown  could  be  more  than  a  seasonal  blip.  The  volume  of  sales  between  October  and  December  dropped  by  nearly  a  quarter  from  the  same  period  in  2003,  the  Land  Registry  said.  Although  both  the  Office  of  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  (ODPM)  and  the  Land  Registry  figures  point  to  a  slowdown  in  the  market,  the  most  recent  surveys  from  Nationwide  and  Halifax  have  indicated  the  market  may  be  undergoing  a  revival.  After  registering  falls  at  the  back-end  of  2004,  Halifax  said  house  prices  rose  by  0.8%  in  January  and  Nationwide  reported  a  rise  of  0.4%  in  the  first  month  of  the  year."

Mr  Marchionne  becomes  the  fourth  head  of  the  business  -  which  is  expected  to  make  a  800m  euro  ($1bn)  loss  in  2004  -  in  as  many  years.  Fiat  underperformed  the  market  in  Europe  last  year,  seeing  flat  sales.  |||    The  car  business  has  made  an  operating  loss  in  five  of  the  last  six  years  and  was  forced  to  push  back  its  break-even  target  from  2005  to  2006.  The  management  changes  are  part  of  a  wider  shake-up  of  the  business  following  Fiat's  resolution  of  its  dispute  with  General  Motors.  As  part  of  a  major  restructuring,  Fiat  is  to  integrate  the  Maserati  car  company  -  currently  owned  by  Ferrari  -  within  its  own  operations.  Ferrari,  in  which  Fiat  owns  a  majority  stake,  could  be  separately  floated  on  the  stock  market  in  either  2006  or  2007.  |||    Mr  Marchionne,  who  only  joined  the  company  last  year,  said  Fiat  Auto  was  now  the  ""principal  focus""  of  his  attention.  ""I  have  made  the  decision  to  take  on  the  post  of  chief  executive  of  the  auto  unit  to  speed  up  the  company's  recovery,""  he  said.  ""A  profound  cultural  transformation  is  underway  following  a  management  reorganisation  that  has  delivered  a  more  agile  and  efficient  structure,""  he  added.  |||    Although  Mr  Marchionne  does  not  have  a  background  in  the  car  industry,  he  has  been  playing  an  increasing  role  in  the  group's  activities.  Last  year,  he  said  that  a  series  of  new  models,  launched  as  part  of  the  group's  recovery  plan,  had  not  boosted  revenues  as  much  as  hoped.  The  car  business,  best  known  for  its  Alfa  Romeo  marque,  is  expected  to  make  a  loss  of  about  800m  euros  in  2004.  Sales  are  expected  to  fall  in  2005,  Fiat  said  this  week,  as  it  exits  unprofitable  areas  such  as  the  rental  car  market.  Mr  Demel,  a  car  industry  veteran,  took  the  helm  in  November  2003  after  being  recruited  by  former  Fiat  chief  executive  Giuseppe  Morchio.  Mr  Morchio  made  a  bid  last  year  to  become  chairman  after  the  death  of  president  Umberto  Agnelli.  However,  this  was  rejected  by  the  founding  Agnelli  family  and  Mr  Morchio  subsequently  resigned.  Earlier  this  week,  Fiat  reached  an  agreement  with  GM  to  dissolve  an  alliance  which  could  have  obliged  GM  to  buy  the  Italian  firm  outright.  GM  will  pay  Fiat  $2bn  as  part  of  the  settlement." 

3	"Safin  plays  down  Wimbledon  hopes  |||    Newly-crowned  Australian  Open  champion  Marat  Safin  has  ruled  out  any  chance  of  winning  Wimbledon  in  the  future.  |||    After  losing  in  round  one  last  year,  Safin  said  he  had  ""given  up""  on  Wimbledon  and  winning  his  second  Grand  Slam  title  has  not  changed  his  mind.  ""I'll  play,  but  with  no  expectations.  I  feel  like  I  can't  waste  my  time,  my  energy  on  that  surface,""  he  said.  ""Some  people,  they  cannot  play  on  clay.  Some  people,  they  cannot  play  on  a  hard  court.  Me,  I  can't  play  on  grass.""  However,  Safin  is  hopeful  that  winning  the  Australian  Open  will  give  him  the  belief  he  needs  to  win  more  Grand  Slam  titles.  ""It's  a  relief  for  me.  Two  grand  slams,  it's  already  something.  But  with  this  one  I  worked  really  hard  for  it,""  he  said.  ""Basically,  I  would  love  to  win  a  couple  more.  I  think  I  have  a  chance  if  I  continue  this  way.  |||    ""If  (coach)  Peter  Lundgren  will  stick  around  with  me  and  wants  to  work  with  me  for  a  bit  longer,  I  think  I  can  make  it.""  The  25-year-old  shocked  Pete  Sampras  in  the  2000  US  Open  final  to  win  his  first  major  title  but  then  lost  in  two  Australian  Open  finals.  Safin  admitted  he  had  begun  to  doubt  whether  he  would  win  another  Grand  Slam.  ""I  didn't  expect  that  (to  win  the  2000  US  Open)  -  it  was  against  Sampras,  I  wasn't  the  favourite  so  I  had  no  pressure  whatsoever,""  he  said.  ""After  the  first  final  that  I  didn't  win  against  Thomas  Johansson  (in  2002),  I  couldn't  see  myself  winning  the  Grand  Slams  anymore.  ""I  was  once  in  the  semi-finals  of  the  French  Open,  but  I  didn't  believe  I  can  win  it.  ""I  just  couldn't  handle  the  pressure.  You  need  to  believe  in  yourself,  and  I  didn't.""  |||    And  after  losing  the  first  set  6-1  to  Lleyton  Hewitt  in  Sunday's  final,  Safin  said  he  began  to  doubt  himself  again.  ""I  am  25.  I'm  playing  against  Hewitt.  At  least  you  have  to  have  the  opportunity  to  win  it,  at  least  have  a  chance,""  he  said.  ""It's  like  you  go  there  and  you  lose  first  set  6-1,  then  you  start  to  think:  'This  is  not  my  day.  The  way  I'm  playing  is  ridiculous.'  ""But  then  you  start  to  really  be  a  little  bit  more  selfish  and  try  to  find  a  way  out  of  there.  ""And  I  found  it.  I  was  like  really  much  I  was  much  happier  than  in  2000,  that's  for  sure,  because  I  get  over  it."""

It  features  the  singer  talking  about  both  his  career  and  his  personal  life,  from  his  days  in  Wham!  through  to  more  recent  events.  Michael  will  attend  the  festival  to  introduce  the  screening  on  16  February.  Director  Southan  Morris  and  executive  producer  Andy  Stephens  will  also  attend  the  festival.  |||    The  93  minute  film  will  see  Michael  discussing  his  early  days  in  Wham!  along  with  his  later  career,  including  his  legal  battles  with  record  label  Sony  and  his  stance  against  the  Iraq  war  and  American  politics.  It  will  also  touch  upon  his  turbulent  personal  life,  including  his  arrest  in  a  Beverly  Hills  park  toilet  in  1998  for  ""lewd  behaviour"",  and  the  death  of  his  boyfriend  Anselmo  Feleppa  from  Aids.  The  film,  which  includes  previously  unseen  footage  of  the  singer  also  features  contributions  from  Michael's  former  Wham!  partner  Andrew  Ridgeley,  as  well  as  ex-Wham!  backing  singers  Pepsi  and  Shirlie.  Other  contributors  include  Sting,  Mariah  Carey,  Elton  John,  Noel  Gallagher,  Geri  Halliwell  and  Simon  Cowell.

US  band  Maroon  5  was  named  best  new  international  artist,  and  took  the  best  international  song  title  for  This  Love.  More  than  five  million  radio  listeners  voted  in  the  awards.  The  international  male  and  female  prizes  went  to  Usher  and  Avril  Lavigne  respectively.  Collecting  his  band's  award  from  model  Naomi  Campbell  at  the  Cannes  ceremony,  U2  frontman  Bono  said  in  French:  ""I'm  not  from  this  country  but  I'll  make  a  little  confession  to  you  -  it's  at  the  Cote  d'Azur  I  feel  at  home.""  |||    Hosted  by  radio  group  NRJ,  the  ceremony  featured  performances  from  Usher  and  Jennifer  Lopez,  who  was  accompanied  by  dancers  clad  in  schoolgirl  outfits.

2	"Analysis:  No  pain,  no  gain?  |||    He  called  it  his  ""masochism  strategy""  in  the  run-up  to  the  Iraq  war  and  now  Tony  Blair  has  signed  up  for  another  dose  of  pain.  |||    The  idea  is  simple  -  the  prime  minister  goes  head  to  head  with  an  often  hostile  group  of  ""real""  voters  in  the  full  spotlight  of  the  television  cameras.  The  theory  is  that  talking  to  the  great  British  public,  even  if  they  are  the  ""great  unwashed"",  is  better  than  having  the  media  filter  what  voters  hear  from  politicians.  It  is  also  the  most  effective  way  of  showing  that  he  is  aware  of  real  people's  concerns  and  -  on  occasions  -  of  their  outright  fury.  Mr  Blair  used  the  tactic  before  the  Iraq  war  to  try  to  show  he  really  was  engaging  with  public  concerns  and  you  can  expect  to  see  it  much  more  in  the  run-up  to  the  election.  |||    Labour  knows  it  has  been  damaged  by  accusations  of  spin,  ""control  freakery""  and  over-slick  presentation  -  sometimes  from  within  the  ranks  of  its  own  MPs.  Tony  Blair  himself  has  said  people  complain  he  does  not  listen.  Mr  Blair's  latest  bout  of  flagellation  came  with  a  series  of  questions  sessions  on  Five  television  throughout  Wednesday.  |||    The  trouble  began  on  the  Wright  Stuff  show,  with  Maria  Hutchings  marching  up  to  him,  saying  ""Tony,  that's  rubbish""  as  she  tried  to  complain  about  her  autistic  son's  school  being  threatened  with  closure.  A  few  ""don't  worries""  as  Mrs  Hutchings  was  led  back  to  the  audience  averted  a  public  slanging  match  -  he  spoke  to  her  privately  after  the  show.  But  that  was  only  the  start  and  later  sessions  produced  the  type  of  grilling  not  even  the  toughest  television  interviewer  could  produce.  |||    Writer  Neil  Coppendale,  from  West  Sussex,  asked  of  the  Iraq  war:  ""Tens  of  thousands  of  innocent  men,  women  and  children  died  -  how  do  you  manage  to  sleep  at  night?""  On  immigration,  London  teacher  Diane  Granger  said:  ""Where  are  you  going  to  put  everyone?""  And  can  you  imagine  even  Jeremy  Paxman  putting  the  question  posed  by  Brighton  nurse  Marion  Brown:  ""Would  you  wipe  somebody's  backside  for  £5?""  |||    Mr  Blair  tried  to  use  the  questioners'  first  names  -  and  sometimes  threw  them  off  their  stride  by  asking  what  they  would  do  about  the  problems.  Many  of  the  newspapers  have  branded  the  exercise  a  PR  stunt  which  backfired.  Indeed  there  is  a  danger  Mr  Blair  simply  ends  up  looking  ""embattled"".  Conservative  Michael  Howard  and  Liberal  Democrat  Charles  Kennedy  are  to  be  offered  chances  to  appear  in  similar  slots  on  the  channel  next  month.  Labour  strategists  believe  more  of  the  sessions  will  mean  the  hecklers  no  longer  become  a  story  and  the  real  issues  take  prominence.  |||    James  Humphreys,  ex-head  of  corporate  communications  at  Number  10,  says  the  strategy  shows  frustration  with  the  media.  ""They  feel  they  don't  get  their  voice  across  and  going  direct  to  people  is  clearly  their  game  on  this  occasion,""  he  says.  There  are  risks  but  the  prize  is  tackling  the  trend  of  lower  turnouts  at  the  polls,  he  argues.  The  prime  minister  knows  full  well  the  potential  hazards  .  |||    He  must  remember  with  gritted  teeth  his  confrontation  with  Sharron  Storer,  the  Birmingham  woman  who  harangued  him  over  the  state  of  her  local  hospital  in  the  2001  election  campaign.  ""All  you  do  is  walk  around  and  make  yourself  known,  you  don't  do  anything  to  help  anybody,""  she  told  Mr  Blair  before  stomping  off,  refusing  his  pleas  to  discuss  the  issue  privately.  Former  Downing  Street  media  chief  Alastair  Campbell  has  described  the  episode  as  a  ""bit  of  a  disaster""  as  it  meant  the  launch  of  Labour's  election  manifesto  received  little  coverage.  But  it  was  seen  as  one  of  the  few  moments  when  that  election  campaign  came  alive,  not  least  because  it  coincided  with  John  Prescott's  even  more  direct  contact  -  when  he  punched  an  egg-throwing  protester.  |||    Former  prime  ministers  too  have  come  to  grief  at  the  hands  of  a  persistent  member  of  the  public.  The  undoubted  highlight  of  years  of  election  phone-in  shows  was  Margaret  Thatcher  discomfort  on  Nationwide  in  1983,  when  viewer  Diana  Gould  put  her  on  the  spot  about  the  sinking  of  the  Belgrano  in  the  Falklands  War.  John  Major  reaped  the  benefits  of  street  campaigning  during  the  1992  election  campaign  with  his  famous  soapbox.  |||    It  may  have  left  him  splattered  with  eggs  and  engine  oil  at  times  but  he  felt  it  added  ""fizz""  to  his  campaign.  In  his  memoirs,  he  also  argues  the  strategy  contrasted  with  Neil  Kinnock's  ""contrived  photo  opportunities""  and  attempts  at  an  artful  campaign.  ""He  wanted  to  look  like  a  prime  minister.  I  |||    was  |||    prime  minister  and  I  wanted  a  flesh  and  blood  fight,""  says  Mr  Major.  Mr  Blair  told  prospective  Labour  MPs  on  Thursday  that  taking  part  in  phone-ins  and  public  meetings  could  ""enthuse  and  engage  and  give  the  public  a  sense  of  empowerment"".  But  he  also  wants  to  counter  complaints  that  he  has  spent  too  much  time  on  international  affairs  and  foreign  trips.  Mr  Blair  recalls  how  Bill  Clinton  once  advised  him:  ""Always  remember  that  what  people  see  of  you  in  the  news  in  the  evening  is  how  they  think  you  spend  your  day.""  His  hope  must  be  that  voters  watching  him  on  the  rack  will  bear  out  for  Labour  the  old  maxim:  ""No  pain,  no  gain.""" 

3	"Bates  seals  takeover  |||    Ken  Bates  has  completed  his  takeover  of  Leeds  United.  |||    The  73-year-old  former  Chelsea  chairman  sealed  the  deal  at  0227  GMT  on  Friday,  and  has  bought  a  50%  stake  in  the  club.  He  said:  ""I'm  delighted  to  be  stepping  up  to  the  mantel  at  such  a  fantastic  club.  I  recognise  Leeds  as  a  great  club  that  has  fallen  on  hard  times.  ""We  have  a  lot  of  hard  work  ahead  to  get  the  club  back  where  it  belongs  in  the  Premiership,  and  with  the  help  of  our  fans  we  will  do  everything  we  can.""  Bates  bought  his  stake  under  the  guise  of  a  Geneva-based  company  known  as  The  Forward  Sports  Fund.  He  revealed  that  part  of  his  plan  is  to  buy  back  Leeds'  Elland  Road  stadium  and  Thorp  Arch  training  ground  in  due  course.  |||    ""It's  going  to  be  a  tough  jon  and  the  first  task  is  to  stabilise  the  cash  flow  and  sort  out  the  remaining  creditors,""  Bates  added.  ""But  there  is  light  at  the  end  of  a  very  long  tunnel.  For  the  past  year  it  has  been  a  matter  of  firefighting  -  now  we  can  start  running  the  club  again.""  Outgoing  Leeds  chairman  Gerald  Krasner  said:  ""This  deal  ensures  the  medium  to  long  term  survival  of  the  club  and  I  believe  Mr  Bates'  proposals  are  totally  for  the  benefit  of  the  club.  ""We  are  content  that  under  Mr  Bates,  Leeds  United  will  continue  to  consolidate  and  move  forward.  ""When  we  took  over  Leeds  United  in  March  2004,  the  club  had  a  debt  of  £103m,  since  that  date,  my  board  has  succeeded  in  reducing  the  debt  to  under  £25m.  ""We  worked  tirelessly  to  solve  all  of  the  problems  at  Leeds  United.  ""Eighty  percent  of  the  problems  have  already  been  overcome  and  we  came  to  this  agreement  with  Mr  Bates  to  secure  its  ongoing  success.""  Krasner  revealed  that  his  consortium  has  been  asked  to  remain  in  the  background  at  the  club  for  an  undisclosed  period  to  help  ensure  a  smooth  hand-over.  He  will  stay  on  in  an  unpaid  capacity  while  Peter  Lorimer  will  continue  in  his  role  as  director  and  point  of  contact  for  the  fans  and  Peter  McCormick  will  serve  as  a  consultant  to  the  incoming  board.  The  other  outgoing  directors  have  agreed  to  leave  their  loans  of  £4.5m  in  the  company  for  the  next  four  years.  On  Leeds'  new-look  board  it  is  understood  that  Lorimer  will  be  joined  by  former  Chelsea  finance  director  Yvonne  Todd  and  Bates'  lawyer  Mark  Taylor.  |||    Krasner  refused  to  give  any  details  of  the  finances  involved  in  the  takeover.  He  told  BBC  Five  Live:  ""I  am  not  going  into  the  figures.  If  Ken  wants  to  give  them  up  that  is  up  to  him.  I  can  not  tell  you  what  the  money  will  be  used  for.  ""This  dea  l  is  not  about  money  for  the  current  board.  In  the  last  four  months  I  never  saw  any  cheques  until  this  week  from  one  person.  I  am  not  stretching  figures,  we  don't  discuss  internal  arrangements.""  Bates  stepped  down  as  Chelsea  chairman  in  March  last  year  following  Roman  Abramovich's  £140m  takeover  at  Stamford  Bridge.  In  May,  he  made  a  proposal  to  invest  £10m  in  Sheffield  Wednesday,  but  this  was  rejected  by  the  club.  Sebastien  Sainsbury  had  been  close  to  a  takeover  of  Leeds  but  withdrew  his  £25m  offer  last  week.  |||    His  efforts  failed  after  he  revealed  it  would  take  £40m  to  stage  a  takeover,  and  that  the  club  will  also  lose  £10m  over  the  next  six  months.  The  club  was  on  the  brink  of  administration  -  and  the  deduction  of  10  points  by  the  Football  League  -  before  Bates'  arrival  but  his  investment  has  spared  them  that  prospect." 

2	"Burglar  defence  guidelines  issued  |||    Householders  who  injure  or  even  kill  intruders  are  unlikely  to  be  prosecuted  -  providing  they  were  acting  ""honestly  and  instinctively"",  new  guidelines  say.  |||    The  law  also  protects  those  who  use  ""something  to  hand""  as  a  weapon.  The  leaflet,  published  by  police  and  prosecutors,  aims  to  combat  confusion  about  current  legislation,  which  lets  people  use  ""reasonable  force"".  The  guidance,  relating  to  England  and  Wales,  follows  a  recent  decision  by  ministers  not  to  change  the  law.  Doing  what  you  ""honestly  and  instinctively""  believed  was  necessary  would  be  the  strongest  evidence  of  acting  lawfully,  the  guidance  said.  |||    And  the  law  protects  those  who  use  ""something  to  hand""  as  a  weapon,  said  the  leaflet  published  jointly  by  the  Crown  Prosecution  Service  (CPS)  and  Association  of  Chief  Police  Officers  (ACPO).  |||    As  a  general  rule,  the  more  extreme  the  circumstances  and  fear  felt,  the  more  force  can  be  used  lawfully  in  self-defence,  it  said,  adding  that  householders  do  not  have  to  wait  to  be  attacked  before  defending  themselves.  But  knocking  someone  unconscious  then  killing  them  or  hurting  them  further,  or  setting  a  trap  for  an  intruder  without  involving  the  police  were  given  as  examples  of  ""excessive  and  gratuitous""  force.  The  Tories  have  called  for  a  change  in  the  law  so  householders  are  only  prosecuted  if  they  use  ""grossly  disproportionate""  force.  Their  demands  have  been  backed  by  former  Metropolitan  Police  Commissioner  Sir  John  Stevens.  Tory  frontbencher  Patrick  Mercer  is  now  pursuing  the  proposal  through  a  private  member's  bill  in  Parliament.  |||    The  government  instead  mounted  a  publicity  campaign  to  clear  up  public  uncertainty  after  a  review  concluded  no  law  change  was  necessary.  Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  said:  ""I  believe  in  that  old  adage  'an  Englishman's  home  is  his  castle'.  That's  exactly  what  should  be  the  case  and  I  believe  the  current  law  provides  that.""  An  ""informal  trawl""  of  CPS  records  found  11  people  had  been  prosecuted  after  attacking  intruders  in  the  past  15  years,  five  of  whom  were  convicted.  They  included  a  man  who  laid  in  wait  for  a  burglar  on  commercial  premises  in  Cheshire,  before  beating  him  up,  throwing  him  into  a  pit  and  setting  him  on  fire.  |||    A  CPS  spokesperson  said  the  figures  were  not  definitive  because  prosecutions  are  not  listed  according  to  whether  they  were  committed  by  a  householder  on  an  intruder.  In  one  of  Britain's  highest  profile  cases,  Norfolk  farmer  Tony  Martin  was  jailed  for  life  for  murdering  16-year-old  burglar  Fred  Barras,  in  1999.  The  conviction  was  later  reduced  to  manslaughter  on  appeal  and  the  sentence  cut  to  five  years.  Mr  Martin  was  freed  from  prison  in  July  2003.  The  guidance  published  on  Tuesday,  said  the  police  had  a  duty  to  investigate  all  incidents  involving  a  death  or  injury.  In  cases  involving  householders  attacking  intruders  prosecutors  and  police  were  ""determined""  they  would  be  dealt  with  ""as  swiftly  and  as  sympathetically  as  possible"",  it  said." 

0	"Fresh  hope  after  Argentine  crisis  |||    Three  years  after  Argentina  was  hit  by  a  deadly  economic  crisis,  there  is  fresh  hope.  |||    The  country's  economy  is  set  to  grow  about  8%  this  year  after  seeing  9%  growth  last  year,  a  sharp  turnaround  from  2002  when  output  fell  11%.  The  unemployment  rate  is  improving,  too:  It  is  set  to  slip  below  13%  by  the  end  of  the  year,  down  from  20%  in  May  2002.  True,  problems  remain,  but  the  overall  picture  is  one  of  vast  improvement.  Even  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  admits  this.  ""The  Argentine  authorities  are  proud,  should  be  proud,  of  the  strong  performance  of  the  economy,""  Thomas  Dawson,  an  IMF  director,  said  earlier  this  month.  |||    Argentina  has  made  a  remarkable  recovery  from  a  hideous  and  lengthy  recession  which  in  2001  culminated  in  the  government  halting  debt  repayments  to  its  private  creditors.  The  debt  default  sparked  a  deep  and  prolonged  economic  crisis  which,  at  least  initially,  was  made  worse  by  the  government's  decisions.  Pension  payments  were  halted  and  bank  accounts  frozen  as  part  of  austerity  measures  introduced  by  the  government  to  deal  with  the  country's  massive  debts.  In  response,  angry  crowds  of  ordinary  Argentines  took  to  the  streets  where  dozens  of  lives  were  lost  in  clashes  with  the  police.  Two  presidents  and  at  least  three  finance  minister  resigned  in  less  than  a  month.  Argentina  was  on  the  brink  of  collapse.  The  fix  was  found  in  the  currency  markets  with  the  abandonment  of  the  peso's  decade-long  peg  to  the  US  dollar  in  February  2002.  The  subsequent  devaluation  saw  thousands  of  people's  life  savings  disappear.  Scathes  of  companies  went  bust.  ""Three  years  ago,  every  sector  [of  the  economy]  was  hit  by  the  crisis,""  said  entrepreneur  Drayton  Valentine.  It  really  was  dire.  |||    But  since  then,  the  general  mood  on  the  ground  has  improved  dramatically,  in  part  because  the  devaluation  helped  attract  fresh  direct  investment  from  abroad  and  stimulate  business  within  Brazil.  ""Agriculture  and  tourism  are  helping,""  said  entrepreneur  Drayton  Valentine.  |||    Mr  Valentine,  who  was  born  in  the  United  States  but  grew  up  in  Argentina,  was  fortunate:  At  the  time  of  the  crisis,  his  savings  were  held  in  dollar  accounts  abroad.  But  now  he  is  using  his  money  to  help  with  the  start-up  a  trading  company.  He  explained  that  initially,  his  firm  is  going  to  export  building  materials  to  Spain  and  United  States.  Then,  he  would  like  to  diversify  to  other  areas,  depending  on  the  market.  ""Locally  there  is  a  sense  of  recovery,  many  companies  are  exporting  now,""  he  said,  noting  that  a  lot  of  firms,  which  were  closed  during  the  crisis,  are  re-opening.  |||    But  not  all  that  shines  is  gold.  Argentina  is  still  burdened  by  its  failure  to  pay  private  creditors  at  the  end  of  2001.  President  Nestor  Kirchner's  administration  is  still  trying  to  hammer  out  an  agreement  with  the  creditors,  but  with  the  debts'  nominal  value  standing  at  around  $100bn  it  is  not  proving  easy.  Debt  defaults  make  further  lending  agreements  both  difficult  and  expensive  to  negotiate.  Argentina's  current  offer  implies  that  the  creditors  would  get  just  25  cents  for  each  dollar  they  are  owed,  according  to  the  creditors.  Understandably,  they  want  more  and  until  they  do,  both  they  and  others  are  loath  to  continue  lending.  For  President  Kirchner,  this  proves  a  hopeless  challenge.  Real  losses  have  been  suffered  and  somebody  has  to  pay,  observed  Jack  Boorman,  adviser  to  IMF's  managing  director,  Rodrigo  Rato.  ""Everyone  needs  to  keep  in  mind  the  enormous  cost  on  the  part  of  both  creditors  and  the  Argentine  society  and  people  that  will  have  been  endured  by  the  time  a  settlement  is  reached,""  he  said.  ""The  cost  is  enormous,  and  continues  to  be  paid,  and  will  not  be  reversed  by  any  restructuring.""  |||    With  the  international  negotiations  being  troubled,  it  is  of  little  help  to  President  Kirchner  that  the  domestic  situation  remains  strained  as  well.  |||    This  is  partly  because  there  are  still  bank  account  holders  who  are  waiting  to  recover  some  of  their  deposits.  ""The  situation  is  bad  for  those  who  had  previously  chosen  to  save  in  Argentina,  ""  said  Carlos  Baez  Silva,  president  of  AARA,  an  association  that  represents  bank  account  and  bond  holders.  Few  people  have  recovered  more  than  about  half  their  savings,  Mr  Baez  Silva  estimated,  pointing  out  that  many  of  the  savers  who  have  lost  out  are  pensioners  or  others  who  once  trusted  the  government,  people  who  set  aside  money  for  the  future  in  the  belief  that  their  investment  would  be  safe.  ""A  lot  of  them  invested  in  good  faith,""  he  said.  ""The  Argentine  state  responded  by  taking  most  of  their  investments.""  The  affair  has  made  Mr  Baez  Silva  disillusioned  with  the  country's  legal  system.  On  occasion,  the  Supreme  Court  has  ruled  against  the  interests  of  the  people  he  represents,  he  says,  insisting  that  the  system  cannot  be  trusted.  ""People  have  to  deposit  their  money  in  the  banks,  not  necessarily  because  they  trust  them  but  because  crime  is  so  high  that  people  cannot  have  their  money  in  their  homes  beneath  their  mattresses.""  Mr  Valentine,  who  was  born  in  the  United  States  but  grew  up  in  Argentina,  agreed.  ""If  I  have  to  save  pesos  [the  local  currency]  there  is  not  much  problem,  but  I  will  think  twice  before  I  deposit  dollars  in  a  bank""." 

2	"Clarke  plans  migrant  point  scheme  |||    Anyone  planning  to  move  to  the  UK  will  have  to  pass  a  test  to  prove  they  can  contribute  to  the  country,  Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  has  said.  |||    He  is  proposing  a  points  system  similar  to  Australia's  but  would  avoid  the  quota  system  planned  by  the  Tories.  Mr  Clarke,  who  will  unveil  his  plans  on  Monday,  said  economic  migration  helped  the  UK  but  ""needed  proper  policing"".  The  Lib  Dems  say  they  will  look  at  his  plans,  but  Tory  Liam  Fox  said  his  party  offered  a  ""clear  choice""  on  the  issue.  The  Conservative  Party  Co-Chairman  said  the  British  electorate  had  a  choice  between  a  Labour  government  that  had  ""done  nothing  for  eight  years  and  will  not  set  a  limit""  on  immigration  and  a  Tory  one  that  would  impose  quotas.  |||    The  home  secretary  said,  by  2008,  he  wanted  everyone  given  a  visa  and  entering  the  UK  to  have  their  fingerprints  taken,  to  ""ensure  we  can  know  everybody  who  is  in  the  country"".  Speaking  on  BBC  One's  Breakfast  with  Frost,  he  said  ""economic  migrants  are  of  great  value  to  this  country"",  but  stressed  that  proper  policing  was  needed  to  ensure  that  they  do  not  become  a  ""burden  on  society"".  He  said:  ""We  will  establish  a  system  ...  which  looks  at  the  skills,  talents  and  abilities  of  people  seeking  to  come  and  work  in  this  country,  and  ensures  that  when  they  come  here  they  have  a  job  and  can  contribute  to  the  economy  of  the  country.""  |||    The  home  secretary,  whose  five-year  blueprint  for  immigration  and  asylum  is  expected  to  be  published  on  Monday,  also  rejected  claims  that  the  immigration  debate  encouraged  bigotry.  ""The  issue  of  who  does  come  into  this  country,  and  whether  they  are  entitled  to  be  in  this  country,  who  does  settle  here,  how  we  have  border  controls,  is  a  perfectly  legitimate  aspect  of  public  debate,""  he  said.  Liberal  Democrat  home  affairs  spokesman  Mark  Oaten  said:  ""Whilst  it  is  good  that  Labour  has  rejected  the  Tory  idea  of  quotas  on  asylum,  the  jury  is  still  out  on  the  Home  Office's  ability  to  deliver  a  fair  and  efficient  asylum  system.""  |||    Mr  Howard  has  said  Britain  should  take  its  fair  share  of  the  world's  ""genuine  refugees"".  But  he  claims  the  current  asylum  system  is  being  abused  -  and  with  it  Britain's  generosity.  Trevor  Phillips,  chairman  of  the  Commission  for  Racial  Equality,  called  on  Mr  Clarke  to  denounce  the  suggestion  Britain's  hospitality  was  being  tested  by  immigration.  ""Tell  that  to  the  44,000  doctors  in  the  NHS  and  the  70,000  nurses  without  whom  we  would  really  see  what  pressure  on  the  health  service  means,""  he  said.  ""Ditto  the  teachers,  from  South  Africa,  Australia,  Jamaica,  who  are  reducing  the  sizes  of  our  classes  and  schools.""  The  Refugee  Council  said  Mr  Howard's  proposals  would  mean  there  would  be  no  safe  haven  in  the  UK." 

0	"LSE  doubts  boost  bidders'  shares  |||    Shares  in  Deutsche  Boerse  have  risen  more  than  3%  after  a  shareholder  fund  voiced  opposition  to  the  firm's  planned  takeover  of  the  London  Stock  Exchange.  |||    TCI,  which  claims  to  represent  owners  of  5%  of  Deutsche  Boerse's  (DB)  shares,  has  complained  that  the  £1.35bn  ($2.5bn)  offer  for  the  LSE  is  too  high.  Opposition  from  TCI  has  fuelled  speculation  that  the  proposed  takeover  could  fail.  Rival  exchange  operator  Euronext  has  also  said  it  may  bid  for  the  LSE.  Euronext  operates  the  Paris,  Amsterdam,  Brussels  and  Lisbon  bourses,  while  Deutsche  Boerse  runs  the  Frankfurt  exchange.  |||    BBC  News  spoke  to  a  number  of  analysts  on  Monday  morning  about  shareholder  worries  over  Deutsche  Boerse's  bid  for  LSE.  Although  none  were  prepared  to  speak  on  the  record,  most  thought  it  was  unlikely  that  TCI's  opposition  would  halt  the  deal  |||    ""Obviously  we'll  have  to  wait  and  see,  but  I  don't  think  it  will  make  much  difference.  Deutsche  Boerse  appears  very  committed,""  said  one  London-based  broker.  He  forecast  the  takeover  bid  would  succeed  and  was  more  concerned  to  see  improvements  in  the  daily  running  of  the  LSE.  In  voicing  its  opposition  to  the  planned  takeover,  TCI  said  it  would  prefer  to  see  Deutsche  Boerse  return  $500m  (£350m)  to  shareholders.  The  Deutsche  Boerse  was  prepared  to  pay  for  the  LSE  ""exceeds  the  potential  benefits  of  this  acquisition"",  said  TCI.  |||    Another  Deutsche  Boerse  shareholder  on  Monday  also  appeared  to  back  TCI's  call.  Another  investor  in  Deutsche  Boerse  has  supported  the  view  that  a  payout  to  shareholders  would  be  preferable  to  Deutsche  Boerse  overpaying  for  the  LSE,  Reuters  news  agency  reported.  ""We  prefer  a  sensible  entrepreneurial  solution  at  a  price  that  is  not  too  high,""  said  Rolf  Dress,  a  spokesman  for  Union  Investment.  ""If  that  cannot  be  achieved,  then  we  would  wish  for  a  distribution  of  liquid  assets  to  shareholders.""  The  Financial  Times  also  reported  a  third  Deutsche  Boerse  shareholder  as  opposed  to  the  deal.  It  quoted  a  spokesman  for  US-based  hedge  fund  Atticus  Capital  complaining  that  the  planned  takeover  appeared  to  be  motivated  by  ""empire-building""  rather  than  the  best  interests  of  shareholders.  |||    TCI  has  called  for  Deutsche  Boerse  to  hold  an  emergency  general  meeting  to  discuss  the  bid  for  LSE.  Yet  under  German  business  law,  DB  does  not  have  to  gain  shareholder  approval  before  making  a  significant  acquisition.  Deutsche  Boerse  said  TCI's  opposition  would  not  change  its  bid  approach.  ""Deutsche  Boerse  is  convinced  that  its  contemplated  cash  acquisition  of  the  London  Stock  Exchange  is  in  the  best  interests  of  its  shareholders  and  the  company,""  it  said.  DB's  shares  were  up  3.4%  to  45.25  euros  by  1030  GMT,  the  highest  gainer  in  Frankfurt."

The  company,  China's  third-largest  milk  producer,  is  to  hold  an  emergency  meeting  to  debate  the  issue.  A  Yili  spokesman  said  it  may  now  move  to  oust  chairman  Zheng  Junhuai.  The  spokesman  did  not  say  why  the  three  had  been  detained  by  the  police.  The  official  Xinhua  News  Agency  said  the  arrest  was  linked  to  alleged  embezzlement.  |||    Yili  has  recently  been  the  subject  of  intense  media  speculation  over  its  financial  operations.  Executives  are  suspected  of  wrongly  using  417m  yuan  ($50.4m;  £26m)  of  company  funds  to  support  a  management  buyout  back  in  July  2003.  Yili's  shares  were  suspended  on  Tuesday,  having  fallen  by  10%  on  Monday.  The  company  and  its  two  main  rivals  -  market  leader  Mengniu  Dairy  and  second  place  Bright  Dairy  -  dominate  a  Chinese  milk  market  that  has  grown  by  almost  30%  over  the  past  five  years.  Analysts  wondered  if  the  scandal  at  Yili  -  the  latest  to  befall  Chinese  companies  this  year  -  could  be  followed  by  further  revelations  of  corporate  wrongdoing.  ""Investors  wonder  if  Yili's  scandal,  one  of  a  slew  to  be  uncovered  this  year,  isn't  just  the  tip  of  the  iceberg,""  said  Chen  Huiqin,  an  analyst  at  Huatai  Securities." 

1	"Stars  shine  on  Bafta  red  carpet  |||    Hollywood  stars  brought  a  touch  of  glamour  to  London  on  Saturday  for  the  biggest  night  in  the  British  film  calendar.  |||    Cate  Blanchett,  Leonardo  DiCaprio  and  Richard  Gere  were  just  some  of  the  actors  who  attended  the  2005  Bafta  film  awards.  They  emerged  from  limos  at  Leicester  Square  to  an  uncertain  British  climate  that  threatened  rain  one  moment  and  promised  late  winter  sunshine  the  next.  But  the  gods  were  certainly  shining  on  the  thousands  of  film  fans  who  lined  the  red  carpet  to  meet  their  idols.  Screaming  built  up  into  a  crescendo  as  more  and  more  big  name  stars  appeared.  The  biggest  cheer  of  the  night  was  reserved  for  The  Aviator  star  Leonardo  DiCaprio,  who  paused  in  the  chilly  February  air  to  sign  autographs  for  the  throngs.  He  said  the  ear-piercing  welcome  was  ""unlike  anything  I've  ever  encountered.  It's  very  intense  and  very  loud.""  |||    Best  actress  winner  Imelda  Staunton,  who  wore  a  green  chiffon  dress  that  sparkled  with  sequins  and  beads,  told  the  BBC  News  website  that  Vera  Drake  was  the  highlight  of  her  career.  Her  role  as  a  backstreet  abortionist  in  the  gritty  low-budget  film  has  already  led  to  a  clutch  of  awards  and  an  Oscar  nomination.  She  said:  ""Never  in  a  million  years  did  I  think  this  was  going  to  happen.  ""Being  here  and  just  being  nominated  is  great,  but  I  hope  it  means  more  people  will  go  and  see  the  film  as  well.""  Rooting  for  Staunton  in  the  best  actress  category  was  Cate  Blanchett,  herself  nominated  for  her  supporting  role  as  Hollywood  icon  Katherine  Hepburn  in  The  Aviator.  |||    Shivering  in  a  floor-length  shimmering  Armani  dress,  the  Australian-born  actress  stopped  to  sign  autographs  and  joked:  ""It's  tight  but  I  love  it.""  Glamour  was  also  brought  to  the  evening  by  actress  Sienna  Miller,  supermodel  Claudia  Schiffer  -  who  was  supporting  her  director  husband  Matthew  Vaughn  -  Troy  actress  Diane  Kruger  and  star  of  the  TV  programme  The  OC,  Micha  Barton.  Wearing  a  caramel-coloured  floaty  frock  by  the  designer  Alexander  McQueen,  Miller  told  reporters  the  red  carpet  experience  was  ""intense,  nerve-wracking  and  cold"".  The  younger  stars  of  British  film  were  also  represented  in  the  shape  of  Emma  Watson,  who  plays  Hermione  in  the  Harry  Potter  films.  The  14-year-old  said  she  was  hoping  to  meet  DiCaprio  and  Keanu  Reeves  but  joked  that  ""they  are  probably  a  little  too  old  for  me"".  |||    Actor  Christian  Slater,  who  is  currently  starring  in  One  Flew  Over  The  Cuckoo's  Nest  in  London's  West  End,  was  greeted  by  cries  of  ""Christian,  Christian""  by  the  ever  vocal  crowd.  Keanu  Reeves,  who  presented  the  best  actress  award,  said  being  on  the  red  carpet  was  an  ""exciting""  part  of  his  job.  ""It  is  always  surreal  and  when  it  is  nice,  it  is  nice,""  he  said.  Martin  Scorsese,  whose  movie  The  Aviator  went  on  to  win  best  film,  said  being  honoured  in  the  UK  meant  a  lot  to  him.  He  said:  ""I  am  a  great  admirer  of  British  cinema  since  the  1930s  and  40s,  up  until  now.  |||    ""They  give  me  a  new  energy  when  I  see  the  best  coming  out  of  England  and  every  two  or  three  years  is  a  whole  new  cycle  of  tough  and  young  film-makers,  and  even  the  older  ones  are  making  good  films.  ""To  recognise  me  in  this  way  is  a  great  honour.""  British  actor  Clive  Owen,  who  has  won  a  Golden  Globe  and  a  Bafta  for  his  supporting  role  in  Closer,  said  it  ""meant  a  lot""  to  be  at  the  ceremony.

1	"How  the  Academy  Awards  flourished  |||    The  77th  annual  Academy  Awards  are  taking  place  on  27  February  with  the  stars  of  the  movie-making  world  once  again  holding  their  breath  to  discover  who  will  be  showered  with  the  honours  this  year.  But  from  humble  beginnings,  how  did  the  modern  day  extravaganza  become  the  behemoth  it  is  today?  |||    HOW  IT  ALL  STARTED  The  first  Academy  Awards  were  handed  out  in  1929  at  a  comparatively  low-key  dinner  held  at  the  Hollywood  Roosevelt  Hotel  -  just  over  the  road  from  their  modern  day  home.  |||    Just  250  guests  attended  with  ticket  prices  at  $5.  |||    The  first  film  to  win  was  Wings,  which  starred  Clara  Bow  in  the  only  silent  movie  to  win  the  big  award.  For  the  first  10  years  or  so,  the  winners  list  was  handed  to  the  newspapers  so  they  could  publish  them  at  11pm,  but  in  1940  the  winners  were  published  in  the  Los  Angeles  Times  at  8.45pm  meaning  guests  entering  the  ceremony  knew  already  knew  the  results.  As  a  result  the  sealed  envelope  system  was  introduced,  leading  to  the  secrecy  and  suspense-filled  night  that  happens  today.  WHEN  AND  WHERE  The  tradition  of  holding  the  awards  at  a  banquet  continued  until  1942  but  with  increasing  interest  came  a  growing  guest  list  and  it  became  impractical  to  host  it  as  a  dinner.  |||    The  ceremonies  were  then  transferred  to  theatres  with  the  famous  Grauman's  Chinese  Theatre  the  first  to  host  the  expanded  event.  Other  venues  included  the  Dorothy  Chandler  Pavilion  and  the  Shrine  Auditorium.  They  are  now  held  at  the  Kodak  Theatre,  which  opened  in  2002  just  across  the  road  from  its  original  home  and  holds  6,000  people.  Until  1954  they  were  held  on  a  Thursday,  then  swapped  around  from  Monday  to  Wednesday  before  Sunday  night  was  settled  on,  although  the  month  swapped  from  May  to  April  to  March  and  now  its  current  month  of  February.  The  first  televised  ceremony  was  in  1953,  with  Bob  Hope  as  the  MC.  WHO  WAS  OSCAR?  There  is  no  solid  evidence  as  to  how  the  trophy  became  to  be  known  as  Oscar.  |||    One  popular  story  is  that  Academy  librarian  Margaret  Herrick  said  the  statue  looked  like  her  uncle  Oscar.  A  journalist  apparently  overheard  this  conversation  and  used  the  phrase  in  an  article.  |||    The  first  time  it  is  thought  to  have  been  used  in  print  was  when  columnist  Sidney  Skolsky  used  it  to  describe  Katherine  Hepburn's  first  best  actress  win  in  1934.  The  Academy  officially  adopted  the  nickname  in  1939.  The  trophy  was  designed  by  MGM  art  director  Cedric  Gibbons.  Since  its  inception  2,530  Oscars  have  been  handed  out.  In  support  of  the  war  effort,  the  Academy  handed  out  plaster  Oscar  statuettes  during  WWII.  After  the  war,  winners  exchanged  the  plaster  awards  for  the  real  thing.  Fifty-five  statues  were  stolen  in  en  route  to  the  awards  in  2000,  52  were  recovered  nine  days  later.  Winners  were  unaffected  as  a  new  batch  was  rushed  out.  WHO  SITS  IN  JUDGEMENT?  The  Academy  was  set  up  in  1927  as  a  non-profit  organisation  with  36  members  from  different  film  disciplines.  Douglas  Fairbanks  Sr  was  the  first  president  and  oversaw  the  first  awards.  There  are  now  5,700  members  of  the  Academy  -  with  membership  by  invitation  only  to  those  who  are  seen  to  have  achieved  distinction  in  the  movies  and  are  therefore  seen  as  fit  to  judge  their  peers.  Some  of  the  criteria  for  admittance  includes:  film  credits  that  reflect  the  high  standards  of  the  Academy,  receipt  of  an  Academy  Award  nomination,  achievement  of  unique  distinction,  earning  of  special  merit,  or  making  an  outstanding  contribution  to  film.  THE  STARS  WHO  LEFT  EMPTY-HANDED  While  many  of  the  biggest  films  and  movie-makers  have  been  honoured  by  the  Academy,  there  is  still  surprise  at  those  that  did  not  receive  any  nominations  that  later  went  on  to  become  classics.  |||    Among  the  overlooked  films  were  Hobson's  Choice,  Dirty  Harry,  The  39  Steps,  The  Searchers  and  King  Kong.  Actors  that  failed  to  win  for  their  iconic  roles  included  Al  Jolson  in  the  Jazz  Singer  (1927),  Humphrey  Bogart  in  Casablanca  (1944),  Gene  Kelly  in  Singing  in  the  Rain  (1952)  and  Henry  Fonda  in  12  Angry  Men  (1957).  Alfred  Hitchcock  also  failed  to  win  an  award  despite  five  nominations.  His  enduring  influence  on  the  horror  genre  was  finally  recognised  with  an  honorary  gong  in  1968.  THE  SHOW  ALWAYS  GOES  ON  Not  even  war  has  halted  the  glittering  Hollywood  event.  There  were  calls  for  it  to  be  cancelled  in  2003  during  the  war  in  Iraq,  but  as  it  didn't  stop  during  World  War  II  or  the  Vietnam  war.  |||    Documentary  winner  Michael  Moore  ensured  nobody  forgot  about  the  Iraq  war  though  and  used  his  acceptance  speech  to  criticise  the  American  invasion.  The  ceremony  was  muted  with  the  glitz  turned  down  and  many  female  stars  opting  for  demure  dark  dresses.  The  ceremony  has  been  postponed  on  three  occasions.  Los  Angeles  floods  in  1938  saw  it  put  back  a  week.  The  death  of  Martin  Luther  King  saw  it  postponed  for  two  days  in  1968  as  a  mark  of  respect  and  there  was  a  24-hour  delay  following  the  assassination  attempt  on  President  Ronald  Reagan.  CONTROVERSIES  AND  OTHER  GAFFES  Three  people  have  refused  Oscars,  including  actor  George  C  Scott  who  said  the  whole  thing  was  ""demeaning"".  Writer  Dudley  Nichols  refused  his  Academy  Award  in  1935  for  his  screenplay  for  The  Insider  because  the  Writers'  Guild  was  striking  at  the  time.  Marlon  Brando  turned  down  his  best  actor  Oscar  for  The  Godfather  in  1973  in  protest  as  Hollywood's  apparent  discrimination  against  Native  American  people.  He  sent  along  a  woman  called  Sacheen  Littlefeather  to  collect  his  award.  She  was  later  revealed  to  be  Native  American  actress  Maria  Cruz.  |||    The  following  year  Robert  Opal  interrupted  proceedings  when  he  streaked,  flashing  a  peace  sign  as  well  as  everything  else.  The  TV  network  managed  to  pan  away  and  avoid  too  much  nudity.  Opal  was  murdered  in  1979.  Frank  Capra  was  the  butt  of  one  major  gaffe  in  1934  when  the  host  opened  out  best  picture  envelope  and  declared  ""come  on  up  and  get  it,  Frank""  to  which  Frank  Capra  bounded  up  to  the  stage  before  realising  that  he  had  meant  Frank  Lloyd  had  won  for  Cavalcade.  |||    Capra  vowed  he  would  never  to  go  the  awards  again  but  went  the  following  year  to  collect  his  award  for  It  Happened  One  Night."

The  honour,  awarded  since  1986,  honours  figures  in  cinema  that  the  festival  feels  ""particularly  indebted  to"".  Man  to  Man,  a  historical  epic  starring  Kristin  Scott  Thomas,  opens  the  German  festival  on  10  February.  A  candid  documentary  about  the  life  and  career  of  singer  George  Michael,  A  Different  Story  will  also  be  screened  at  the  10-day  event.  '  |||    Day-Lewis  has  competed  four  times  at  the  Berlin  Film  Festival,  with  films  In  The  Name  Of  The  Father  (1994),  The  Crucible  (1997),  The  Boxer  (1998)  and  Martin  Scorsese's  Gangs  Of  New  York  (2003).  The  festival  praises  him  for  his  ""sensational  start""  with  roles  in  My  Beautiful  Launderette  and  costume  classic  A  Room  With  A  View,  and  a  ""great  number  of  celebrated  roles""  in  subsequent  productions.  Japan's  oldest  film  studio  will  also  be  honoured  along  with  Day-Lewis.  Shochiku  film  studios,  which  was  founded  110  years  ago,  will  become  the  first  cinematic  institution  to  receive  the  Berlinale  Camera  award.  Famous  Japanese  directors  including  Akira  Kurosawa  have  had  films  produced  at  the  studio." 

1	"US  TV  special  for  tsunami  relief  |||    A  US  television  network  will  screen  a  celebrity  TV  special  to  benefit  the  tsunami  relief  effort  in  South  Asia.  |||    NBC  will  encourage  viewer  donations  during  an  hour-long  show  featuring  musical  performances  on  15  January.  Actress  Sandra  Bullock  has  donated  $1m  (£525,000)  to  The  American  Red  Cross  and  actor  Leonardo  DiCaprio  pledged  a  ""sizable""  aid  contribution  to  Unicef.  Meanwhile  70  Hong  Kong  music  and  movie  stars  re-recorded  We  Are  the  World  in  Mandarin  and  Cantonese  to  raise  funds.  |||    The  song  will  not  be  released  as  a  single,  but  will  be  played  regularly  during  a  Chinese  telethon  on  Friday  in  aid  of  victims  of  the  Boxing  Day  disaster.  Around  140,000  people  were  killed  and  five  million  left  homeless  or  without  food  and  water  after  an  earthquake  below  the  Indian  Ocean  sent  waves  crashing  into  coastal  communities  in  11  countries.  |||    The  United  Nations  warned  that  the  number  killed  in  the  disaster  could  rise  sharply,  with  aid  yet  to  reach  some  remote  areas.  Performers  have  yet  to  be  confirmed  for  NBC's  aid  relief  benefit  later  this  month.  It  follows  a  two-hour  telethon  carried  by  all  four  major  US  television  networks  10  days  after  the  11  September  terror  attacks  in  2001.  America:  A  Tribute  to  Heroes  raised  more  than  $150m  (£79m)  to  help  victims  of  the  suicide  attacks  on  the  World  Trade  Center  and  Pentagon."

The  proposed  deal  was  seen  as  crucial  to  safeguarding  the  future  of  Rover's  Longbridge  plant  in  the  West  Midlands.  However,  there  are  growing  fears  that  the  deal  could  result  in  job  losses.  The  Observer  reported  on  Sunday  that  nearly  half  the  workforce  at  Longbridge  could  be  under  threat  if  the  deal  goes  ahead.  |||    Shanghai  Automotive's  proposed  £1bn  investment  in  Rover  is  awaiting  approval  by  its  owner,  the  Shanghai  city  government  and  by  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  which  oversees  foreign  investment  by  Chinese  firms.  According  to  the  FT,  the  regulator  has  been  annoyed  by  Rover's  decision  to  talk  publicly  about  the  deal  and  the  intense  speculation  which  has  ensued  about  what  it  will  mean  for  Rover's  future.  As  a  result,  hopes  that  approval  of  the  deal  may  be  fast-tracked  have  disappeared,  the  paper  said.  There  has  been  continued  speculation  about  the  viability  of  Rover's  Longbridge  plant  because  of  falling  sales  and  unfashionable  models.  |||    According  to  the  Observer,  3,000  jobs  -  out  of  a  total  workforce  of  6,500  -  could  be  lost  if  the  deal  goes  ahead.  The  paper  said  that  Chinese  officials  believe  cutbacks  will  be  required  to  keep  the  MG  Rover's  costs  in  line  with  revenues.  It  also  said  that  the  production  of  new  models  through  the  joint  venture  would  take  at  least  eighteen  months.  Neither  Rover  nor  Shanghai  Automotive  commented  on  the  reports." 

2	"Howard  and  Blair  tax  pledge  clash  |||    Tony  Blair  has  said  voters  will  have  to  wait  for  Labour's  manifesto  to  see  if  the  party  has  plans  to  increase  tax.  |||    The  premier  was  responding  to  a  challenge  from  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  who  said  Labour  would  raise  taxes  in  its  post-election  Budget.  Mr  Blair  derided  Tory  claims  they  could  cut  £35bn  in  ""wasteful  spending""  saying  the  party  had  got  its  sums  wrong.  The  two  political  leaders  clashed  just  days  after  the  opening  salvoes  of  the  pre-election  period.  Mr  Howard  told  MPs  that  ""every  independent  expert""  from  the  International  Monetary  Fund  to  the  Institute  of  Fiscal  Studies  had  suggested  the  ""government  was  spending  more  than  it  is  raising  and  a  Labour  chancellor  would  have  to  put  up  taxes"".  Mr  Blair  replied:  ""I  think  they  are  wrong  for  this  very  simple  reason:  that  the  Treasury  forecasts  on  the  economy  have  been  proven  right.""  The  Tories  on  Monday  highlighted  their  plans  for  tax  cuts  worth  £4bn,  although  the  specific  taxes  to  be  cut  have  not  been  announced.  |||    They  also  spelled  out  their  plans  for  reduced  government  borrowing  and  more  spending  on  key  services.  Labour  and  the  Liberal  Democrats  have  said  the  party's  sums  do  not  add  up  and  claim  it  would  cut  frontline  services.  But  Mr  Howard  said  voters  faced  a  clear  choice  at  the  next  election  between  more  waste  and  more  tax  under  Labour  and  Tory  value  for  money  and  lower  taxes.  The  Liberal  Democrats  have  also  launched  their  pre-election  platform,  with  leader  Charles  Kennedy  saying  his  party  was  the  ""authentic  opposition"",  particularly  on  the  Iraq  war,  council  tax  and  university  tuition  fees.  Labour  hit  back  at  the  Tory  proposals  even  before  their  publication  with  election  coordinator  Alan  Milburn  accusing  Mr  Howard  of  producing  a  ""fraudulent  prospectus""." 

0	"S  Korea  spending  boost  to  economy  |||    South  Korea  will  boost  state  spending  next  year  in  an  effort  to  create  jobs  and  kick  start  its  sputtering  economy.  |||    It  has  earmarked  100  trillion  won  ($96bn)  for  the  first  six  months  of  2005,  60%  of  its  total  annual  budget.  The  government's  main  problems  are  ""slumping  consumption  and  a  contraction  in  the  construction  industry"".  It  aims  to  create  400,000  jobs  and  will  focus  on  infrastructure  and  home  building,  as  well  as  providing  public  firms  with  money  to  hire  new  workers.  |||    The  government  has  set  an  economic  growth  rate  target  of  5%  for  next  year  and  hinted  that  would  be  in  danger  unless  it  took  action.  ""Internal  and  external  economic  conditions  are  likely  to  remain  unfavourable  in  2005,""  the  Finance  and  Economy  Ministry  said  in  a  statement.  |||    It  blamed  ""continuing  uncertainties  such  as  fluctuating  oil  prices  and  foreign  exchange  rates  and  stagnant  domestic  demand  that  has  shown  few  signs  of  a  quick  rebound"".  In  2004,  growth  will  be  between  4.7%  and  4.8%,  the  ministry  said.  Not  everyone  is  convinced  the  plan  will  work.  ""Our  primary  worry  centres  on  the  what  we  believe  is  the  government's  overly  optimistic  view  that  its  front  loading  of  the  budget  will  be  enough  to  turn  the  economy  around,""  consultancy  4Cast  said  in  a  report.  |||    The  problem  facing  South  Korea  is  that  many  consumers  are  reeling  from  the  effects  of  a  credit  bubble  that  only  recently  burst.  Millions  of  South  Koreans  are  defaulting  on  their  credit  card  bills,  and  the  country's  biggest  card  lender  has  been  hovering  on  the  verge  of  bankruptcy  for  months.  As  part  of  its  spending  plans,  the  government  said  it  will  ask  firms  to  ""roll  over  mortgage  loans  that  come  due  in  the  first  half  of  2005""  .  It  also  pledged  to  look  at  ways  of  helping  families  on  low  incomes.  |||    The  government  voiced  concern  about  the  effect  of  redundancies  in  the  building  trade.  ""Given  the  economic  spill  over  and  employment  effect  in  the  construction  sector,  a  sharp  downturn  in  the  construction  industry  could  have  other  adverse  effects,""  the  ministry  said.  |||    As  a  result,  South  Korea  will  give  private  companies  also  will  be  given  the  chance  to  build  schools,  hospitals,  houses  and  other  public  buildings.  It  also  will  look  at  real  estate  tax  system.  Other  plans  on  the  table  include  promoting  new  industries  such  as  bio-technology  and  nano-technology,  as  well  as  offering  increased  support  to  small  and  medium  sized  businesses.  ""The  focus  will  be  on  job  creation  and  economic  recovery,  given  that  unfavourable  domestic  and  global  conditions  are  likely  to  dog  the  Korean  economy  in  2005,""  the  ministry  said." 

2	"Assembly  ballot  papers  'missing'  |||    Hundreds  of  ballot  papers  for  the  regional  assembly  referendum  in  the  North  East  have  ""disappeared"".  |||    Royal  Mail  says  it  is  investigating  the  situation,  which  has  meant  about  300  homes  in  County  Durham  are  not  receiving  voting  packs.  Officials  at  Darlington  Council  are  now  in  a  race  against  time  to  try  and  rectify  the  situation.  The  all-postal  votes  of  about  two  million  electors  are  due  to  be  handed  in  by  4  November.  A  spokesman  for  Darlington  Council  said:  ""We  have  sent  out  the  ballot  papers,  the  problem  is  with  Royal  Mail.  ""Somewhere  along  the  line,  something  has  gone  wrong  and  these  ballot  papers  have  not  been  delivered.  ""The  Royal  Mail  is  investigating  to  see  if  they  can  find  out  what  the  problem  is.""  |||    A  spokeswoman  for  Royal  Mail  said:  ""We  are  investigating  a  problem  with  the  delivery  route  in  the  Mowden  area  of  Darlington.  ""This  is  affecting  several  hundred  properties,  which  have  failed  to  receive  ballot  papers.  ""We  are  working  closely  with  the  council  and  will  do  all  we  can  to  help  rectify  the  problem.

""We  then  made  further  investigations  and  it  became  clear  this  was  a  bigger  issue.""  A  spokeswoman  for  the  Electoral  Commission  told  BBC  News  Online  that  letters  were  being  sent  out  to  those  homes  affected.  She  said  the  commission  was  satisfied  that  measures  had  been  put  in  place  to  ensure  all  voters  received  ballot  papers  in  time.  So  far  a  total  of  569,072  ballot  envelopes  have  been  scanned  by  bar  code  at  counting  offices  across  the  North  East." 

3	"Prutton  poised  for  lengthy  FA  ban  |||    Southampton's  David  Prutton  faces  a  possible  seven-match  ban  when  he  goes  before  the  Football  Association.  |||    The  23-year-old  has  admitted  two  charges  of  improper  conduct  following  his  dismissal  against  Arsenal.  The  first  charge  relates  to  his  failure  to  leave  the  field  promptly,  pushing  referee  Alan  Wiley  and  remonstrating  with  assistant  referee  Paul  Norman.  And  the  second  charge  is  for  using  threatening  words  and/or  behaviour  to  a  match  official  during  the  1-1  draw.  |||    Paolo  di  Canio  was  given  a  seven-match  suspension  when  he  pushed  referee  Paul  Alcock  over  in  a  Premiership  game  between  Sheffield  Wednesday  and  Arsenal  in  1998.  Prutton  will  be  joined  at  Wednesday's  hearing  by  Saints  boss  Harry  Redknapp,  who  believes  that  the  FA  will  throw  the  book  at  his  player.  Redknapp  himself  sprinted  along  the  touchline  to  help  physio  Jim  Joyce  and  coach  Denis  Rofe  shepherd  the  enraged  Prutton  away  from  referee's  assistant  Norman.  ""David  has  made  a  big  mistake  and  he  knows  it.  I  can't  condone  what  he's  done.  He  was  out  of  order  but  he  knows  that,""  said  Redknapp.  ""He's  a  decent  lad.  He  over-reacted  badly  for  some  reason  -  he  had  a  rush  of  blood  from  somewhere.  Off  the  pitch  you  couldn't  meet  a  nicer  lad.""  Prutton  has  apologised  publicly  for  his  actions  and  to  Arsenal's  Robert  Pires,  who  was  injured  in  a  wild  tackle  by  the  Saints'  midfield  man.  |||    He  said:  ""It's  an  horrendous  situation.  I  apologise  to  the  ref  and  linesman,  who  were  only  doing  their  job.  ""I've  also  seen  what  happened  to  Pires'  leg  and  I'm  sorry  for  that  as  well.""  ""I  apologise  for  the  people  who  saw  it.  I  know  you  get  lots  of  kids  going  to  the  match  now  and  they  don't  pay  money  to  see  that  sort  of  thing.  ""It's  not  a  cop-out,  but  it  was  all  a  bit  of  a  blur.  Sometimes  you  react  and  it's  beyond  your  control,  ""  added  Prutton." 

0	"Fiat  mulls  Ferrari  market  listing  |||    Ferrari  could  be  listed  on  the  stock  market  as  part  of  an  overhaul  of  Fiat's  carmaking  operations,  the  Financial  Times  has  reported.  |||    It  said  Fiat  was  set  to  restructure  its  business  after  reaching  a  $2bn  (1.53bn  euros;  £1.05bn)  settlement  with  GM  about  Fiat's  ownership.  Steps  being  considered  include  listing  Ferrari  and  bringing  Maserati  and  Alfa  Romeo  closer  together,  it  said.  Despite  strong  sales  of  Alfa  Romeo,  Fiat's  car  business  is  making  a  loss.  |||    Under  the  proposals  -  which  the  paper  said  could  be  announced  within  days  -  the  iconic  sportscar  maker  could  be  listed  separately  on  the  market.  Fiat  owns  a  56%  stake  in  Ferrari  -best  known  for  its  dominant  Formula  One  motor  racing  team  -  having  first  bought  into  the  business  in  1969.  It  considered  floating  Ferrari  in  2002  but  opted  to  sell  a  minority  stake  to  Italian  bank  Mediobanca  for  775m  euros  ($1bn).  That  sale  valued  Ferrari  -  which  owns  the  Maserati  brand  -  at  2.3bn  euros.  The  price  tag  would  change  if  Maserati  was  stripped  out.  The  Financial  Times  said  Fiat  may  transfer  Maserati  within  its  wholly-  owned  Alfa  Romeo  division  in  an  effort  to  exploit  commercial  synergies.  Such  a  move  would  help  Alfa  Romeo  and  Maserati  to  share  marketing,  distribution  and  research  &  development  costs.  Maserati  and  Ferrari  sell  about  10,000  cars  between  them  and  both  companies  broke  even  in  2003.  |||    Fiat,  Italy's  largest  private  sector  employer,  did  not  comment  on  the  reported  changes.  Fiat  recently  negotiated  an  end  to  its  alliance  with  General  Motors.  The  US  firm  agreed  to  pay  $2bn  to  exit  an  agreement  under  which  it  could  have  been  liable  to  buy  Fiat  outright.  Analysts  said  the  reported  restructuring  was  evidence  of  the  greater  flexibility  which  Fiat  now  had  to  develop  the  business." 

2	"Protesters  plan  airport  challenge  |||    Campaigners  against  the  expansion  of  Britain's  airports  have  begun  challenging  the  government's  plans  in  the  High  Court.  |||    BAA's  expansion  of  Stansted  Airport  in  Essex  by  building  an  extra  runway  is  one  of  the  most  fiercely  opposed  plans.  Opponents  say  the  £2bn  cost  of  the  new  runway  could  not  be  met  unless  cash  from  Heathrow  and  Gatwick  was  used.  They  said  this  is  illegal  under  current  rules  and  are  trying  to  block  the  government  from  changing  legislation.  BAA  are  also  owners  of  the  airports  at  Heathrow  and  Gatwick.  They  have  said  they  cannot  raise  the  money  needed  for  the  Stansted  upgrades  from  current  landing  charges.  BAA  also  says  it  has  attempted  to  involve  communities  in  any  future  airport  plans.  |||    Groups  challenging  the  plans  include  Stop  Stansted  Expansion,  Heathrow  anti-noise  campaigners  HACAN  Clearskies  and  the  London  boroughs  of  Hillingdon  and  Wandsworth.  Their  opponents  are  also  likely  to  complain  there  was  no  public  consultation  before  an  extra  runway  was  built  at  Luton  Airport,  or  when  it  changed  take-off  and  landing  procedures  at  Heathrow.  If  the  group  wins,  the  government's  future  aviation  plans  outlined  in  last  year's  transport  White  Paper  could  be  left  in  ruins.  |||    The  campaigners  will  say  the  government  did  not  adequately  consider  the  building  of  new  airports,  such  as  one  planned  for  the  Isle  of  Sheppey  east  of  London.  Lord  Hanningfield,  leader  of  Essex  County  Council,  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme:  ""We  are  going  to  the  High  Court  because  we  want  a  judge  to  rule  there  should  be  a  proper  inquiry.  ""We  want  a  judge  to  say  there  has  been  inadequate  preparation,  consultation  and  thought  before  the  government  came  out  with  its  Green  Paper.  ""Then  there  could  be  a  proper  debate  nationally  about  where  this  extra  capacity  should  go.""  He  added:  ""Politicians  should  not  decide  where  runways  should  be.""  The  Stansted  expansion,  apart  from  the  building  of  the  new  runway,  would  also  need  to  include  new  terminal  buildings  to  deal  with  the  projected  50m  passengers  who  will  use  it  every  year.  |||    The  airport  is  the  hub  of  many  of  the  no-frills  airlines  operating  in  the  UK.  But  BAA  has  said  it  has  attempted  to  involve  communities  in  any  future  airport  plans.  At  Heathrow,  Gatwick,  Edinburgh  and  Glasgow  airports,  BAA  launched  a  series  of  consultations  on  blight  to  properties  from  the  proposed  expansion  in  September  2004,  which  will  close  next  week.  BAA  is  also  offering  to  buy  noise-hit  properties  for  an  index-linked,  unblighted  price.  At  Heathrow,  BAA  said  it  was  working  closely  with  all  interested  parties  to  see  how  the  strict  environmental,  air  quality  and  noise  targets  for  a  third  runway  can  be  met.  At  Gatwick,  the  company  has  written  to  homes  and  business  likely  to  be  affected  by  any  extra  runway."

Profit  growth  in  the  insurance  market  has  not  matched  expansion  at  Citigroup's  other  businesses.  For  Metlife,  the  US's  leading  insurance  company,  the  purchase  gives  it  access  to  a  much  larger  distribution  network.  |||    Robert  Benmosche,  Metlife's  chairman  and  chief  executive,  said  that  it  was  a  ""great  opportunity  for  the  brand  of  Metlife  to  be  distributed  through  Citigroup"".  Under  the  agreement,  Metlife  will  be  able  to  sell  its  products  through  Citigroup  over  the  next  10  years.  The  deal  includes  Smith  Barney  retail  brokerages  and  Citibank  branches.  The  company  will  pay  between  $1bn  and  $3bn  in  Metlife  stock  with  the  rest  being  made  up  of  cash.  Travelers  had  sales  of  $5.2bn  in  2004  and  made  a  profit  of  $901m.  It  has  total  net  assets  of  $96bn.  ""This  deal  employs  some  of  Metlife's  excess  capital  in  a  potentially  higher-return  business  and  gives  it  more  distribution,""  said  Stuart  Quint,  an  analyst  at  Gartmore."

The  revelation  came  as  the  Russian  government  said  Rosneft  had  signed  a  long-term  oil  supply  deal  with  China.  The  deal  sees  Rosneft  receive  $6bn  in  credits  from  China's  CNPC.  |||    According  to  Russian  newspaper  Vedomosti,  these  credits  would  be  used  to  pay  off  the  loans  Rosneft  received  to  finance  the  purchase  of  Yugansk.  Reports  said  CNPC  had  been  offered  20%  of  Yugansk  in  return  for  providing  finance  but  the  company  opted  for  a  long-term  oil  supply  deal  instead.  Analysts  said  one  factor  that  might  have  influenced  the  Chinese  decision  was  the  possibility  of  litigation  from  Yukos,  Yugansk's  former  owner,  if  CNPC  had  become  a  shareholder.  Rosneft  and  VEB  declined  to  comment.  ""The  two  companies  [Rosneft  and  CNPC]  have  agreed  on  the  pre-payment  for  long-term  deliveries,""  said  Russian  oil  official  Sergei  Oganesyan.  ""There  is  nothing  unusual  that  the  pre-payment  is  for  five  to  six  years.""  |||    The  announcements  help  to  explain  how  Rosneft,  a  medium-sized,  indebted,  and  relatively  unknown  firm,  was  able  to  finance  its  surprise  purchase  of  Yugansk.  Yugansk  was  sold  for  $9.3bn  in  an  auction  last  year  to  help  Yukos  pay  off  part  of  a  $27bn  bill  in  unpaid  taxes  and  fines.  |||    The  embattled  Russian  oil  giant  had  previously  filed  for  bankruptcy  protection  in  a  US  court  in  an  attempt  to  prevent  the  forced  sale  of  its  main  production  arm.  But  Yugansk  was  sold  to  a  little  known  shell  company  which  in  turn  was  bought  by  Rosneft.  Yukos  claims  its  downfall  was  punishment  for  the  political  ambitions  of  its  founder  Mikhail  Khodorkovsky.  Once  the  country's  richest  man,  Mr  Khodorkovsky  is  on  trial  for  fraud  and  tax  evasion.  |||    The  deal  between  Rosneft  and  CNPC  is  seen  as  part  of  China's  desire  to  secure  long-term  oil  supplies  to  feed  its  booming  economy.  China's  thirst  for  products  such  as  crude  oil,  copper  and  steel  has  helped  pushed  global  commodity  prices  to  record  levels.  ""Clearly  the  Chinese  are  trying  to  get  some  leverage  [in  Russia],""  said  Dmitry  Lukashov,  an  analyst  at  brokerage  Aton.  ""They  understand  property  rights  in  Russia  are  not  the  most  important  rights,  and  they  are  more  interested  in  guaranteeing  supplies.""  ""If  the  price  of  oil  is  fixed  under  the  deal,  which  is  unlikely,  it  could  be  very  profitable  for  the  Chinese,""  Mr  Lukashov  continued.  ""And  Rosneft  is  in  desperate  need  of  cash,  so  it's  a  good  deal  for  them  too."""

3	"Parmar  ruled  out  of  Davis  Cup  tie  |||    A  knee  injury  has  forced  Arvind  Parmar  out  of  Great  Britain's  Davis  Cup  tie  in  Israel  and  left  Alex  Bogdanovic  in  line  to  take  the  second  singles  place.  |||    Parmar  picked  up  the  injury  last  week  and  has  failed  to  recover  in  time  for  the  Europe/Africa  Zone  I  tie,  which  begins  in  Tel  Aviv  on  Friday.  Bogdanovic  looks  set  to  take  the  second  singles  place  alongside  Greg  Rusedski.  GB  captain  Jeremy  Bates  could  use  17-year-old  Andrew  Murray  and  David  Sherwood  in  the  doubles  rubber.  Bogdanovic  and  Murray  both  pulled  out  of  tournaments  last  week  through  injury  but  are  expected  to  be  fit.  Jamie  Delgado  and  Lee  Childs  have  been  called  into  the  squad  in  Tel  Aviv  as  designated  hitters  for  team  practice  but  Bates  has  no  plans  to  call  either  of  them  into  his  squad  at  present.  |||    The  unheralded  Sherwood  was  the  surprise  inclusion  when  the  squad  was  announced  last  week,  and  Bates  said:  ""David  has  earned  his  place  in  this  squad  on  the  merit  of  his  form  and  results  over  the  last  12  months.""  The  6ft  4in  Sherwood  is  ranked  264th  in  the  world  and  the  LTA  have  high  hopes  for  him  after  Futures  tournament  wins  in  Wrexham  and  Edinburgh.  |||    The  Sheffield-born  right-hander,  aged  24,  also  reached  another  final  in  Plaisir,  France,  a  week  after  making  the  semi-final  in  Mulhouse.  Bates  is  glad  to  have  Rusedski  available  after  Tim  Henman's  retirement  from  Davis  Cup  tennis.  ""His  wealth  of  experience  is  invaluable,  particularly  to  the  younger  players  and  I  know  he  will  lead  by  example,""  Bates  said.  ""We  are  looking  forward  to  the  tie.  The  squad  are  all  in  excellent  form."""

Some  63%  of  respondents  in  the  Sunday  Times  poll  thought  his  former  lover  -  Kimberly  Quinn  -  acted  vindictively  and  61%  that  he  had  been  right  to  resign.  YouGov  polled  a  weighted  sample  of  1,981  voters  online  on  16-18  December.  Mr  Blunkett  resigned  as  Home  Secretary  on  Wednesday  after  an  inquiry  uncovered  an  e-mail  showing  a  visa  application  by  Mrs  Quinn's  former  nanny  had  been  speeded  up.  Sir  Alan  Budd's  inquiry  also  found  Mr  Blunkett's  account  of  events  had  been  wrong.  Almost  a  quarter  (21%)  of  those  polled  for  the  Sunday  Times  said  he  should  return  to  the  Cabinet  straight  after  the  election.  One  in  four  said  he  should  be  back  in  the  Government's  top  ranks  within  a  year  or  two  while  39%  opposed  a  comeback.  |||    Three-quarters  said  Mr  Blunkett  was  right  to  go  to  court  for  the  right  to  see  Mrs  Quinn's  son  -  whom  he  says  he  fathered  -  and  just  14%  voiced  sympathy  for  Mrs  Quinn.  A  total  of  53%  of  those  polled  said  they  had  sympathy  for  Mr  Blunkett,  with  40%  saying  they  did  not.  Forty-three  per  cent  thought  Mr  Blunkett  had  done  a  good  job  as  home  secretary  and  17%  disagreed.  Meantime,  32%  said  Mr  Blair  was  a  good  prime  minister  and  38%  disagreed.  A  majority,  52%,  said  Chancellor  Gordon  Brown  had  done  a  good  job  and  just  16%  disagreed.  |||    A  second  poll  for  the  Independent  on  Sunday  found  that  support  for  all  political  parties  remained  largely  unchanged  after  the  Blunkett  controversy.

In  contrast,  he  said,  the  popularity  of  van-style  seven-seat  vehicles  and  traditional  saloon  cars  would  fade.  ""Customers  are  moving  out  of  the  mini-van  (and)  traditional  concepts  are  not  as  attractive  anymore,""  he  said.  ""We  have  decided  that  BMW  will  enter  the  [crossover]  segment,""  he  said  in  the  clearest  indication  yet  about  the  car  maker's  intentions.  |||    Mr  Panke  praised  the  Honda  Accura  as  the  ""best  execution""  yet  of  a  crossover  vehicle.  ""We  have  decided  that  the  BMW  brand  will  enter  the  segment,""  he  said.  |||    A  decision  on  just  how  BMW  will  manage  its  entry  into  the  new  market  is  due  in  the  first  half  of  2005.  Typically  it  takes  about  three  years  from  when  a  decision  is  taken  before  a  new  model  hits  the  streets,  Mr  Panke  said,  implying  that  a  BMW  crossover  could  be  on  the  market  by  2008.  The  coming  switch  is  driven  in  part  by  the  need  for  successful  carmakers  to  stay  aware  of  trans-Atlantic  differences  in  the  car  market,  Mr  Panke  insisted.  While  in  the  US  drivers  tend  to  prefer  sports  utility  vehicles  (SUVs),  such  as  the  BMW  X5  and  its  sibling  X3,  in  Europe  demand  for  crossover  vehicles  is  likely  to  be  considerable,  Mr  Panke  said.

2	"Falconer  rebuts  'charade'  claims  |||    Concessions  on  a  bill  which  critics  claim  would  allow  euthanasia  ""through  the  back  door""  were  not  a  political  ploy,  the  lord  chancellor  has  said.  |||    Ministers  have  been  accused  of  panic  in  offering  last  minute  changes  to  the  Mental  Capacity  Bill  amid  chaotic  scenes  in  the  Commons  on  Tuesday.  Lord  Falconer  said  it  was  fair  to  criticise  the  late  timing  of  the  offer.  He  said  the  changes  provided  a  solution  to  a  very  difficult  issue  but  some  MPs  argue  the  situation  is  still  unclear.  |||    The  bill  allows  people  to  give  somebody  the  power  of  attorney  to  make  decisions  on  their  behalf  if  they  become  too  ill  to  decide  for  themselves.  Ministers  insist  the  plans  would  not  change  laws  on  euthanasia  and  would  improve  safeguards.  Critics  fear  it  could  allow  ""killing  by  omission""  through  withdrawing  treatment,  including  food  and  fluids.  |||    Tony  Blair  said  he  would  do  everything  he  could  to  meet  concerns  about  the  bill.  But  changes  to  the  bill  must  not  overturn  the  law  set  when  a  court  ruled  that  doctors  could  withdraw  artificial  feeding  and  hydration  from  Hillsborough  coma  victim  Tony  Bland.  ""It  is  important  we  don't  end  up  in  the  situation  where  doctors  and  consultants  are  confused  about  the  law  and  may  lay  themselves  open  to  prosecution  in  circumstances  where  no  sensible  person  would  want  that  to  happen,""  he  said.  |||    On  Tuesday,  the  government  saw  off  a  backbench  attempt  to  force  changes  to  the  bill  by  297  votes  to  203,  despite  rebellion  by  34  Labour  MPs.  The  revolt  was  also  reduced  by  news  that  Lord  Falconer  had  promised  the  Catholic  archbishop  of  Cardiff  to  strengthen  safeguards  in  the  bill.  But  that  only  came  after  MPs  bombarded  Constitutional  Affairs  Minister  David  Lammy  with  a  barrage  of  requests  for  him  to  read  the  letter  as  they  complained  they  had  been  left  in  the  dark.  Eventually,  he  was  hurriedly  handed  the  letter  to  read  out  five  minutes  before  the  crunch  votes,  prompting  claims  of  a  shambles.  The  deputy  speaker  later  said  the  debate  had  not  been  handled  as  it  should  have  been.  |||    Lord  Falconer  says  there  will  be  amendments  when  the  bill  goes  to  the  House  of  Lords.  He  told  BBC  News:  ""We  have  given  a  commitment  to  put  into  the  bill  a  clause  that  says  that  nothing  in  the  bill  authorises  any  act  where  the  motive  of  the  person  authorising  the  decision  is  to  end  life.  ""The  motive  has  got  to  be  to  end  suffering.""  He  denied  the  concessions  were  a  ""political  manoeuvre""  forced  by  panic  about  the  rebellion.  It  was  inevitable  that  minds  became  more  focused  as  the  bill  went  through  Parliament  but  the  result  was  a  ""sensible  solution"",  he  said.  ""I  don't  think  it  is  something  to  be  embarrassed  about.  These  issues  are  not  easy  to  deal  with,""  he  went  on.  BBC  political  editor  Andrew  Marr  said  Mr  Lammy  was  ""waste  deep  in  quicksand  and  sinking  fast""  after  his  performance.  But  Lord  Falconer  praised  his  minister  for  an  ""excellent  job"".  Former  Conservative  leader  Iain  Duncan  Smith,  one  of  the  chief  critics  of  the  plans,  condemned  the  debate  as  a  ""charade""  and  complained  the  promises  of  changes  to  the  bill  were  vague." 

1	"God  cut  from  Dark  Materials  film  |||    The  director  and  screenwriter  of  the  film  adaptation  of  Philip  Pullman's  His  Dark  Materials  is  to  remove  references  to  God  and  the  church  in  the  movie.  |||    Chris  Weitz,  director  of  About  a  Boy,  said  the  changes  were  being  made  after  film  studio  New  Line  expressed  concern.  The  books  tell  of  a  battle  against  the  church  and  a  fight  to  overthrow  God.  ""They  have  expressed  worry  about  the  possibility  of  perceived  anti-religiosity,""  Weitz  told  a  His  Dark  Materials  fans'  website.  Pullman's  trilogy  has  been  attacked  by  some  Christian  teachers  and  by  the  Catholic  press  as  blasphemy.  Weitz,  who  admitted  he  would  not  be  many  people's  first  choice  to  direct  the  films,  said  he  regarded  the  film  adaptation  as  ""the  most  important  work  of  my  life"".  |||    ""In  part  because  it  is  one  of  the  few  books  to  have  changed  my  life,""  he  told  bridgetothestars.net.  The  award-winning  trilogy  -  Northern  Lights,  The  Subtle  Knife  and  The  Amber  Spyglass  -  tell  the  story  of  Oxford  school  child  Lyra  Belacqua.  She  is  drawn  into  an  epic  struggle  against  the  Church,  which  has  been  carrying  out  experiments  on  children  in  an  attempt  to  remove  original  sin.  |||    As  the  books  progress  the  struggle  turns  into  a  battle  to  overthrow  the  Authority,  a  figure  who  is  God-like  in  the  books.  Weitz,  who  directed  American  Pie  and  About  A  Boy,  said  New  Line  feared  that  any  anti-religiosity  in  the  film  would  make  the  project  ""unviable  financially"".  He  said:  ""All  my  best  efforts  will  be  directed  towards  keeping  the  film  as  liberating  and  iconoclastic  an  experience  as  I  can.  ""But  there  may  be  some  modification  of  terms.""  |||    Weitz  said  he  had  visited  Pullman,  who  had  told  him  that  the  Authority  could  ""represent  any  arbitrary  establishment  that  curtails  the  freedom  of  the  individual,  whether  it  be  religious,  political,  totalitarian,  fundamentalist,  communist,  what  have  you"".  He  added:  ""I  have  no  desire  to  change  the  nature  or  intentions  of  the  villains  of  the  piece,  but  they  may  appear  in  more  subtle  guises.""  There  are  a  number  of  Christian  websites  which  attack  the  trilogy  for  their  depiction  of  the  church  and  of  God,  but  Pullman  has  denied  his  books  are  anti-religious.  His  agent  told  the  Times  newspaper  that  Pullman  was  happy  with  the  adaptation  so  far.

Barclays  has  declined  to  comment  on  the  report  in  the  Sunday  Express,  saying  it  does  not  respond  to  market  speculation.  The  two  banks  reportedly  held  talks  in  October  and  November  2004.  |||    Barclays  shares  were  up  8  pence,  or  1.3%,  at  605  pence  by  late  morning  in  London  on  Monday,  making  it  the  second  biggest  gainer  in  the  FTSE  100  index.  UK  banking  icon  Barclays  was  founded  more  than  300  years  ago;  it  has  operations  in  over  60  countries  and  employs  76,200  staff  worldwide.  Its  North  American  divisions  focus  on  business  banking,  whereas  Wells  Fargo  operates  retail  and  business  banking  services  from  6,000  branches.  In  2003,  Barclays  reported  a  20%  rise  in  pre-tax  profits  to  £3.8bn,  and  it  has  recently  forecast  similar  gains  in  2004,  predicting  that  full  year  pre-tax  profits  would  rise  18%  to  £4.5bn.  Wells  Fargo  had  net  income  of  $6.2bn  in  its  last  financial  year,  a  9%  increase  on  the  previous  year,  and  revenues  of  $28.4bn.  Barclays  was  the  focus  of  takeover  speculation  in  August,  when  it  was  linked  to  Citigroup,  though  no  bid  has  ever  materialised.  Stock  market  traders  were  sceptical  that  the  latest  reports  heralded  a  deal.  ""The  chief  executive  would  be  abandoning  his  duty  if  he  didn't  talk  to  rivals,  but  a  deal  doesn't  seem  likely,""  Reuters  quoted  one  trader  as  saying."

And  Wenger  said:  ""At  the  beginning  of  the  season  you  would  expect  them  to  be  fighting  for  the  top  four.  ""I  don't  know  how  they  got  to  be  where  they  are.  It  looks  to  me  from  the  outside  that  they  have  many  injuries.""  |||    Arsenal  go  into  the  game  on  the  back  of  a  2-0  victory  over  Fulham  on  Sunday.  And  Wenger  added:  ""The  best  way  to  prepare  for  a  game  is  to  win  the  previous  one.  We  will  go  to  Newcastle  in  good  shape.  ""Fatigue  won't  play  too  big  a  part  in  the  next  few  weeks  as  we  have  players  coming  back  so  I  can  rotate  a  bit  more.  ""We  do  not  play  a  season  with  11  players  and  I  believe  that  all  of  our  squad  deserve  a  chance  in  the  team.""  Striker  Thierry  Henry,  along  with  Robert  Pires,  scored  against  Fulham.  And  Henry  afterwards  described  the  display  as  ""beautiful  to  watch"".  He  said:  ""What  matters  is  winning  and  the  three  points,  of  course.  That  is  the  only  thing  that  really  matters.  But  it  is  more  enjoyable  when  you  play  like  we  did  against  Fulham.  ""We  are  playing  as  a  team  and  that  is  important  because  there  were  some  games  when  we  maybe  were  not  there  as  a  team  and  suffered  for  that.  Those  were  games  we  lost."""

MCI's  directors  have  backed  Verizon,  despite  it  tabling  less  money.  They  are  accused  of  breaching  their  fiduciary  duties  by  depriving  MCI  shareholders  ""of  maximum  value"".  |||    According  the  legal  papers  filed  in  a  Delaware  court,  Verizon  is  set  to  pay  an  """"unconscionable,  unfair  and  grossly  inadequate""  sum  for  MCI,  which  was  formerly  known  as  Worldcom.  Qwest  said  on  Wednesday  that  MCI  had  rejected  a  deal  worth  $8bn.  A  number  of  large  MCI  shareholders  expressed  unhappiness  at  the  decision,  saying  that  Verizon's  offer,  made  up  of  cash,  shares  and  dividends,  undervalued  the  company.  Friday's  lawsuit  argues  that  the  Verizon  offer  makes  no  provision  for  future  growth  prospects  and  that  consolidation  in  the  US  phone  industry  will  put  a  premium  on  MCI's  network,  assets  and  clients.  MCI's  directors  have  argued  that  Verizon  is  bigger  than  Qwest,  has  fewer  debts  and  has  built  a  successful  mobile  division.  Chief  executive  Michael  Capellas  spent  last  week  meeting  with  shareholders  in  an  effort  to  win  their  backing.  |||    In  2002,  investors  in  the  then-named  Worldcom  lost  millions  when  the  company  filed  for  bankruptcy  following  an  accounting  scandal.  However,  the  firm  -  now  renamed  MCI  -  has  put  its  operations  in  order  and  emerged  from  bankruptcy  protection  last  April.  It  is  a  long-distance  and  corporate  phone  firm,  and  would  provide  the  buyer  with  access  to  a  global  telecommunications  network  and  a  large  number  of  business-based  subscribers.  MCI  shares  jumped  on  Friday,  hitting  their  highest  level  since  April  2004  amid  speculation  that  it  would  be  the  focus  of  a  bidding  war.  A  takeover  of  MCI  would  be  the  fifth  billion-dollar  telecoms  deal  since  October  as  companies  look  to  cut  costs  and  boost  client  bases.  Earlier  this  month,  SBC  Communications  agreed  to  buy  its  former  parent  and  phone  pioneer  AT&T  for  about  $16bn." 

2	"Nuclear  strike  'key  terror  risk'  |||    The  UK  and  US  must  realise  they  cannot  prevent  all  terror  attacks  and  should  focus  on  making  sure  they  are  not  nuclear  strikes,  says  a  top  academic.  |||    Amitai  Etzioni,  a  key  influence  on  New  Labour  thinking,  says  the  US  emphasis  on  an  ""Axis  of  Evil""  is  misplaced.  The  priority  should  instead  be  on  ""failing  states"",  including  Russia  and  Pakistan,  who  cannot  properly  control  their  nuclear  material,  he  argues.  His  report  demands  a  major  overhaul  of  world  rules  on  nuclear  technology.  |||    Professor  Etzioni  was  a  senior  adviser  to  President  Carter's  White  House  and  is  the  guru  behind  communitarian  ideas  which  influenced  the  development  of  Blairite  Third  Way  politics.  In  a  report  for  the  Foreign  Policy  Centre  think  tank,  he  says  a  nuclear  terrorist  attack  is  the  main  danger  faced  by  many  nations.  |||    ""Attempts  to  defend  against  it  by  hardening  domestic  targets  cannot  work,  nor  can  one  rely  on  pre-emption  by  taking  the  war  to  the  terrorists  before  they  attack,""  he  says.  That  means  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  curb  terrorists'  access  to  nuclear  arms  and  the  materials  used  to  make  them.  ""We  must  recognise  that  we  will  be  unable  to  stop  all  attacks  and  thus  ensure  terrorists  will  not  be  able  to  strike  with  weapons  of  mass  destruction,""  Prof  Etzioni  continues.  |||    He  suggests  so-called  rogue  states  such  as  Iran  and  North  Korea  are  less  of  a  problem  than  ""failed  and  failing  states"",  which  are  more  likely  to  be  a  source  of  nuclear  materials.  He  names  Russia  as  the  ""failing  state""  of  gravest  concern  as  it  has  an  estimated  90%  of  all  fissile  material  outside  America.  And  he  is  also  worried  about  Pakistan  after  one  of  its  top  nuclear  scientists,  Abdul  Qadeer  Khan,  admitted  leaking  nuclear  secrets.  Prof  Etzioni  criticises  the  US  for  overlooking  those  reports,  suggesting  it  was  done  in  return  for  Pakistani  help  in  hunting  Osama  Bin  Laden.  ""This  is  like  letting  a  serial  killer  go  because  he  promised  to  catch  some  jay-walkers,""  he  says.  |||        -  Upgrading  security  at  nuclear  arms  stores  as  a  temporary  measure      -  Creating  a  new  Global  Safety  Authority  to  tackle  nuclear  terrorism,  using  the  intelligence  links  established  in  the  wake  of  11  September  -  backed  by  the  United  Nations'  authority      -  Encouraging,  pressuring  and  using  ""all  available  means""  to  persuade  countries  to  switch  their  highly-enriched  uranium  for  less  dangerous  less-enriched  uranium      -  When  possible,  taking  fissile  material  away  from  failing  states  to  safe  havens  where  it  can  be  blended  down  or  converted      -  Compelling  ""failing  and  rogue  states"",  and  eventually  all  states,  to  destroy  their  nuclear  bombs." 

0	"Survey  confirms  property  slowdown  |||    Government  figures  have  confirmed  a  widely  reported  slowdown  of  the  UK's  housing  market  in  late  2004.  |||    House  prices  were  11.8%  higher  on  the  year  in  the  last  quarter  of  2004,  down  from  16.3%  in  the  July-to-September  quarter,  the  Land  Registry  said.  The  average  house  price  in  England  and  Wales  was  £182,920,  down  from  £187,971  in  July-September.  The  volume  of  sales  between  October  and  December  dropped  by  nearly  a  quarter  from  the  same  period  in  2003.  The  government  figures  are  the  first  official  confirmation  of  falls  in  the  market  at  the  end  of  2004.  Land  Registry  figures  are  less  up  to  date  than  those  of  banks  and  building  societies,  since  they  record  completions  not  mortgage  approvals.  However,  the  figures  are  viewed  as  the  most  accurate  measure  of  house  prices  as  they  include  all  property  transactions,  including  cash  sales.  |||    The  cost  of  buying  a  home  fell  in  seven  out  of  10  regions  between  the  third  and  fourth  quarters  of  2004.  |||    The  biggest  annual  gains  were  made  in  Wales,  where  house  prices  were  up  by  23%  in  the  fourth  quarter.  House  prices  rose  the  slowest  in  Greater  London,  being  up  by  6%.  In  the  capital,  the  volume  of  sales  fell  by  23%  from  36,185  in  2003  to  28,041  for  the  same  period  in  2004.  There  was  also  a  decline  in  the  number  of  million-pound  properties  sold  in  the  capital,  with  436  properties  over  £1m  sold  compared  to  469  for  the  same  period  in  2003.  Although  the  figures  point  to  a  slowdown  in  the  market,  the  most  recent  surveys  from  Nationwide  and  Halifax  have  indicated  the  market  may  be  undergoing  a  revival.  After  registering  falls  at  the  back  end  of  2004,  Halifax  said  house  prices  rose  by  0.8%  in  January  and  Nationwide  reported  a  rise  of  0.4%  in  the  first  month  of  the  year.  Members  of  the  Bank  of  England's  rate-setting  committee  will  make  their  latest  decision  on  interest  rates  on  Thursday." 

0	"No  seasonal  lift  for  house  market  |||    A  swathe  of  figures  have  provided  further  evidence  of  a  slowdown  in  the  UK  property  market.  |||    The  Council  of  Mortgage  Lenders  (CML),  British  Bankers  Association  (BBA)  and  Building  Societies  Association  (BSA)  all  said  mortgage  lending  was  slowing.  CML  figures  showed  gross  lending  fell  by  4%  in  November  as  the  number  of  people  buying  new  homes  fell.  Elsewhere,  the  BBA  added  underlying  mortgage  lending  rose  by  £4m  in  November,  compared  to  October's  £4.29m.  The  CML  said  that  loans  for  new  property  purchases  fell  25%  year-on-year  to  85,000  -  the  lowest  total  seen  since  February  2003.  |||    Data  from  the  CML  showed  lending  fell  to  just  over  £25bn  in  November,  from  £25.5bn  a  year  earlier.  Separate  figures  from  the  Building  Societies  Association  showed  the  value  of  mortgage  approvals  --  loans  agreed  but  not  yet  made  --  stood  32%  lower  than  at  the  same  time  last  year,  at  a  seasonally-adjusted  £2.98bn.  The  figures  come  hot  on  the  heels  of  new  data  from  property  website  Rightmove  which  suggested  owners  must  indulge  in  a  ""winter  sale""  and  slash  prices  by  up  to  8%.  Miles  Shipside,  commercial  director  at  Rightmove,  said  sellers  would  have  to  be  ""more  realistic  with  their  asking  prices""  to  tempt  buyers.  The  average  asking  price  of  a  home  fell  by  more  than  £600  from  £190,329  in  November  to  £189,733  in  December,  while  the  length  of  time  it  takes  to  sell  a  home  rose  to  81  days  from  53  in  the  summer.  |||    Rightmove  said  estate  agents  were  set  to  enter  2005  with  a  third  more  properties  on  their  books  than  a  year  ago.  ""Even  once  the  quieter  holiday  period  is  over,  sellers  will  find  themselves  competing  with  a  lot  of  other  properties  on  the  market.  In  any  business,  excess  supply  and  low  demand  means  one  thing  -  cut  prices,""  Mr  Shipside  said.  |||    ""The  proof  is  that  some  properties  that  have  been  appropriately  discounted  are  selling,  even  in  the  current  market.""  Overall,  asking  prices  have  fallen  3.3%  from  their  July  peaks  as  the  equivalent  of  £6,500  has  been  cut  from  an  average  property.  A  host  of  mortgage  lenders  and  economists  have  predicted  that  property  prices  will  either  fall  or  stagnate  in  2005.  ""What  is  apparent  is  a  picture  of  a  slowing  market,  but  one  that  should  remain  stable  as  we  return  to  more  normal  volumes  of  lending  over  2005  as  a  whole,""  CML  director  general  Michael  Coogan  said.  ""It's  a  fairly  consistent  picture,  showing  that  mortgage  demand  has  fallen  back  again,  which  is  consistent  with  a  continuing  correction  in  the  housing  market,""  Investec  economist  Philip  Shaw  said.  ""However,  the  figures  do  suggest  only  a  modest  weakening,  and  we  stand  by  our  view  that  the  property  market  will  remain  in  the  doldrums  for  some  time,  though  a  collapse  is  still  unlikely.""" 

2	"Immigration  to  be  election  issue  |||    Immigration  and  asylum  have  normally  been  issues  politicians  from  the  big  parties  have  tiptoed  around  at  election  time.  |||    But  no  longer.  Both  Labour  and  the  Tories  have  signalled  their  intention  of  making  them  central  to  their  election  campaigns.  They  have  been  struck  by  the  level  of  concern  amongst  voters  about  the  issues,  with  internal  surveys  showing  they  have  the  potential  to  swing  large  numbers  of  votes.  That  was  also  true  at  the  last  general  election  and  the  issue  did  briefly  become  a  campaigning  issue.  But  it  sparked  the  probably  predictable  furore  with  claims  politicians  were  either  stoking  up  xenophobia  or,  alternatively,  running  scared  of  addressing  the  problem.  But  this  time  around  it  looks  set  to  be  one  of  the  core  battlegrounds  with  both  the  big  parties  competing  to  set  out  tough  policies.  |||    The  Tories  are  already  committed  to  imposing  annual  limits  on  immigration,  with  a  quota  for  asylum  seekers  and  with  applications  processed  outside  the  UK.  Labour  has  already  branded  the  proposal  unworkable  but  party  strategists  have  seen  the  Tories  seizing  a  poll  advantage  over  the  issue.  |||    Now  Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  has  come  up  with  alternative  proposals  for  a  points  system  to  ensure  only  immigrants  who  can  benefit  the  economy  will  be  granted  entry,  and  to  kick  out  more  failed  asylum  seekers.  That  has  been  attacked  by  the  Tories  as  too  little,  too  late  and  for  failing  to  tackle  the  key  issue  of  the  numbers  entering  the  UK.  The  Liberal  Democrats  have  not  been  drawn  too  deeply  into  the  argument  but  have  called  for  a  Europe-wide  policy  on  immigration.  |||    But,  while  all  the  parties  appear  to  agree  the  time  has  come  to  properly  debate  and  address  the  issue,  there  are  already  signs  they  will  run  into  precisely  the  same  problems  as  before.  Former  union  leader  Sir  Bill  Morris  has  already  accused  both  the  big  parties  of  engaging  in  a  ""bidding  war  about  who  can  be  nastiest  to  asylum  seekers"".  |||    ""My  concern  is  that,  whilst  the  Labour  Party  and  the  Conservative  Party  will  take  a  constructive  approach  to  the  debate,  right-wing  political  parties,  picking  up  on  statements  like  `burden  to  Britain'  will  exploit  this  and  create  a  lot  of  fear  and  uncertainty"".  It  is  precisely  that  concern  -  and  the  possible  suggestion  the  issue  is  playing  to  the  far  right's  racist  agenda  -  that  will  provoke  strong  reactions  from  many  concerned  with  this  issue.  The  challenge  for  the  big  parties  is  to  ensure  they  can  engage  in  the  debate  during  the  cut  and  thrust  of  a  general  election  while  also  avoiding  that  trap."

Analysts  expect  Jet  to  raise  at  least  16.4bn  rupees  ($375m;  £198m)  from  the  offering.  Interest  in  Jet's  IPO  has  been  fuelled  by  hopes  for  robust  growth  in  India's  air  travel  market.  |||    The  share  offer,  representing  about  20%  of  Jet's  equity,  was  oversubscribed,  news  agency  Reuters  reported.  Jet,  which  was  founded  by  London-based  travel  agent  Naresh  Goyal,  plans  to  use  the  cash  to  buy  new  planes  and  cut  its  debt.  The  company  has  grown  rapidly  since  it  launched  operations  in  1993,  overtaking  state-owned  flag  carrier  Indian  Airlines.  However,  it  faces  stiff  competition  from  rivals  and  low-cost  carriers.

The  annual  rate  has  halved  since  August  last  year,  as  interest  rises  have  cooled  the  housing  market.  At  the  same  time,  the  number  of  mortgage  approvals  fell  in  January  to  a  near  10-year  low,  official  Bank  of  England  figures  have  shown.  |||    Nationwide  said  that  in  January  house  prices  went  up  by  0.4%  on  the  month  and  by  12.6%  on  a  year  earlier.  ""We  are  not  seeing  the  market  collapsing  in  the  way  some  had  feared,""  said  Nationwide  economist  Alex  Bannister.  There  have  been  a  number  of  warnings  that  the  UK  housing  market  may  be  heading  for  a  downturn  after  four  years  of  strong  growth  to  2004.  In  November,  Barclays,  which  owns  former  building  society  the  Woolwich,  forecast  an  8%  fall  in  property  prices  in  2005,  followed  by  further  declines  in  2006  and  2007.  And  last  summer,  economists  at  PricewaterhouseCoopers  (PWC)  warned  house  prices  were  overvalued  and  could  fall  by  between  10%  and  15%  by  2009.  |||    The  price  of  an  average  UK  property  now  stands  at  £152,879.  Homeowners  now  expect  house  prices  to  rise  by  1%  over  the  next  six  months,  Mr  Bannister  said.  He  said  if  the  growth  continued  at  this  level  then  the  Bank  of  England  may  increase  interest  rates  from  their  current  4.75%.  |||    ""I  think  the  key  is  what  the  Bank  expects  to  happen  to  the  housing  market.  We  always  thought  we  would  see  a  small  rise,  they  thought  they  would  see  a  small  decline.""  House  prices  have  risen  0.9%  this  year,  Nationwide  said,  and  if  this  pace  of  increase  persists,  prices  would  rise  by  just  under  6%  in  the  year  to  December.  This  is  slightly  above  the  0-5%  range  Nationwide  predicts.  |||    Further  evidence  of  a  slowdown  in  the  housing  market  emerged  from  Bank  of  England  lending  figures  released  on  Tuesday.  New  mortgage  loans  in  January  fell  to  79,000  from  82,000  in  December,  the  bank  said.  The  past  few  months  have  seen  approvals  fall  to  levels  last  seen  in  1995.  The  Bank  revealed  that  48,000  fewer  mortgages  were  approved  in  January  than  for  the  same  month  in  2004.  Overall,  mortgage  lending  rose  by  £7.2bn  in  January,  marginally  up  on  the  £7.1bn  rise  in  December."

But  the  group  said  Barclays  is  still  waiting  for  the  approval  of  South  Africa's  banking  and  competition  authorities  to  make  a  formal  offer.  Absa  also  announced  that  it  expects  to  see  earnings  grow  by  20-25%  in  its  current  financial  year.  |||    ""Discussions  with  Barclays  are  continuing,  but  shareholders  are  advised  that  no  agreement  has  been  reached  as  to  any  offer  being  made  by  Barclays  to  acquire  a  majority  stake  in  Absa,""  Absa  said  in  a  statement.  If  Barclays  buys  a  stake  in  Absa  it  will  be  one  of  the  largest  foreign  investments  in  South  Africa  in  recent  years.  Absa  currently  has  a  market  value  of  about  $8.5bn  (£4.4bn).  Analysts  said  Absa's  earnings  forecast  was  better  than  expected.  However,  the  company  warned  that  headline  earnings  growth  would  be  trimmed  by  about  four  percentage  points  because  of  share  options  for  a  black  economic  empowerment  transaction  and  a  staff  share  incentive  scheme.  The  South  African  group  will  release  its  results  for  the  year  to  31  March  on  30  May."

Qwest  chairman  Richard  Notebaert  sent  a  letter  to  MCI's  board  on  Thursday  saying  that  it  plans  to  submit  a  new  offer  after  examining  Verizon's  bid.  Formerly  known  as  Worldcom,  MCI  is  a  long-distance  and  corporate  phone  firm.  Snapping  up  MCI  would  give  the  buyer  access  to  a  global  telecommunications  network  and  a  large  number  of  business-based  subscribers.  Shares  of  MCI  were  up  more  than  4%  in  electronic  trading  after  the  close  of  New  York  markets.  |||    Qwest  said  on  Wednesday  that  MCI  had  rejected  a  deal  worth  $8bn.  ""We  would  like  to  advise  you  that  once  we  have  completed  our  review  of  the  Verizon  merger  agreement,  we  do  intend  to  submit  a  modified  offer  to  acquire  MCI,""  the  letter  from  Qwest  said.  Verizon's  offer  is  made  up  of  cash,  shares  and  dividends,  and  a  number  of  investors  have  said  that  it  undervalues  MCI.  Verizon  plans  to  swap  0.41  of  its  shares  and  $1.50  in  cash  for  each  MCI  share,  as  well  as  offering  special  dividends  of  $4.50  a  share.  Both  company  boards  have  backed  the  deal,  but  regulators  will  still  need  to  give  their  approval.  As  well  as  trying  to  lure  investors  with  the  promise  of  better  returns,  Qwest  also  reckons  that  its  offer  will  face  less  regulatory  scrutiny  than  Verizon's.  |||    The  takeover  would  be  the  fifth  billion-dollar  telecoms  deal  since  October  as  companies  look  to  cut  costs  and  boost  client  bases.  Earlier  this  month,  SBC  Communications  agreed  to  buy  its  former  parent  and  phone  trailblazer  AT&T  for  about  $16bn.  There  may  be  concerns  other  than  cash,  however,  especially  as  MCI  only  emerged  from  bankruptcy  protection  last  April.  Verizon  is  far  bigger  than  Qwest,  has  fewer  debts  and  has  built  a  successful  mobile  division.  Also,  MCI,  while  trading  under  the  name  Worldcom,  became  the  biggest  corporate  bankruptcy  in  US  history  after  admitting  that  it  illegally  booked  expenses  and  inflated  profits.  Former  Worldcom  boss  Bernie  Ebbers  is  currently  standing  trial,  accused  of  overseeing  an  $11bn  fraud.  Qwest,  meanwhile,  had  to  pay  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  $250m  in  October  to  settle  charges  that  it  massaged  earnings  to  keep  Wall  Street  happy." 

2	"Minimum  wage  increased  to  £5.05  |||    The  minimum  wage  will  rise  in  October,  benefiting  more  than  1m  people,  the  government  has  announced.  |||    Adults  must  be  paid  at  least  £5.05  an  hour,  up  from  £4.85,  while  18  to  21  year  olds  will  be  paid  £4.25.  The  recommendations  came  from  the  Low  Pay  Commission  which  said  the  number  of  jobs  had  continued  to  grow  since  the  minimum  wage  was  introduced  in  1999.  Businesses  wanted  it  frozen,  warning  more  rises  could  damage  competitiveness  but  the  unions  want  a  £6  rate.  |||    A  further  increase  in  the  adult  rate  to  £5.35  an  hour  is  provisionally  scheduled  for  October  2006.  According  to  the  commission,  many  businesses  had  found  the  last  two  significant  increases  in  the  minimum  wage  ""challenging"".  ""We  have  therefore  recommended  only  a  slight  increase  above  average  earnings,  and  concentrated  it  in  the  second  year  to  allow  business  more  time  to  absorb  the  impact,""  said  chairman  Adair  Turner.  The  government  says  most  of  those  on  the  minimum  wage  are  women  -  with  many  working  in  cleaning,  catering,  shops  and  hairdressing.  |||    Unveiling  the  latest  increase,  Mr  Blair  said  he  wanted  the  minimum  wage  to  become  a  ""symbol  of  decency  and  fairness"".  ""For  too  long,  poverty  pay  capped  the  aspiration  and  prosperity  of  far  too  many  hard-working  families,""  he  said.  ""Too  often,  people  were  told  to  make  a  choice  between  the  indignity  of  unemployment  or  the  humiliation  of  poverty  pay.""  Chancellor  Gordon  Brown  and  Transport  Secretary  Alistair  Darling  promoted  the  news  in  Edinburgh,  Wales  Secretary  Peter  Hain  and  Welsh  First  Minister  Rhodri  Morgan  in  Cardiff  and  Northern  Ireland  Minister  John  Spellar  in  Belfast.  The  government  has  not  accepted  the  commission's  recommendation  that  21-year-olds  should  be  paid  at  the  adult  rate,  but  says  it  will  look  again  at  the  rate  later  on.  Mr  Brown  said:  ""We  want  to  do  nothing  that  can  damage  the  employment  opportunities  for  young  people,  particularly  young  people  entering  the  labour  market  for  the  first  time.""  The  government  has  said  it  will  look  at  tougher  action  against  the  small  number  of  employers  who  consistently  refuse  to  pay  the  minimum  wage.  |||    The  national  minimum  wage  is  currently  set  at  £4.85  per  hour  for  those  aged  22  and  above,  and  at  £4.10  for  those  aged  18  to  21.  A  £3  per  hour  minimum  wage  was  introduced  last  October  for  16  to  17-year-olds,  but  apprentices  are  exempt.  The  Trade  Unions  Congress  welcomed  the  increase,  but  has  called  for  a  £6  minimum  wage  by  next  year.  But  the  Confederation  of  British  Industry  (CBI)  called  for  a  ""pause  year""  to  assess  the  impact  of  the  above  inflation  rise  in  the  minimum  wage  in  October.  And  David  Frost,  director  of  the  British  Chambers  of  Commerce,  said:  ""The  level  of  increase  each  year  has  increased  by  rates  far  outstripping  the  rates  of  inflation.  ""What  employers  are  saying  to  us  now  is  that  it's  at  a  level  where  it's  starting  to  bite  into  the  competitiveness  of  companies  right  across  the  country.""  |||    The  Liberal  Democrats'  economics  spokesman  Vincent  Cable  said  he  supported  the  move  to  raise  the  minimum  wage.  ""It's  not  just  good  for  the  workers  themselves  but  it  lifts  them  out  of  benefits  and  therefore  is  good  for  the  Exchequer  too,""  he  said.  Conservative  leader  Michael  Howard  said  he  accepted  the  principle  of  the  minimum  wage  and  would  not  ""seek  to  disturb""  the  increase.  Speaking  on  BBC  Radio  4's  Woman's  Hour,  Mr  Howard  hinted  the  Tories  might  go  into  the  general  election  with  a  promise  to  cancel  income  tax  for  the  lowest-paid  workers.  ""There  are  people  on  very  low  salaries,  very  low  incomes  indeed  who  really  shouldn't  be  paying  income  tax,""  he  said.  |||    It  would  be  better  to  decrease  taxes  on  earnings  below  £12,000  a  year,  with  say  no  tax  on  below  £6,000.  The  losses  in  tax  can  be  recouped  by  having  a  50pc  tax  band  for  people  making  over  £100,000.  Our  minimum  wage  is  going  to  be  effectively  almost  twice  the  US  minimum  wage,  yet  our  economy  per  person  is  only  2/3rds  of  the  US!  Perhaps,  we  have  to  really  starting  questioning  why  some  products  cost  50-60%  more  here  than  they  do  in  the  US.  This  combined  with  the  tax  decreases  would  make  the  pounds  the  low-paid  people  do  make  go  much  further.  |||    It's  still  not  good  enough!  I  got  a  part  time  Job  at  16  when  I  was  doing  my  A-levels  in  an  attempt  to  get  a  little  money  saved  for  Uni.  This  was  only  2  years  ago  and  I  was  getting  paid  £2.75  an  hour,  and  working  as  hard  as  any  of  the  older  staff,  maybe  it's  about  time  16  -  21  year  olds  got  a  fair  wage!  |||    We  must  remember  that  the  minimum  wage  is  only  part  of  the  picture  and  must  not  rise  to  a  level  that  makes  employing  people  unattractive  and  encourages  businesses  to  send  work  and  therefore  jobs  abroad.  Still  government  and  local  councils  employ  staff  via  their  contractors  that  pay  at  the  minimum  wage  or  very  close  to  it.  An  easy  way  for  the  government  to  do  as  it  preaches  would  be  to  insist  on  floor  pay  levels  for  all  government  workers  and  take  tens  of  thousand  of  civil  servants  out  of  the  social  security  system  all  together.  |||    Any  increase  is  certainly  welcome  news.  However  for  all  those  whining  about  the  pressures  of  an  increase  in  the  minimum  wage  I  would  simply  ask  them:  ""Would  you  be  happy  to  work  for  less  than  £5.05  an  hour?"".  Thought  not  ...  so  then,  don't  expect  others  to  either.  |||    I  can't  believe  that  so  many  of  these  comments  are  against  the  minimum  wage!  Also  I  personally  take  great  offence  at  the  insinuation  that  people  earning  minimum  wage  were  lazy  at  school  if  everyone  went  to  university  then  who  would  serve  you  in  the  supermarkets  and  clean  up  after  you?  It's  about  time  that  these  hardworking  people  are  rewarded  with  only  what  they  deserve  and  have  earned  fair  pay  and  a  bit  of  respect  wouldn't  go  a  miss  either.  br  /&gt;  |||    This  is  good  news.  The  minimum  wage  has  put  a  sense  of  equality  back  into  a  worker's  relationship  with  their  employer.  Wages  are  supposed  to  be  a  fair  reflection  of  an  employee's  efforts.  For  too  long  wages  were  a  point  of  exploitation  -  what  could  an  employer  get  away  with.  In  very  simplistic  terms  this  put  a  pressure  to  keep  low-paid  wages  low.  With  the  minimum  wage  this  downward  pressure  is  at  least  partly  removed.  |||    It  is  also  interesting  to  read  the  comments  from  so  called  business  leaders.  They  are  the  first  to  defend  the  rights  and  privileges  of  boards  to  award  fat-cat  salaries,  bonuses  and  pension  rights  to  the  select  few  but  they  are  the  first  to  attack  policies  that  are  put  in  place  to  merely  defend  the  rights  of  those  that  really  make  those  fat  cats  purr!  |||    I  feel  there  are  both  negatives  and  positives  to  the  increase,  on  one  hand  some  businesses  will  struggle  to  stay  afloat  but  on  the  other  hand  in  today  world  many  young  people  can't  afford  to  move  out  as  property  costs  too  much  and  only  by  earning  more  will  they  be  able  to  get  on  in  life.  Its  true  many  may  get  complacent  but  the  minimum  wage  could  be  looked  at  as  more  of  a  stepping  stone  rather  than  a  hand  out.  |||    Here  come  the  usual  whines  about  how  difficult  it  will  be  for  businesses!  We  all  remember  Michael  Howard's  protestations  that  the  minimum  wage  would  cost  a  million  jobs  when  it  was  introduced  -  funny  how  he's  gone  quiet  on  that  one!  Jobs  have  continued  to  increase  since  this  humane  legislation  was  brought  in.  I  think  if  any  job  is  worth  doing  then  it's  worth  being  paid  a  fair  wage  for,  and  £5.05  is  hardly  a  fortune.  If  your  business  cannot  pay  its  workers  a  decent  wage  then  maybe  it's  not  being  run  properly  and  if  it  folds,  a  better-run  company  will  take  over  its  duties  and  employ  more  people,  so  everybody  wins  except  incompetent  business  owners!  |||    Great  keep  at  it  Tony,  I  remember  the  despair  of  the  80s  and  the  low  wages  employers  got  away  with.  At  last  we  can  make  a  difference  to  people  and  reward  them  for  working.  We  can't  afford  not  to  pay  a  decent  wage.  It's  not  a  jobs  at  any  price  economy,  goodbye  sweatshops  hello  decency.  |||    The  increase  in  minimum  wage  is  a  good  thing.  Living  in  the  southwest  where  house  prices  and  rent  have  increased  hugely  (like  the  rest  of  the  country)  over  the  past  5  years  has  made  living  for  you  average  18-21  years  old  very  difficult.  In  the  south  west  the  increase  in  living  costs  have  not  been  matched  by  an  increase  in  pay,  for  example  a  job  I  did  in  Plymouth  was  underpaid  to  an  equivalent  worker  in  Exeter  by  75p  an  hour.  Hopefully  the  increase  in  the  minimum  wage  will  bring  in  to  balance  pay  on  a  regional  and  national  level,  and  in  turn  allow  people  like  myself  who  do  work  hard,  but  might  never  earn  a  6  figure  salary  the  chance  to  branch  out  on  our  own.  |||    I  work  at  a  large  Hospital  where  the  contractors  providing  all  ancillary  services  -  domestic,  catering  &  portering  etc  -  pay  the  minimum  wage  of  £4.85  as  the  basic  rate.  Someone  has  to  do  these  unglamorous  jobs  and  earn  enough  to  live  decently.  How  dare  people  suggest  we  are  lazy  or  complacent  for  accepting  these  jobs  and  these  wages?  Who  do  they  think  will  be  carrying  out  these  public  service  jobs  if  contractors  are  allowed  to  pay  as  little  as  their  consciences  allow?  |||    This  is  definitely  the  right  step  in  the  right  direction.  It  shows  that  this  government  cares  for  the  low  income  earners  as  well.  This  is  a  million  votes  more.  Good  strategy  isn't  it?  |||    Although  I  would  not  deny  people  the  minimum  wage  increase,  its  timing  stinks.  I  am  quite  prepared  for  a  raft  of  'bribes'  to  come  from  the  government  before  the  election  and  a  raft  of  taxes  afterwards,  they  are  playing  us  for  the  fools  they  think  we  are.  |||    This  is  extremely  bad  news  for  any  business  -  whether  they  are  small  and  medium  enterprises  or  even  large  companies.  By  increasing  overheads,  for  business,  there  will  be  an  almost  certain  rise  in  costs  to  the  consumer  who  while  they  openly  welcome  the  idea  of  an  increase  in  the  minimum  wage  are  the  same  people  who  still  want  to  buy  that  shirt,  or  that  pair  of  trainers  for  next  to  nothing.  The  extra  cost  this  increase  will  bring,  will  only  be  reflected  in  the  price  of  the  goods  we  buy,  which,  in  turn  will  only  serve  to  discourage  companies  from  setting-up  business  in  the  UK,  or  encourage  those  companies  already  based  here  to  look  elsewhere.  The  jubilation  felt  by  ""low-paid""  workers  here  will  soon  give  way  to  misery  as  they  lose  their  jobs.  |||    This  will  only  lead  to  a  reduction  in  jobs.  Why  have  many  of  the  call  centre  jobs  gone  to  India.  Blair  say's  the  economy  is  ""strong  and  stable  economy""  however  consumer  debt  and  the  country's  debt  is  at  its  highest  and  now  they  heap  this  onto  businesses,  that  will  have  no  choice  but  to  cut  the  workforce.  |||    The  timing  cannot  be  coincidental.  This  is  blatant  electioneering  and  should  be  exposed  as  such.  |||    Andrew  in  Derby  complains  that  raising  the  minimum  wage  is  'blatant  electioneering'.  I  don't  mind  if  it  is.  In  our  degraded  democracy,  elections  are  the  one  time  when  elites  really  have  to  worry  about  doing  something  concrete  for  the  majority.  My  only  complaint  is  the  paltry  figures  being  discussed.  If  my  maths  is  right,  a  35  hour  week  at  £5.05  gives  you  an  annual  income  just  over  £9,000  and  raising  it  to  £6  leaves  it  under  £11,000.  The  unions  should  be  putting  the  Government  under  pressure  for  much  more.  Businesses  complaining  might  like  to  take  a  look  at  corporate  pay,  shareholder  payouts  and  profits  before  wondering  if  paying  a  living  wage  is  really  a  controlling  factor  in  the  viability  of  their  firm.  |||    I  am  all  for  lifting  the  minimum  wage  of  workers  to  a  reasonable  level,  but  we  have  to  accept  that  with  this  will  come  competition  from  overseas  workers.  Also  small  businesses  will  have  to  be  able  to  afford  this  manpower  cost.  We  are  already  seeing  a  sweeping  change  in  IT  work  being  lost  to  India  where  people  are  paid  much  less.  It  is  difficult  for  me  to  understand  that  only  five  years  ago  cheap  labour  abroad  was  classified  as  'sweat  shop',  but  now  we  are  told  it  is  global  competition.  With  our  manufacturing  industry  in  serious  decline  the  country  cannot  be  entirely  service  industries  without  something  tangible  to  serve.  There  has  to  be  something  at  the  top  of  the  food  chain  and  that  is  manufacturing.  The  whole  picture  needs  to  be  looked  at.  |||    This  is  great  news,  but  that  might  be  because  I  work  for  minimum  wage.  Seems  a  good  idea  and  will  hopefully  be  an  incentive  to  those  who  live  to  claim  to  actually  get  a  job.  When  you  can  ""earn""  more  from  claiming  than  you  can  from  work,  there  is  no  incentive.  Perhaps  a  step  in  the  right  direction.  |||    If  the  TUC  get  their  way  a  very  large  number  of  SMEs  will  have  to  close  -  this  will  put  more  people  out  of  work.  How  then  will  the  government  fudge  the  unemployment  figures!  The  government  know  it  is  not  big  business  that  keeps  the  economy  going  but  the  SMEs  but  we  always  get  overlooked,  they  will  only  take  notice  if  these  large  corporations  close  and  move  to  other  countries,  after  all  they  are  predominantly  owned  by  foreign  companies.  We  are  a  specialist  company  but  with  these  increases  have  already  had  an  effect  on  us  and  we  have  lost  work  another  one  will  close  us.  |||    While  I'm  delighted  for  those  on  low  pay  that  this  increase  is  being  put  forward,  I  am  extremely  concerned  at  the  implications  for  small  businesses.  As  an  employee  for  a  small  nursery,  I  know  this  increase  will  cause  great  hardship  for  my  employer,  who  has  been  unable  to  increase  salaries  for  higher  paid  employees  because  of  last  October's  increase  for  the  lower  paid  employees  -  who  were  originally  being  paid  slightly  above  the  minimum  but  are  now  on  the  minimum.  This  latest  increase  of  20p  an  hour  will  cause  even  more  financial  hardship.  If  the  rate  rises  to  £6  then  I  can  foresee  many  small  businesses  having  to  pay  off  employees.  |||    The  increase  in  minimum  wage  will  have  a  serious  effect  on  my  business.  Although  we  pay  above  the  minimum  level  we  will  have  to  increase  our  pay  rates  to  maintain  the  differential.  The  raise  is  well  above  inflation  and  without  significant  increases  in  sales,  it  will  mean  that  I  will  not  be  taking  on  a  new  member  of  staff  as  planned  and  I  will  be  looking  to  reduce  the  total  hours  worked  by  the  other  members  of  staff,  overtime  being  the  first  to  go.  |||    I  currently  employ  42  staff  whose  wages  mirror  the  national  minimum  wage.  Increases  above  inflation  are  fine  but  all  of  my  business  is  conducted  with  local  authorities  who  will  not  accept  above  inflation  rises  in  my  service  delivery.  80%  of  my  costs  are  labour.  The  other  aspect  that  is  always  hidden  is  that  the  thresholds  for  tax  credits  do  not  move  in  line  with  these  increases  so  that  all  that  happens  is  that  employees  tax  credit  support  is  reduced  by  the  amount  of  the  increase,  thereby  saving  the  government  money  but  increasing  the  financial  burden  on  small  to  medium  businesses  |||    It  is  very  good  that  the  government  has  decided  to  increase  the  minimum  wage  -  this  should  hopefully  motivate  people  to  undertake  the  ""lower  status""  jobs.  |||    I  know  about  this  great  idea  -  don't  bother  getting  qualifications,  laze  about  at  school,  no  need  to  do  anything  other  than  attend  so  your  parents  don't  get  fined  because  remember,  when  you  do  eventually  start  working,  doesn't  matter  how  lazy  you  are,  you'll  be  guaranteed  a  decent  wage.  The  ones  who  suffer  are  the  employers.  |||    I  hope  that  if  industry  and  business  have  to  pay  this  new  rate  that  Mr  Blair  and  Mr  Brown  will  increase  tax  allowances  and  raise  national  insurance  thresholds  so  that  the  treasury  won't  take  some  of  this  increase  off  the  people  they  say  they  are  helping,  or  is  this  just  another  form  of  stealth  tax  on  business  through  the  back  door?  |||    I  don't  believe  in  the  minimum  wage  at  all!  I  think  jobs  should  create  their  own  wage  value  and  that  if  people  want  higher  wages  they  should  earn  them.  Now,  before  everyone  thinks  that  I  am  some  ""rich-kid"",  I  can  assure  you  I  am  not.  I  came  from  a  very  much  working  class  background  and  started  work  20  years  ago  on  a  Youth  Opportunity  Program  earning  £25  per  week.  I  worked  hard,  went  to  college  part  time,  got  my  A-levels  and  degree  &  bettered  myself.  I  now  earn  a  6  figure  salary.  I  did  that  through  hard  work  and  getting  off  my  backside.  A  minimum  wage  just  makes  people  complacent.  |||    To  Ashley,  of  Swindon:  when  you  earned  £25  per  week,  it  was  worth  something.  These  days  that  £25  would  need  to  be  near  to  £60  to  have  the  equivalent  buying  power.  I  might  add,  that  thanks  to  successive  governments  holding  down  the  tax  allowance  threshold  below  inflation,  people  earning  the  minimum  wage  are  paying  taxes  that  they  never  would  have  done  10  years  ago  at  equivalent  wages.  ""In  my  day""  type  arguments  are  a  view  that  belong  in  the  'your  day'  -  20  years  ago!  |||    As  a  graduate  working  for  minimum  wage,  I  welcome  any  increase  of  pay  I  can  get.  I  disagree  with  Ashley,  Swindon  saying  I  have  to  work  harder  to  get  more  pay.  I  have  my  GCSE's  A-Levels  and  A  degree  and  have  chosen  to  work  for  a  small  business  that  can't  afford  the  wages  I  should  be  getting,  I  should  be  on  at  least  3x  what  I'm  getting  but  they  can't  afford  it.  We  all  work  hard  but  the  money  is  just  not  there.  But  on  the  plus  side  I  love  my  job  and  wouldn't  change  it  just  to  get  more  pay.  |||    As  an  employer  of  staff  in  several  shops  the  last  rise  in  the  minimum  wage  cost  my  company  an  additional  £5000  per  year.  These  next  rises  will  cost  me  more.  I  have  to  get  the  money  from  somewhere  so  pass  it  on  to  customers.  So  no  one  really  wins  in  the  end.  |||    In  answer  to  Emma  from  Sleaford  regarding  no  one  really  wins  in  the  end...  on  the  contrary  Mr  Blair  wins  -  he  wins  because  he  obviously  has  announced  this  to  be  a  vote  winner  and  his  treasury  wins  because  as  an  employer  you  will  know  that  the  amount  of  tax  and  national  insurance  that  the  government  will  receive  from  all  the  minimum  wage  increases  will  rise  and  of  course  not  only  will  be  paying  out  higher  wages  but  as  an  employer  higher  Employer  NI  Contributions  as  well.  If  the  minimum  wage  increases  again  and  if  it  hits  anywhere  near  the  £6.00  mark  there  will  be  12  more  people  on  the  employment  line  and  one  more  small  business  going  bankrupt  -  namely  mine.  Think  of  us  employers  as  well  Mr  Blair,  we  are  not  all  big  corporations  earning  millions.  |||    All  workers  should  be  entitled  to  a  fair  day's  pay  for  a  fair  day's  work.  How  many  people  on  the  minimum  wage  have  any  hope  of  obtaining  a  mortgage  or  saving  towards  retirement?  |||    It  is  good  news  for  many  Asians  living  in  UK.  Students  who  do  odd  jobs  can  increase  their  income  and  can  help  there  family  in  their  home  country.  I  thank  Mr.  Blair  and  his  government  for  increase  in  the  national  minimum  wage." 

2	"Blair  dismisses  quit  claim  report  |||    Tony  Blair  has  dismissed  reports  he  told  Gordon  Brown  he  would  quit  before  the  next  general  election.  |||    ""You  don't  do  deals  over  jobs  like  this,""  the  prime  minister  told  BBC  One's  Breakfast  with  Frost  programme.  According  to  a  new  book,  Brown's  Britain,  Mr  Blair  went  back  on  a  pledge  to  make  way  for  Mr  Brown  after  Cabinet  allies  intervened  in  June  2004.  Mr  Blair  said  the  claims  were  ""reheated  from  six  months  ago""  and  that  he  was  concentrating  on  running  the  country.  Mr  Blair  said:  ""I've  dealt  with  this  six  months  ago.  I  said  then  you  don't  do  deals  over  jobs  like  this  -  you  don't.  |||    ""What  both  of  us  are  actually  concentrating  on  are  the  issues  that  concern  the  country.""  The  book,  by  Sunday  Telegraph  journalist  Robert  Peston  and  serialised  in  the  newspaper,  said  the  pair  had  ""mutual  animosity  and  contempt""  for  each  other.  |||    It  claims  Tony  Blair  felt  by  November  2003  he  had  lost  voters'  trust  because  of  the  Iraq  war  and  that  he  was  no  longer  an  asset  to  the  Labour  Party.  And  that  at  a  dinner  hosted  by  Deputy  Prime  Minister  John  Prescott  he  told  Mr  Brown  of  his  intention  to  stand  down.  According  to  Mr  Peston  the  prime  minister  said:  ""Help  me  to  get  through  the  year  and  I  will  then  stand  down.""  But  he  then  changed  his  mind  in  June  2004,  following  intervention  from  allies  in  the  Cabinet  and  the  suspicion  that  the  chancellor  was  deliberately  manoeuvring  against  him,  according  to  the  book.  |||    Mr  Peston  told  BBC  News:  ""My  understanding  is  that  they  are  not  nearly  as  close  or  as  friendly  as  they  once  were.  ""What  the  book  says  is  there  is  now  a  pretty  profound  mutual  mistrust,  mutual  animosity.  ""I  think  in  public  you  see  this  double-act  pretending  everything  is  alright,  but  in  private  I  don't  think  the  relationship  is  good  because  Brown,  understandably,  feels  deeply  betrayed  -  particularly  over  this  issue  of  the  leadership.""  But,  in  a  wide-ranging  BBC  interview  covering  issues  such  as  the  Asian  tsunami  disaster,  the  Middle  East  peace  process  and  Northern  Ireland,  Mr  Blair  said:  ""When  you  get  to  the  top  in  politics  you  get  this  huge  swell  around  you.  ""All  sorts  of  people  make  all  sorts  of  claims  and  counter-claims.""  He  admitted  to  a  ""sense  of  frustration""  about  the  allegations  which  he  said  had  been  made  ""countless  times"".  |||    There  has  been  fresh  speculation  of  a  rift  recently,  following  their  separate  responses  to  the  Asian  tsunami.  These  rumours  were  fuelled  by  Mr  Blair's  decision  to  hold  his  monthly  media  conference  at  the  same  time  as  a  long-planned  speech  by  Mr  Brown  on  UK  plans  to  tackle  global  poverty  with  a  new  ""Marshall  Plan""  for  Africa.  There  was  speculation  the  pair  were  trying  to  outdo  each  other's  response  to  the  disaster.  But  the  prime  minister  said  he  had  discussed  these  claims  with  the  chancellor  and  dismissed  them  as  a  ""load  of  nonsense"".  Former  welfare  minister  Frank  Field  MP  said  the  prime  minister  should  sack  Mr  Brown,  but  did  not  believe  Mr  Blair  was  strong  enough  to  do  so.  |||    Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  accused  the  prime  minister  and  Mr  Brown  of  ""squabbling  like  schoolboys"".  He  told  Sky  News'  Sunday  with  Adam  Boulton:  ""This  is  the  politics  of  the  playground  and  Britain  really  does  deserve  better.""  The  Liberal  Democrat  parliamentary  chairman  Matthew  Taylor  said  the  personal  ambition  of  Mr  Blair  and  Mr  Brown  was  ""getting  in  the  way  of  good  government"".  ""Either  they  need  to  grow  up  and  put  their  squabbles  to  one  side  or  they  cannot  expect  the  electorate  to  support  a  divided  government  at  the  next  election.""  During  the  interview  Mr  Blair  also  said  the  former  home  secretary  David  Blunkett  would  play  a  ""big  role""  at  the  general  election." 

2	"'No  UK  apology'  for  colonial  past  |||    The  days  of  Britain  having  to  apologise  for  its  colonial  past  are  over,  Gordon  Brown  has  said.  |||    The  chancellor,  speaking  during  a  week-long  tour  of  Africa,  said  it  was  time  to  talk  about  enduring  British  values  of  liberty  and  tolerance.  Mr  Brown  has  signed  a  debt  relief  deal  with  Tanzania  which  could  cost  the  UK  £1  billion.  South  African  president  Thabo  Mbeki  has  attacked  British  imperialists,  saying  they  treated  Africans  like  savages.  Mr  Brown  said  that  missionairies  had  come  to  Africa  because  of  their  sense  of  duty.  He  added  that  the  history  of  internationalism  and  enterprise  had  given  Britain  a  greater  global  reach  than  any  other  country.  BBC  political  correspondent  Mark  Mardell  said  Britishness  had  long  been  a  theme  of  the  chancellor's  but  ""never  before  has  he  been  so  outspoken  in  defending  Britain's  past  history"".  |||    The  UK  has  pledged  to  pay  10%  of  the  developing  world's  foreign  debt  bill  in  an  attempt  to  fight  poverty.  On  top  of  the  relief  deal  with  Tanzania  Mr  Brown  said  the  UK  would  make  similar  offers  to  70  poorer  nations  around  the  world.  Under  the  plan  -  which  could  cost  the  UK  £1bn  -  countries  must  spend  the  cash  saved  on  health,  education  and  welfare.  ""We  make  this  offer  unilaterally  but  we  are  now  asking  other  countries  to  join  us,""  the  chancellor  said.  Mr  Brown,  on  a  week-long  tour  of  Africa,  spent  two  days  in  Tanzania  before  heading  on  Friday  evening  to  Mozambique,  a  country  where  more  than  half  of  the  17-million  population  lives  below  the  poverty  line.  |||    There  he  is  expected  to  strike  a  similar  debt  relief  pact.  The  chancellor  said  he  hoped  other  G8  and  European  countries  would  follow  suit.  The  UK  has  already  cancelled  its  bilateral  debts  -  money  the  UK  alone  is  owed  -  with  the  world's  poorest  nations  including  Tanzania.  Former  international  development  secretary  Clare  Short  questioned  the  effectiveness  of  debt  relief  as  a  means  of  tackling  poverty." 

2	"Top  judge  clashes  with  ministers  |||    The  UK's  top  judge  has  revealed  he  has  clashed  with  ministers  about  how  the  heads  of  public  inquiries  are  chosen.  |||    Lord  Woolf  said  he  was  determined  his  current  veto  on  whether  a  judge  should  chair  an  inquiry  should  continue  as  a  guard  for  judicial  independence.  But  he  told  MPs  the  Lord  Chancellor,  Lord  Falconer,  was  insisting  he  should  have  the  final  say  in  such  cases.  Lord  Hutton's  inquiry  into  the  death  of  Dr  David  Kelly  sparked  debate  about  who  should  run  inquiries.  |||    The  government  says  the  lord  chancellor  would  be  unlikely  to  go  against  Lord  Woolf's  wishes.  Lord  Woolf,  who  is  Lord  Chief  Justice  of  England  and  Wales,  was  giving  evidence  to  the  Commons  public  administration  select  committee's  inquiry  into  public  inquiries.  He  said  he  had  not  been  involved  in  the  choice  of  Lord  Hutton,  who  as  a  law  lord  did  not  come  under  his  jurisdiction.  But  he  argued  he  should  have  a  veto  on  whether  judges  generally  should  chair  a  particular  inquiry  and  if  so,  which  judge  it  should  be.  In  written  evidence  to  the  committee,  Lord  Woolf  said:  ""I  have,  so  far,  failed  to  reach  an  agreement  with  the  lord  chancellor  on  this  issue  ...  I  intend  to  maintain  my  position  and  will  press  for  this  safeguard  to  be  in  any  future  legislation.""  |||    Judges  should  think  carefully  before  heading  an  inquiry  into  a  highly  political  issue,  such  as  the  intelligence  on  Iraq's  weapons  of  mass  destruction,  he  said.  He  argued:  ""The  subject  matter  of  the  inquiry  may  be  so  political  that  it  would  be  damaging  to  the  judiciary  for  a  judge  to  be  involved.  ""In  addition,  the  question  of  whether  there  should  be  an  inquiry  at  all  may  be  highly  controversial  and  if  a  judge  is  appointed,  the  judiciary,  as  a  result  of  the  appointment,  may  be  seen  as  siding  inappropriately  with  the  government.""  He  told  the  MPs:  ""Anything  that  tends  to  undermine  the  confidence  of  the  public  in  the  judiciary  worries  me.""  |||    Lord  Woolf  said  the  current  rules  were  not  written  down  but  it  was  inconceivable  in  practice  that  the  lord  chancellor  would  overrule  his  concerns.  But  that  situation  could  change  with  new  legal  reforms.  The  issue  had  been  ""overlooked""  when  a  new  agreement  was  drawn  up  about  those  responsibilities  and  the  dispute  had  emerged  in  later  discussions.  ""What  I  am  asking  for  is  a  situation  where  if  the  lord  chancellor  cannot  obtain  my  agreement  [on  appointing  a  judge],  it  doesn't  happen,""  he  said.  |||    Lord  Woolf  said  he  did  not  think  there  would  be  difficulties  but  he  wanted  to  establish  the  principle.  A  Department  for  Constitutional  Affairs  spokeswoman  said  Lord  Woolf  and  Lord  Falconer  agreed  about  what  happened  in  practice.  ""Their  disagreement  is  about  whether  the  legislation  should  include  a  requirement  for  consultation  or  concurrence  -  a  very  narrow  dispute,  in  Lord  Woolf's  words,""  she  said.  ""As  Lord  Woolf  also  acknowledged,  it  is  highly  unlikely  that  the  lord  chancellor  would  appoint  a  judge  against  the  wishes  of  the  lord  chief  justice.  ""Judges  are  free  to  decide  for  themselves  whether  to  accept  positions  as  inquiry  chairs.""  Parliament  will  examine  the  issue  next  year  when  it  debates  a  new  bill  about  public  inquiries." 

0	"Dollar  gains  on  Greenspan  speech  |||    The  dollar  has  hit  its  highest  level  against  the  euro  in  almost  three  months  after  the  Federal  Reserve  head  said  the  US  trade  deficit  is  set  to  stabilise.  |||    And  Alan  Greenspan  highlighted  the  US  government's  willingness  to  curb  spending  and  rising  household  savings  as  factors  which  may  help  to  reduce  it.  In  late  trading  in  New  York,  the  dollar  reached  $1.2871  against  the  euro,  from  $1.2974  on  Thursday.  Market  concerns  about  the  deficit  has  hit  the  greenback  in  recent  months.  On  Friday,  Federal  Reserve  chairman  Mr  Greenspan's  speech  in  London  ahead  of  the  meeting  of  G7  finance  ministers  sent  the  dollar  higher  after  it  had  earlier  tumbled  on  the  back  of  worse-than-expected  US  jobs  data.  ""I  think  the  chairman's  taking  a  much  more  sanguine  view  on  the  current  account  deficit  than  he's  taken  for  some  time,""  said  Robert  Sinche,  head  of  currency  strategy  at  Bank  of  America  in  New  York.  ""He's  taking  a  longer-term  view,  laying  out  a  set  of  conditions  under  which  the  current  account  deficit  can  improve  this  year  and  next.""  |||    Worries  about  the  deficit  concerns  about  China  do,  however,  remain.  China's  currency  remains  pegged  to  the  dollar  and  the  US  currency's  sharp  falls  in  recent  months  have  therefore  made  Chinese  export  prices  highly  competitive.  But  calls  for  a  shift  in  Beijing's  policy  have  fallen  on  deaf  ears,  despite  recent  comments  in  a  major  Chinese  newspaper  that  the  ""time  is  ripe""  for  a  loosening  of  the  peg.  The  G7  meeting  is  thought  unlikely  to  produce  any  meaningful  movement  in  Chinese  policy.  In  the  meantime,  the  US  Federal  Reserve's  decision  on  2  February  to  boost  interest  rates  by  a  quarter  of  a  point  -  the  sixth  such  move  in  as  many  months  -  has  opened  up  a  differential  with  European  rates.  The  half-point  window,  some  believe,  could  be  enough  to  keep  US  assets  looking  more  attractive,  and  could  help  prop  up  the  dollar.  The  recent  falls  have  partly  been  the  result  of  big  budget  deficits,  as  well  as  the  US's  yawning  current  account  gap,  both  of  which  need  to  be  funded  by  the  buying  of  US  bonds  and  assets  by  foreign  firms  and  governments.  The  White  House  will  announce  its  budget  on  Monday,  and  many  commentators  believe  the  deficit  will  remain  at  close  to  half  a  trillion  dollars."

It  makes  lawn  and  garden  products  in  Newton  Aycliffe,  and  cookers  and  ovens  in  Spennymoor.

But  he  is  not  on  the  list  of  producers  who  can  win  a  best  film  Oscar  due  to  a  limit  on  the  number  of  nominees.  The  Oscars  organisers  have  picked  two  of  The  Aviator's  four  producers  to  be  nominated  for  best  film.  |||    Up  to  three  producers  can  be  named  per  film  but  the  studios  behind  The  Aviator  and  Million  Dollar  Baby  failed  to  trim  their  credits  -  so  the  Academy  of  Motion  Pictures  Arts  and  Sciences  (Ampas)  has  done  it  for  them.  The  Aviator's  nominated  producers  are  Michael  Mann  and  Graham  King  -  with  Mr  Evans  and  Sandy  Climan,  Mr  Mann's  former  deputy,  left  off.  Mr  Evans  sued  Mr  Mann  in  2001,  claiming  he  came  up  with  the  idea,  spent  years  developing  it  and  persuaded  DiCaprio  to  play  Hughes  -  but  said  he  was  later  excluded  from  the  project.  The  two  sides  settled  out  of  court  in  a  deal  that  has  remained  secret  apart  from  the  fact  Mr  Evans'  name  has  appeared  as  a  producer  when  the  film's  credits  roll.  At  the  Golden  Globes,  Mr  Evans  -  who  was  named  among  the  winners  when  the  film  won  best  drama  film  -  evaded  a  security  guard  to  have  his  photo  taken  with  DiCaprio,  director  Martin  Scorsese,  Mr  Mann  and  Mr  King.  |||    Ampas  decided  to  limit  the  number  of  producers  who  could  be  nominated  after  Shakespeare  in  Love's  victory  in  1999  saw  five  producers  collect  awards.  The  eligible  names  for  The  Aviator  and  Million  Dollar  Baby  were  decided  by  Ampas'  producers  branch  executive  committee  on  Wednesday.  The  decision  also  saw  Clint  Eastwood  get  his  third  personal  nomination  for  Million  Dollar  Baby.  He  is  now  named  in  the  best  film  category  as  well  as  being  nominated  for  best  director  and  best  lead  actor.  The  Academy  Awards  ceremony  will  be  held  in  Hollywood  on  27  February.  Chinese  actress  Ziyi  Zhang,  star  of  Crouching  Tiger,  Hidden  Dragon,  Hero  and  House  of  Flying  Daggers,  is  the  latest  name  to  be  added  to  the  list  of  presenters  on  the  night."
