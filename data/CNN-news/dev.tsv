But  how,  exactly,  does  one  decorate  for  romance?</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  It's  Valentine's  Day,  and  you  want  that  dining  room,  that  study  --  that  bedroom  --  to  feel  romantic.Even  interior  decorators  don't  tell  clients,  "'Romantic?'  Oh,  I  got  it,  you  just  sit  here  and  I'll  make  a  romantic  room,"  said  Karin  Tehve,  associate  chairperson  of  interior  design  at  the  Pratt  Institute.That's  because  in  decorating,  there's  no  such  thing  as  a  "romantic  style,"  she  said.  There  isn't  a  formula  for  a  romantic  room  or  a  checklist  of  the  most  breathtaking  features.But  romantic  rooms  do  exist,  she  said.  They're  the  spaces  that  speak  to  another  time  or  place,  or  that  help  you  forget  about  your  iPhone,  the  bills  or  the  socks  you  lost  in  the  laundry.  Romantic  decorating,  she  said,  is  less  about  scattering  some  heart-shaped  objects  around  a  room  than  about  "the  idea  of  making  a  particular  place  where  a  loved  one  can  feel  special."So  this  month,  as  you  leaf  through  the  Valentine's  Day  issues  of  home  decor  magazines  featuring  "romantic"  homes,  don't  expect  the  romance  to  jump  at  you  with  flowers  and  diamonds.That's  because  the  romance  is  in  the  details,  said  Veranda  magazine  editor-in-chief  Clinton  Smith."A  romantic  room  today  is  one  that  slowly  reveals  itself  over  time,"  Smith  said.  "It  might  not  hit  you  immediately,  but  the  longer  you're  in  a  room,  you'll  start  picking  up  on  little  details  that  might  not  be  really  obvious  at  first  glance."As  with  a  lover,  a  romantic  space  will  definitely  seduce  you  and  often  sweep  you  off  your  feet,  or  at  the  very  least  take  your  breath  away."Start  with  candlelightThat's  Smith's  criteria  to  call  a  room  "romantic"  in  Veranda,  but  he's  the  first  to  admit  that  his  magazine's  photos  of  idealized  interiors  lose  some  luster  when  they're  rendered  in  two  dimensions.In  a  magazine,  it's  hard  to  capture  the  warm  embrace  of  good  lighting,  he  said  --  and  the  best  for  a  romantic  room  is  candlelight."There's  a  reason  for  the  stereotype  about  candlelight  being  romantic,"  said  Tehve  of  the  Pratt  Institute.  "It's  extremely  flattering."Interior  designer,  author  and  scholar  Thomas  Jayne  said  it's  the  designer's  job  to  make  the  person  occupying  the  room  look  good."I  used  to  work  with  Sister  Parish.  She  famously  lined  the  lampshades  with  pink  lingerie  so  they  would  give  off  a  flattering  glow,"  he  said."No  one  looks  appealing,  romantic  or  attractive  in  an  uncomfortable  situation.  Harsh  lighting  and  blank,  white  walls  is  proof  of  that  point."Pay  attention  to  detailsRomantic  rooms  help  people  feel  good,  too,  said  Veranda's  Smith.  That's  hard  to  get  across  in  photographs,  but  there  are  clues,  he  said."Never  underestimate  the  power  of  $10  roses  at  the  grocery  store,"  Smith  said.  "It's  those  little  things  that  really  let  the  other  person  (someone  you're  in  a  relationship  with  or  just  a  house  guest)  know  that  they're  important."Romantic  rooms  elicit  emotion,  he  said,  and  the  return  of  farm  tables  in  dining  room  decor  inspires  communal  feelings."I  think  a  dining  room  can  be  the  most  romantic  room  in  the  house.  And  by  romance  I  don't  mean  just  a  couple  dining  together,  but  when  they're  having  friends  over."  He  added:  "It's  this  sense  of  feeling  special,  like  you  belong  and  making  a  connection  with  one  another."Tehve  agreed:  "I  often  think  about  where  food  is  being  served.  (Where)  we  take  care  of  ourselves  as  sensuous  beings  and  not  just  brains.  Those  rooms  can  be  very  romantic."Conveniences  also  make  people  feel  good  in  a  room,  Jayne  said.  Thoughtfully  placed  surfaces  to  set  down  a  drinking  glass,  a  small  box  of  a  loved  one's  favorite  chocolates  and  a  cashmere  throw  to  defend  against  chilly  weather  are  all  little  ways  a  designer  or  a  homeowner  can  lend  a  room  some  romance."A  little  bit  of  sentiment  is  important,"  for  a  room  to  feel  romantic,  Jayne  said.  "Make  an  effort.  Have  some  bonbons."Let  a  room  take  you  far  awayGetting  transported  far  away  by  a  room,  Jayne  said,  is  also  romantic.  "Think  of  French  doors  opening  to  the  garden,  the  view  of  the  ocean,  the  mountain  cabin;  I  think  it's  more  about  the  actual  location  than  the  decoration  a  lot  of  the  times."Even  mad  passion  in  a  hayloft  is  considered  romantic."A  room  that  transports  a  person  to  another  time  can  also  feel  romantic,  Smith  said."It  definitely  slaps  you  in  the  face  if  you  walk  into  a  19th  century  Victorian  castle,"  he  said.  "With  shows  like  'Downton  Abbey,'  (Victorian)  design  and  decor  has  been  romanticized."The  Victorian  era  was  the  first  time  that  homes  became  truly  private,  Tehve  said,  because  people  left  their  homes  to  work  during  the  Industrial  Revolution.  Decor  that  pays  homage  to  Victorian  style  reflects  centuries  of  tradition  but  can  still  work  in  a  modern  setting,  she  said.Despite  all  the  hallmarks  of  a  romantic  room,  there  has  to  be  room  for  the  person  and  their  preferences,  of  course."'What  is  romantic?'  is  an  extremely  important  thing  for  all  of  us  to  consider,"  Jayne  said.  "It  makes  the  essence  of  life.  It  furthers  our  relationships.  It  is  an  extremely  good  thing  to  have  a  sense  of  history  and  a  sense  of  sentiment  and  a  sense  of  romance."What's  the  most  romantic  room  you've  ever  been  in?

The  202  passengers  and  crew  aboard  the  Boeing  767-300  were  not  harmed.It  was  a  welcome  outcome  from  the  last  time  an  Ethiopian  Airlines  was  hijacked.In  1996,  125  people  died  after  a  hijacked  Ethiopian  Airlines  crashed  in  the  Indian  Ocean  after  running  out  of  fuel.  In  that  case,  the  hijackers  were  seeking  asylum  in  Australia.Taking  controlIn  Monday's  incident,  Flight  702  had  taken  off  from  the  Ethiopian  capital  of  Addis  Ababa  and  was  headed  to  Rome,  the  airline  said.The  co-pilot  took  control  of  the  plane  when  the  pilot  went  to  the  restroom,  said  Swiss  police  spokesman  Jean-Philippe  Brandt.The  co-pilot,  who  was  not  named,  closed  the  fortified  door,  police  said.  Instead  of  Rome,  he  then  steered  the  plane  toward  Geneva.At  one  point,  as  the  plane  hovered  over  Geneva's  airspace  several  times,  he  asked  the  control  tower:"And  you  have  to  give  us  lastly  permission  on  board  for  asylum.""Yes  I  know,"  the  tower  responded.  "Sorry,  but  we  are  still  waiting  for  the  response.  We  are  trying  our  best  to  get  you  the  response,  sir."The  surrenderEventually,  the  plane  landed  at  Geneva  International  Airport."I  will  be  coming  out  via  the  window,"  the  co-pilot  told  the  control  tower.He  then  escaped  through  the  cockpit  window  using  a  rope,  and  surrendered  to  police,  Brandt  said.He  was  unarmed,  authorities  said."His  act  has  been  motivated  by  the  fact  that  he  feels  threatened  in  his  county  and  wants  to  make  an  asylum  claim  in  Switzerland,"  Swiss  police  spokesman  Philippe  Grangean  said.The  passengers  were  not  threatened  or  put  in  danger,  police  said.Ethiopian  Airlines,  in  a  statement,  would  only  say  the  plane  was  "forced  to  proceed"  to  the  airport.During  the  incident,  Geneva  International  Airport  was  shut  down.  It  reopened  later  Monday  morning.While  rare,  a  pilot  hijacking  an  airline  is  not  unheard  of.In  1998,  an  Air  China  captain,  reportedly  disgruntled  with  life  in  China,  hijacked  his  passenger  jet  to  Taiwan.Plane  hijacker,  jailed  in  Cuba,  seeks  U.S.  plea  deal'Air  pirate'  tries  to  hijack  plane  to  SochiCNN's  Marilia  Brocchetto  and  Ric  Ward  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Andrews's  "Flowers  in  the  Attic."  McIver  will  inherit  the  role  from  Kiernan  Shipka,  who  played  Cathy  from  ages  12  through  15  in  the  first  film.  The  novel  on  which  Petals  is  based  picks  up  immediately  where  Flowers  leaves  off,  covering  a  sequence  of  events  that  take  place  over  the  course  of  12  years;  Lifetime's  movie  version  will  take  a  different  approach,  beginning  a  decade  after  the  events  of  the  first  movie.  (Which  is  a  good  thing,  since  it  means  viewers  will  be  spared  scenes  of  Sally  Draper  seducing  a  40-year-old  man.)McIver,  a  New  Zealand  native,  may  be  known  best  to  American  audiences  as  Vivian  Scully  on  Showtime's  "Masters  of  Sex"  or  Tinker  Bell  on  ABC's  "Once  Upon  a  Time."  As  her  Facebook  page  notes,  McIver  also  used  to  study  ballet  and  jazz  dance  —  which  may  come  in  handy  when  playing  dancer-turned-teacher  Cathy.She  joins  returning  "Flowers"  cast  members  Heather  Graham  and  Ellen  Burstyn,  who  will  reprise  their  roles  Cathy's  wicked  mother  and  grandmother,  respectively.See  the  original  story  at  EW.com.CLICK  HERE  to  Try  2  RISK  FREE  issues  of  Entertainment  Weekly©  2011  Entertainment  Weekly  and  Time  Inc.

Its  structure  is  largely  one-sided  and  its  members  are  unilaterally  chosen  by  one  unelected  person.The  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Court  --  or  FISA  Court  for  short  --  is  a  panel  that  critics  contend  rubber-stamps  nearly  every  National  Security  Agency  request  to  snoop  that  it  receives.Court  officials,  naturally,  object  to  that  characterization.  But  concerns  remain  that  without  reforms,  like  President  Barack  Obama's  call  for  an  independent  "privacy  advocate"  to  monitor  its  actions,  civil  liberties  might  be  at  risk.Bottom  line:  5  takeaway  messages  on  Obama's  NSA  changesWho's  on  the  court?The  court  is  housed  in  a  room  in  a  windowless  and  secure  area  of  the  U.S.  District  Court  on  Constitution  Avenue.  Government  sources  say  it's  a  courtroom  with  a  judge's  bench,  tables  for  lawyers,  and  support  staff.  Officials  won't  divulge  its  exact  location  in  the  building.The  court  is  made  up  of  11  judges  who  sit  for  seven-year  terms.  All  are  federal  district  judges  who  agree  to  take  on  the  additional  duties  on  a  rotating  basis.  They  are  appointed  by  Chief  Justice  John  Roberts,  without  any  supplemental  confirmation  from  the  other  two  branches  of  government.  Roberts  has  named  every  member  of  the  current  court,  as  well  as  a  separate  three-judge  panel  to  hear  appeals  known  as  the  Court  of  Review.How  does  the  surveillance  court  work?The  FISA  Court's  larger  mission  is  to  decide  whether  to  grant  certain  types  of  government  requests--  wiretapping,  data  analysis,  and  other  monitoring  for  "foreign  intelligence  purposes"  of  suspected  terrorists  and  spies  operating  in  the  United  States.The  once-secret  approval  of  collecting  bits  and  pieces  of  information  from  electronic  communications  --  called  metadata  --  comes  quarterly  from  judges  at  the  court.  To  collect  the  information,  the  government  has  to  demonstrate  to  a  judge  that  it  is  "relevant"  to  an  international  terrorism  investigation.There  were  1,856  applications  in  2012  to  the  FISA  Court  for  electronic  surveillance  and  physical  searches  for  "foreign  intelligence  purposes,"  the  Justice  Department  said.None  were  denied,  but  40  were  modified  to  some  extent.  Only  one  such  request  was  withdrawn  by  the  FBI.Obama  announces  modest  changes  to  NSA  data  collectionCriticismNSA  leaker  Edward  Snowden  last  June  revealed  a  secret  surveillance  court  order  approving  government  collection  of  mass  amounts  of  metadata  from  telecom  giant  Verizon  and  leading  Internet  companies,  including  Microsoft,  Apple,  Google,  Yahoo  and  Facebook.The  metadata  orders  were  shocking,  because  it  confirmed  the  scope  of  the  NSA's  efforts  and  the  court's  original  mission  had  greatly  expanded.  No  longer  were  FISA  judges  approving  individual  surveillance  requests--  now  they  were  in  essence  reinterpreting  the  Constitution,  expanding,  say  critics,  the  limits  of  privacy  and  due  process.Some  members  of  Congress  worry  the  surveillance  court--  at  the  urging  of  the  Obama  administration--  is  interpreting  the  surveillance  law  too  broadly--  something  lawmakers  say  they  did  not  intend.And  because  it  only  hears  the  government's  side,  it  has  been  criticized  as  a  body  that  too  easily  accedes  to  a  request.Those  on  the  court  worry  the  President's  push  for  a  privacy  advocate  might  prove  counter-productive  and  might  lead  to  public  "confusion  and  misunderstanding"  of  judicial  rulings,  former  surveillance  court  Judge  John  Bates  wrote  in  a  letter  this  week  to  Sen.  Dianne  Feinstein,  chairman  of  the  Senate  Intelligence  Committee.How  did  we  get  here?In  1978,  the  United  States  was  still  deeply  engaged  in  the  Cold  War  and  foreign  spying  was  the  main  concern,  not  terrorism.So  Congress  created  the  surveillance  court  and  it  began  issuing  warrants  the  next  year  in  the  wake  of  a  series  of  intelligence-related  scandals  earlier  that  decade  and  the  one  before,  including  the  FBI's  spying  on  the  Rev.  Martin  Luther  King  Jr.Laws  passed  in  the  wake  of  the  9/11  terror  attacks  made  it  easier  for  the  government  to  request  electronic  records,  harder  for  telecom  companies  to  refuse  and  nearly  impossible  for  them  to  voice  their  concerns  publicly.And  2008,  revisions  in  surveillance  laws  gave  the  attorney  general  and  the  director  of  national  intelligence  greater  authority  to  order  "mass  acquisition"  of  electronic  traffic,  if  it  is  related  to  a  terror  or  espionage  investigation.The  administration  says  amassing  a  telecommunications  company's  entire  phone  records  database  is  relevant  to  counterterrorism,  and  something  a  surveillance  court  judge  can  authorize.The  law  that  created  the  surveillance  court  isn't  due  to  be  renewed  for  another  four  years.NSA  and  your  phone  records:  What  should  Obama  do?</TEXT></DOC>

The  White  House  is  not  commenting  on  whether  the  singer  will  be  in  attendance  for  Michelle  Obama's  birthday  party,  but  it's  well  known  that  the  pair  are  friends.The  superstar  performed  the  Etta  James  classic  "At  Last"  at  President  Obama's  first  inaugural  ball  and  teamed  up  with  Michelle  Obama  for  her  initiative  to  get  children  more  active.  Who  can  forget  FLOTUS  dancing  to  Beyonce's  "Move  Your  Body"  exercise  theme?  Even  their  spouses  are  friends.  Rapper  Jay  Z  changed  the  lyrics  to  his  rap  song  to  say  "I've  got  99  problems  but  Mitt  ain't  one"  during  an  Obama  fundraiser.In  July,  the  first  lady  and  daughters  Malia  and  Sasha  attended  a  Beyonce  concert  in  Chicago.  The  singer  even  once  wrote  an  open  letter  of  admiration:  "Michelle,  thank  you  so  much  for  every  single  thing  that  you  do  for  us.  I  am  proud  to  have  my  daughter  grow  up  in  a  world  where  she  has  people  like  you  to  look  up  to."Michelle  Obama  responded,  "@Beyonce  Thank  you  for  the  beautiful  letter  and  for  being  a  role  model  who  kids  everywhere  can  look  up  to.  --mo"Awwwww!Their  friendship  has  not  been  without  controversy,  however.Some  Christian  mothers  were  reportedly  upset  over  FLOTUS  teaming  up  with  Beyonce  because  of  the  singer's  "booty  shaking"  and  revealing  outfits.  Writing  for  the  Daily  Beast,  journalist  Allison  Samuels  noted  that  there  was  "the  unfortunate  conundrum  posed  for  Mrs.  Obama.""When  Beyoncé  goes  into  the  studio  to  record  an  album  for  her  millions  of  fans,  she's  not  thinking  about  her  friendship  with  the  first  lady;  she's  thinking  about  what's  hot,  what's  edgy,  and  what  will  sell  to  the  masses,"  Samuels  wrote.  "That  surely  must  have  been  her  mindset  when  she  recorded  the  controversial  lyrics  single  "bow  down  b**ches"  for  her  new  album  earlier  this  year."Demetria  L.  Lucas  from  the  Root  wrote,  "This  love  fest  has  gone  too  far  for  my  liking.

See  his  report  on  The  Situation  Room,  which  airs  today  from  5-7  p.m.  ET.Killeen,  Texas  (CNN)  --  A  man  opens  fire  at  a  military  base,  gunning  down  fellow  soldiers  before  ending  his  own  life.  A  hero  steps  in,  trying  to  save  lives.  A  community  already  scarred  by  war  is  left  reeling,  nearly  five  years  after  authorities  vowed  to  improve  security  when  another  mass  shooter  struck  there.A  day  after  a  shooting  rampage  at  Fort  Hood,  Texas,  left  three  soldiers  dead  and  16  wounded,  a  key  question  looms  over  the  investigation:  Why?Authorities  are  still  piecing  together  the  answer,  but  seem  to  be  homing  in  on  at  least  one  thing  that  might  have  made  Spc.  Ivan  Lopez  pull  the  trigger."We  have  very  strong  evidence  that  he  had  a  medical  history  that  indicates  an  unstable  psychiatric  or  psychological  condition.  (We're)  going  through  all  records  to  ensure  that  is,  in  fact,  is  correct.  But  we  believe  that  to  be  the  fundamental  underlying  causal  factor,"  Lt.  Gen.  Mark  Milley,  the  post's  commanding  general,  told  reporters  Thursday.The  incident  began  Wednesday  at  about  4  p.m.,  when  Lopez,  34,  fired  his  .45-caliber  handgun  at  two  buildings  at  the  sprawling  Texas  military  facility,  then  put  the  gun  to  his  head  and  pulled  the  trigger,  ending  his  life.The  gunman  was  an  experienced  soldier  who  was  grappling  with  mental  illness,  officials  said.  But  they  haven't  pinpointed  why  he  opened  fire.The  U.S.  Army's  criminal  investigation  division  is  the  lead  agency  probing  the  deadly  shooting.Authorities  are  interviewing  witnesses  and  "looking  at  what  the  trigger  event  was"  that  led  to  the  shooting,  including  a  possible  altercation  with  a  fellow  soldier  "that  immediately  preceded  the  shooting,"  Milley  said.Investigators  say  they  haven't  found  any  links  to  domestic  or  international  terrorist  organizations,  but  said  they  were  keeping  open  minds."At  this  point  we  have  not  yet  ruled  out  anything  whatsoever,"  Milley  said.  "We  are  committed  to  letting  the  investigation  run  its  course."Another  key  question  for  investigators:  did  any  gaps  in  safety  and  security  measures  allow  the  shooting  to  take  place?"Obviously  something  went  wrong,"  U.S.  Defense  Secretary  Chuck  Hagel  told  reporters  Thursday.But  he  stressed  that  investigators  were  still  trying  to  piece  together  the  events  leading  up  to  the  shooting."We  know  a  lot  of  things  24  hours  later,  but  we  don't  know  everything,"  Hagel  said.  "What  happened?  What  motivated  this  person  to  do  this?  Where  was  the  gap?  Why  did  we  have  a  gap:?  Why  did  it  happen?  ...  I  think  we  are  going  to  find  out,  and  we  will  do  everything  possible  to  implement  those  reforms  and  fill  those  kinds  of  gaps."Lopez  had  a  history  of  depression,  anxietyThe  native  of  Puerto  Rico  enlisted  in  the  Army  as  an  infantry  soldier  and  was  deployed  twice,  including  a  four-month  stint  in  Iraq  as  a  truck  driver,  Milley  said.Lopez  had  arrived  at  the  Texas  base  in  February,  moving  with  his  wife  and  their  daughter  into  an  apartment  a  little  more  than  a  week  before  the  shooting.They  appeared  to  be  a  normal  couple,  said  neighbor  Xanderia  Morris.  "They  would  smile  whenever  they'd  see  someone,"  she  said.But  behind  Lopez's  smile  lay  a  history  of  depression,  anxiety  and  other  psychiatric  disorders,  Milley  told  reporters  late  Wednesday,  and  he  was  receiving  treatment  and  taking  antidepressants.He  had  served  for  four  months  in  Iraq  in  2011.  And  while  Army  records  don't  show  him  as  having  been  wounded  there,  Lopez  himself  reported  that  he  had  suffered  a  traumatic  brain  injury,  Milley  said.And  he  was  undergoing  diagnosis  procedures  for  post-traumatic  stress  disorder."He  was  not  diagnosed,  as  of  today,  with  PTSD,"  Milley  said.Arriving  at  a  PTSD  diagnosis,  which  is  common  among  war  veterans,  can  take  time.The  shooter  "had  a  clean  record"  behaviorally,  Army  Secretary  John  McHugh  said.  There  were  "no  major  misbehaviors  that  we're  yet  aware  of,"  he  said.Though  he  had  been  diagnosed  with  depression,  anxiety  and  sleep  disturbances,  Lopez  gave  no  sign  during  a  psychiatric  exam  last  month  that  he  was  likely  to  commit  violence  against  himself  or  others,  "so  the  plan  (going)  forward  was  just  to  continue  to  monitor  and  treat  him  as  deemed  appropriate,"  McHugh  said.Lopez  had  been  prescribed  the  sedative  Ambien,  McHugh  said.His  records  "show  no  wounds,  no  direct  involvement  in  combat  ...  or  any  injury  that  might  lead  us  to  further  investigate  battle-related  TBI  (traumatic  brain  injury)."Officers  picked  up  Lopez's  widow  at  their  apartment  near  the  base  in  Killeen,  and  she  was  cooperating  with  law  enforcement,  an  FBI  official  told  CNN.What  makes  Fort  Hood  a  target?Lopez  was  an  experienced  soldierLopez  served  in  the  National  Guard  in  Puerto  Rico  from  1999  until  2010,  when  he  left  the  Guard  to  become  an  active  duty  infantryman  in  the  U.S.  Army.Before  coming  to  Fort  Hood,  Lopez  served  at  Fort  Bliss  in  Texas.He  carried  out  Wednesday's  killings  with  his  own  gun  --  a  .45-caliber  Smith  &  Wesson  semiautomatic  pistol  he  bought  after  arriving  in  Killeen.By  taking  it  onto  the  base,  he  was  breaking  the  rules."If  you  have  weapons  and  you're  on  base,  it's  supposed  to  be  registered  on  base,"  Milley  said.  "This  weapon  was  not  registered  on  base."In  addition,  people  who  are  not  military  police  are  not  allowed  to  walk  around  with  guns  on  a  military  base.  They  are  required  to  store  them  in  an  armory.Sequence  of  eventsLopez  walked  into  an  administration  building  at  the  base  and  opened  fire.  He  then  got  into  a  car,  fired  from  the  vehicle,  got  out  of  the  car,  walked  into  another  nearby  administration  building  and  fired  again.During  the  minutes  of  gunfire,  he  killed  three  and  wounded  16  --  all  of  them  Army  personnel,  Milley  said.Three  of  the  wounded  who  had  been  in  critical  condition  were  upgrade  to  serious  condition  on  Thursday,  hospital  officials  said.  Four  of  the  16  U.S.  soldiers  wounded  in  the  shooting  had  been  treated  and  released  from  hospitals  by  Thursday  afternoon,  Milley  said.Authorities  have  "no  indication  at  this  time"  that  Lopez  was  targeting  specific  soldiers  when  he  opened  fire  on  the  Army  base,  Milley  said.The  shootings  took  place  in  the  medical  brigade  and  the  transportation  battalion  buildings.  Lopez  was  assigned  to  the  13th  Sustainment  Command,  which  deals  with  logistics.The  base,  which  has  more  than  45,000  soldiers  and  nearly  9,000  civilian  employees,  went  on  lockdown  in  the  aftermath  of  the  shooting  Wednesday.People  were  told  to  shelter  in  place.As  sirens  blared,  Pvt.  Dehlan  Kay  stayed  in  his  barracks  and  talked  on  a  phone.  "I'm  doing  good,"  he  told  CNN's  Wolf  Blitzer.  "I'm  just  a  little  nervous  on  what's  happening."The  all-clear  wouldn't  go  out  for  another  six  hours.The  revelationThe  shooting  rampage  ended  when  a  military  police  officer  confronted  Lopez  in  a  parking  lot.  "He  put  his  hands  up  and  reached  under  his  jacket,  pulled  out  the  (gun),  and  she  pulled  out  her  weapon.  And  then  she  engaged,  and  then  he  put  the  weapon  to  his  head,  and  he  died  of  a  self-inflicted  gunshot  wound,"  Milley  said.He  added:  "She  did  her  job,  and  she  did  exactly  what  we  would  expect  of  a  U.S.  Army  military  police."At  the  Lopez  apartment,  the  shooter's  wife  was  watching  the  news.She  came  out  crying,  worried  about  her  husband,  from  whom  she  had  not  heard  all  afternoon.  But  she  had  no  idea  that  he  was  the  shooter,  said  Morris,  the  neighbor."I'm  just  worried,  I'm  just  worried,"  Lopez's  wife  told  her."I  tried  to  console  her  and  comfort  her,  let  her  know  everything  was  OK,"  Morris  said.It  was  not.  When  a  local  TV  station  identified  the  dead  gunman  as  Lopez,  his  widow  became  "hysterical,"  Morris  said.The  casualtiesIt  took  law  enforcement  about  15  minutes  to  respond  to  the  gunfire,  Milley  said.Nine  of  the  wounded  were  taken  to  Scott  &  White  Memorial  Hospital  in  nearby  Temple,  where  three  were  in  critical  condition  --  one  with  injuries  to  the  neck,  another  to  the  spine  and  the  third  to  the  abdomen,  said  Dr.  Matthew  Davis,  medical  director  of  trauma  services.Two  of  the  three  were  expected  to  require  further  surgery  --  one  of  them  on  Thursday  and  the  second  likely  on  Friday,  he  told  reporters.  It  was  not  clear  whether  the  third  would  also  require  further  surgery,  he  said.Two  of  the  remaining  patients  were  in  fair  condition,  and  the  rest  were  in  good  condition,  with  some  of  them  possibly  being  discharged  later  in  the  day,  he  said.The  eight  men  and  one  woman  range  in  age  from  early  20s  to  mid-40s,  he  said.The  wounds  may  heal,  but  "we  clearly  are  going  to  have  some  physical  scars  and  emotional  scars  going  forward,"  he  said.  He  predicted  that  the  actions  of  a  man  who  himself  may  have  had  PTSD  will  likely  be  responsible  for  others  experiencing  it."We'll  have  to  work  with  some  of  our  long-term  professionals  who  help  to  work  with  PTSD,"  he  said.The  previous  mass  shooterIn  squeezing  off  his  final  shot,  Lopez's  actions  differed  from  those  of  Fort  Hood's  previous  mass  shooter.Army  Maj.  Nidal  Malik  Hasan  survived  after  killing  13  people  and  wounding  another  32  on  November  5,  2009.Months  later,  the  former  military  psychiatrist  told  a  court  that  he  was  on  a  terrorist  mission.During  a  hearing  in  June,  Hasan  said  that  he  fired  at  soldiers  preparing  to  deploy  to  Afghanistan  in  order  to  protect  leading  members  of  the  Taliban.Hasan  was  convicted  of  13  counts  of  murder  and  32  counts  of  attempted  murder,  and  a  military  jury  recommended  last  August  that  he  be  put  to  death.Both  men  bought  their  weapons  at  Guns  Galore,  a  gun  store  in  Killeen,  according  to  U.S.  law  enforcement  officials  who  have  reviewed  the  records.Lopez,  who  had  no  criminal  history,  passed  the  standard  background  check,  they  said,  adding  that  the  gun  store  did  what  was  required.A  man  who  answered  the  phone  Thursday  at  the  store  cited  the  ongoing  nature  of  the  investigation  and  referred  a  caller  to  local  law  enforcement.  "We  don't  have  anything  to  release,"  said  the  man,  who  would  not  identify  himself.The  store  also  sold  ammunition  and  gunpowder  to  Pvt.  Jason  Abdo,  an  AWOL  soldier  who  was  arrested  in  2011  for  plotting  to  attack  a  restaurant  near  Fort  Hood  while  it  was  filled  with  soldiers  and  their  families.The  plot  unraveled  when  the  store  alerted  authorities  that  Abdo  seemed  suspicious.  He  is  serving  a  sentence  of  life  in  prison.Lessons  learned"My  reaction  was  not  'not  again  here,'"  Milley  said  in  response  to  reporters'  questions.  "My  reaction  was  to  immediately  make  sure  we  had  a  read  on  the  casualties.  Immediately  secure  the  site.  Immediately  look  for  one  or  more  shooters."But  others  saw  the  link."That  was  so  similar,  it  just  tore  up  my  heartstrings,"  Staff  Sgt.  Patrick  Zeigler  told  CNN's  "New  Day"  on  Thursday.Zeigler,  who  is  still  recovering  from  four  bullet  wounds  to  the  head  and  body  from  the  2009  Fort  Hood  shooting,  expressed  surprise.  "It's  just  hard  to  believe  that  these  people  that  you  serve  with,  who  are  your  brothers  in  arms,  would  turn  against  you,"  he  said.  "And  it's  just  incredible  that  at  home,  someone  in  the  environment  of  a  military  base  would  decide  to  do  this."He  said  security  procedures  will  never  suffice  to  deter  someone  bent  on  committing  such  an  act.  "It  takes  somebody  brave  enough  to  report  these  people  in  order  for  it  to  be  prevented."Army  Chief  of  Staff  Gen.  Ray  Odierno  credited  procedures  that  were  put  in  place  after  the  Hasan  massacre  for  mitigating  the  carnage  that  could  have  resulted  Wednesday.The  procedures  and  responses  prevented  "something  that  could  have  been  much,  much  worse,"  he  told  the  Senate  Armed  Services  Committee.But  the  recurrence  weighed  on  Killeen  Mayor  Dan  Corbin.  "As  a  community,  it's  like  you've  been  kicked  in  the  gut,"  he  said.  "It  can't  be  happening  again."No  community  should  have  to  experience  such  violence  once,  let  alone  twice,  said  John  Cornyn,  a  U.S.  senator  from  Texas.  "Tonight,  Texans'  hearts  are  once  again  very  heavy.  The  scenes  coming  from  Fort  Hood  today  are  sadly  too  familiar  and  still  too  fresh  in  our  memories,"  he  said  Wednesday."We're  heartbroken  something  like  this  might  have  happened  again,"  said  President  Barack  Obama,  who  was  briefed  by  defense  and  FBI  leaders  by  phone  while  traveling  on  Air  Force  One.CNN's  Joshua  Rubin  reported  from  Killeen,  Texas;  Ben  Brumfield  and  Tom  Watkins  reported  and  wrote  from  Atlanta.

"For  me  the  energy  and  draw  is  around  the  act  of  creation."Inspired  by  crop  circlesAmador  was  drawn  to  ancient  geometric  art  after  studying  crop  circle  reconstructions.Then,  one  cloudless  day  10  years  ago  on  Kalalau  Beach  on  the  Hawaiian  island  of  Kaua'i,  Amador  was  showing  a  friend  the  geometric  art  he'd  been  studying  using  a  stick  in  the  sand.MORE:  World's  100  best  beaches"[I  drew]  one  circle  and  [explained  to  my  friend]  the  meaning  it  has  had  for  people;  two  overlapping  circles  and  the  line  between  their  centers;  three  overlapping  circles  which  form  a  triangle,"  Amador  tells  CNN."I  suddenly  realized  that  all  of  the  crop  circle  reconstructions  I  had  been  studying  start  in  this  exact  way,  which  establish  reference  points  for  everything  that  follows."It  felt  like  a  bolt  from  the  heavens,  in  which  I  had  a  vision  that  I  could  do  enormous  designs  on  the  sand."In  2004,  Amador  drew  his  first  piece  on  Ocean  Beach  in  San  Francisco,  a  wide  beach  near  Amador's  home.His  work  grew  from  there.Dogs  not  the  artist's  allyAmador  keeps  a  log  of  ideas  on  flash  cards  and  picks  one  before  heading  to  the  beach.He's  created  hundreds  of  beach  murals  on  just  30  or  so  beaches.Not  every  beach  provides  the  right  conditions.READ:  22  can't-miss  U.S.  beaches"The  needs  I  have  in  a  beach  have  been  such  that  there  are  few  that  are  available  to  me,"  says  Amador."I  need  a  large  beach  that  is  relatively  flat.  Then  I  need  a  high  high  tide  followed  by  a  low,  low  tide.  These  occur  several  times  of  the  month."At  these  times  the  canvas  I  have  to  work  with  is  maximized.  Other  considerations  are  the  scenery  of  the  beach  and  the  quality  of  the  sand  --  some  dries  faster  than  others."I  also  appreciate  beaches  without  a  lot  of  traffic,  particularly  dogs  --  they're  the  worst  for  creating  scars  in  the  sand."Amador  hopes  to  inspire  people  to  "follow  what  brings  you  joy.""I  did  this  art  for  many  years  without  pay  simply  because  it  was  so  enlivening  to  do  so,"  says  Amador.  "If  I  can  inspire  others,  I  hope  that  I  can  offer  the  message  that  the  path  is  more  important  than  the  destination  --  that  the  journey  should  be  the  focus."When  one  is  experiencing  joy,  then  the  world  also  receives  that  joy.

"These  arrests  should  send  a  message  to  anyone  thinking  about  misusing  a  landmark  this  way."Three  of  the  men  are  accused  of  climbing  the  nation's  tallest  building  on  September  30  and  parachuting  more  than  1,300  feet  off  the  skyscraper,  said  attorney  Timothy  Parlatore,  who  is  representing  Rossig.  Hartwell  is  accused  of  keeping  lookout  at  the  BASE  of  the  tower  during  the  stunt,  Parlatore  said.Video  footage  of  the  early  morning  jump  shows  the  men  deploying  their  parachutes  and  flying  down  to  a  secluded  spot  on  a  nearby  highway,  according  to  Parlatore,  who  said  he's  seen  the  video."They  were  very  professional,  very  controlled.  There  was  nothing  haphazard  or  reckless  about  it,"he  said.At  the  time  of  the  incident,  Brady  was  a  construction  worker  assigned  to  work  at  the  One  World  Trade  Center  site,  police  said.The  men  snuck  into  the  area  through  a  hole  in  a  fence,  said  Parlatore."One  of  the  first  things  my  client  said  to  me  was  that  how  surprised  he  was  at  how  there  was  no  security  whatsoever  --  how  easy  it  was  to  just  walk  right  up  there  in  something  that  the  mayor  has  just  recently  described  as  the  No.  1  terrorist  target  in  the  world,"  he  said.Investigators  reviewed  video  footage  from  around  One  World  Trade  Center,  as  well  as  other  electronic  and  photographic  evidence.A  search  of  the  men's  homes  last  month  produced  video  footage  of  the  jump,  police  said.One  World  Trade  Center  is  rising  in  the  shadows  of  the  original  World  Trade  Center,  where  the  twin  towers  were  felled  by  two  hijacked  airplanes  on  September  11,  2001,  in  the  deadliest  terrorist  attack  on  U.S.  soil.The  charges  come  less  than  a  week  after  a  16-year-old  boy  from  New  Jersey  was  arrested  on  trespassing  charges  at  the  skyscraper.  Justin  Casquejo  is  accused  of  sneaking  past  security  and  climbing  to  the  top  of  the  building.Police  said  Casquejo  also  snuck  in  through  a  hole  in  a  fence  to  get  into  the  One  World  Trade  Center  site.It  is  unclear  whether  it  was  the  same  hole  in  a  fence  that  the  BASE  jumpers  said  they  used,  said  Parlatore.  BASE  is  an  acronym  for  Base/Antenna/Span/Earth.It  was  not  known  Monday  night  when  the  men  would  be  arraigned."The  Port  Authority  joins  the  NYPD  in  condemning  this  lawless  and  selfish  act  that  clearly  endangered  the  public,"  Port  Authority  Chief  Security  Officer  Joseph  Dunne  said  in  a  statement.

Plus,  Topo  Designs'  retro-inspired,  functional  backpacks  are  inspired  by  the  active  lifestyle  for  which  Denver  and  the  rest  of  Colorado  has  earned  a  national  reputation."Colorado  --  especially  Denver  --  is  a  lifestyle  choice,  a  destination  for  someone  who  wants  to  be  outdoors  and  still  have  the  comforts  and  perks  of  a  city,"  said  Rose,  who  grew  up  in  Wyoming  and  now  lives  in  Fort  Collins,  about  an  hour  from  Topo's  Denver  headquarters.Since  2008,  Topo  Designs  has  grown  steadily,  thanks  to  interest  from  across  the  United  States  and  foreign  markets  like  Japan  and  Germany.  Last  November,  it  opened  its  flagship  store  in  Denver  in  a  development  made  of  reclaimed  shipping  containers.Topo  has  also  expanded  into  menswear  that  bears  a  similar  aesthetic  to  its  bags:  simple  and  functional  button-up  shirts,  jackets  and  pants  that  could  be  worn  to  work,  to  dinner  or  even  for  a  hike  in  the  Rockies.  While  growing  profit  margins  certainly  helped  them  expand  operations,  Rose  credits  a  hospitable  small  business  climate  with  allowing  them  to  open  a  store  much  sooner  than  planned."Denver  has  gone  through  some  big  changes  in  the  past  four  to  five  years,"  Rose  said.  "It's  a  good  time  to  be  here."Denver  isn't  a  menswear  capital,  but  Topo  and  other  brands  based  there  are  drawing  attention  from  beyond  Colorado  for  their  style  and  quality.  In  the  past  five  years  a  handful  of  makers  and  entrepreneurs  have  flocked  to  this  city  in  the  Rockies  of  about  600,000  people,  lured  by  the  active  lifestyle  and  its  "small  town  in  a  big  city"  vibe.  Upon  arrival,  they  say  they've  found  a  thriving  "Portland-esque"  makers  scene,  and  a  market  for  their  goods  among  the  city's  growing  ranks  of  young  professionals.These  kinds  of  businesses  found  a  foothold  in  New  York,  San  Francisco,  even  Portland  years  ago,  but  there's  a  certain  Rocky  Mountain  vibe  to  those  in  Colorado,  Rose  said."Sure,  you  can  buy  backpacks  and  shirts  elsewhere,  but  ours  have  a  different  spin  because  we're  in  Denver."A  place  for  'work-life  integration'The  global  nature  of  fashion  and  e-commerce  allows  startups  to  work  from  wherever  they  want.  So,  why  is  Denver  the  place  where  these  entrepreneurs  want  to  be?The  active  lifestyle  was  the  biggest  draw  for  Eric  Powell,  founder  of  Ratio  Clothing,  which  makes  custom-fitted  shirts  for  men."I  don't  like  the  term  'work-life  balance'  because  it  separates  the  two  too  much;  it's  more  like  work-life  integration,"  Powell  said.  "People  here  know  how  to  live."Powell  moved  from  Chicago  to  Denver  in  2011,  shortly  before  the  public  launch  of  Ratio,  which  was  borne  out  of  Powell's  difficulty  finding  clothes  that  fit.  Powell  started  building  the  business  in  2010,  combining  his  technology  background  as  a  software  developer  and  his  passion  for  clothing,  while  he  was  working  full-time  as  a  consultant.  When  it  became  clear  that  his  design  viewpoint  and  formula  for  getting  a  good  fit  was  finding  an  audience,  he  left  his  job  and  moved  his  family  to  Denver.As  a  consultant,  Powell  visited  a  lot  of  American  cities.  But  "Denver  was  always  the  city  that  resonated  with  us,"  the  32-year-old  entrepreneur  says.  It's  big  enough  so  it  has  a  variety  of  cultural  offerings  and  restaurants,  but  small  enough  to  get  across  town  without  sitting  in  traffic,  Powell  said.  And,  compared  to  Powell's  native  Cincinnati,  it's  a  young  city  full  of  transplants.It's  also  affordable  compared  to  other  metropolitan  areas,  which  allowed  Powell  to  build  his  start-up  from  his  home.  His  business  was  gaining  traction  through  the  online  menswear  blog  community  when  a  customer  from  Italy  in  town  for  business  showed  up  at  his  home  seeking  alterations.  Powell,  who  had  just  returned  from  a  run,  greeted  him  in  his  exercise  gear."At  that  point  I  realized  I  had  to  step  up  my  game,"  he  said.  He  opened  his  storefront  in  August  2013  in  the  Lower  Highlands  neighborhood,  a  retail  and  restaurant  hub  near  downtown  Denver.  It  helps  Ratio  reach  a  new  audience  outside  the  menswear  blogs,  he  said.Tanya  Fleisher  and  Roy  Katz  also  moved  to  Denver  from  Chicago  in  February  2013.  The  couple  had  started  their  business  Winter  Session  in  Chicago,  sewing  cotton  and  canvas  bags  in  their  apartment.  The  Colorado  natives  always  intended  to  return  home,  and  when  their  business  started  to  grow  they  decided  it  was  time.After  living  in  big  cities  for  more  then  a  decade  --  Chicago,  Los  Angeles,  Mumbai  --  the  couple  wanted  to  live  somewhere  they  could  navigate  on  a  bicycle  instead  of  hopping  on  the  freeway.  They  easily  found  an  affordable  workspace  east  of  downtown  on  a  small  strip  that  used  be  known  as  the  jazz  district,  which  Roy  Katz  likens  to  Chicago's  Fulton  Market  District.  They  also  found  a  supportive  small  business  community  that  collaborates  on  events  and  marketing  rather  than  working  against  each  other.Winter  Session's  headquarters'  doubles  as  a  storefront  and  a  workspace  where  the  couple  and  two  full-time  employees  make  all  of  Winter  Session's  bags  and  accessories,  along  with  collaborations  with  other  brands.They  were  even  able  to  convince  employee  Laura  Staugaitis  to  follow  them  to  Denver.  Staugaitis  said  she  was  more  than  happy  to  leave  behind  the  rat  race.  She  says  the  laid  back  maker  environment  in  Denver  gives  small  businesses  room  to  grow."It's  a  very  non-competitive  environment,"  she  said.  "It's  a  young  scene  here  and  we're  all  working  toward  the  same  critical  mass,  so  people  aren't  as  protective  of  what  they're  working  on."'Denver  fashion  has  a  personality  of  its  own'Many  of  these  new  businesses  cater  to  the  elusive  stylish  man  who  is  willing  to  pay  more  for  quality  goods.  His  presence  has  been  noted  in  the  fashion  capitals,  where  custom-shirtmakers  and  curated  menswear  shops  have  existed  for  years.Unlike  your  rich  uncle's  menswear  store,  which  might  carry  bespoke  suits  from  Italy  or  Brooks  Brothers,  these  stores  are  more  likely  to  stock  waxed  cotton  jackets,  chambray  button-downs,  shawl  collar  sweaters  or  jeans  made  of  Japanese  selvedge.Borne  of  renewed  interest  in  classic  American  workwear  brands  --  sometimes  called  the  "heritage  movement"  --  the  curated  shop  is  more  revival  than  new  phenomenon,  said  Jesse  Thorn,  creator  of  the  popular  menswear  blog,  "Put  This  On.""Men  now  want  to  know  where  their  clothes  come  from  in  a  way  they  didn't  before,  and  they  want  to  know  about  the  quality  of  their  clothes  in  a  way  they  didn't  before,"  Thorn  said.  "That  was  at  the  center  of  the  'heritage  movement'  before  the  marketers  got  hold  of  it,  and  it's  a  sea  change  in  the  marketplace.  The  effects  of  that  change  are  going  to  stick  around,  even  after  people  stop  buying  defunct  workwear  brands  and  opening  boutiques  that  sell  colorfully-painted  axes."The  rise  of  casual  menswear  and  national  retail  contributed  to  the  decline  of  the  men's  store  in  the  mid-20th  century,  but  they're  becoming  hip  once  again,  thanks  to  increasing  interest  in  American-made  products  and  quality  brands  from  abroad.When  27-year-old  Eli  Cox  opened  Berkeley  Supply  Store  on  a  credit  card  in  November  2012,  he  stocked  it  exclusively  with  American-made  brands  that  he  liked:  Red  Wing  boots,  Taylor  Stitch  shirts,  Filson  coats  and  Rogue  Territory  jeans  --  clothes  with  a  workwear  feel,  but  a  little  more  refined.In  New  York  and  Portland,  "you  can't  swing  a  cat  without  hitting  one  of  these  shops,"  Cox  said.  In  Denver,  his  biggest  competition  was  J.Crew,  he  said.After  closing  out  his  first  year  in  the  black,  he  attributes  his  success  to  "like-minded"  millennials  flooding  the  city  in  recent  years,  creating  a  market  for  these  goods.Other  Denver-based  outlets  are  tapping  into  the  Rocky  Mountain  lifestyle  for  inspiration.When  their  shop  Armitage  &  McMillan  opens  in  March,  owners  Darin  Combs  and  Daniel  Armitage  plan  to  stock  it  with  brands  they  learned  about  through  their  work  in  New  York  fashion  industry,  like  Steven  Alan,  UNIS  and  Fair  Ends.  But  Armitage  &  McMillan  will  also  include  outdoor  gear  from  brands  like  Saturdays  Surf  NYC,  Mt.  Rainier  and  Epperson  Mountaineering."Denver  fashion  has  a  personality  of  its  own.  It's  not  the  Midwest  and  it's  not  the  West  Coast,"  said  Armitage.  The  Denver  man  is  looking  for  clothes  to  suit  his  lifestyle.The  childhood  friends  from  Oklahoma  lived  and  worked  in  Denver  before  relocating  to  New  York  in  2007  to  work  in  fashion.  As  they  watched  interest  grow  in  small  menswear  labels,  the  more  they  thought  there  could  be  a  market  for  them  in  Denver.Armitage  hopes  to  reach  fashion-conscious  men  who  want  to  support  the  brands  they  read  about  on  menswear  blogs,  or  young  professionals  who  work  in  places  where  suit  and  tie  aren't  required."They  don't  want  to  go  to  mall  stores  that  have  a  menswear  section,"  he  said.  "These  guys  want  to  go  into  a  menswear  shop  that  feels  like  a  menswear  shop  and  talk  to  guys  about  clothing  and  the  history  of  brands."</TEXT></DOC>

Her  husband  gave  her  knitting  needles.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Her  brother's  sudden  death  in  2004  hit  Sarah  Huerta  hard.In  the  years  that  followed,  Huerta  couldn't  leave  the  house  without  suffering  a  panic  attack.  She  hated  getting  in  cars  since  her  brother's  body  was  found  in  one.  She  couldn't  seem  to  hold  down  a  job.  Every  time  she  stepped  outside  she  felt  disaster  closing  in.Her  physician  diagnosed  her  with  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  and  extreme  anxiety.Her  husband  gave  her  knitting  needles.Huerta  was  skeptical  at  first.  Knitting  seemed  silly  --  and  difficult  for  hands  she  could  never  seem  to  keep  still.  But  as  she  learned  to  knit  and  purl,  hours  melted  away.  She  realized  she  was  no  longer  focusing  on  the  future,  imagining  catastrophic  things  happening  to  her  loved  ones."That's  when  I  seriously  started  crafting,"  Huerta  said.Crafting  can  help  those  who  suffer  from  anxiety,  depression  or  chronic  pain,  experts  say.  It  may  also  ease  stress,  increase  happiness  and  protect  the  brain  from  damage  caused  by  aging.Little  research  has  been  done  specifically  on  crafting,  but  neuroscientists  are  beginning  to  see  how  studies  on  cognitive  activities  such  as  doing  crossword  puzzles  might  also  apply  to  someone  who  does  complex  quilting  patterns.  Others  are  drawing  connections  between  the  mental  health  benefits  of  meditation  and  the  zen  reached  while  painting  or  sculpting."There's  promising  evidence  coming  out  to  support  what  a  lot  of  crafters  have  known  anecdotally  for  quite  some  time,"  says  Catherine  Carey  Levisay,  a  clinical  neuropsychologist  and  wife  of  Craftsy.com  CEO  John  Levisay.  "And  that's  that  creating  --  whether  it  be  through  art,  music,  cooking,  quilting,  sewing,  drawing,  photography  (or)  cake  decorating  --  is  beneficial  to  us  in  a  number  of  important  ways."Effects  similar  to  meditationEven  today,  years  after  Huerta  first  learned  to  knit,  she  finds  she  can  lose  herself  for  hours  in  a  tricky  pattern.Psychologist  Mihaly  Csikszentmihalyi  first  described  this  phenomenon  as  flow:  a  few  moments  in  time  when  you  are  so  completely  absorbed  by  an  activity  that  nothing  else  seems  to  matter.  Flow,  Csikszentmihalyi  says,  is  the  secret  to  happiness  --  a  statement  he  supports  with  decades  of  research."When  we  are  involved  in  (creativity),  we  feel  that  we  are  living  more  fully  than  during  the  rest  of  life,"  Csikszentmihalyi  said  during  a  TED  talk  in  2004.  "You  know  that  what  you  need  to  do  is  possible  to  do,  even  though  difficult,  and  sense  of  time  disappears.  You  forget  yourself.  You  feel  part  of  something  larger."Our  nervous  system  is  only  capable  of  processing  a  certain  amount  of  information  at  a  time,  he  explains.  That's  why  you  can't  listen  and  understand  two  people  who  are  talking  to  you  at  once.  So  when  someone  starts  creating,  his  existence  outside  that  activity  becomes  "temporarily  suspended.""He  doesn't  have  enough  attention  left  over  to  monitor  how  his  body  feels,  or  his  problems  at  home.  He  can't  feel  if  he's  hungry  or  tired.  His  body  disappears."The  effects  of  flow  are  similar  to  those  of  meditation,  says  occupational  therapist  Victoria  Schindler.  Science  has  shown  meditation  can,  among  other  things,  reduce  stress  and  fight  inflammation.Our  bodies  are  in  a  constant  state  of  stress  because  our  brain  can't  tell  the  difference  between  an  upcoming  meeting  with  the  boss  and  an  upcoming  bear  attack,  Schindler  says.  The  repetitive  motions  of  knitting,  for  example,  activate  the  parasympathetic  nervous  system,  which  quiets  that  "fight  or  flight"  response.In  a  2007  paper  "The  neurological  basis  of  occupation,"  Schindler  and  co-author  Sharon  Gutman  argue  that  patients  could  learn  to  use  activities  such  as  drawing  or  painting  to  elicit  flow,  which  would  offer  a  nonpharmaceutical  way  to  regulate  strong  emotions  such  as  anger  or  prevent  irrational  thoughts."Flow  could  potentially  help  patients  to  dampen  internal  chaos,"  they  write.A  natural  anti-depressantThe  reward  center  in  your  brain  releases  a  neurotransmitter  called  dopamine  when  you  do  something  pleasurable.  Scientists  believe  dopamine  was  originally  designed  to  make  us  repeat  activities  that  would  help  the  species  survive,  such  as  eating  and  having  sex.  Over  time,  we've  evolved  so  that  the  brain  can  also  release  dopamine  while  we're  staining  glass  or  decorating  a  cake.No  more  'buts':  Do  what  makes  you  happy"Dopamine,  in  and  of  itself,  is  our  natural  anti-depressant,"  Levisay  says.  "Any  time  we  can  find  a  nonmedicinal  way  to  stimulate  that  reward  center  ...  the  better  off  we're  going  to  be."There's  survey  evidence  to  support  crafting's  dopamine  effect.  In  one  study  of  more  than  3,500  knitters,  published  in  The  British  Journal  of  Occupational  Therapy,  81%  of  respondents  with  depression  reported  feeling  happy  after  knitting.  More  than  half  reported  feeling  "very  happy."And  crafting's  reward  goes  far  beyond  creation.  Seeing  the  finished  product  adorning  your  walls  --  or  receiving  praise  from  a  loved  one  --  can  offer  repeated  hits  of  that  feel-good  chemical.Crafting  also  improves  our  self-efficacy,  Levisay  says,  or  how  we  feel  about  performing  particular  tasks.  Psychologists  believe  a  strong  sense  of  self-efficacy  is  key  to  how  we  approach  new  challenges  and  overcome  disappointments  in  life.  So  realizing  you  can,  in  fact,  crochet  a  sweater  for  your  nephew  can  help  you  tackle  the  next  big  paper  your  teacher  assigns.Creative  activities  may  protect  against  agingMore  than  35  million  people  worldwide  live  with  dementia  today.  By  2050,  that  number  is  expected  to  more  than  triple,  and  experts  are  racing  to  find  ways  to  protect  the  brain  from  this  debilitating  condition.Neuroscientists  used  to  believe  that  the  brain  was  a  static  organ,  says  Levisay,  and  that  once  it  was  fully  developed  in  your  20s,  all  you  could  do  was  lose  power.  But  research  has  shown  more  recently  that  our  brains  are  flexible  and  can  adapt  to  their  environment,  even  in  old  age  --  a  concept  called  neuroplasticity.The  aging  brain:  Why  getting  older  just  might  be  awesomeThe  evidence  to  support  this  concept  is  overwhelming.  Studies  have  found  intellectually  stimulating  activities,  such  as  learning  a  new  language,  can  help  prevent  cerebral  atrophy  and  significantly  delay  dementia.  And  a  recently  published  clinical  trial  shows  cognitive  training  can  improve  reasoning  skills  and  the  brain's  processing  speed  for  up  to  10  years  after  said  training  has  been  completed."The  natural  next  step  is  to  study  other  activities  --  not  just  memory,  cognitive  tests,"  Levisay  says.  "What  about  crafting  activities?  Something  people  do  naturally  because  they're  enjoyable."Crafting  is  also  unique,  Levisay  says,  in  its  ability  to  involve  many  different  areas  of  your  brain.  It  can  work  your  memory  and  attention  span  while  involving  your  visuospatial  processing,  creative  side  and  problem-solving  abilities.Scientists  are  beginning  to  study  leisure  activities'  impact  on  the  brain.  Playing  games,  reading  books  and  crafting  could  reduce  your  chances  of  developing  mild  cognitive  impairment  by  30%  to  50%,  according  to  a  2011  study  published  in  The  Journal  of  Neuropsychiatry."The  hypothesis  is  that  the  more  stimulating  your  environment  is  ...  the  more  you're  increasing  the  complexity  of  the  brain,  the  more  you  can  afford  to  lose,"  Levisay  says.  "You're  building  a  buffer."Related:  Why  I'm  a  Pinterest  mom  |  I'm  not,  and  OK</TEXT></DOC>

Tell  us  how  you  did  it  and  you  could  be  featured  in  our  weekly  weight-loss  story  on  CNN.com.(CNN)  --  In  the  end,  a  coupon  changed  Torrie  Creamer's  life.Years  of  New  Year's  resolutions  hadn't  done  it.  Her  son's  probing  questions  about  her  "still  pregnant"  belly  hadn't  done  it.  Hurtful  comments  from  a  friend  about  another  obese  woman  at  a  ballgame  had  only  primed  her  desire  to  lose  weight.Then  the  LivingSocial  deal  arrived  in  her  inbox.  For  $25,  she  could  take  four  weeks  of  classes  at  a  women's  fitness  boot  camp.  And  after  the  incident  at  the  ballpark,  Creamer  was  ready  to  try  just  about  anything.Learn  more  about  Creamer's  journey  in  her  own  wordsThe  Norfolk,  Virginia,  resident  had  been  steadily  gaining  weight  since  she  married  her  high  school  sweetheart  Jason  more  than  10  years  before.  Each  kid  --  Jordan,  then  Gabriel,  then  Kameron  --  added  extra  pounds  she  couldn't  seem  to  shake.  By  2011,  she  was  5-foot-11  and  weighed  322  pounds.Boot  camps  have  become  popular  in  the  fitness  community  over  the  past  decade,  earning  praise  for  their  focus  on  high-intensity  intervals  and  body  weight  exercises.  Trainer  Ken  Williams  started  Bootcamp  for  Women  -  Body  by  Ken  with  five  members  in  May  2002.  By  July,  it  was  standing  room  only.Walking  toward  the  beach  for  her  first  workout,  Creamer  spotted  women  running  back  and  forth  in  the  sand.  She  hesitantly  joined  in  and  promptly  fell  down.  It  took  three  male  trainers  to  pick  her  back  up.Creamer  left  the  class  crying.  But  the  next  day  she  returned,  and  she  continued  to  go  to  every  class  for  the  next  four  weeks."I  was  always  the  last  runner  in,  or  in  my  case,  the  last  walker  in,"  she  says.  "I  could  not  do  push-ups.  I  could  not  finish  a  routine  without  feeling  like  I  was  dying  and  about  to  vomit.  But  somehow  I  made  it  there."She  lost  15  pounds  in  four  weeks  and  told  Williams  she  was  coming  back.The  next  day  Creamer  found  out  she  had  been  laid  off  from  her  job.  She  left  a  message  for  Williams  saying  she  couldn't  afford  the  program  without  a  steady  income  and  figured  that  was  that.But  that  night  she  got  a  phone  call  from  someone  in  the  group.  The  women  talked  and  were  going  to  chip  in  so  Creamer  could  continue  to  work  out."I  sat  on  my  porch  thinking  to  myself,  'These  people  don't  know  me,'"  Creamer  says.  "At  that  moment  I  made  the  promise  to  myself...  if  these  people  were  not  letting  me  fail,  then  how  can  I  let  myself  fail?"Creamer  committed  to  12  more  weeks  of  boot  camp.  Each  week  it  got  easier  for  her  to  complete  Williams'  grueling  workout.  She  continually  increased  her  goals  and  spoke  with  Williams  about  changes  she  could  make  when  she  hit  a  plateau.  When  the  12  weeks  were  over,  she  came  back  again."Everyday  she  came  I  could  see  her  giving  100%,"  Williams  says.  "That's  the  thing  I  saw  different  in  her.  When  you  put  that  in  your  head,  when  you  put  that  in  your  mind,  when  you  have  that  attitude  --  you  can't  help  but  be  successful."Creamer  also  overhauled  her  diet.  She  used  to  eat  a  bowl  of  ice  cream  every  night  before  going  to  sleep;  she  loved  "any  and  all"  fried  foods,  carbohydrates  and  sweets.  Now  she  eats  six  small  meals  a  day,  using  a  child's  plate  to  control  her  portion  sizes.Her  typical  day  consists  of:--  A  protein  shake  with  oatmeal  for  breakfast--  Mixed  nuts  for  a  morning  snack--  A  turkey  salad  sandwich  for  lunch--  Yogurt  with  fruit  for  an  afternoon  snack--  Chicken  with  vegetables  and  "good  carbs"  for  dinner--  And  another  protein  shake  for  a  post-dinner  snackAll  the  people  Williams  has  seen  lose  a  significant  amount  of  weight  have  one  thing  in  common,  he  says:  "They're  tired  of  being  sick  and  tired."Since  that  fateful  day  on  the  beach,  Creamer  has  lost  145  pounds.  She's  happier  and  more  positive  than  she's  ever  been,  and  it  shows  in  every  aspect  of  her  life.She  loves  having  enough  energy  to  play  with  her  kids.  And  she's  introduced  a  ton  of  new  customers  to  Williams'  program.  She's  determined  to  spread  her  "healthy  hugs"  to  other  overweight  women  who  are  suffering."I  feel  like  this  is  what  I  truly  was  put  here  to  do,  and  honestly  it  (took)  hitting  rock  bottom  before  I  could  understand  that,"  Creamer  says.  "If  I  can  do  it,  so  can  you."</TEXT></DOC>

Confronting  a  life  obstacle  --  injury,  illness  or  other  hardship  --  they  tapped  their  inner  strength  and  found  resilience  they  didn't  know  they  possessed.  This  week  we  meet  Allison  Lint,  who  plans  to  play  her  violin  in  all  50  states,  to  raise  awareness  for  vasculitis,  a  disease  she's  been  living  with  since  she  was  a  teenager.(CNN)  --  I  am  a  professional  musician  in  northeast  Ohio,  where  I  teach  private  lessons  at  two  independent  music  schools,  perform  in  the  Akron  Symphony  Orchestra  and  freelance  in  the  Cleveland/Akron  area.In  my  spare  time,  I  travel  the  country  raising  awareness  for  the  nonprofit  project  Violin  for  Vasculitis  (V4V),  which  has  brought  a  story  of  hope  and  inspiration  to  hundreds  of  music  lovers  and  vasculitis  patients  nationwide.It  all  began  at  the  age  of  16,  when  I  began  to  show  symptoms  of  illness:  severe  respiratory  problems,  fatigue  and  --  most  alarmingly  --  a  cough  that  brought  up  blood.It  was  determined  that  I  had  been  suffering  a  prolonged  lung  hemorrhage,  and  it  would  be  four  months,  three  hospital  visits  and  one  two-week  sedation  period  before  doctors  would  finally  reach  a  diagnosis:  Granulomatosis  with  Polyangiitis  (GPA/Wegener's),  a  rare  type  of  vascular  autoimmune  disease.With  the  help  of  the  Cleveland  Clinic  medical  staff,  the  Vasculitis  Foundation,  my  local  chapter  support  group  and  the  friends  and  family  who  knew  me  best,  I  was  able  to  find  the  information  I  needed  and  gain  the  strength  to  continue  with  my  life  while  fighting  an  uncommon  chronic  illness.Actor-director  Harold  Ramis  dies  from  form  of  vasculitisIn  2011,  I  realized  it  was  not  enough  to  simply  survive  with  vasculitis.  I  wanted  to  bring  information  and  hope  to  others  who  also  struggled,  and  let  them  discover  that  they  were  not  alone.At  the  encouragement  of  a  friend  who  suggested  I  "do  something  that  no  one  has  done  before,"  I  founded  Violin  for  Vasculitis  with  its  far-reaching  travel  plan  and  mission  of  nationwide  awareness.Within  weeks  of  beginning  the  project,  I  had  the  full  support  of  doctors,  professors,  colleagues,  members  of  the  vasculitis  community  and  musicians  around  the  globe.  V4V  has  performed  in  12  states,  with  several  events  scheduled  for  2014.Today  I  am  closely  monitored  by  a  team  of  doctors  at  the  Cleveland  Clinic,  and  I  have  been  in  and  out  of  remission  several  times.  I  balance  an  unconventional  musician's  lifestyle  with  the  necessary  precautions  of  diet,  sleep,  exercise  and  medications  that  my  body  needs  to  keep  functioning  well.Through  V4V  I  have  found  a  purpose,  both  in  my  performance  and  in  my  once-tragic  diagnosis.

For  young  people  growing  up  then  and  even  today,  the  writer-director's  name  conjures  up  memories  of  unforgettable  films.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  When  people  talk  about  the  cinematic  geniuses  of  the  1980s,  one  name  invariably  comes  up  --  John  Hughes.  For  young  people  growing  up  then  and  even  today,  the  writer-director's  name  conjures  up  memories  of  unforgettable  films.From  "Sixteen  Candles"  (1984)  and  "The  Breakfast  Club"  (1985)  to  "Pretty  in  Pink"  (1986)  and  "Ferris  Bueller's  Day  Off"  (1986),  Hughes  was  responsible  for  a  series  of  films  that  openly  and  honestly  explored  the  exhilaration  and  tumultuousness  of  adolescence.It's  been  nearly  three  decades  since  those  movies  arrived  in  theaters,  but  audiences  still  watch  and  enjoy  them  as  if  they  were  made  yesterday.  However,  despite  the  love  audiences  have  shown  for  his  work,  Hughes  was  never  nominated  for  an  Academy  Award.Hughes  isn't  alone  in  being  an  outstanding  filmmaker  whose  features  about  people  under  30  were  overlooked  during  awards  season.  It's  unfortunate  but  undeniable  that  award  shows  --  and  the  Oscars  in  particular  --  have  a  history  of  ignoring  great  movies  made  for  and  about  young  people.In  2013  alone,  several  such  films  received  raves  from  critics,  earning  spots  on  "best  of"  lists.  "The  Kings  of  Summer"  and  "The  Way,  Way  Back"  scored  approval  ratings  of  76%  and  85%  of  critics,  respectively,  on  RottenTomatoes.com,  while  "The  Spectacular  Now,"  written  by  the  duo  behind  2009's  underappreciated  "(500)  Days  of  Summer,"  earned  the  approval  of  92%  of  critics."Short  Term  12"  received  a  99%  approval  on  Rotten  Tomatoes,  a  higher  ranking  than  any  of  this  year's  best  picture  nominees.  "Spring  Breakers,"  starring  James  Franco  and  Selena  Gomez,  may  have  divided  some  moviegoers,  but  the  film  was  also  lauded  for  its  provocative  depiction  of  disaffected  youth.  And  it's  not  for  nothing  that  "The  Hunger  Games:  Catching  Fire"  was  the  top  grossing  film  of  2013.Yet  not  one  of  these  movies  earned  a  single  Oscar  nomination.Meanwhile,  "The  Wolf  of  Wall  Street  --  which  secured  a  77%  approval  rating  on  Rotten  Tomatoes  --  received  five  Academy  Award  nods,  including  ones  for  best  picture  and  best  adapted  screenplay.2014  Oscars  nominees  listThat's  not  to  say  that  "Wolf"  didn't  deserve  recognition,  but  these  other  movies  focused  on  characters  in  the  early  stages  of  adulthood.  From  three  teenage  boys  running  away  from  home  to  build  a  house  in  "The  Kings  of  Summer"  to  a  couple  in  their  20s  managing  a  treatment  facility  for  troubled  children  in  "Short  Term  12,"  these  films  were  about  young  people  finding  their  way  --  a  seeming  disadvantage  in  the  academy's  eyes.In  an  e-mail  interview,  Dana  Polan,  a  professor  of  cinema  studies  at  New  York  University's  Tisch  School  of  the  Arts,  noted  that  "Hollywood  associates  youth  with  escapist  entertainment.  (There)  is  the  assumption  here  (no  doubt,  a  biased  one)  that  to  be  important,  a  theme  has  to  be  adult  and  mature,  and  youth  films  just  don't  make  it."Over  the  years,  there  have  been  some  exceptions  to  this  rule.  For  example,  "Rebel  Without  a  Cause"  (1955)  received  three  Oscar  nominations,  and  "American  Graffiti"  (1973)  grabbed  five  nods  --  though  both  films  ultimately  walked  away  empty-handed.  "Juno,"  the  2007  comedy  about  a  pregnant  high  schooler  (Ellen  Page),  was  nominated  for  four  Oscars,  including  best  picture  and  best  director.  The  film  took  home  the  award  for  best  original  screenplay  --  a  win  that  one  could  argue  had  more  to  do  with  the  quirkiness  of  Diablo  Cody's  script  than  the  subject  matter  itself.Film  critic  Nell  Minow  (the  Movie  Mom)  also  observed  that  "Oscar  voters  skew  older.""They  are  more  interested  in  stories  about  grown-ups  and  more  likely  to  have  relationships  with  actors  and  filmmakers  who  are  30  and  older,"  Minow  said  via  e-mail.That  may  be  part  of  the  reason  why  movies  such  as  "The  Perks  of  Being  a  Wallflower,"  which  delighted  critics  with  one  of  2012's  best  scripts  and  stellar  performances  from  Logan  Lerman  and  Emma  Watson  --  also  didn't  receive  any  recognition  from  the  academy.Such  snubs  seem  particularly  egregious,  partly  because  the  academy  often  blatantly  attempts  to  appeal  to  a  younger  demographic.  In  2011,  the  Oscars  chose  James  Franco  and  Anne  Hathaway  as  hosts  in  hopes  of  attracting  younger  viewers.  The  plan  failed,  with  the  ratings  dipping  and  the  duo  receiving  poor  reviews.The  intention  may  have  been  a  noble  one,  but  perhaps  a  better  idea  would  have  been  for  the  academy  to  begin  honoring  movies  that  speak  to  what  it's  like  to  be  a  young  person  today."The  Youth,"  a  song  performed  by  MGMT  on  "The  Kings  of  Summer"  soundtrack,  speaks  of  the  transition  between  adolescence  and  adulthood.  It  includes  the  following  lyrics:The  youth  is  starting  to  change.Are  you  starting  to  change?</TEXT></DOC>

He  is  the  author  of  eight  books,  including  a  new  novel,  "Patriots,"  and  a  post-election  e-book,  "Why  Romney  Lost."  Frum  was  a  special  assistant  to  President  George  W.  Bush  from  2001  to  2002.(CNN)  --  Democratic  hopes  for  2014,  never  good,  are  fading  fast.  The  New  York  Times  reported  on  the  mood  of  panic  among  Democratic  senators.  Forecaster  Charlie  Cook  is  speculating  about  a  Democratic  Senate  wipeout.  It's  suddenly  looking  very  possible  that  Republicans  could  regain  control  of  both  houses  of  Congress  for  the  first  time  in  eight  years.  What  then?The  main  thing  to  expect:  You're  going  to  hear  a  lot  less  about  debt  and  deficits  from  Republicans  and  a  lot  more  from  Democrats.It's  almost  a  rule  of  American  politics  that  the  losers  of  the  last  election  talk  about  deficits,  while  the  winners  talk  about  what  they  want  to  do.It  happened  after  2008:  Barack  Obama's  triumphant  Democrats  announced  huge  new  spending  plans;  the  defeated  and  discarded  Republicans  fulminated  about  red  ink.It  happened  after  the  recount  election  of  2000.  Then  it  was  Republicans  who  had  plans  --  tax  cuts,  defense  buildups  --  and  Democrats  who  fretted  about  the  impact  on  the  budget  balance.It  happened  after  the  stunning  Republican  sweep  in  the  congressional  elections  of  1994.  Abruptly,  President  Clinton  --  who  had  campaigned  only  two  years  earlier  on  a  bold  program  of  "investments"  --  reinvented  himself  as  Mr.  Fiscal  Responsibility.  The  triumphant  Republicans  sent  Clinton  tax  cut  after  tax  cut.  He  vetoed  most  of  them,  but  finally  signed  a  reduction  in  the  capital  gains  tax  in  1997,  as  part  of  a  bargain  to  secure  spending  programs  that  he  preferred.And  so  it  will  be  if  Republicans  take  full  control  of  Congress  after  2014.  The  debt  crisis  that  used  to  present  such  a  generational  challenge?  The  new  "red  menace"  --  this  time  of  red  ink  rather  than  the  Red  Army?  It  will  suddenly  take  a  back  seat  to  the  need  to  accelerate  economic  growth  by  cutting  tax  rates.Meanwhile  the  Obama  Democrats  --  who  five  years  ago  accepted  budget  deficits  of  nearly  10%  of  GDP  as  indispensable  to  economic  recovery  --  will  suddenly  decide  that  the  country's  present  deficit  of  less  than  half  that  amount  is  intolerable  and  unacceptable.  The  President's  latest  budget  proposes  to  reduce  the  deficit  below  2%,  thanks  in  large  part  to  new  tax  revenues  generated  by  the  lapse  of  the  Bush  tax  cuts  at  the  end  of  2012  and  the  new  Obamacare  taxes  that  went  into  effect  at  the  same  time.If  Republicans  win  in  November  2014,  they  will  try  to  send  that  money  back  home.  President  Obama  will  invoke  "fiscal  responsibility,"  Clinton  style,  in  hope  of  thwarting  them.Deficit  reduction  is  everybody's  second  favorite  policy,  after  their  first  favorite,  "Doing  what  I  want."  This  may  explain  the  seeming  paradox  that  deficits  tend  to  shrink  during  periods  of  divided  government  (like  the  final  six  years  of  the  Clinton  and  Obama  presidencies)  and  to  widen  during  period  of  united  government  (like  the  first  six  years  of  the  George  W.  Bush  presidency  and  the  first  two  years  of  Clinton  and  Obama).To  put  it  even  more  bluntly:  Deficits  don't  shrink  because  politicians  reach  Grand  Bargains.  Deficits  shrink  precisely  when  politicians  are  least  able  to  do  anything  grand.  Deficits  shrink  not  when  leaders  compromise,  but  when  they  squabble.Right  now,  the  deficit  is  shrinking  at  the  fastest  pace  since  the  end  of  World  War  II.  Much  of  this  improvement  can  be  explained  by  economic  recovery;  much,  but  not  all.  And  that  part  of  deficit  reduction  explained  by  public  policy  has  been  put  in  place  (and  will  likely  continue  for  at  least  the  next  two  years)  by  political  conflict,  not  by  deal-making.The  Bush  tax  cuts  expired  at  the  end  of  2012,  as  did  the  payroll  tax  holiday  put  in  place  to  counter  the  2009  recession.  Obamacare's  new  taxes  on  high-income  earners  went  into  effect  the  very  next  day.  These  tax  increases  enrage  Republicans.  Yet  until  and  unless  Republicans  can  elect  a  president  to  sign  a  tax  cut  passed  by  Congress,  the  tax  increases  will  remain  in  effect,  collecting  rising  revenues  for  the  government  in  Washington.To  end  the  debt  ceiling  fight  in  2011,  the  parties  agreed  to  an  emergency  measure  --  a  budget  sequester  that  mindlessly  imposes  spending  cuts  across  the  federal  discretionary  budget.  The  hope  was  that  the  sheer  irrationality  of  the  sequester  would  force  the  parties  to  agree  on  a  more  sensible  plan.  So  much  for  that.  The  sequester  continues  to  hack  away  --  and  as  things  stand,  will  continue  to  hack  away  for  the  remainder  of  the  decade.Health  care  cost  inflation  is  slowing  down,  for  reasons  economists  don't  fully  understand.  Is  the  slowdown  a  rare  positive  effect  of  the  Great  Recession?  Is  Obamacare  delivering  as  promised?  Or  is  it  just  a  manifestation  of  the  old  rule  that  nothing  continues  forever?  Whatever  the  explanation,  that  explanation  is  likely  to  remain  in  force  for  some  time  to  come.  Obamacare  can't  be  repealed,  can't  be  expanded,  and  can't  be  fixed.  Whatever  Obamacare  does,  it's  going  to  keep  doing  it  for  a  long  time  to  come.A  friendly  foreign  observer  of  U.S.  politics  used  to  joke:  "It's  never  over  till  it's  over  --  and  it's  never  over."You  could  add  a  PS  to  that  rule:  "And  when  it's  over,  it's  not  because  anybody  likes  the  result  --  but  because  so  many  different  people  hate  it  for  so  many  different  reasons."Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinionJoin  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinionThe  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  David  Frum.</TEXT></DOC>

It  generated  a  record  2.7  million  retweets  --  a  coup  for  her,  the  Oscars  telecast  and  the  Korean  electronics  maker.But  some  sharp-eyed  observers  noticed  something  a  bit  different  when  viewing  the  talk-show  host's  backstage  tweets.  Several  of  them,  such  as  a  photo  of  DeGeneres  with  actor  Channing  Tatum,  were  sent  not  from  a  Samsung  Galaxy  handset  but  a  rival  iPhone.The  source  of  the  photos  and  tweets  can't  be  seen  on  DeGeneres'  Twitter  page,  but  is  visible  when  they're  viewed  on  another  platform  such  as  TweetDeck.Samsung  did  not  immediately  respond  to  a  request  for  comment  from  CNN.  Several  other  photos  DeGeneres  posted  were  sent  using  an  Android  device,  most  likely  the  Samsung  phone  she  used  to  pose  with  Bradley  Cooper,  Meryl  Streep,  Brad  Pitt  and  a  handful  of  other  A-list  stars.A  similar  faux  pas  occurred  in  2012,  when  after  weeks  of  talking  up  Microsoft's  Surface  tablet,  talk-show  queen  Oprah  Winfrey  sent  a  Twitter  message  touting  the  product  to  her  14.8  million  followers.  However,  Winfrey  --  or  whoever  managed  her  Twitter  account  --  sent  the  tweet  from  an  iPad.Some  bloggers  came  to  her  defense,  noting  that  no  official  Twitter  app  existed  for  the  Surface's  operating  system  at  the  time.And  singer  Alicia  Keys  claimed  she  was  hacked  after  she  was  caught  tweeting  from  an  iPhone  last  year  while  serving  as  a  "creative  director"  for  BlackBerry.CNN's  Doug  Gross  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Tell  us  how  you  did  it,  and  you  could  be  featured  in  our  weekly  weight-loss  story  on  CNN.com.(CNN)  --  Fried  chicken.  Mashed  potatoes.  Collard  greens.  These  were  the  foods  Chris  Ross  grew  up  on  in  rural  Kentucky."One  of  the  earliest  food  memories  I  have  is  my  grandfather  making  hamburgers  ...  my  grandmother  frying  potatoes,"  he  says.  "Of  course,  in  those  days,  everything  was  fried  in  lard."Ross  still  enjoys  those  foods,  despite  having  lost  --  and  kept  off  --  more  than  100  pounds.  He  doesn't  make  substitutions  or  skip  the  bun.  His  weight  loss  secret  isn't  really  a  secret  at  all.He  simply  eats  less.Ross,  the  executive  chef  at  Bristol  Catering  in  Louisville,  Kentucky,  started  gaining  weight  after  high  school  while  working  in  restaurants,  first  as  a  waiter,  then  as  a  cook.  At  the  time,  he  was  studying  law  enforcement  in  college,  but  in  between  classes,  he  came  home  to  watch  the  Food  Network.  "I  just  got  consumed,"  he  says.He  didn't  really  notice  that  he  had  gained  20  or  30  pounds  over  his  freshman  year.  He  ignored  the  signs  when  his  clothes  stopped  fitting.  Later,  when  an  overweight  friend  at  work  mentioned  their  similarities,  he  was  confused."I  never  saw  it,"  Ross  says.  "It's  a  weird  realization  when  you're  gaining  weight.  You  think,  you're  getting  older.  Maybe  it's  normal."Then  in  late  2004,  Ross  stepped  on  a  scale  for  the  first  time  in  years.  The  scale,  which  only  went  up  to  300  pounds,  refused  to  register  his  weight.  That  was  bad.  When  he  finally  found  another  scale  to  tell  him  the  truth,  it  was  worse.The  6-foot-2-inch  chef  was  327  pounds."To  realize  that  you're  not  just  obese,  but  morbidly  obese,  it  was  pretty  tough  on  the  mental  psyche."Ross  started  looking  at  his  daily  habits  a  little  closer.  He  switched  from  regular  Coke  to  Coke  Zero  and  lost  10  pounds  over  a  couple  months.  Then  he  picked  up  a  book  --  "French  Women  Don't  Get  Fat"  by  Mireille  Guiliano  --  that  he  saw  Oprah  Winfrey  discussing  on  her  show.  As  a  chef,  he'd  always  had  a  love  for  Paris.  If  anything  could  motivate  him,  this  was  it.The  book  talked  about  eating  smaller  portions,  drinking  water  and  walking  everywhere.  So  Ross  started  doing  the  same.  He  tried  to  drink  eight  glasses  of  water  every  day,  and  he  made  an  effort  to  walk  for  at  least  an  hour  before  or  after  work.Take  upwave's  challenge:  Drink  more  water!The  book's  tips  helped  him  drop  another  20  pounds.  But  it  wasn't  enough.After  reading  about  a  New  Orleans  chef  who  had  lost  weight,  Ross  decided  to  conduct  an  experiment.  For  one  day,  he  wrote  everything  that  he  tasted  at  his  restaurant  down  on  disposable  spoons  and  tossed  the  spoons  into  a  pan.  At  the  end  of  the  day,  he  tallied  the  calories.  He  had  consumed  more  than  4,000  just  from  tasting  his  dishes."Breakfast,  lunch,  dinner  in  addition  to  that  --  I  was  taking  in  6,000  calories  a  day,"  Ross  says.  "And  not  being  an  Olympic  athlete,  it  was  kind  of  hard  to  burn  it  off."Ross  couldn't  stop  tasting  his  food.  So  he  started  discreetly  spitting  out  his  tastes  into  the  trash.  From  that  point  on,  nothing  could  stop  him.When  he  hit  250  pounds,  he  started  jogging.  When  he  lost  10  more  pounds,  he  ran  a  5K  race.  When  he  got  down  to  230  pounds,  he  proposed.  Then  he  and  his  fiancee  started  taking  a  friend's  Zumba  class."Man,  the  weight  really  started  falling  off  then,"  he  says.  "I'm  a  36-year-old  white  guy  with  no  rhythm.  It's  a  fun  exercise  when  you  get  over  the  fact  that  you  feel  stupid  doing  it."By  the  time  the  couple  married  in  July  2011,  Ross  weighed  190  pounds."I  think  the  only  way  to  really  consistently  lose  weight  and  keep  it  off  is  to  develop  moderation  and  portion  control,"  he  says.  "You  need  to  eat  what  you  want  to  eat,  just  try  to  maintain  control."With  three  kids  and  a  growing  catering  company,  the  days  of  a  40-hour  work  week  are  long  gone.  Still,  Ross  makes  time  to  run  at  least  four  days  a  week  as  he  trains  for  the  Kentucky  Derby  Festival  miniMarathon  on  April  19.His  weight  fluctuates.  Some  days,  dinner  is  a  McDonald's  double  cheeseburger  and  kid-sized  fries.  He  refuses  to  give  up  margarine,  despite  the  FDA's  warnings  about  the  health  risks  of  partially  hydrogenated  oils.  But  overall,  Ross  has  adopted  the  healthy  lessons  he  learned  in  "French  Women  Don't  Get  Fat."More  importantly  he's  adopted  the  author's  attitude:"The  key?  Not  guilt  or  deprivation  but  learning  to  get  the  most  from  the  things  you  most  enjoy."</TEXT></DOC>

More  like  Super  Bust!</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Super  Bowl?  More  like  Super  Bust!The  team  that  set  a  record  for  most  points  in  the  NFL  this  season  almost  set  another  Sunday  night:  team  to  score  zero  points  in  a  Super  Bowl.  Fortunately,  the  Denver  Broncos  managed  eight  measly  points  late  in  the  game  to  avoid  that  ignominy.Still,  the  Seattle  Seahawks  delivered  a  brutal  crushing.  A  43-8  crushing.But  the  Super  Bowl  stopped  being  about  just  the  game  a  long  time  ago.  It's  about  the  ads,  the  halftime  show,  the  social  media  reaction.More  than  24.9  million  tweets  were  sent  about  the  game  and  halftime  show,  Twitter  reported;  24.1  million  were  sent  in  2013.The  top  three  moments  were  all  sports-related,  including  the  Percy  Harvin  87-yard  kickoff  return  for  a  touchdown  at  the  opening  of  the  third  quarter,  a  touchdown  pass  to  Jermaine  Kearse  and  the  69-yard  interception  return  by  Malcolm  Smith.Here  are  our  10  favorite  social  media  moments  from  Sunday  night.1.  The  heartbreakNo  matter  how  much  joy  you  took  in  the  Seahawks'  carnage,  this  photo  of  a  young  Broncos  fan  crying  at  his  team's  loss  is  pretty  gloat-sapping.2.  The  fur  coat"Broadway  Joe"  stepped  onto  the  midfield  for  a  coin  toss  (that  he  botched),  and  he  sent  Twitter  into  a  tizzy  with  his  mammoth  fur  coat.3.  The  big  winnerThe  ads  were  great.  We  especially  liked  the  Clydesdale  horse  and  the  shelter  puppy.  But  Radio  Shack's  back-to-the-'80s  spot  was  a  big  winner  with  viewers.4.  The  charmerBruno  Mars  charmed  just  about  everyone.  The  Red  Hot  Chili  Peppers?  Not  so  much.5.  The  apologyYikes.  Several  of  JC  Penney's  tweets  during  the  game  had  people  scratching  their  heads.  The  company  later  posted  an  apology  for  the  misspellings,  saying  it  was  "tweeting  with  mittens."6.  The  tweetPeople  pay  attention  to  Hillary.  A  tweet  from  the  former  secretary  of  state  and  former  first  lady  --  a  sly  dig  at  Fox  --  has  been  retweeted  more  than  50,000  times.7.  The  cellphonesYou  pay  thousands  of  dollars  for  prime  seats  to  the  game.  Then  you  spend  the  entire  time  staring  at  it  through  your  smartphone  screen.  Sigh.8.  The  oops!CBS  accidentally  aired  its  Wi-Fi  access  password.  Props  for  using  both  numbers  and  uppercase  letters.9.  The  channel  changersThe  one-sided  game  was  so  one-sided  that  even  guys  were  like,  "I'd  rather  watch  'Downton  Abbey.'  "</TEXT></DOC>

Like  aircraft  parts.The  Beluga  can  carry  the  wings  of  an  A340  airliner  or  a  fuselage  section  for  Airbus'  newest  wide-body  aircraft,  the  A350.But  it's  not  large  enough  to  transport  parts  for  the  A380  super  jumbo.Those  need  to  travel  by  boat,  barge  and  road.Belugas  have  occasionally  been  chartered  to  fly  satellites,  helicopters  and  even  works  of  art.Delacroix's  "Liberty  Leading  the  People"  flew  from  Paris  to  Tokyo  on  a  Beluga  --  the  canvas  wouldn't  fit  into  any  other  plane.MORE:  Superjumbo  on  the  streets  of  tiny  French  villageComing  up:  Beluga  XLWith  the  Beluga  nearing  two  decades  of  indefatigable  service,  it's  starting  to  show  its  age  and  limitations.Since  the  Beluga's  maiden  flight  in  1994,  Airbus  has  multiplied  aircraft  deliveries  by  nearly  five.The  company  has  become  more  global,  diversifying  its  supplier  base  and  opening  assembly  plants  in  China  and  Alabama  --  well  outside  the  Beluga's  relatively  short  range  of  1,500  nautical  miles  with  maximum  payload.In  order  to  cope  with  the  increasing  workload,  Airbus  has  put  in  place  the  so-called  "Fly  10,000"  program.The  program  aims  to  optimize  the  company's  logistics  infrastructure  by  increasing  the  work  performed  by  its  transport  fleet  to  10,000  hours  per  year  by  2017.The  plan  includes  the  Beluga,  which  will  be  expected  to  fly  many  more  hours  per  day.With  aircraft  order  books  at  a  historic  maximum,  however,  Airbus  can't  afford  to  bet  its  vital  logistics  operation  chain  on  the  readiness  of  five  aging  aircraft.Though  no  decisions  have  been  made,  Airbus  is  looking  at  potential  replacement  solutions.Tentatively  called  Beluga  XL,  the  Beluga's  replacement  is  likely  to  be  based  on  the  A330  airframe.It's  expected  to  have  a  longer  range  and  be  able  to  carry  a  heavier  payload,  while  still  being  able  to  land  at  airports  with  relatively  short  runways,  such  as  Broughton,  England,  where  Airbus  makes  wings  for  its  airliners.The  next  generation  Beluga  should  also  make  it  possible  for  Airbus  to  double  its  number  of  cargo  flights  to  120  per  week.What  seems  assured  is  that  the  Beluga  XL  is  going  to  look  similar  to  the  current  version,  something  plane  spotters  passing  through  Toulouse  should  appreciate.MORE:  Boeing  through  the  ages:  Planes  that  changed  the  way  we  travelMiquel  Ros  is  an  aviation  blogger.

As  someone  who  has  worked  on  reforming  marijuana  laws  for  nearly  three  years,  I  decided  to  take  part  as  a  customer  and  get  in  line.Advocates,  industry  members  and  media  stayed  away  from  partying  New  Year's  Eve  to  get  up  early  to  commemorate  the  historic  day.  We  began  at  3D  cannabis  dispensary  at  7  a.m.  with  a  press  conference.  We  joined  city  and  state  representatives  at  Medicine  Man  dispensary  later  in  the  morning.The  atmosphere  was  reminiscent  of  a  concert  or  sporting  event.  People  who  braved  the  cold  stood  in  line  and  made  small  talk.  A  lot  of  people,  particularly  those  over  50,  said  "It's  about  time,"  and  told  stories  about  arrests  spanning  decades  for  using  marijuana.  It  was  like  a  wedding  or  Election  Night,  with  lots  of  picture-taking,  hugs  and  congratulatory  wishes  --  except  it  was  7  a.m.  and  coffee  and  cocoa  took  the  place  of  beer  and  wine.I  waited  alongside  three  fairly  young  men  who  drove  nine  hours  from  Nebraska  to  take  part.  Behind  them  was  a  couple  from  Chicago  who  insisted  their  decision  to  go  to  Denver  was  not  solely  based  on  buying  state-regulated  marijuana  --  but  it  played  a  significant  role.  Many  others  were  local  marijuana  users  looking  forward  to  experiencing  what  only  medical  marijuana  patients  had  been  accustomed  to  in  Colorado.Once  in  earshot  of  the  "budtenders,"  the  conversation  was  fairly  surreal.  I  asked  for  a  strain  perfect  for  after  work,  something  to  make  me  relax  and  help  me  sleep  --  a  Marijuana  Merlot.  I  was  told  two  Indica  strains  are  solid  sellers  for  this  purpose:  Tahoe  Triangle  and  Ogre.  Tahoe  Triangle  had  a  light  pine  smell;  Ogre  was  more  musty  and  pungent  like  you  might  imagine  a  hairy  monster  would  be.  I  went  with  the  Ogre  with  thoughts  of  Shrek  in  my  mind.The  stores  are  fully  backed  by  the  state  and  local  governments,  and  have  been  given  a  cautious  green  light  by  the  federal  government  to  proceed  as  planned.Colorado  voters  approved  Amendment  64,  which  legalized  pot  for  recreational  use,  because  they  believe  marijuana  prohibition  is  more  harmful  than  good  and  wastes  resources.  Colorado's  previous  efforts  to  decriminalize  the  plant  --  remove  criminal  penalties  for  possession  of  small  amounts  of  marijuana  while  it  still  remained  technically  illegal  --  have  already  proven  cost  effective,  practical  and  safe.  According  to  the  Colorado  Center  on  Law  and  Policy,  the  amendment's  decriminalization  alone  would  save  the  state  $12  million  in  2012.In  the  last  decade,  the  state  has  averaged  more  than  10,000  arrests  and  citations  per  year  for  minor  marijuana  possession.  The  number  of  arrests  has  dropped  over  the  last  year  to  below  4,500,  but  this  number  represents  high  increases  in  arrests  for  public  consumption.Public  consumption  is  a  primary  issue  ahead  of  us.  Using  marijuana  in  public  is  still  illegal  in  Colorado,  and  the  Denver  City  Council  has  been  engaging  in  a  long  back  and  forth  to  define  "open  and  public  use."  The  current  definition  isn't  specific  enough  for  the  post-  Amendment  64  era.The  proposed  law  in  Denver  would  allow  for  open  and  public  use  as  long  as  it's  on  private  property  with  permission  of  the  owner  or  lessee.  Smoking  is  not  allowed  on  city  sidewalks,  parks  or  the  downtown  mall.Law  enforcement  rarely  arrested  anyone  for  public  use  before  Amendment  64,  when  possession  charges  were  the  primary  prohibition.  We  expect  this  number  to  stabilize  and  decline  as  law  enforcement,  decision-makers  and  users  establish  a  culture  of  responsible  use.  Fortunately,  use  and  consumption  laws  will  soon  be  a  civil  issue  in  Denver,  not  a  criminal  one.On  the  way  back  to  the  car  after  making  my  first  fully  legal  and  regulated  marijuana  purchase,  I  saw  the  guys  from  Nebraska  again.  I  handed  them  educational  brochures  created  by  local  reform  advocates  that  provide  various  resources,  address  the  effects  and  caution  for  consuming  potent  edibles,  and  generally  explain  the  law.  The  young  men  thanked  me,  jumped  in  their  Jeep  with  Nebraska  license  plates  and  Denver  Bronco  covers  and  took  off.The  state  is  addressing  potential  harms  of  using  marijuana  with  public  education,  safety  and  health  outreach  efforts.  It  felt  good  to  put  this  new  reality  in  action  with  cautionary  discussions  with  the  Nebraskans  and  others  throughout  the  day.Colorado  is  leading  the  nation  in  a  new  way  to  control  marijuana,  focusing  scarce  law  enforcement  resources  away  from  arresting  responsible  users.  It  is  satisfying  to  be  part  of  that  process,  and  it  feels  incredible  to  be  in  a  position  to  promote  safety  and  positive  experiences  for  adults  who  are  now  law-abiding.  They  are  pioneering  an  end  to  prohibition  just  by  being  regular  people,  standing  in  line,  and  behaving  with  friendly  cheer  and  good  spirits  on  the  first  day  of  2014.

She  is  a  mom  of  two.  Read  her  other  columns  and  follow  her  reports  at  CNN  Parents  and  on  Twitter.(CNN)  --  Imagine  that  Twitter  existed  when  Gloria  Steinem  helped  usher  in  the  women's  liberation  movement  of  the  1960s  and  1970s.How  much  louder  a  voice  would  she  and  other  feminists  of  that  time  have  had  to  bring  attention  to  the  unequal  economic,  political  and  social  rights  of  women?  Would  we  be  further  along  on  that  still  incomplete  path  to  equal  rights  if  they  had  the  technological  resources  we  have  today?Suppose  the  Internet  were  available  in  the  developing  world  several  decades  ago;  how  much  more  aware  would  girls  have  been  about  the  world  around  them?  How  much  more  attention  would  have  been  paid  to  the  harsh  treatment  of  many  girls  worldwide?Or  what  if  groups  of  anonymous  online  activists,  who  have  exposed  sexual  abuse  against  young  women,  were  around  20  or  30  years  ago?  How  many  rapes  would  not  have  been  swept  under  the  rug?OPINION:  New  women's  issues,  new  challengesIt's  heady  to  think  what  modern  connective  technology  could  have  done  for  women  if  it  existed  years  ago  and  how  it's  empowering  women  and  girls  around  the  world  today.  At  the  same  time,  some  of  the  very  technology  that  is  moving  us  forward  could  also  be  setting  us  back  by  making  harassment  and  exploitation  of  women  easier.That  intersection  of  technology  and  empowerment  was  the  subject  of  a  panel  I  was  honored  to  participate  in  during  this  year's  South  by  Southwest  Interactive  Festival  in  Austin,  Texas.Feminism  2.0"The  worldwide  web  is  the  newest  (and  arguably  most  important)  realm  in  our  society  that  presents  great  opportunities  and  significant  challenges  for  women,"  said  Carla  Franklin,  the  organizer  of  the  panel,  who  calls  herself  a  "2.0  feminist.""It's  women  using  high-tech  to  make  sure  we  have  equal  rights,  making  sure  that  as  moms,  as  daughters,  as  granddaughters,  as  nieces,  as  aunts,  we  are  empowering  ourselves  in  the  workplace,  at  home,  in  our  lives  in  general,  and  we  do  that  through  technology,"  said  Franklin,  who  is  the  founder  and  managing  director  of  Carlin  Solutions,  a  management  consulting  firm.Maggie  Neilson  is  partner  and  chief  executive  officer  of  Global  Philanthropy  Group,  an  organization  that  helps  charitable  foundations,  corporations  and  celebrities  provide  philanthropic  services.OPINION:  Millennial  women  are  leaning  in  and  stepping  up"I  think  two  of  the  strengths  of  technology  on  its  own  are  relevant  with  women's  issues;  one  is  the  ability  to  give  voice  and  two  is  the  ability  to  connect,"  Neilson  said  during  the  panel  discussion.She  cited  as  one  example  her  company's  work  with  Gucci  last  year,  helping  the  company  start  an  online  platform  called  Chime  for  Change,  which  began  as  a  global  concert.  The  initiative,  co-founded  by  Beyonce,  Salma  Hayek  and  Frida  Giannini,  an  Italian  fashion  designer,  helps  bring  together  voices  speaking  out  for  girls  and  women  around  the  world  in  the  areas  of  education,  health  and  justice.The  impact  of  celebrities  getting  involved  and  putting  the  word  out  has  led  to  extraordinary  results,  she  said."We've  rescued  sex  trafficking  victims.  We've  had  young  women  in  the  United  Kingdom  receive  mentoring  help,"  said  Neilson,  who  added  that  these  feats  were  accomplished  because  the  technology  existed  to  connect  people.Trying  to  take  the  concept  to  the  next  level  and  figure  out  how  to  use  technology  to  really  move  the  idea  forward,  Neilson's  firm  reached  out  to  Twitter.  The  company  hosted  a  hackathon  for  three  days,  where  coders  came  from  all  over  Silicon  Valley  and  developed  apps  such  as  one  to  help  get  vaccinations  to  rural  areas  and  another  to  help  women  who  have  been  victims  of  sexual  abuse  on  college  campuses."If  you  can  do  that  in  a  couple  of  months'  time,  there  really  is  no  telling  what  technology  can  open  up  for  all  of  us,"  she  said.READ:  No  movement  for  women  at  the  top  in  corporate  AmericaTech  taking  'the  covers  off'  social  issuesTechnology  has  certainly  opened  our  eyes  to  the  plight  of  women  and  girls  around  the  world.  Consider  the  impact  social  media  had  on  galvanizing  international  outrage  after  the  horrific  and  deadly  gang  rape  of  a  young  Indian  medical  student,  or  the  power  of  Malala  Yousafzai  of  Pakistan,  an  advocate  for  the  right  of  girls  to  an  education,  who  was  targeted  and  shot  by  a  gunman,  and  who  has  since  become  an  international  heroine."Technology  has  definitely  taken  the  covers  off  a  lot  of  social  issues  when  it  comes  to  women,"  said  panelist  Tara  Hughes,  senior  director  of  technical  product  management  at  Turner  Broadcasting,  CNN's  parent  company.  "I  think  it's  provided  a  voice  for  the  voiceless,  so  we  wouldn't  know  some  of  the  things  that  were  going  on  in  countries  like  India  or  (in)  the  Middle  East  if  it  wasn't  for  some  of  those  social  networks."Franklin  cited  some  of  the  rape  cases  in  the  United  States  brought  to  light  by  the  group  Anonymous  or  other  groups  that  have  "shed  light  on  injustices."  She  also  pointed  to  technology's  help  for  women  impacted  by  cyberbullying  and  cyberharassment."Just  to  see  the  groundswell  of  support  for  victims  because  of  ...  awareness  through  the  Internet  is  a  critical  thing,"  said  Franklin,  who  was  one  of  50  women  featured  on  More  Magazine's  "Fierce  List"  for  her  relentless  efforts  to  hold  accountable  a  cyberstalker  who  was  harassing  her.In  many  ways,  technology  has  also  helped  women  better  balance  work,  family  and  outside  interests.  "We  can  now  order  groceries  on  the  way  home  from  work,"  said  Franklin  via  e-mail.  "We  can  run  our  own  companies  using  virtual  offices  and  virtual  assistants."READ:  Ladies,  stop  trying  to  be  perfect!Neilson,  who  has  two  elementary  school-age  daughters,  says  technology  gives  her  the  flexibility  she  needs  and  values."I  can,  as  someone  who  owns  my  own  business,  go  coach  my  daughter's  basketball  team  and  work  at  night,"  she  said.  "I  can,  as  I'm  on  a  flight  home,  be  paying  the  bills  and  ordering  stuff  for  their  birthday  party  this  weekend  or  whatever  the  case  may  be."How  tech  can  also  set  women  backBut  just  as  technology,  in  many  ways,  may  be  the  best  friend  of  feminism,  it  can  also  be  its  foe:  That  same  technology  that  is  empowering  us  can  also  push  us  down.During  her  work  on  sex  trafficking,  Neilson  told  me  via  e-mail,  she  heard  johns  discuss  how  "the  combination  of  mobile  phones  and  online  want  ad  platforms  have  made  it  easier  to  order  a  girl  than  a  pizza."  Girls  and  women  make  up  75%  of  global  human  trafficking  victims,  according  to  a  report  by  the  United  Nations  Office  on  Drugs  and  Crime.In  Saudi  Arabia,  the  government  has  launched  a  system  allowing  officials  to  send  text  messages  to  men  when  female  members  of  their  family  try  to  travel  abroad  alone,  Neilson  said.And  then  there  is  the  issue  of  anonymity  on  the  Internet,  which  has  led  to  far  too  many  cases  of  women  being  terrorized,  ridiculed  and  bullied.  The  meanness  can  also  sometimes  come  from  surprising  sources.READ:  What  changes  with  women  in  the  boardroom?Any  woman  who  has  reported  on  or  expressed  an  opinion  about  feminism  online  knows  there  can  be  a  backlash,  but  sometimes  that  backlash  comes  from  other  feminists,  which  is  harder  to  comprehend."The  way  that  women's  groups  and  LGBT  (lesbian,  gay,  bisexual  and  transgender)  groups  turn  on  each  other  in  comments'  sections  is  mind-boggling,"  said  Neilson.Getting  more  women  into  techTechnology  is  no  doubt  here  to  say,  and  a  challenge  for  women  in  the  future  is  making  sure  more  women  have  a  seat  at  the  table  when  it  comes  to  developing  the  new  technologies  that  will  dramatically  impact  men's  --  and  women's  --  lives.That  is  an  even  bigger  challenge  when  you  consider  how  the  number  of  first-year  undergraduate  women  interested  in  majoring  in  computer  science  dropped  79%  between  2000  and  2011,  according  to  the  National  Center  for  Women  and  Information  Technology  (Turner  Broadcasting  is  an  investment  partner  of  NCWIT).  At  the  same  time,  there  are  glimmers  of  hope  when  you  hear  that  for  the  first  time,  the  University  of  California  at  Berkeley  reported  more  women  than  men  enrolled  in  its  introductory  computer  science  course.READ:  Tech  firms  now  hiring  more  women  than  menHughes  of  Turner  Broadcasting,  who  remembers  being  one  of  only  two  females  in  her  engineering  classes  during  college,  spends  some  of  her  time  trying  to  expose  young  women  and  girls  in  Atlanta  to  careers  in  technology."Every  year  a  young  lady  says,  'Well,  I  don't  want  to  major  in  math  and  science  because  my  teacher  told  me  such  and  such,'"  said  Hughes.  Her  response?  "You  have  to  just  take  whatever  someone  tells  you  and  throw  it  out  the  window.""There  is  no  box,  that's  the  first  thing  we  need  to  tell  young  women  ...  so  they  can  forge  their  own  path  and  then  wreak  havoc  on  the  world  in  a  beautiful  way."How  do  you  think  technology  has  empowered  women?

It's  part  of  a  kingdom  that  flourished  almost  1,000  years  ago,  and  home  to  the  biggest  ancient  structure  in  sub-Saharan  Africa.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Every  week,  Inside  Africa  takes  its  viewers  on  a  journey  across  Africa,  exploring  the  true  diversity  and  depth  of  different  cultures,  countries  and  regions.  Follow  host  Errol  Barnett  on  Twitter  and  Facebook.(CNN)  --  Legend  has  it  that  this  was  once  a  playground  for  the  giants  --  and  for  visitors  gazing  over  this  steep  hill  in  southern  Zimbabwe  it's  easy  to  understand  why.Spread  around  in  every  direction,  great  jumbled  blocks  of  granite  rise  from  the  ground  to  create  spectacular  rock  formations,  their  fantastical  shapes  fashioned  by  centuries  of  wind  and  rain,  of  heat  and  cold.  Stacked  upon  one  another,  such  boulders  are  scattered  haphazardly  across  the  southern  African  country  --  Zimbabwe  is  indeed  home  to  one  of  Africa's  most  breathtaking  landscapes.Living  here  amongst  the  boulders,  in  the  hills  of  Masvingo  province,  the  Zimbabwean  people  are  largely  Shona.  Sometimes  known  as  Bantu,  they  form  three  quarters  of  the  country's  population.Read  this:  Will  African  coins  rewrite  Australian  history?Shona  people  first  settled  in  the  region  more  than  1,000  years  ago  and  for  centuries  flourished  in  the  region's  lush  green  savannah  plains.  Central  to  their  prosperity  was  the  ancient  town  of  Great  Zimbabwe,  the  capital  of  a  booming  trading  empire  that  flourished  between  the  11th  and  15th  centuries,  extending  over  the  gold-rich  plateau  in  southern  Africa.Located  some  30  kilometers  from  the  modern  Zimbabwean  town  of  Masvingo,  the  stone  ruins  of  Great  Zimbabwe  are  today  one  of  the  continent's  most  impressive  monuments,  linking  the  present  with  the  past.A  UNESCO  World  Heritage  site  since  1986,  the  archeological  remains  contain  the  largest  ancient  structure  in  sub-Saharan  Africa.Read  this:  Dark  history  of  "slave  trade  ghost  town"According  to  UNESCO,  the  method  of  construction  in  Great  Zimbabwe  is  unique  in  the  continent's  architecture  and  although  there  are  cases  of  similar  work  elsewhere,  none  are  as  exceptional  and  imposing  as  here.The  first  thing  that  draws  the  visitor's  eye  is  the  high  level  of  craftmanship  that  went  into  the  construction  of  the  site.  Skillful  stonemasons  built  massive  dry-stone  walls,  incorporating  large  natural  boulders  into  some  of  the  structures.  Walls  extend  between  rocky  outcrops  and  massive  rocks,  forming  a  maze  of  narrow  passageways  and  the  enclosures.The  site  extends  over  about  800  hectares  and  it  can  be  divided  into  three  main  architectural  zones.  The  Hill  Complex  is  generally  considered  a  royal  site,  and  the  Valley  Ruins  are  a  series  of  living  spaces.  But  most  impressive  is  the  Great  Enclosure,  a  spectacular  circular  monument  made  of  cut  granite  blocks  that  was  entirely  built  in  curves.  Its  outer  wall  extends  some  250  meters  and  it  has  a  maximum  height  of  11  meters,  making  it  the  largest  single  pre-colonial  structure  in  Africa  south  of  the  Sahara.While  trade  kept  the  community  prosperous,  religious  life  was  also  rich  at  Great  Zimbabwe,  which  had  an  estimated  population  of  about  18,000  people  in  its  heyday.Read  this:  Rock  churches  'built  by  angels'Although  the  stone  city  was  largely  abandoned  around  the  1450s,  its  cultural  and  historical  significance  didn't  wane  with  the  passing  of  centuries.In  fact,  Great  Zimbabwe  became  such  an  important  part  of  the  national  identity  that  the  country  itself  was  named  for  this  ancient  city  --  "Zimbabwe"  derives  from  the  Shona  name  for  the  historic  town  --  meaning  "big  houses  of  stone."Click  through  the  gallery  above  to  take  our  tour  through  the  ruins  of  the  stone  kingdom  of  Great  Zimbabwe.READ  THIS:  African  roots  of  the  human  family  treeREAD  THIS:  Tribal  beauty  of  vanishing  life</TEXT></DOC>

The  theologically  loose  adaptation  fared  better  than  the  last  time  Crowe  went  gallivanting  around  in  a  tunic,  in  2010′s  Robin  Hood.  (That  period  epic  only  made  $36  million  in  its  first  weekend.)  However,  there  wasn't  exactly  a  rainbow  at  the  end  of  the  storm,  considering  audiences  gave  Noah  a  "C"  CinemaScore  rating.The  Divergent  Games:  City  of  Bones  —  er,  Divergent  --  couldn't  quite  muster  enough  YA  fandom  or  non-reader  interest  to  push  its  to-date  take  over  the  $100  million  mark.  The  fantasy  drama  sits  comfortably  in  a  distant  second  with  $26.5  million  for  the  weekend,  making  for  a  grand  total  of  $95.3  million.  With  a  reported  budget  of  $85  million,  this  certainly  isn't  a  dystopian  scenario  for  the  proposed  trilogy,  but  it  is  less  than  half  of  what  both  films  in  The  Hunger  Games  series  had  made  by  the  end  of  their  second  weekends.In  third  place,  Muppets  Most  Wanted  slipped  only  33  percent  from  its  opening  weekend  to  $11.4  million,  bringing  its  total  up  to  $33.2  million.  The  film  —  a  sequel  to  the  2011  reboot  of  the  beloved  Jim  Henson  characters  —  isn't  performing  quite  as  strongly  as  its  predecessor,  but  as  Kermit  knows,  it  ain't  easy  making  green.  The  other  family-friendly  film  on  offer,  DreamWorks  Animation's  Mr.  Peabody  and  Sherman,  followed  up  in  fourth  with  $9.5  million.Putting  Judeo-Christian-based  films  both  on  the  top  and  bottom  of  this  weekend's  Top  5,  the  pro-deity  tract  God's  Not  Dead  found  an  additional  $9.1  million  in  the  collection  plate  this  Sunday,  bringing  it  to  more  than  $22  million  all  together.  Ah-nold's  drug  bust  thriller  Sabotage,  on  the  other  hand,  seems  to  have  been  forsaken,  belly-flopping  into  seventh  place  with  only  $5.3  million  —  pretty  dismal  for  a  movie  with  so  much  supposed  star  power.Here's  the  Top  5:1)  Noah  --  $44  million2)  Divergent  -  $26.5  million3)  Muppets  Most  Wanted  --  $11.4  million4)  Mr.  Peabody  and  Sherman  -  $9.5  million5)  God's  Not  Dead  --  $9.1  millionSee  the  original  story  at  EW.com.CLICK  HERE  to  Try  2  RISK  FREE  issues  of  Entertainment  Weekly©  2011  Entertainment  Weekly  and  Time  Inc.

This  new  Titanium  line  will  include  four  frame  shapes  called  curve,  thin,  split  and  bold.  The  outside  of  the  Titanium  frames  is  gray,  but  there  are  four  options  for  subtle  accent  colors  inside  the  frames.  Google  is  also  adding  three  options  for  sunglasses  designed  by  Maui  Jim,  which  will  cost  $150  each.The  actual  Glass  hardware,  which  can  shoot  video  and  projects  Internet  content  such  as  e-mails,  walking  directions  and  sports  scores  onto  a  tiny  screen  above  the  wearer's  right  eye,  is  staying  the  same  for  now.  It  was  last  updated  in  October,  when  the  team  made  sure  the  design  was  modular  and  could  attach  to  the  right  side  of  the  Titanium  glass  frames.You  still  can't  quickly  pop  Google  Glass  off  one  frame  and  onto  another,  because  the  process  requires  undoing  a  small  screw.  While  the  task  is  easy  enough,  the  system  is  not  meant  for  frequent  frame  changes.  Google  is  betting  that  people  will  be  so  comfortable  wearing  Google  Glass  that  they  won't  have  to  choose  between  prescription  glasses  and  Google  Glass."We're  going  to  reach  some  day,  hopefully  it  will  be  soon,  where  people  will  wonder  'why  would  I  want  traditional  glasses?  They  don't  do  X,  Y  or  Z,'  "  said  Google  Glass  Product  Director  Steve  Lee.Fusing  Google  Glass  with  prescription  lenses  could  lead  to  its  own  set  of  problems,  however,  because  wearers  can't  take  them  off  without  limiting  their  vision,  and  the  Internet-enabled  glasses  aren't  welcome  everywhere.Earlier  this  month,  an  Ohio  man  was  questioned  by  local  and  federal  law  enforcement  for  wearing  his  Google  Glass  during  a  movie.  The  authorities  suspected  he  was  secretly  recording  the  film  until  he  explained  the  eyewear  was  turned  off  and  connected  to  a  pair  of  prescription  frames.  (He  had  purchased  the  custom  frames  for  $600  through  a  third  party.)Driving  while  wearing  Glass  is  also  a  thorny  issue  in  many  states,  including  California,  where  a  woman  was  ticketed  last  year  for  wearing  the  device  while  behind  the  wheel.  The  citation  was  dismissed  in  court,  but  since  many  people  need  their  prescription  glasses  to  drive,  there  could  be  an  uptick  in  the  number  of  motorists  sporting  Google  Glass.Google  is  confident  these  types  of  issues  will  be  resolved  as  Glass  becomes  more  common  place  and  people  learn  to  recognize  when  the  device  is  turned  on  or  off.  Currently  there  is  no  indicator  light  but  when  the  device  is  on,  other  people  can  see  a  faint  light  on  the  Glass  screen.The  company  hopes  venues  and  states  hostile  to  Glass  might  even  embrace  it  down  the  road.  For  example,  there's  a  Glass  app  called  Drive  Safe  Google  Glass  that  can  wake  drivers  up  if  it  detects  they  are  falling  asleep.  That  might  appeal  to  law  enforcement.  Theaters  could  embrace  the  technology  as  a  way  to  deliver  close  captioning  for  movies  to  certain  audience  members."I  think  you  need  to  give  the  technology  a  chance  to  breathe  and  evolve,"  said  Google  Glass  spokesperson  Chris  Dale.Prescription  glasses  can  be  pricey  without  insurance,  so  Google  has  struck  a  deal  with  vision  benefits  company  Vision  Service  Provider  to  add  coverage  for  wearers  of  the  new  specs.  Insurance  reimbursements  will  extend  only  to  the  frames  and  prescription  lenses  and  can't  be  used  toward  the  Glass  device  itself,  which  still  costs  $1,500.The  new  frames  were  designed  in-house  by  Google  employees  on  the  Glass  team,  despite  earlier  rumors  of  a  possible  partnership  with  hip  eyewear  retailer  Warby  Parker.  Going  forward,  the  company  does  hope  to  work  with  third-party  eyewear  companies  so  partners  can  create  their  own  Google  Glass  compatible  products.Even  with  the  regular-looking  new  frames,  someone  wearing  Google  Glass  still  stands  out.  In  the  future,  it  might  be  possible  to  shrink  the  hardware  down  so  that  it's  more  subtle,  but  Google  doesn't  necessarily  think  that's  what  all  users  will  want.  More  modular  designs  and  partnerships  with  third  parties  could  expand  the  options  so  that  a  Glass  wearer  could  decide  between  wearing  an  obvious  look  or  going  undetected."Sometimes  I  want  to  go  out  and  I  want  to  be  seen,  I  want  people  to  talk  to  me  about  Glass.  I've  actually  found  glass  to  be  the  most  social  experience  ever,"  said  Lee.  "But  other  times  I  just  want  to  go  about  my  business,  stay  low  key."Fighting  fires  with  the  help  of  Google  GlassGoogle  Glass  users  fight  privacy  fears</TEXT></DOC>

He  must  attend  24  anger  management  sessions,  perform  250  hours  of  community  service  and  pay  restitution  to  the  victim.Rubin  said  he  will  review  the  community  service  to  make  sure  he  is  getting  no  special  treatment.Photographer  Daniel  Ramos  told  the  judge  he  wanted  West  thrown  in  jail."I  was  only  doing  my  job,  and  he  broke  the  law,"  Ramos  said.  "I  believe  that  if  I  did  what  he  did  to  me,  I  would  have  been  put  behind  bars."The  incident  was  caught  on  camera,  leaving  West  with  the  prospect  of  a  tough  trial  and  the  possibility  of  jail  unless  he  accepted  a  plea  deal  from  prosecutors  that  included  probation.West  was  not  required  to  appear  in  court  since  the  charge  was  just  a  misdemeanor.The  video  recorded  the  following  exchange:"Kanye!  Kanye!  Talk  to  me,  Kanye!"  a  photographer  shouted  outside  of  a  Los  Angeles  International  Airport  terminal  on  the  night  of  July  19,  2013."Now  come  on,  Kanye,  I  don't  want  to  fight  with  you.""I  told  you,  don't  talk  to  me,  right.  You're  trying  to  get  me  in  trouble  so  I  step  off  and  have  to  pay  you  like  $250,000."West  is  then  seen  rushing  the  photographer  and  attempting  to  wrestle  his  camera  from  his  hands.  West  retreats  after  about  15  seconds  of  scuffling  with  the  photographer."I  simply  asked  him  a  question,  and  I  didn't  use  any  vulgar  language,"  Ramos  told  the  judge  Monday.  "In  fact,  I  gave  him  a  compliment  and  told  him  that  he  was  cool."Lawyer  Gloria  Allred  has  filed  a  civil  suit  against  West  on  behalf  of  the  photographer.Beverly  Hills  Police  investigated  an  incident  in  January  in  which  West  was  accused  of  assaulting  a  man  at  a  Beverly  Hills  chiropractor's  office.  West  avoided  criminal  charges  by  reaching  a  civil  settlement  with  the  man.Kim  and  Kanye's  wedding:  Save  the  dateBonnaroo  lineup  includes  Elton  John  and  Kanye  West</TEXT></DOC>

It's  their  own  face,  over  20  feet  tall,  rendered  on  a  giant  morphing  wall  at  the  entrance  to  Olympic  Park.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(Wired)  --  One  of  the  most  impressive  spectacles  visitors  have  found  at  the  Sochi  games  doesn't  have  anything  to  do  with  sports  at  all.  It's  their  own  face,  over  20  feet  tall,  rendered  on  a  giant  morphing  wall  at  the  entrance  to  Olympic  Park.Read  more:  'Brilliant  Cube'  lights  up  GangnamThe  Mt.  Rushmore-style  monument  is  "the  first  thing  you  see  when  you  go  in,"  says  Asif  Khan,  the  British  designer  who  conceived  of  the  pavilion  for  Megafon,  one  of  the  games'  sponsors.  Spectators  start  by  getting  their  likeness  captured  at  one  of  seven  photo  booths  throughout  the  park.A  five-camera  array  generates  a  3D  image  of  the  face,  which  is  then  processed  for  the  facade,  where  it's  rendered  with  11,000  pistons,  each  acting  as  its  own  LED-tipped  pixel.  (After  getting  their  picture  taken,  visitors  get  a  QR  code  to  scan  that  lets  them  know  when  to  expect  to  see  their  mug  go  big.)Kahn  worked  with  Basel-based  engineering  firm  iart  to  bring  the  idea  to  life.  Scott  Eaton,  a  digital  sculptor  whose  worked  with  animators  at  Lucasfilm  and  Pixar  and  contributed  to  films  including  "Captain  America"  and  "World  War  Z,"  was  brought  on  as  a  sort  of  creative  director  for  the  project,  creating  a  piece  of  software  that  situated  each  face  at  a  certain  angle.The  faces,  shown  three  at  a  time  and  cycled  through  every  20  seconds  or  so,  are  8  meters  tall  --  larger  than  the  face  on  the  Statue  of  Liberty.Read  more:  The  world's  most  incredible  offices:  Happier  staff,  more  money?For  Khan,  the  concept  perfectly  captured  the  spirit  of  the  Olympics.  "I  thought,  if  we  can  harness  that  latent  emotive  potential  in  the  face,  we  can  communicate  with  everyone  --  without  language,  without  any  text,  without  anything,"  he  explains.But  he  had  to  be  careful  about  what  he  was  communicating.  At  one  point,  Megafon  wanted  to  explore  the  idea  of  rendering  the  faces  in  true  color,  using  the  LEDs  to  recreate  spectators'  skin  tones."We  had  to  pull  that  back  a  bit,"  Khan  says.  "It  looked  like  a  giant  was  there.  I  mean,  it  was  really  scary."Still,  even  in  monochrome,  the  faces  are  a  striking  sight,  harkening  back  to  monumental  sculptures  of  antiquity.  If  you  want  to  put  a  more  contemporary  spin  on  the  installation,  you  could  think  of  it  as  a  Mt.  Rushmore  for  the  Selfie  Age."The  iconography  of  the  face  and  the  expressive  potential  behind  it  hasn't  been  surpassed,"  Khan  says.

"It  was  just  so  close  to  home.  It  really  makes  you  think  how  things  could  have  went."In  the  aftermath,  heroes  respondedAn  argument,  then  a  shotThe  shooting  happened  early  Monday  afternoon  at  the  Grove  16  theater,  just  before  an  afternoon  showing  of  "Lone  Survivor,"  a  film  about  a  Navy  SEAL  mission.Reeves  was  with  his  wife  and  sat  behind  Chad  Oulson,  43,  and  his  wife,  authorities  said.  Oulson  was  using  his  cell  phone  during  the  previews  before  the  film  and  Reeves  told  him  to  put  it  away,  according  to  police  and  witnesses.The  two  men  began  to  argue  and  Reeves  walked  out  of  the  auditorium.  Police  said  Reeves  was  going  to  complain  to  a  theater  employee.But  Pasco  County  Sheriff  Chris  Nocco  told  CNN  Tuesday  night  that  the  manager  was  busy  with  another  customer  and  Reeves  never  addressed  his  complaint  with  a  supervisor.When  Reeves  returned,  witnesses  and  authorities  said  that  Oulson  asked  him  if  he  had  gone  to  tell  on  him  for  texting.Police  said  Tuesday  that  Oulson  was  texting  his  young  daughter's  babysitter.Voices  were  raised.  Oulson  threw  a  bag  of  popcorn  at  Reeves,  police  said.  Then,  the  former  police  officer  took  out  a  .380  semi-automatic  handgun  and  shot  Oulson,  police  said.Opinion:  Texting  killing  tells  us  one  thingTheater  reopensThe  Grove  complex,  including  the  theater  where  the  shooting  took  place,  reopened  Wednesday.A  thin  crowd  trickled  in  to  see  "The  Wolf  of  Wall  Street,"  CNN  affiliate  WTSP  reports.  Complex  owner  Cobb  Theatres  hired  off-duty  Pasco  County  sheriff's  deputies  to  patrol  the  area  --  at  a  level  typical  for  a  Friday  or  Saturday  night,  the  station  said.A  theater  employee  told  WTSP  that  the  staff  had  actually  gone  through  a  training  session  the  day  of  the  shooting  to  help  prepare  them  for  an  emergency,  a  precaution  inspired  by  the  theater  massacre  in  Aurora,  Colorado,  that  occurred  in  the  summer  of  2012.Sheriff  Nocco  said  the  staff  did  an  "outstanding"  job  of  getting  everyone  out  of  the  theater  in  an  calm  and  orderly  way.Nocco  is  preparing  a  report  to  make  sure  all  the  department's  procedures  were  followed.Standing  his  ground?Reeves  made  his  first  court  appearance  Tuesday  on  a  charge  of  second-degree  murder.His  attorney,  Richard  Escobar,  tried  to  persuade  Circuit  Court  Judge  Lynn  Tepper  that  his  client  was  actually  the  victim  in  the  incident  and  that  Oulson  was  the  "aggressor."Police  said  despite  Reeves'  claim  that  he  was  in  fear  for  his  safety,  this  was  not  a  case  for  Florida's  "stand  your  ground"  defense."Working  with  the  state  attorney's  office  it  was  determined  that  stand-your-ground  does  not  fly  here  in  this  case,"  Nocco  said.Authorities  said  a  preliminary  investigation  determined  that  there  was  no  physical  contact  during  the  incident.  It  was  popcorn,  thrown  by  Oulson,  that  struck  Reeves.Tepper  said  there  was  no  evidence  to  support  the  claim  that  the  shooter  was  a  victim.  She  denied  him  bond.Is  this  'insanity'  or  'just  a  matter  of  time?'Outside  Reeves'  home  Wednesday  were  newly  hung  "No  trespassing"  signs.Who  was  the  texting  father?Chad  Oulson  was  a  former  U.S.  Navy  petty  officer,  serving  from  1990  to  1997,  according  to  spokeswoman  Lt.  Richlyn  Neal.Wednesday  morning,  a  woman  who  said  she  was  Oulson's  sister  answered  the  door  at  his  home  in  the  Tampa  suburb  of  Land  O'  Lakes.She  declined  to  give  her  name  but  told  a  CNN  reporter  and  producer  that  the  family  wasn't  going  to  make  a  public  statement  for  a  while,  and  that  they  were  struggling  with  their  grief  and  arranging  a  funeral  for  Oulson.She  did  say,  however,  that  Oulson  has  a  daughter  who  is  just  under  2  years  old.Though  the  garage  door  was  shut,  a  day  earlier  the  Tampa  Tribune  reported  that  a  reporter  saw  a  motocross  motorcycle  was  on  a  stand  next  to  a  gold  pickup  truck  and  a  child's  wagon."He  loved  his  job,  loved  his  family,  loved  motocross,  loved  the  motorcycle  world,"  friend  Joseph  Detrapani  told  the  newspaper.  "He  grew  up  riding  motocross  and  loved  to  keep  doing  it,  even  at  his  age  of  43,  he's  still  out  there  every  weekend  riding.""It  is  just  going  to  be  a  huge  hole  in  everybody's  lives  for  him  and  his  family.  He'd  give  you  the  shirt  off  his  back  if  he  needed  to,"  Joseph  Trapani  told  CNN  affiliate  WFTS.Read:  Victim  was  a  Navy  vetTheater  securityTheater  violence  is  nothing  new.  Less  than  two  years  ago,  an  Aurora,  Colorado,  cineplex  was  the  scene  of  a  shooting  massacre  that  left  12  people  dead.Theater  chains  had  already  moved  to  ban  handguns.  Cobb  Theatres,  which  owns  the  Grove  16  and  more  than  120  other  theaters,  says  posters  displaying  its  zero  weapons  policy  are  posted  on  its  front  doors.  Other  chains  have  also  stepped  up  safety  measures.Still,  is  that  enough?"The  question  is  going  to  become:  how  are  they  enforcing  them?  Is  a  sign  sufficient  to  give  notice  that  you  shall  not  bring  a  handgun  on  our  premises?"  CNN  legal  analyst  Danny  Cevallos  asked.There  are  theater  chains  that  take  it  a  step  further,  employing  security  guards  at  some  locations  to  keep  patrons  safe."If  somebody  were  to  bring  in  a  bag,  for  instance,  they're  immediately  going  to  spot  something  like  that  or  if  they're  acting  unusual  or  nervous  they  would  spot  something  like  this,  whereas  a  metal  detector  is  only  looking  at  one  thing,"  according  to  Howard  Levinson,  the  president  of  Expert  Security  Consulting.The  National  Association  of  Theatre  Owners  doesn't  comment  publicly  on  theater  security  matters,  but  says  "we  encourage  our  patrons  to  remember  that  they  are  sharing  a  common  wish  to  be  entertained  and  to  treat  their  fellow  moviegoers  with  courtesy  and  respect."Guns  in  theatersCNN's  Steve  Almasy,  Ashley  Fantz,  Martin  Savidge,  Devon  Sayers,  Kevin  Conlon,  Suzanne  Presto,  Tristan  Smith  and  Jennifer  Rizzo  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Deval  Patrick  signed  a  bill  Friday,  according  to  his  office,  making  photographing  or  recording  video  under  a  person's  clothing  --  think  down  a  blouse  or  up  a  skirt  --  a  misdemeanor."The  legislation  makes  the  secret  photographing,  videotaping,  or  electronically  surveiling  of  another  person's  sexual  or  other  intimate  parts,  whether  under  or  around  a  person's  clothing  or  when  a  reasonable  person  would  believe  that  the  person's  intimate  parts  would  not  be  visible  to  the  public,  a  crime,"  Patrick's  office  said  in  a  prepared  statement.The  crime  is  punishable  by  up  2½  years  in  jail  or  a  fine  of  up  to  $5,000.In  addition,  the  law  states  that  "whoever  videotapes  or  photographs,  with  the  intent  to  secretly  conduct  or  hide  such  activity,  the  sexual  or  other  intimate  parts  of  a  child"  faces  a  sentence  of  2½  to  5  years  and  up  to  a  $5,000  fine.  The  law  goes  into  effect  immediately.Victim  of  "upskirting"  speaks  outLawmakers  hastily  drew  up  and  passed  the  bill  Thursday,  a  day  after  the  state's  highest  court  ruled  that  current  laws  against  secretly  photographing  a  person  in  a  state  of  partial  nudity  don't  apply  to  these  sorts  of  secretive  shots."A  female  passenger  on  a  MBTA  (Massachusetts  Bay  Transportation  Authority)  trolley  who  is  wearing  a  skirt,  dress,  or  the  like  covering  these  parts  of  her  body  is  not  a  person  who  is  'partially  nude,'  no  matter  what  is  or  is  not  underneath  the  skirt  by  way  of  underwear  or  other  clothing,"  wrote  Justice  Margot  Botsford  of  the  state  Supreme  Judicial  Court.The  ruling  stemmed  from  a  case  against  Michael  Robertson,  32,  who  was  arrested  in  2010.  He  was  accused  of  using  his  cell  phone  to  take  pictures  and  record  video  up  the  skirts  and  dresses  of  women  riding  on  the  trolley,  court  documents  say.Complaints  were  filed  with  transit  police,  who  then  staged  "a  decoy  operation"  to  catch  Robertson.  He  promptly  pointed  his  phone  up  the  dress  of  a  female  officer,  court  documents  say.  He  was  arrested  and  charged  with  two  counts  of  attempting  to  secretly  photograph  a  person  in  a  state  of  partial  nudity.Though  a  lower  court  ruled  against  him,  Robertson  found  his  case  dismissed  Wednesday  --  and  outraged  lawmakers  got  to  work."We  are  sending  a  message  that  to  take  a  photo  or  video  of  a  woman  under  her  clothing  is  morally  reprehensible  and,  in  Massachusetts,  we  will  put  you  in  jail  for  doing  it,"  state  Senate  President  Therese  Murray  said  in  a  prepared  statement.  "We  will  need  to  revisit  this  law  again  and  again  as  technology  continues  to  evolve  and  ensure  that  we  are  providing  the  necessary  protections."Recognizing  how  technology  plays  a  part  in  amplifying  the  violation  is  key,  victim  advocates  say.  The  images  can,  in  no  time,  make  the  international  rounds  online."I  think  there's  a  fear  among  people  that  you  could  have  an  'upskirt'  photo  taken  of  you  and  never  realize  it,"  said  Emily  May,  executive  director  of  ihollaback.org,  a  website  that  encourages  women  to  share  their  stories  and  cell  phone  photos  of  harassers.

Plane  lands  at  wrong  airport</TITLE><TIME>Mon,  13  Jan  2014  17:28:41  EST</TIME><ABSTRACT>The  Southwest  pilots  who  landed  at  the  wrong  Missouri  airport  have  been  removed  from  flying  duty  pending  an  investigation,  an  airline  spokeswoman  says.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  A  day  after  a  Southwest  Airlines  jet  with  124  passengers  landed  at  the  wrong  airport,  many  are  asking:  How  in  the  world  could  that  happen?"It's  not  common,  but  it's  not  unheard  of,"  said  pilot  Mark  Weiss,  a  20-year  veteran  of  commercial  aviation  who  has  frequently  flown  Boeing  737-700s,  the  same  kind  of  aircraft  that  touched  down  Sunday  at  a  small  airport  in  Taney  County,  Missouri,  about  seven  miles  from  where  it  was  supposed  to  land  at  Branson  Airport.The  plane  stopped  about  500  feet  from  the  end  of  a  runway  at  M.  Graham  Clark  Downtown  Airport,  but  no  one  was  injured,  said  Chris  Berndt,  the  Western  Taney  County  Fire  District  fire  chief  and  emergency  management  director."There  are  a  lot  of  questions,  and  I  suspect  this  is  a  matter  of  procedures  not  being  followed,  something  along  the  long  chain  of  everything  you  must  do  and  constantly  do  as  a  pilot  for  safety,"  Weiss  said.But  that's  little  consolation  for  passengers  shaken  by  the  experience."Really  happy  (the)  pilot  applied  brakes  the  way  he  did,"  said  passenger  Scott  Schieffer.  "Who  knows  what  would  have  happened?"The  airport's  runway  is  3,738  feet  long,  about  half  the  length  of  the  Branson  Airport  runway,  which  is  7,140  feet.  That  forced  pilots  to  act  fast  and  brake  hard  when  the  aircraft  touched  down.If  they  had  not,  the  plane  could  have  overshot  the  end  of  the  runway,  tumbled  down  an  embankment  and  onto  U.S.  Highway  65.Air  traffic  controllers  had  cleared  the  jet  to  land  at  Branson  and  only  learned  of  the  mishap  when  the  pilots  radioed  that  they  had  landed  at  the  wrong  airport,  a  source  familiar  with  the  investigation  told  CNN.  Branson  is  not  equipped  with  radar,  and  Clark  has  no  control  tower.Southwest  said  the  flight's  captain  had  worked  for  the  airline  for  14  years  and  the  first  officer  had  been  with  the  company  for  12.  Both  were  on  paid  leave  pending  an  investigation,  it  said.The  jet  took  off  Monday  from  Clark  after  "a  thorough  inspection"  and  was  scheduled  to  resume  regular  service  in  the  evening.  The  airline  did  not  disclose  its  destination,  but  the  aviation  website  FlightAware  said  it  was  bound  for  Tulsa,  Oklahoma."We  have  since  reached  out  to  each  customer  directly  to  apologize,  refund  their  tickets  and  provide  future  travel  credit  as  a  gesture  of  goodwill  for  the  inconvenience,"  the  airline  said  in  a  written  statement.Apology  following  landing  announcementPassenger  Schieffer  told  CNN  the  flight  had  been  late  in  departing  Chicago's  Midway  International  Airport  on  Sunday  afternoon,  but  nothing  seemed  amiss.  As  the  plane  touched  down  on  the  runway,  however,  Schieffer  said  he  heard  and  felt  the  brakes  hit  hard  and  smelled  rubber  burning.It  was  "one  of  the  hardest  landings  I  ever  experienced,"  he  told  CNN.Kevin  Riley,  who  lives  near  the  airport,  said  he  was  sitting  in  his  living  room  when  he  heard  the  landing."I  thought  it  was  a  military  plane  because  it's  so  loud,"  he  said.  "This  airport  takes  small  planes  ...  nothing  to  the  level  or  volume  of  that  plane.""Welcome  to  Branson,"  the  pilot  announced,  Schieffer  recalled.  A  few  minutes  later,  the  pilot  came  back  on."I'm  sorry,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  we  have  landed  at  the  wrong  airport,"  he  said,  according  to  Schieffer.He  then  repeatedly  apologized  to  passengers  who  were  stuck  on  the  tarmac  for  two  hours  while  steps  could  be  brought  over  from  Branson  Airport  to  help  them  deplane.The  pilots  declined  to  talk  about  what  happened  as  they  left  the  plane,  Berndt  said.While  waiting,  Schieffer  and  the  other  passengers  ate  peanuts  provided  by  flight  attendants.  Southwest  offered  them  a  $200  travel  voucher,  he  said.Paper  and  computerSouthwest  spokesman  Brad  Hawkins  said  Sunday  night  he  didn't  yet  have  enough  information  to  say  why  the  plane  landed  at  the  wrong  location.CNN  first  learned  of  the  landing  error  via  tweets  from  the  region.There  are  many  questions  that  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  and  National  Transportation  Safety  Board  will  explore.  Both  agencies  have  launched  investigations.Weiss  gave  insight  into  what  investigators  will  be  looking  for  in  their  probes.When  the  plane  was  still  on  the  ground  at  Midway,  the  pilots  would  have  looked  at  a  paper  flight  plan  on  which  the  distance  between  their  departing  location  and  arriving  location  would  have  been  written.  That  distance  should  have  also  been  plugged  into  the  cockpit  computer."You  match  one  thing  to  the  other,"  he  said.  "Let's  say  there  was  503  miles  on  the  paper.  The  computer  in  the  console  should  have  matched  that  distance."That's  important  if  the  pilots  end  up  doing  what  is  called  an  instrument  landing  --  essentially  where  they  rely  on  their  instruments  to  assure  everything  is  as  it  should  be.  If  the  equipment  was  correct  on  the  ground  at  Midway,  the  instrument  reading  during  an  instrument  landing  would  have  indicated  to  the  pilots  they  were  descending  to  the  wrong  location.Relying  on  instruments  is  sometimes  the  only  alternative  pilots  have  when  the  weather  is  poor  or  there  are  other  factors  making  visual  landing  difficult.  When  the  plane  landed,  it  was  58  degrees  Fahrenheit  in  the  area,  with  visibility  for  10  miles  and  clear  skies.  It  was  a  bit  breezy  with  a  south  wind  of  about  20  mph.A  checklist  to  mindRegardless  of  particular  variables,  pilots  should  constantly  be  working  on  a  checklist  of  safety  measures.  "You  back  the  approach  (to  a  runway)  up  (consulting)  all  the  instrumentation  and  validation  that  you  have  available  to  you,"  Weiss  said.That  includes  scanning  the  horizon,  looking  up  and  down,  talking  to  air  traffic  controllers,  reading  instruments  and  communicating  frequently  with  a  copilot.Some  smaller  airports  don't  have  towers.  The  airport  where  the  Southwest  plane  landed  did  not,  but  it's  unclear  whether  air  traffic  controllers  were  in  touch  with  the  pilots.When  an  airplane  descends,  the  pilot  will  tell  the  controllers,  "I  have  the  runway  in  sight.""Once  a  pilot  says  that  then  the  responsibility  for  getting  that  aircraft  to  that  runway  isn't  a  joint  responsibility,"  Weiss  said.  "It's  the  responsibility  of  the  pilot."Pilot  Ken  Hiller  has  been  flying  into  both  Missouri  airports  for  a  decade.  He  said  a  navigational  tool  called  a  localizer  could  have  told  the  pilots  that  they  were  off.  The  airports  have  different  runway  numbers  that  would  have  popped  up  --  they  are  20  degrees  of  difference  between  them.  If  pilots  were  only  doing  a  visual  landing,  they  might  not  have  noticed  the  difference  in  numbers  in  a  navigation  tool.But  even  with  all  the  instruments  available  to  modern  pilots,  Mary  Schiavo,  former  inspector  general  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation  told  CNN  that  planes  landing  at  the  wrong  airport  aren't  unusual."A  visual  landing  on  side-by-side  airports,  not  far  apart  ...  that's  how  it  happens,"  she  said  Monday  on  CNN.  "It  happens  many  times."Similar  incidentsSunday  night's  incident  brought  to  mind  another  landing  at  a  wrong  airport  two  months  earlier.In  November,  a  mammoth  cargo  plane  landed  at  the  wrong  airport  in  Wichita,  Kansas  --  one  that  typically  does  not  accommodate  such  beasts  and  with  a  runway  half  a  mile  shorter  than  such  an  aircraft  usually  uses.The  Boeing  747  Dreamlifter  was  bound  for  McConnell  Air  Force  Base  from  New  York's  John  F.  Kennedy  International  Airport.  But  instead  of  landing  at  the  military  airport  on  Wichita's  southeast  side,  it  landed  at  the  much  smaller,  general  aviation  Col.  James  Jabara  Airport  on  the  northeast  side.  It  eventually  took  off.In  August  2012,  a  regional  commuter  plane  landed  at  the  wrong  West  Virginia  airport.United  Express  Flight  4049,  operated  by  Silver  Airways,  was  supposed  to  fly  from  Morgantown  to  Clarksburg  but  landed  instead  at  Fairmont  Municipal  Airport  about  10  miles  away.CNN's  Mike  M.

After  all,  many  millionaire  tech  execs  flaunt  their  party  lifestyle  like  a  badge  of  honor.But  on  this  Tuesday,  in  a  quiet  corner  of  an  Austin  hotel  lounge,  Stone  is  clear-eyed,  animated  and  apparently  hangover-free.For  the  first  time  in  years  he's  back  at  the  South  by  Southwest  Interactive  conference,  where  Twitter  first  and  famously  blew  up  in  2007.  Stone's  got  a  book  coming  out  next  month,  "Things  a  Little  Bird  Told  Me,"  which  he  describes  as  "packed  with  aspirational  lessons  that  were  learned  through  embarrassing  mistakes."And  he's  recently  launched  his  newest  venture,  a  mobile  tool  called  Jelly.  Part  social  app,  part  visual  search  engine,  Jelly  lets  users  mine  their  social  networks  for  answers  to  such  questions  as,  "What  kind  of  plant  is  this?"  or  "How  do  I  hook  up  this  TV?"Jelly  is  unusual  in  that  instead  of  computer  algorithms  like  Google's,  it  relies  on  human  knowledge  to  help  users  find  the  answers  they  seek.  And  each  question  must  be  accompanied  with  an  image,  creating  a  sort  of  visual  shorthand.  Users  can  even  draw  over  the  images  with  their  finger.Despite  its  lofty  pedigree  --  its  investors  include  Bono  and  Al  Gore  --  Jelly  has  baffled  some  tech  pundits  who  don't  understand  why  people  would  use  it  when  they  can  just  poll  their  friends  directly  through  Facebook  or  Twitter.  But  Stone,  who  also  helped  launch  Blogger,  remains  optimistic  that  Jelly  will  catch  on.The  serial  entrepreneur  sat  down  with  CNN  at  SXSW  for  a  chat  about  Jelly,  social  networking  and  why  seeing  Twitter  hashtags  sometimes  seems  "surreal."  Here's  a  condensed  version  of  our  conversation:On  bringing  Twitter  to  SXSW:"Twitter  exploded  here.  It  was  a  watershed  moment  for  Twitter,  and  it  was  an  eye-opening  moment  for  me.  So  for  the  most  part  after  that  year  I  never  came  back,  because  I  didn't  want  to  jinx  it."When  we  came  to  SXSW  in  2007  it  was  the  first  time  we  could  really  see  Twitter  being  used  in  the  wild.  There  was  a  concentration  of  people,  and  most  of  them  were  using  it.  And  I  saw  that  Twitter  was  far  more  powerful  than  I  realized."The  one  example  that  comes  to  mind  is  ...  there  was  this  guy  in  a  pub.  And  he  said  (on  Twitter),  'This  place  is  too  loud  for  us  to  talk.  Let's  go  to  this  other  place.'  And  he  named  it  in  his  tweet.  And  in  the  eight  minutes  it  took  him  to  walk  over  there,  it  had  filled  to  capacity  and  there  was  a  line  out  the  door.  Twitter  took  a  bunch  of  loose  individuals,  and  suddenly  they  became  one  organism,  like  a  flock  of  birds."And  I  couldn't  think  of  another  technology  that  allowed  human  beings  to  flock  in  real  time.  We  went  back  (to  San  Francisco),  and  a  few  days  later  we  formed  the  company."On  the  idea  behind  Jelly:"We've  become  the  most  connected  humanity  that's  ever  existed.  We're  now  connected  to  anyone  else  on  the  planet  within  four  degrees  of  separation  because  of  social  networks  and  mobile  phones.  It's  an  amazing  era  of  connectedness.  And  yet  not  a  lot  of  people  stop  to  think,  'Why?  What's  the  true  promise  of  a  connected  society?'"I've  been  asking  myself  that  question  ever  since  I  left  Twitter.  And  it  occurred  to  me  the  true  promise  of  a  connected  society  is  people  helping  one  other.  Or  at  least  it  should  be."So  Jelly  is  a  search  engine,  as  audacious  as  it  sounds.  Everyone  figures  we've  got  search  all  wrapped  up.  There's  the  Internet  --  it's  vast  and  growing,  and  we  can  search  it  in  a  fraction  of  second  to  find  anything  we  want.  But  the  Internet  is  only  the  Internet  ...  it's  only  a  collection  of  documents.  There's  way  more  to  life  than  the  Internet.  So  Jelly  is  like  a  search  engine  for  everything  else.  And  the  reason  it  works  is  that  we're  all  connected."People  talk  about  artificial  intelligence.  Well,  how  about  (human)  intelligence?  We  have  7  billion  people  on  this  planet."On  why  Jelly  requires  images:"We're  carrying  around  8-megapixel  cameras  (on  our  phones).  In  a  world  where  140  characters  is  considered  a  maximum  length,  a  photo  really  is  worth  1,000  words.  For  almost  any  question,  a  photo  can  deepen  the  context.  Also,  it  allows  you  to  type  less:  'Should  I  buy  a  Tesla?'  How  about  just,  'Should  I  buy  this  (with  a  picture  of  a  Tesla)?""A  lot  of  people  ask,  'Why  not  just  ask  my  social  network?'  But  what  Jelly  does  is  blend  Twitter  and  Facebook  together.  Jelly  gives  you  far  more  reach.  Your  friend's  wife's  lawyer  is  all  of  a  sudden  answering  your  question.On  how  people  have  been  using  Jelly:"Whenever  you  build  something,  the  creativity  in  humanity  comes  out.  I  love  it  when  I'm  seeing  answers  to  questions  where  people  are  only  drawing  on  the  photo.  They're  not  even  using  language.  Somebody  asked,  'How  do  you  do  a  screenshot  on  a  Mac?'  and  all  the  person  (answering)  did  was  circle  the  three  keys  you  touch.  It  was  wonderful."I  have  this  theory  that  if  something  isn't  fun  and  goofy,  then  you  won't  use  it  on  a  regular  basis.  And  then  you  won't  think  to  use  it  when  you  need  it.  The  same  thing  happened  with  Twitter."On  the  future  of  social  networking:"Social  networking  is  still  brand  new.  We're  still  figuring  it  out  --  how  much  we  should  share,  and  how  much  we  should  self-edit."But  I  think  the  bigger  thing  here  is  that  it's  growing  so  huge.  You  can  now  measure  the  number  of  people  on  planet  Earth  who  use  social  networking  ...  (as  a  large  percentage)  of  the  planet.  And  that  opens  up  intense  possibilities  of  cooperation  among  humankind."In  the  future,  what  do  I  think  will  happen?  I  think  we'll  be  able  to  accomplish  in  one  year  what  used  to  take  100  years.  Because  when  people  get  together  and  coordinate,  they  can  do  amazing  things.On  his  early  days  at  SXSW:"I  used  to  come  to  South  by  Southwest  in  the  early  2000s  every  year,  and  we'd  put  on  a  party  for  Blogger.  It  (SXSW)  always  falls  on  my  birthday.  So  I  used  to  pretend  it  was  my  birthday  party,  because  we  got  Google  money  to  throw  around  and  give  everyone  free  whiskey  and  beer.  And  we'd  give  out  Blogger  T-shirts,  which  of  course  had  a  B  logo,  like  for  Biz.  And  I'd  say,  'Welcome  to  my  birthday  party!  Free  whiskey  for  everyone!'  "On  the  success  of  Twitter,  which  he  left  in  2011:"It's  incredibly  weird  to  see,  everywhere  I  look,  the  little  birdie  that  I  drew.  Or  hashtags  on  my  favorite  TV  shows.  For  me  personally  ...  that's  surreal.  Most  importantly,  it  means  that  people  are  finding  value  in  the  service."And  that's  the  most  important  thing  you  can  do  in  this  world  before  you  die  --  to  build  something  of  value."</TEXT></DOC>

The  airline  and  a  source  familiar  with  the  investigation  told  CNN  Tuesday  that  a  Southwest  dispatcher  was  seated  in  the  flight  deck  jump  seat.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Washington  (CNN)  --  A  company  dispatcher  who  was  seated  in  the  cockpit  jump  seat  as  Southwest  Airlines  Flight  4013  landed  at  the  wrong  Missouri  airport  has  been  placed  on  paid  leave  pending  the  outcome  of  the  investigation,  the  company  told  CNN  on  Tuesday.Investigators  will  want  to  know  whether  the  dispatcher  distracted  the  pilot  as  the  Boeing  737  and  its  124  passengers  approached  the  airport,  a  source  familiar  with  the  investigation  told  CNN.The  pilots  of  Sunday's  flight,  which  departed  from  Chicago's  Midway  airport,  remain  on  paid  leave.The  dispatcher  will  give  investigators  another  source  of  information  and  open  up  another  line  of  questions  surrounding  the  landing  at  M.  Graham  Clark  Downtown  Airport  near  the  resort  community  of  Branson,  Missouri.An  industry  official  said  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration,  which  is  conducting  its  own  investigation,  has  reviewed  the  actions  of  air  traffic  controllers  at  Branson  Airport  and  "indicate  that  there  appears  to  be  no  controller  issue."The  Southwest  dispatcher  was  authorized  by  the  company  to  fly  in  the  jump  seat  --  which  is  a  fold-down  seat  in  the  cockpit.Related:  How  could  this  happen?Under  an  FAA  regulation  known  as  the  "sterile  cockpit"  rule,  pilots  must  restrict  all  conversations  to  flying-related  matters  when  planes  are  taking  off  and  landing.  The  rule  is  intended  to  keep  distractions  from  interfering  with  the  flight.The  FAA,  along  with  the  National  Transportation  Safety  Board  and  Southwest  remained  largely  silent  Tuesday  about  the  investigation.However,  the  pilots  have  been  given  routine  drug  and  alcohol  tests.  Results  of  the  tests  have  not  come  back,  said  NTSB  spokesman  Keith  Holloway.  The  NTSB  plans  to  interview  the  pilots  and  the  dispatcher  in  the  coming  days,  Holloway  said.Also,  the  NTSB  is  reviewing  the  airplane's  cockpit  voice  recorder  and  flight  data  recorder.  Preliminary  information  is  expected  to  be  released  when  it  becomes  available.Investigation  officials  acknowledged  that  the  737  had  returned  to  service,  suggesting  that  the  investigation  was  focused  on  human  factors  and  not  mechanical  malfunctions.An  NTSB  spokesman  said  officials  planned  to  interview  the  pilots,  but  it  was  unknown  if  interviews  had  been  scheduled.The  official  familiar  with  the  incident  said  it  was  certain  that  the  pilots  would  be  asked  if  the  third  person  in  the  cockpit  had  somehow  distracted  them.  A  review  of  cockpit  voice  recordings  may  also  answer  that  question.  Southwest  said  the  flight's  captain  had  worked  for  the  airline  for  14  years  and  the  first  officer  had  been  with  the  company  for  12.FAA  air  traffic  controllers  and  company  employees  are  sometimes  permitted  to  ride  in  cockpit  jump  seats  so  they  can  learn  about  life  "on  the  other  side  of  the  frequency,"  as  it's  sometimes  called.At  one  point,  after  a  government  investigation  disclosed  widespread  abuse  of  the  privilege  by  air  traffic  controllers,  the  FAA  halted  the  program.  But  it  was  resurrected  a  few  years  ago  under  tighter  controls.No  one  was  hurt  in  Sunday's  landing  on  the  airport's  relatively  short  runway.  But  it  was  memorable.  One  passenger  said  it  was  "one  of  the  hardest  landings  I  ever  experienced."The  plane  stopped  about  500  feet  from  the  end  of  a  runway,  said  Chris  Berndt,  the  Western  Taney  County  Fire  District  fire  chief  and  emergency  management  director.  If  the  plane  had  overshot  the  end  of  the  runway  it  could  have  tumbled  down  an  embankment  and  onto  U.S.  Highway  65.Southwest  said  Monday  it  has  reached  out  directly  to  apologize  to  each  passenger,  refund  their  tickets  and  provide  future  travel  credit.</TEXT></DOC>

But  far  fewer  treat  Americans  who  suffer  from  the  PTSD  that  comes  from  violence  in  their  neighborhoods.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Nightly  gunshots  wake  Veronica  Morris.When  the  community  organizer  walks  down  her  block  in  Chicago's  Englewood  neighborhood,  she  is  reminded  of  the  officer  who  was  shot  there.Violence  even  surrounded  her  high  school.  Shots  constantly  rang  out  around  the  streets  by  the  school  building.  Her  junior  year,  a  police  car  crashed  right  in  front  of  her  class."The  violence  is  something  we  deal  with  daily  and  it's  a  real  struggle,"  Morris  said.  "You  get  scared  and  youth  here  are  angry  when  their  friends  are  shot.  The  violence  really  does  something  to  a  person.""It's  sometimes  bigger  than  the  crime  itself,"  Morris  said.  "It  affects  you  more,  maybe  even  more  than  the  person  injured,  because  it  lingers."Studies  show  her  experience  is  shared  by  thousands  of  Americans  who  live  in  tough  urban  areas.A  growing  number  of  programs  treat  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  in  war  veterans.  But  far  fewer  treat  Americans  who  suffer  from  the  PTSD  that  comes  with  their  ZIP  code.  And  this  kind  of  PTSD  may  be  affecting  even  more  people.PTSD  can  directly  hurt  a  person's  brain  by  messing  with  the  amygdala  --  the  part  of  the  brain  that  triggers  a  chemical  to  release  to  help  you  decide  between  "fight  or  flight"  in  a  threatening  situation.If  someone  is  exposed  to  prolonged,  repetitive,  or  extreme  trauma,  the  amygdala  stays  in  alert  mode.  And  the  neurons,  the  pathways  to  this  part  of  the  brain,  lose  their  ability  to  recover.A  person's  memory  becomes  corrupted  like  a  bad  computer  hard  drive  and  it  can  hurt  a  person's  ability  to  separate  out  new  experiences  and  determine  whether  they  are  safe  or  dangerous.The  longer  a  person  stays  in  the  hyper-vigilant  mode,  the  greater  the  chance  of  permanent  damage.  In  a  child,  damage  can  be  magnified  and  lead  to  problems  like  dissociative  identity  disorder.Chicago  anti-violence  program  didn't  do  much,  audit  findsA  recent  study  that  ran  in  the  American  Journal  of  Orthopsychiatry  found  that  you  don't  even  need  a  direct  experience  of  a  violent  crime  to  be  hurt  by  it.  When  there  is  a  perception  that  there  is  disorder  in  a  particular  neighborhood,  it  causes  some  residents  to  suffer  from  PTSD.While  the  overall  rate  of  violent  crime  has  gone  down  in  the  United  States  --  so  much  that  some  sociologists  call  this  the  era  of  the  "Great  Crime  Decline"  --  there  are  still  pockets  where  violent  crime  is  so  concentrated  that  neighbors  can't  escape  it.After  interviewing  some  8,000  people  in  Atlanta,  Emory  University  professor  of  psychiatry  Dr.  Kerry  Ressler  and  his  colleagues  say  that  they  are  seeing  evidence  of  higher  rates  of  PTSD  in  this  urban  population  than  in  war  veterans."It's  outrageous.  This  is  --  well,  it  is  not  an  epidemic  of  violence,  that  is  not  the  right  term  for  this.  This  is  a  pandemic,"  Ressler  said.An  epidemic  is  concentrated  in  a  particular  region.  A  pandemic  is  spread  over  a  wider  geographic  area  and  impacts  a  much  larger  population."We  are  seeing  the  same  (high  instances  of  PTSD)  in  cities  like  D.C.  and  Chicago  and  L.A."In  surveying  patients  picked  at  random  from  Atlanta's  Grady  Memorial  Hospital  --  one  of  the  busiest  Level  1  trauma  centers  in  the  United  States  --  Ressler  and  his  team  found  that  at  least  half  knew  someone  who  had  been  murdered.  Some  two-thirds  said  they  had  been  victims  of  a  violent  assault.  A  third  had  been  sexually  assaulted.  This  wide  range  of  trauma  experience  meant  that  32%  of  this  population  suffered  PTSD  symptoms.In  continuing  these  surveys,  the  team  wants  a  better  scientific  understanding  about  the  lasting  consequences  of  living  in  violent  neighborhoods,  Ressler  said."We  find  you  don't  only  lose  a  generation  to  this  violence,"  in  terms  of  the  people  who  are  directly  hurt,  he  said.  Instead,  "you  are  losing  multiple  generations  (to  the  violence)  in  these  war-torn  inner  cities.""With  pandemic  levels  of  disorder  there  are  serious  consequences,"  Ressler  says.  The  violence  "makes  it  harder  for  kids  to  go  through  school  or  to  play  by  the  rules.  It  makes  it  harder  for  a  parent  to  get  a  job  or  avoid  addiction  to  drugs."Community  leaders  often  talk  about  education  being  key  to  lifting  people  from  poverty,  but  Ressler  believes  that  won't  be  enough."It  is  important  to  have  programs  like  Head  Start  to  help  begin  to  break  the  cycle  of  poverty  with  education,  but  if  we  are  not  doing  something  for  people's  mental  health,  we  may  not  be  able  to  change  this  cycle,"  Ressler  said.The  chances  that  young  men  who  experience  trauma  in  their  neighborhood  will  end  up  in  jail  are  astronomically  high,  studies  show.  Studies  have  also  shown  a  high  correlation  between  neighborhood  disorder  and  physical  abuse.  There  are  further  cognitive  consequences  as  well.A  study  by  Andrew  Papachristos,  a  Yale  sociology  professor,  found  that  some  neighborhoods  in  Chicago  have  seen  high  violent  crime  rates  for  decades.  Frequent  violence  has  dramatically  limited  academic  achievement  in  these  neighborhoods.  Exposure  to  violence  is  associated  with  cognitive  and  emotional  stress  that  can  lead  to  reductions  in  working  memory.Another  study  looking  at  local  violence  in  Chicago  found  that  children  who  lived  within  1,500  feet  of  a  homicide  had  lower  verbal  and  impulse  control  scores  a  week  after  the  incident  happened.  Tests  of  older  students  showed  similar  results.She  survived  a  standoff  with  a  gunman  --  could  you?This  concept  that  "deteriorated"  neighborhoods  have  an  impact  on  one's  mental  health  is  not  new.  At  least  70  years  ago,  Chicago  school  researchers  Robert  E.L.  Faris  and  H.  Warren  Dunham  went  through  30,000  psychiatric  hospital  admission  records.  They  found  high  rates  of  substance  abuse  and  even  schizophrenia  in  these  neighborhoods.  Later  studies  found  that  high  rates  of  depression  were  also  common.One  compounding  problem  is  that  there  is  an  overall  element  of  mistrust  in  rougher  neighborhoods,  studies  show.  People  feel  powerless  to  change  their  overall  circumstances;  therefore,  PTSD  --  which  carries  symptoms  of  hyper-vigilance,  social  separation  and  avoidance  --  may  amplify  that  mistrust.In  an  absence  of  a  national  public  policy  to  address  this  serious  problem,  there  are  a  handful  of  nonprofits  that  have  overcome  some  of  that  neighborhood  mistrust.  Cure  Violence,  one  of  those  nonprofits,  takes  a  public  health  approach  to  violence  prevention.Epidemiologist  Dr.  Gary  Slutkin  started  the  program  after  returning  from  Africa,  where  he  had  been  fighting  tuberculosis  and  AIDS  epidemics.  When  he  returned  to  Chicago,  he  saw  similar  patterns  in  outbreaks  of  violence  and  thought  an  epidemiological  approach  may  stop  it.Cure  Violence  concentrates  its  efforts  on  those  who  are  at  highest  risk  to  cause  violence.  Workers  living  in  the  tougher  Chicago  neighborhoods  listen  for  trouble.  When  they  hear  rumblings  about  a  fight  brewing,  they  intervene,  talk  to  involved  parties  and  try  to  mediate  the  problem  before  it  escalates  into  violence.They  also  work  with  at-risk  individuals  to  develop  a  plan  to  reject  violence,  whether  that  be  through  anger  management,  job  training  or  substance  abuse  programs."If  we  can  stop  the  violence  and  stop  people's  exposure  to  the  violence  early,  we  reduce  its  impact  from  spreading  through  the  community,"  said  Charlie  Ransford,  Cure  Violence  spokesman.Morris,  meanwhile,  is  turning  her  experience  growing  up  in  a  tough  neighborhood  into  motivation  to  organize  it.  She's  led  highly  visible  protests  to  raise  awareness  of  the  consequences  of  violence."I  always  believe  in  hope,  and  I  feel  as  an  organizer  that  we've  got  to  reinvest  in  these  communities  so  that  more  of  us  won't  have  to  continue  to  live  this  way,"  Morris  said.Mother  loses  both  sons  in  19  days  to  gun  violenceRessler  hopes  there  will  be  some  kind  of  public  policy  initiative  to  address  the  consequences  of  violence  before  it  is  too  late."By  having  a  lifetime  of  trauma  baggage  and  coming  from  multiple  generations  with  trauma  baggage,  this  is  hard  to  overcome  without  help,"  Ressler  said.  There  will  be  trouble,  he  said,  "if  we  don't  start  paying  attention  soon."More  from  the  series:  How  you  make  moral  judgmentsThis  is  your  brain  on  knitting</TEXT></DOC>

There  were  four  awkward  and  unplanned  encounters  in  six  months,  to  be  exact.So  while  most  social  apps  are  about  connecting  with  friends,  family  or  good-looking  strangers,  Moore  began  to  wonder  if  a  mobile  tool  could  use  the  same  readily  available  location  information  to  help  you  avoid  certain  people.That's  how  he  and  Chris  Baker  were  inspired  to  create  Cloak,  a  free  iPhone  app  that  pulls  in  location  check-ins  from  your  contacts'  Instagram  and  Foursquare  accounts.  It  maps  out  the  positions  of  people  you  know  based  on  their  most  recent  social  posts  so  you  can  give  them  the  slip.Cloak's  tagline  is  "Incognito  mode  for  real  life."  You  might  say  it's  an  anti-social  network.Click  on  a  bubble  on  the  map,  and  you'll  see  a  person's  name,  his  or  her  location  and  about  how  long  ago  he  or  she  checked  in  there.  If  it  was  a  while  ago,  the  image  will  appear  faded,  like  a  ghost."We  feel  like  we've  reached  the  point  of  social  fatigue  --  too  many  networks  with  too  much  information,  all  the  time,"  Baker  says.  "It's  OK  to  turn  off  and  pick  up  a  copy  of  'Walden'  and  just  be  alone."The  app  lets  people  set  up  push  alerts  for  acquaintances  they'd  prefer  to  avoid  such  as  exes,  frenemies  or  annoying  co-workers.  If  someone  wants  to  drop  off  the  grid  completely,  he  can  set  up  these  notifications  for  everyone  in  his  social  networks  --  presumably  while  sneaking  through  dark  alleys  or  hiding  behind  sunglasses  and  a  hat.The  app  only  works  with  Foursquare  and  Instagram  for  now,  so  it  has  limited  usefulness  if  your  friends  aren't  active  on  those  networks.  But  the  developers  hope  to  add  Facebook  soon.  They  say  Twitter's  location  information  is  still  weak,  but  they  may  add  that  service  as  well  someday.Dodging  friends  isn't  necessarily  an  anti-social  activity.  Baker  says  there  are  plenty  of  times  a  person  might  want  to  avoid  being  seen,  such  as  while  on  a  first  date  or  during  a  quick  run  to  the  grocery  store  in  pajamas.  Anyone  playing  hooky,  recovering  from  plastic  surgery  or  carrying  on  a  clandestine  relationship  might  also  find  the  app  useful.For  some  digital  users,  the  move  away  from  always-on  oversharing  is  a  natural  progression.  After  years  of  being  on  our  phones  24/7,  getting  constant  updates  from  our  social  networks  and  broadcasting  our  every  social  outing,  many  of  us  crave  a  break.  All  that  contact  online  can  leave  us  wanting  more  privacy  in  real  life."Twitter  and  Facebook  ...  are  like  giant  auditoriums  where  we  put  on  'public  performances.'  And  those  have  grown  exhausting.  That's  why  Snapchat  felt  so  refreshing,"  Moore  says.The  app  is  still  young,  but  Moore  says  users  have  already  found  creative,  social  ways  to  use  it.  Some  are  exploring  Instagram  images  by  using  the  map,  while  others  have  set  up  alerts  for  people  they  do  want  to  see.In  theory,  someone  could  use  the  app  purposefully  to  run  into  people  who'd  rather  be  ignored.  To  prevent  any  unwanted  abuse  of  your  location  information,  lock  down  your  privacy  settings  and  don't  share  your  whereabouts  unless  you're  comfortable  with  people  knowing  exactly  where  you  are."Social  has  had  its  moment  in  the  sun.  Now  people  are  beginning  to  revolt,"  Baker  says.</TEXT></DOC>

Today,  he's  talking  about  executive  orders  and  executive  actions  if  a  divided  Congress  won't  or  can't  act  on  his  agenda.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Waukesha,  Wisconsin  (CNN)  --  Once,  Barack  Obama  spoke  of  what  he  wanted  for  his  presidency  in  terms  of  healing  a  nation  divided.  "This  was  the  moment  when  the  rise  of  the  oceans  began  to  slow,  and  our  planet  began  to  heal,"  he  said.Today,  Obama  is  talking  about  executive  orders  and  executive  actions  --  with  a  pen  or  phone  --  if  a  divided  Congress  won't  or  can't  act  on  an  agenda  he  laid  out  this  week  in  his  State  of  the  Union  address.But  in  an  exclusive  interview  airing  Friday  on  CNN,  the  President  insists  he  has  not  recalibrated  his  ambitions."In  no  way  are  my  expectations  diminished  or  my  ambitions  diminished.  But  what  is  obviously  true  is  we've  got  a  divided  government  right  now,"  Obama  said."The  House  Republicans,  in  particular,  have  had  difficulty  rallying  around  any  agenda,  much  less  mine.  And  in  that  kind  of  environment,  what  I  don't  want  is  the  American  people  to  think  that  the  only  way  for  us  to  make  big  change  is  through  legislation.  We've  all  got  to  work  together  to  continue  to  provide  an  opportunity  for  the  next  generation."Just  days  after  his  address  to  the  nation,  where  he  blended  hopeful  calls  for  a  unified  approach  with  declarations  of  presidential  independence  through  executive  orders,  he  sounded  less  than  confident  that  Congress  would  come  around."I  think  there  are  some  issues  where  it's  going  to  be  tough  for  them  to  move  forward,  and  I  am  going  to  continue  to  reach  out  to  them  and  say  here  are  my  best  ideas,  I  want  to  hear  yours,"  the  President  said  during  the  interview  conducted  in  Waukesha,  Wisconsin."But,  as  I  said  in  the  State  of  the  Union,  I  can't  wait.  And  the  American  people,  more  importantly,  cannot  wait."Among  the  actions  the  President  has  taken  is  securing  commitments  from  some  of  the  nation's  largest  companies  for  a  plan  to  boost  hiring  of  the  long-term  unemployed."What  we  have  done  is  to  gather  together  300  companies,  just  to  start  with,  including,  some  of  the  top  50  companies  in  the  country,  companies  like  Wal-mart,  and  Apple,  Ford  and  others,  to  say  let's  establish  best  practices,"  Obama  said."Because  they've  been  unemployed  ...  so  long,  folks  are  looking  at  that  gap  in  the  resume  and  they're  weeding  them  out  before  these  folks  even  get  a  chance  for  an  interview."In  a  wide-ranging  interview  that  touched  on  everything  from  security  at  the  Winter  Olympics  to  the  legalization  of  pot,  here  is  what  else  the  President  had  to  say:'The  imperial  presidency?'Since  the  President  announced  12  areas  where  he  would  take  executive  actions  --  from  raising  the  minimum  wage  for  federal  workers  to  creating  a  "starter"  retirement  savings  account  --  that  would  bypass  Congress,  he  has  been  under  fire  from  a  number  of  Congressional  Republicans.Sen.  Ted  Cruz  described  the  actions  as  "the  imperial  presidency,"  and  House  Republicans  have  threatened  to  rein  in  the  President's  use  of  executive  actions."I  don't  think  that's  very  serious,"  Obama  said,  adding  that  every  president  engages  in  executive  actions.He  said  his  administration  has  been  disciplined,  taking  such  actions  sparingly."We  make  sure  we're  doing  it  within  the  authority  that  we  have  under  the  statute,"  Obama  said.  "But  I  am  not  going  to  make  an  apology  for  saying  that  if  I  can  help  middle  class  families  and  folks  who  are  working  hard  to  try  to  get  in  the  middle  class  do  a  little  bit  better,  then  I'm  going  to  do  it.""It's  a  tough  argument  for  the  other  side  to  make  that  not  only  are  they  willing  to  not  do  anything,  but  they  also  want  me  not  to  do  anything."And  that  he  said  would  only  make  the  low  opinion  Americans  have  of  Congress  even  lower.'Not  going  to  prejudge'The  one  area  where  Obama  says  he  believes  he  can  work  with  Republicans  is  on  the  subject  of  immigration  and  the  path  to  citizenship,  a  cornerstone  issue  for  Democrats.The  major  sticking  point  between  Democrats  and  Republicans  will  likely  be  whether  or  not  the  estimated  11  million  undocumented  workers  in  this  country  be  given  a  path  to  citizenship.  Obama  refused  to  say  whether  he  would  veto  a  bill  that  did  not  contain  such  a  provision;  it  is  likely  that  House  Republicans  would  not  pass  any  bill  that  included  a  path  to  citizenship."I'm  not  going  to  prejudge  what  gets  to  my  desk,"  he  said.On  Thursday,  House  Republicans  released  a  one-page  document  that  outlined  what  they  called  the  standards  of  immigration  reform,  which  calls  for  legal  status,  but  not  citizenship."I  think  the  principle  that  we  don't  want  two  classes  of  people  in  America  is  a  principle  that  a  lot  of  people  agree  with,  not  just  me  and  not  just  Democrats.  But  I  am  encouraged  by  what  Speaker  (John)  Boehner  has  said,"  Obama  said."...  I  genuinely  believe  that  Speaker  Boehner  and  a  number  of  House  Republicans,  folks  like  Paul  Ryan,  really  do  want  to  get  a  serious  immigration  reform  bill  done.  And  keep  in  mind  that  the  Senate  bill  and  the  legislation  that  I've  supported  already  calls  for  a  very  long  process  of  earning  citizenship.  You  had  to  pay  fines.  You  had  to  learn  English.  You  had  to  pay  back  taxes.  And  you  had  to  go  to  the  back  of  the  line.  And  at  the  end  of  that,  you  could  get  citizenship."The  marijuana  experimentWhen  it  was  pointed  out  that  the  President's  remarks  to  The  New  Yorker  magazine  about  marijuana  --  which  he  described  as  a  bad  habit  but  not  any  worse  for  a  person  than  alcohol  --  contradict  the  administration's  official  policy  on  marijuana,  Obama  stood  by  his  views.The  President  declined  to  say  whether  he  would  support  removing  marijuana  as  a  "Schedule  One"  narcotic,  a  classification  that  includes  heroin  and  ecstasy."I  stand  by  my  belief  based  on  the  scientific  evidence  that  marijuana  for  casual  users,  individual  users,  is  subject  to  abuse,  just  like  alcohol  is  and  should  be  treated  as  a  public  health  problem  and  challenge,"  he  said.Obama  said  his  main  concern  is  the  criminalization  of  marijuana  use."My  concern  is  when  you  end  up  having  very  heavy  criminal  penalties  for  individual  users  that  have  been  applied  unevenly  and,  in  some  cases,  with  a  racial  disparity,"  he  said."I  think  that  is  a  problem.  We're  going  to  see  what  happens  in  the  experiments  in  Colorado  and  Washington.  The  Department  of  Justice  under  Eric  Holder  has  said  that  we  are  going  to  continue  to  enforce  federal  laws."At  the  same  time,  the  President  said  the  federal  government  doesn't  have  the  resources  to  police  whether  somebody  is  "smoking  a  joint  on  the  corner."Rather,  he  said,  the  government  was  working  to  make  sure  that  drug  traffickers  and  the  spillover  of  violence  from  the  drug  trade  are  not  "creeping  out  of  this  experiment  that  is  taking  place."Obama  offered  what  he  described  as  a  "cautionary  note"  for  those  who  see  legalization  of  marijuana  as  a  panacea."I  think  they  have  to  ask  themselves  some  tough  questions,  too.  Because  if  we  start  having  a  situation  where  big  corporations  with  lots  of  resources  and  distribution  and  marketing  arms  are  suddenly  going  out  there,  peddling  marijuana,  then  the  levels  of  abuse  that  may  take  place  are  going  to  be  higher,"  he  said.'Win  back  confidence'Obama  did  not  suggest  that  he  was  disappointed  with  National  Intelligence  Director  James  Clapper  for  not  being  honest  in  his  testimony  before  Congress  last  year  about  the  mass  surveillance  programs  that  were  revealed  by  former  NSA  contractor  Edward  Snowden.Clapper  later  justified  his  untrue  answer  by  saying  it  was  the  "least  untruthful"  one  he  could  give.  "Least  untruthful"  was  not  exactly  a  term  Obama  used  on  the  campaign  trail.So  did  he  have  concerns  about  what  Clapper  said?"I  think  that  Jim  Clapper  himself  would  acknowledge,  and  has  acknowledged,  that  he  should  have  been  more  careful  about  how  he  responded,"  Obama  said."His  concern  was  that  he  had  a  classified  program  that  he  couldn't  talk  about,  and  he  was  in  an  open  hearing  in  which  he  was  asked,  he  was  prompted  to  disclose  a  program,  and  so  he  felt  he  was  caught  between  a  rock  and  a  hard  place."The  President  acknowledged  that  the  leaks,  including  details  about  the  wide-ranging  use  of  the  surveillance  programs,  damaged  the  confidence  of  Americans  as  well  as  other  nations."It's  going  to  take  some  time"  to  win  back  that  confidence,  he  said.  "It's  going  to  take  some  work,  partly  because  the  technology  has  just  moved  so  quickly  that  discussions  that  needed  to  be  had  didn't  happen  fast  enough."Russia  understands  'the  stakes  here'Neither  the  President,  his  wife  nor  his  daughters  will  be  attending  the  Winter  Olympics  in  Sochi,  Russia.Asked  what  he  would  tell  close  friends  who  asked  if  they  should  attend  amid  security  concerns,  he  said:  "I'd  tell  them  that  I  believe  Sochi  is  safe  and  that  there  are  always  some  risks  in  these  large  international  gatherings."Much  has  been  made  about  Russia's  ability  to  keep  the  athletes,  coaches  and  spectators  safe  in  a  region  where  terror  threats  are  very  real."The  Russian  authorities  understand  the  stakes  here.  They  understand  that  there  are  potential  threats  that  are  out  there,  and  we  are  coordinating  with  them,"  he  said."We've  looked  at  their  plans.  I  think  we  have  a  good  sense  of  the  security  that  they  are  putting  in  place  to  protect  not  only  the  athletes  themselves,  but  also  visitors  there."In  large  settings  like  the  Olympics,  there  is  always  some  risk,  Obama  said."I  don't  want  to  completely  discount  those.  But  as  we've  seen  here  in  the  United  States,  at  the  Boston  Marathon,  there  were  some  risks  if  you  have  lone  wolves  or  small  cells  of  folks  who  are  trying  to  do  some  damage,"  he  said.That  said,  the  President  encouraged  Americans  traveling  to  the  Olympics  to  register  with  the  U.S.  State  Department  and  read  the  material  posted  on  its  web  site  about  "prudent  measures"  people  should  take.'In  harms  way'During  his  State  of  the  Union  address,  the  President  brought  many  to  tears  with  a  tribute  to  Army  Sgt.  1st  Class  Cory  Remsburg,  a  veteran  who  was  on  his  10th  deployment  when  he  was  injured  by  a  roadside  bomb  in  Afghanistan.Remsburg,  who  is  now  disabled,  was  sitting  with  first  lady  Michelle  Obama  when  he  was  given  a  prolonged  standing  ovation.Obama  had  met  Remsburg  before  he  deployed,  before  he  was  wounded.As  commander-in-chief,  Obama  said  he  meets  what  he  describes  as  "amazing"  service  members  who  make  up  the  country's  all-volunteer  military."But  it  also  means  only  1%  of  the  American  people  are  in  harms  way,  and  their  families  are  the  ones  bearing  that  burden,"  Obama  said.  "Which  means  that  when  we  make  decisions  about  war,  it  is  that  much  more  important  for  lawmakers  and  the  president  to  understand  that  there  are  consequences  to  this."Jake  Tapper  reported  from  Waukesha,  Wisconsin;  and  Chelsea  J.

Daniel  Mathis  and  his  sister  Mersadies  Shelton  have  been  charged  with  grand  larceny  in  the  theft  of  Quick's  1999  Toyota  4Runner,  while  the  second  sister,  Shantai  Shelton,  was  picked  up  on  an  outstanding  warrant  from  Louisa  County,  east  of  Charlottesville,  where  Sunday  night's  armed  robbery  took  place,  she  said.The  18-year-old  Mathis  was  also  charged  with  robbery,  malicious  wounding  and  a  variety  of  weapons-related  charges  in  connection  with  the  Sunday  night  robbery,  but  no  details  of  that  holdup  were  released.  Mathis  and  his  sisters  were  being  held  without  bond  Wednesday  evening,  Geller  said.Quick  is  an  auxiliary  police  captain  in  Waynesboro,  west  of  Charlottesville.  He  was  last  seen  at  his  mother's  house  in  Afton  about  10:15  p.m.  Friday,  and  was  reported  missing  after  failing  to  show  up  for  a  brother's  birthday  party  Saturday  afternoon.After  that,  the  4Runner  was  captured  by  surveillance  cameras  at  automatic  teller  machines  twice.  The  first  time  was  in  the  town  of  Fork  Union,  about  50  miles  from  Afton,  on  Friday  night;  the  second  was  in  Manassas,  on  the  outskirts  of  Washington,  on  Saturday  night,  Geller  said.Each  time,  the  same  two  people  were  in  the  picture,  she  said.  The  4Runner  turned  up  parked  under  a  carport  in  Mineral,  more  than  30  miles  northeast  of  Fork  Union,  on  Monday.Investigators  combed  that  area  on  foot  Wednesday  in  hopes  of  finding  some  sign  of  Quick,  said  Sgt.  Brian  Edwards,  a  Waynesboro  police  spokesman.  But  that  search  ended  unsuccessfully,  Geller  said.Virginia  State  Police  say  they  suspect  foul  play  in  his  disappearance,  and  civic  leaders  have  put  up  $30,000  in  reward  money  for  information  that  helps  find  him."Capt.  Quick  is  a  very  outgoing  person,"  Edwards  said.  "He  had  a  lot  of  street  credibility.  He  automatically  commanded  respect."Fork  Union  is  one  of  two  towns  where  Quick's  silver  1999  Toyota  4Runner  has  been  spotted  since  he  was  last  seen.  The  other  was  a  sighting  later  in  Manassas,  near  Washington  --  nearly  100  miles  away.Police  have  linked  two  men  to  Quick's  SUV  and  released  a  photo  of  one  of  them:  The  man  wears  a  hooded  sweatshirt  that  covers  much  of  his  face.  Authorities  hope  the  public  can  help  them  track  him  down  for  questioning.Quick  had  planned  a  big  bash  Saturday  for  his  brother's  40th  birthday  --  hiring  a  DJ,  hanging  decorations  and  inviting  friends  and  relatives  to  join  in  the  fun.  But  the  host  never  showed,  prompting  his  family  to  start  searching  for  him."When  he  never  showed,  that  was  when  people  could  tell  there  was  something  really  wrong,"  Edwards  said.  "Family  was  really  important  to  him.  He  wouldn't  just  ditch  out  on  the  family."Quick's  family  is  deeply  rooted  in  Waynesboro,  a  city  of  about  21,000  residents  along  the  edge  of  the  Appalachian  Mountains,  and  has  strong  ties  to  its  police  department.  Kevin  Quick's  late  father  joined  Waynesboro  police's  reserve  arm  in  1983.  His  eldest  son  joined  him  in  1990,  ascending  the  ranks  over  the  subsequent  years.The  middle  brother,  Glenn,  is  an  officer  with  the  U.S.  Capitol  Police  in  Washington  and  has  joined  the  search  around  Fork  Union,  Edwards  said.Quick  worked  in  the  reserves  while  working  day  jobs,  including  the  past  15  years  as  a  production  coordinator  for  the  synthetic  fabrics  company  Invista.  He  was  laid  off  three  weeks  ago,  according  to  court  papers,  and  given  a  severance  package  in  what  Edwards  called  an  "amicable"  separation.The  severance  package  had  not  yet  been  accounted  for,  according  to  a  police  affidavit  filed  as  part  of  a  request  for  a  search  warrant.  The  application  asked  Quick's  bank  for  records  of  his  transactions  since  January  1.Quick  had  been  legally  separated  from  his  wife  since  2007,  but  their  divorce  was  not  final,  Edwards  said.  He  said  another  woman  gave  birth  to  Quick's  daughter  four  months  ago,  and  he  was  headed  to  their  home  in  Charlottesville  when  he  disappeared.He  had  been  living  with  his  mother  in  Afton  and  took  her  to  breakfast  on  Friday  --  the  last  time  his  credit  card  had  been  used,  Edwards  said.  He  spent  that  day  prepping  for  his  brother's  surprise  party,  then  texted  his  child's  mother  to  tell  her  he  was  on  the  way.  His  phone  has  been  turned  off  since  just  before  11  p.m.  Friday,  according  to  the  search  warrant  paperwork.When  the  party's  1  p.m.  Saturday  start  time  rolled  around  and  there  was  no  Kevin,  his  family  suspected  something  was  up.According  to  Edwards,  authorities  have  already  ruled  out  the  possibility  that  he  disappeared  of  his  own  accord.  He  was  not  involved  in  any  undercover  or  large-scale  operations:  His  duties  involved  administrative  issues  and  training,  Edwards  said.He  was  off-duty  at  the  time  and  had  no  known  adversaries  or  enemies,  but  his  status  as  a  police  officer  "does  bring  into  question  whether  or  not  he  could  have  been  targeted,"  the  spokesman  said.Authorities  have  "traced  every  possible  route  that  he  could  have  taken"  between  the  various  locations  as  part  of  extensive  air  and  ground  searches,  Geller  said.CNN's  Carma  Hassan  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

The  musical  icon  stirred  a  bit  of  a  ruckus  on  social  media  Sunday  night  after  he  appeared  in  a  Super  Bowl  commercial  for  Chrysler  while  another,  for  Chobani  yogurt,  featured  his  music.The  term  of  choice:  "sellout.""I'm  sorry.  Young  Bob  Dylan  would  vomit  in  the  mouth  of  old  Bob  Dylan  for  making  car  commercials,  especially  jingoistic  ones,"  said  one  Twitter  user.  The  Chrysler  ad  included  Dylan  asking,  "Is  there  anything  more  American  than  America?"Another  tweeted  "That  Bob  Dylan,  Chrysler  commercial  was  disappointing  and  sad  on  so  many  levels.  Proof  that  there  are  very  few  not  willing  to  sell  out."Could  this  be  the  same  artist  once  known  --  to  his  regret  --  as  "the  voice  of  a  generation"?  Oh  the  times,  they  are  a-changing.However,  it's  not  the  first  time  Dylan  has  linked  up  with  an  advertiser.Bleacher  Report:  Bob  Dylan's  Chrysler  Super  Bowl  ad  highlights  night  of  memorable  commercialsIn  2003  he  made  an  appearance  in  a  Victoria's  Secret  ad  which  used  his  song  "Love  Sick."  According  to  Rolling  Stone,  Dylan  previously  licensed  his  track  "Motherless  Children"  to  be  used  in  a  Jeep  ad.  That  brand  is  also  owned  by  Chrysler.There  was  also  the  2009  Pepsi  commercial  which  aired  during  the  Super  Bowl  which  mashed  up  Dylan's  image  and  music  with  Will.I.Am  of  the  Black  Eyed  Peas.Brian  Steinberg  of  Variety  points  out  that  instead  of  "selling  out"  Dylan  may  be  merely  doing  what  some  of  his  contemporaries  have  done  in  trying  to  remain  relevant  in  today's  music  industry."Put  bluntly,  with  radio  formats  so  narrow  and  music  videos  so  out  of  vogue,  musicians  often  have  a  tough  time  getting  their  work  heard,"  Steinberg  writes.  "For  Dylan,  an  artist  whose  time  in  the  spotlight  was  most  intense  in  the  1960s,  the  feat  is  more  difficult,  even  if  he  does  continue  to  release  albums  that  gain  plaudits  and  critical  acclaim."</TEXT></DOC>

Police  saw  Jeezy  walking  out  the  back  of  the  townhouse,  and  the  rapper  allegedly  said  the  townhouse  was  his  girlfriend's  home.The  Journal-Constitution  said  Jenkins  refused  to  show  his  identification  or  give  his  name  and  instead  cursed  at  officers,  who  then  arrested  him.All  this  comes  less  than  three  weeks  after  Jeezy,  36,  turned  himself  after  the  alleged  incident  with  his  teenage  son.His  son  told  police  the  ordeal  started  at  an  Atlanta  apartment  in  September  2012  after  he  sent  a  text  message  to  his  father.According  to  the  son,  Jeezy  "walked  into  the  bathroom  where  he  was  and  slammed  his  head  against  the  sliding  shower  door,"  then  "picked  him  up  and  threw  him  into  the  wall  in  the  bedroom,"  a  police  report  said.When  the  teen  tried  to  run  downstairs  and  away,  he  was  blocked  by  his  father's  bodyguard,  the  report  said.Jeezy  then  "pulled  him  back  into  the  room,  threw  him  on  the  bed,  choked  him  and  stated,  'I'll  kill  you,"  the  son  told  police.  He  allegedly  threw  him  against  a  wall  and  onto  the  floor  before  kicking  him  in  the  head."The  juvenile  stated  his  father  stated  to  him  'I'll  put  a  bullet  in  your  head  right  now,'"  the  report  said.The  boy's  mother  called  police  two  days  later  when  her  son  returned  to  her  and  she  noticed  bruising  and  scratches  on  his  face,  the  police  report  said.A  grand  jury  warrant  was  issued  for  the  rapper,  who  faces  charges  of  battery,  terroristic  threats  and  false  imprisonment.Jeezy  turned  himself  in  to  authorities  January  3  and  was  released  on  a  $45,000  bond,  the  Fulton  County  Sheriff's  Office  said.CNN's  Dave  Alsup  and  Jane  Caffrey  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Other  parts  of  Ukraine  and  the  new  government  leaders  want  to  align  with  Europe."We  are  now  deeply  concerned  by  reports  of  military  movements  taken  by  the  Russian  Federation  inside  of  Ukraine,"  Obama  said.  "Russia  has  a  historic  relationship  with  Ukraine,  including  cultural  and  economic  ties,  and  a  military  facility  in  Crimea,  but  any  violation  of  Ukraine's  sovereignty  and  territorial  integrity  would  be  deeply  destabilizing,  which  is  not  in  the  interest  of  Ukraine,  Russia,  or  Europe."It  would  represent  a  profound  interference  in  matters  that  must  be  determined  by  the  Ukrainian  people."He  said  Ukraine  must  be  autonomous."Throughout  this  crisis,  we  have  been  very  clear  about  one  fundamental  principle:  The  Ukrainian  people  deserve  the  opportunity  to  determine  their  own  future,"  he  said.Just  before  Obama  spoke,  the  U.S.  ambassador  to  the  United  Nations,  Samantha  Power,  called  for  an  "urgent  international"  mediation  mission  to  Crimea.Also,  a  bipartisan  group  of  12  senators  from  the  Foreign  Relations  Committee  expressed  support  for  U.S.  assistance  in  Ukraine  and  warned  of  Russian  intervention."We  do  not  seek  confrontation  with  President  Putin  and  his  government,  but  simply  to  ensure  that  Russia  abides  by  its  commitments  and  adheres  to  core  principles  of  international  law.

The  game's  fluttering  rise  to  the  top  has  been  a  viral  mystery.  Its  addictiveness  and  absurd  level  of  difficulty  have  driven  many  to  the  brink  of  madness  and  spawned  a  number  of  online  rants  and  hysterical  reviews.The  game's  concept  is  simple.  You  are  steering  a  bird,  a  wide-eyed,  8-bit  yellow  bird  with  no  tail  and  some  serious  navigational  issues.There  is  only  one  goal.  Tap  the  screen  to  make  Flappy  fly  and  navigate  it  safely  through  an  obstacle  course  of  metal  pipes.  Cruise  through  a  narrow  gap  between  pipes  to  get  a  single  point.  Touch  a  pipe,  however,  and  the  little  bird  dies  with  a  loud  smack,  nose-diving  from  the  pale  blue  sky  to  the  ground."Flappy  Bird"  seems  so  easy,  so  completely  inane  that  you  are  instantly  angered  by  how  difficult  it  is  to  keep  the  creature  alive.  Obviously  you  must  keep  playing  until  you  get  at  least  one  point.  Then,  intoxicated  by  your  hard-earned  victory,  you  continue  playing.It's  all  tappity  tap  tap,  death,  anger  and  repeat  until  you  notice  an  hour  has  passed,  and  you've  only  managed  to  get  a  high  score  of  3  points.  You  are  a  smart,  successful  human  with  a  college  degree  and  a  job,  and  you  can't  stop  steering  a  bird  through  a  little  virtual  maze  in  the  hopes  of  a  double-digit  score.Side  effects  of  playing  too  much  "Flappy  Bird"  include  soreness  of  the  tapping  finger,  anxiety,  guilt,  waves  of  anger  and  even  existential  crises."There  is  little  else  as  substantive  and  convincing  as  'Flappy  Bird'  that  the  smartphone  era  has  driven  us  to  the  cliff  of  insanity  when  it  comes  to  compulsive  behavior,  contracting  attention  spans,  and  a  desire  to  succeed  at  something  arbitrary  and  meaningless,"  says  CNET's  Nick  Statt  in  an  article  titled  "Flappy  Bird  is  the  embodiment  of  our  descent  into  madness."Over  at  Forbes,  Paul  Tassi  wonders,  "What  does  that  say  about  society  as  a  whole?  Have  we  reached  a  level  of  boredom  bordering  on  dangerous  if  we're  spending  our  time  en  masse  on  something  so  pointless?""Flappy  Bird  is  a  condition  of  the  universe,"  says  writer  and  game  designer  Ian  Bogost  in  a  2,800-word  article  for  The  Atlantic.  "A  condition  in  the  sense  of  a  circumstance,  but  also  in  the  sense  of  a  blight,  a  sickness,  a  stain  we  cannot  scrub  out  but  may  in  time  be  willing  to  accept.  A  stain  like  our  own  miserable,  tiny  existences  as  players,  which  we  nevertheless  believe  are  more  fundamental  than  the  existence  of  bird  flapping  games  or  machine  screws  or  the  cold  fog  rising  against  the  melting  snow  in  the  morning,"Wow.  So  much  angst  from  one  little  app."Flappy  Bird"  was  created  by  Dong  Nguyen,  a  Vietnamese  developer  with  a  studio  called  DotGears.  He  did  not  reply  to  a  request  for  an  interview  and  has  stayed  mostly  quiet  in  the  wake  of  the  game's  recent  and  sudden  success.Nguyen  did  give  an  interview  in  January  to  Chocolate  Lap  Apps,  saying  that  Western  mobile  games  are  unnecessarily  complicated  and  that  he  wanted  to  make  something  simple.Even  though  smartphones  have  elevated  mobile  gaming  with  rich  graphics  and  intricately  designed  apps,  the  platform  has  a  history  of  simple,  addictive  games  becoming  incredibly  popular.  Witness  "Bejeweled,"  "Candy  Crush"  and  even  the  early  iPhone  hit  "Paper  Toss."  "Flappy  Bird"  is  just  the  latest  in  a  string  of  smartphone  games  starring  avians,  though  it  makes  "Angry  Birds"  look  like  "World  of  Warcraft."One  of  the  great  mysteries  of  "Flappy  Bird"  is  why  it  suddenly  shot  to  the  top  of  the  most  downloaded  charts.  It  was  originally  released  for  the  iPhone  in  May  but  didn't  become  the  top  free  iPhone  app  until  mid-January,  following  a  surge  in  popularity  that  seems  to  have  kicked  off  in  early  December.Nguyen  told  Chocolate  Lab  Apps  he  created  the  game  in  two  to  three  days  and  says  he  did  not  promote  the  app  in  any  way  after  its  release.There  are  some  unproven  theories  floating  around  about  the  game's  sudden  success,  including  the  use  of  bots  to  get  it  on  Top  10  lists  artificially,  organic  enthusiasm  on  social  media  and  a  surge  in  amusing  user  reviews  in  the  Apple  App  and  Google  Play  stores.  "Flappy  Bird"  currently  has  an  average  four-star  rating  from  more  than  543,000  reviews  in  the  Apple  App  Store  and  228,000  on  Android.Many  of  the  reviews  are  lengthy,  tongue-in-cheek  tales  of  time  lost,  marriages  ended  and  lives  ruined  by  playing  the  game.  Android  users  report  wanting  to  destroy  their  phones  in  frustration  by  throwing  them  off  bridges,  tossing  them  into  the  blades  of  a  helicopter  or  running  over  them  with  18-wheel  Mack  trucks.Reviewers  curse  the  game  and  warn  others  not  to  follow  them  down  the  dark  hole  of  "Flappy  Bird.""My  family  called  an  exorcist  to  try  and  remove  this  devil  game  but  flappy  bird  had  already  firmly  gripped  my  soul,"  said  iOS  user  Ahhccwat."My  boss  fired  me.  My  kids  stopped  talking  to  me.  When  my  husband  would  text  me,  it  would  ruin  my  game.  I  blocked  his  number  and  rented  out  a  hotel  room.  I  am  still  in  this  hotel  room  today,"  reads  part  of  a  tragic  App  Store  tale  from  Bella102349.Meanwhile,  the  unlikely  success  of  "Flappy  Bird"  has  inspired  serious  analysis  from  developers  interested  in  replicating  its  inexplicable  hold  over  casual  gamers.  Is  it  the  bird?  The  high  difficulty  level?  The  temporary  respite  from  all  but  the  most  basic  brain  activity?"It  consumes  your  every  thought  process  and  desire.  You  know  you  can  do  better  so  you  keep  playing  and  keep  playing,"  says  Lyvia  Haley  in  an  Android  review.  She  gave  "Flappy  Bird"  five  stars  and  is  presumably  still  playing  it  right  now.</TEXT></DOC>

But  among  his  many  problems  on  the  right,  immigration  wasn't  one  of  them.On  that  May  afternoon  in  South  Carolina,  Romney,  his  sleeves  rolled  up  and  shirt  tucked  neatly  into  bluejeans,  came  prepared  to  answer  a  range  of  tough  questions.  He  delivered  a  defense  of  his  health  care  law  and  equivocated  on  a  controversial  Medicare  plan  being  debated  in  Congress.He  didn't  expect  to  have  to  talk  about  immigration,  But  one  activist  who  felt  like  a  party  crasher  in  the  small,  hand-picked  audience  wanted  to  know  if  Romney  backed  amnesty  for  "illegals."  Romney  said  no,  matter-of-factly  outlined  his  positions,  and  the  voter  departed  seeming  satisfied.The  point  is  this:  Even  if  immigration  fails  to  register  as  a  top  issue  in  the  polls  --  only  3%  of  Americans  called  it  the  country's  "most  important  problem"  in  a  recent  Gallup  survey  --  the  topic  continues  to  burn  white  hot  as  a  litmus  test  among  a  passionate  and  vocal  slice  of  the  GOP  primary  electorate.Opinion:  Big  surprise  ahead  on  immigrationEven  when  immigration  reform  is  not  on  the  calendar  in  Congress  --  and  it  wasn't  during  the  2012  campaign  --  it  routinely  bubbles  up  in  Republican  primary  campaigns,  popping  up  in  town  hall  meetings,  on  talk  radio  and  online.  And  it's  not  just  the  dreaded  "comprehensive"  immigration  reform  effort  that  roils  grassroots  activists;  for  a  defiant  portion  of  the  GOP  base  (looking  at  you,  Steve  King),  any  kind  of  reform  is  non-negotiable.Despite  efforts  by  top  Republicans  in  Washington  to  improve  the  party's  miserable  image  among  Hispanic  voters,  not  much  has  changed  since  the  2012  primary  campaign,  when  GOP  voters  tore  down  Texas  Gov.  Rick  Perry  for  telling  a  debate  audience  that  they  didn't  "have  a  heart"  if  they  opposed  in-state  college  tuition  for  young  illegal  immigrants.Undocumented  immigrant  lawyer  speaks  outA  sweeping  Senate  immigration  bill  is  stalled  in  the  House,  effectively  dead  and  nailed  into  its  coffin  by  its  own  Republican  co-sponsor,  Sen.  Marco  Rubio,  who  now  opposes  it.House  Speaker  John  Boehner  says  he  is  open  to  passing  a  series  of  smaller  fixes.  At  the  same  time,  numerous  elected  GOP  officials  made  intemperate  comments  about  Hispanic  immigrants.This  is  the  party  that  New  Jersey  Gov.  Chris  Christie,  who  will  ceremonially  sign  a  New  Jersey  version  of  the  DREAM  Act  this  week,  must  face  if  he  decides  to  seek  the  Republican  presidential  nomination  in  2016.  And  at  first  glance,  his  support  for  the  bill,  which  allows  undocumented  immigrants  who  have  attended  New  Jersey  high  schools  for  three  years  to  pay  in-state  college  tuition  rates,  is  problematic.Christie  reaches  immigration  deal  with  New  Jersey  DemocratsHaving  won  re-election  last  November  with  a  majority  of  Hispanic  voters,  Christie's  support  for  the  so-called  tuition  equality  bill  is  another  notch  in  his  belt  as  he  cultivates  an  image  as  a  Republican  who  can  appeal  to  independent  voters  and  nontraditional  constituencies.  He  is,  his  supporters  believe,  a  GOP  candidate  who  can  actually  win  a  national  election.But  in  the  hothouse  context  of  a  Republican  primary,  which  he  must  win  to  get  to  a  national  election,  signing  the  tuition  bill  seems  like  yet  another  example  of  Christie  unfurling  a  giant  middle  finger  to  the  very  voters  whose  support  he  will  need  once  the  presidential  race  begins  in  earnest  this  November.The  biggest  sin  conservatives  point  to  when  discussing  Christie  is  symbolic:  his  arm-in-arm  tour  of  the  New  Jersey  coastline  with  President  Obama  after  Hurricane  Sandy,  lending  the  president  a  veneer  of  bipartisan  street  cred  just  days  before  the  2012  presidential  election.There  are  other  apostasies:  Gun  control  measures  signed  in  Trenton,  a  gushing  buddy-buddy  appearance  with  Bill  Clinton  at  a  policy  conference  in  Chicago  last  summer,  and  his  spirited  defense  of  the  country's  surveillance  and  drone  efforts,  a  position  that  rankles  libertarians.Brandon  Patterson,  a  23-year-old  student  at  the  Pat  Roberston-founded  Regent  University  in  Virginia,  summed  up  the  prevailing  conservative  attitude  toward  Christie  at  last  summer's  Faith  and  Freedom  Coalition  conference  in  Washington."He  is  not  very  popular  here,"  Patterson  said.  "Nobody  is  excited  to  support  him  at  all.  Nobody  that  I  know  of.  He's  a  moderate."Talk  to  any  strategist  backing  his  potential  GOP  opponents,  and  you'll  hear  a  similar  take  on  Christie's  decision  to  sign  the  DREAM  Act:  Supporting  tuition  breaks  for  illegal  immigrants  burnishes  his  reputation  with  the  Amtrak  corridor  pundit  class,  but  it  cements  Christie's  status  as  persona  non  grata  at  the  Pizza  Ranches  of  western  Iowa  and  diners  of  New  Hampshire."This  amnesty  bill  is  just  another  in  a  really,  really  long  list  of  reasons  why  Republican  primary  voters  don't  trust  Christie,"  said  a  national  GOP  operative  working  for  a  likely  2016  rival.  "From  guns,  to  Sandy  spending,  to  hugging  Obama,  he'll  have  a  tough  time  winning  any  early  state  primaries.  Unless,  of  course,  'Morning  Joe'  holds  an  early  state  Republican  primary  that  I'm  unaware  of."But  there's  another  way  to  look  at  it:  The  conservatives  who  despise  Christie  for  signing  the  tuition  bill  probably  wouldn't  support  him  anyway.  They  might  not  like  him,  but  he  doesn't  need  them,  eitherLet  those  conservatives  flock  to  Ted  Cruz  and  Rand  Paul  and  Rick  Santorum.  The  silent  plurality  of  Republican  primary  voters  --  the  blue  hairs,  the  country  clubbers,  the  Rotarians  --  don't  garner  the  kind  of  media  attention  ginned  up  by  tea  party  groups  and  outspoken  pastors,  but  they  vote.After  all,  Mitt  Romney,  that  squishy  scion  of  the  hated  "establishment,"  lost  the  Iowa  caucuses  by  only  34  votes.  And  whatever  failings  Christie  may  have,  few  dispute  that  he  has  natural  political  talents  and  a  rapport  with  voters  that  Romney  never  had.Reid  says  Boehner  will  compromise  on  immigration  reformThe  dynamics  of  the  2012  race  were  different  than  they  will  be  in  2016;  a  fiscal  conservative  like  Wisconsin  Gov.  Scott  Walker  could  clog  Christie's  lane  in  the  business  community.  But  early  state  operatives  sympathetic  to  Christie  are  hopeful  that  there  will  be  even  more  space  in  2016  for  a  candidate  who  wants  the  party  to  expand  its  popular  appeal.Tim  Albrecht,  a  Republican  operative  in  Iowa  and  former  adviser  to  Gov.  Terry  Branstad,  pointed  out  that  the  Iowa  House  passed  a  version  of  the  DREAM  Act  way  back  in  2004.  (The  bill,  however,  did  not  become  law.)"Led  by  a  Republican  majority,  the  Iowa  House  unanimously  passed  the  Dream  Act  in  2004,"  Albrecht  said  in  an  e-mail.  "Iowa  has  been  ahead  of  the  curve  on  this  issue,  and  Republicans  value  fairness.  While  there  will  be  a  vocal  minority  speaking  out  against  immigration  reform,  a  majority  of  Republicans  and  caucus-goers  will  not  take  issue  with  Gov.  Christie's  position  on  the  DREAM  Act,  and  in  growing  circles  it  will  gain  him  support."And  for  those  without  long  memories,  one  only  needs  to  look  back  to  2008  to  find  a  Republican  candidate  who  bucked  the  party  faithful  on  a  range  of  issues,  including  immigration,  and  won  the  presidential  nomination.  John  McCain  ran  for  president  while  the  immigration  overhaul  he  backed  was  collapsing  in  Congress.His  campaign  fell  apart  in  the  process,  but  McCain  recovered  and  mounted  a  remarkable  comeback,  facing  questions  about  immigration  all  the  while.In  a  crowded  Republican  field,  he  even  won  South  Carolina,  that  conservative  bastion,  by  courting  the  party  establishment  and  cobbling  together  a  coalition  of  coastal  newcomers,  moderate  suburbanites  and  national  security  hawks  in  a  state  loaded  with  military  families  and  veterans.Ever  since  the  Barry  Goldwater  wipeout  of  1964,  no  Republican  candidate  has  won  the  Republican  nomination  without  having  at  least  one  foot  planted  firmly  on  the  establishment  side  of  the  party  divide.  This  is  the  bet  Christie  is  making,  so  don't  expect  him  to  back  away  from  signing  the  tuition  bill,  or  any  of  piece  of  legislation,  once  he  makes  his  barely  concealed  presidential  campaign  official.As  long  as  Christie  is  up  front  about  where  he  stands,  his  positions  may  not  hurt  him  as  much  as  the  right  claims,  said  Robert  Cahaly,  a  longtime  Republican  operative  in  South  Carolina."It's  running  over  a  political  speed  bump,  not  into  a  brick  wall,"  Cahaly  said  of  Christie's  support  for  the  tuition  bill.  "He's  got  to  do  what  he  thinks  is  right  and  not  apologize  for  it.  Sort  of  his  schtick.""Now  is  as  good  a  time  as  any  to  get  it  out  of  the  way,"  Cahaly  said.  "It's  kind  of  like  that  fight  you've  got  to  have  with  your  bother  over  that  lawnmower  he  wrecked.  Don't  put  it  off  all  summer.  It's  better  for  the  Thanksgiving  table.  South  Carolina  GOP  voters  have  forgiven  and  forgotten  much  more.  Ask  John  McCain."</TEXT></DOC>

We  are  experiencing  a  surge  in  demand  and  are  making  sure  that  we  will  be  ready  to  help  consumers  who  may  be  in  line  by  the  deadline  to  complete  enrollment  --  either  online  or  over  the  phone,"  said  Joanne  Peters,  a  spokeswoman  for  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services.Administration  officials  said  this  move,  similar  to  the  one  in  December  for  the  large  number  of  people  who  were  trying  to  sign  up  by  January  1,  will  accommodate  people  who  face  special  circumstances  or  complex  cases  and  need  extra  time  to  complete  their  enrollment.The  officials  said  those  who  fall  in  this  category  will  have  to  attest  to  their  circumstances  as  part  of  the  application  process.

In  an  answer  to  a  question  from  CNN  Senior  White  House  Correspondent  Jim  Acosta  on  Friday,  White  House  Press  Secretary  Jay  Carney  indicated  the  administration  would  allow  some  flexibility  for  those  who  encountered  problems  meeting  Monday's  deadline."As  was  the  case  for  the  December  deadline,  we're  going  to  want  to  make  sure  that  people  who  are  already  in  line  can  finish  their  enrollment,"  Carney  said.Insurance  industry  sources  did  not  want  to  comment  in  detail  until  they  knew  of  the  specifics  but  said  anytime  changes  are  made,  it  complicates  their  work  and  will  require  manual  workarounds  to  help  complete  applications.

He  "passed."</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Allyson  Hobbs  is  a  history  professor  at  Stanford  University.  Her  forthcoming  book,  "A  Chosen  Exile:  A  History  of  Racial  Passing  in  American  Life,"  will  be  published  in  the  fall.  This  is  the  first  piece  in  a  Black  History  Month  series  that  explores  African-American  identity.(CNN)  --  When  Harry  S.  Murphy  arrived  at  the  University  of  Mississippi  in  the  fall  of  1945,  he  was  nervous.  He  landed  at  Ole  Miss  by  way  of  the  Navy's  V-12  program,  a  wartime  measure  that  allowed  young  men  to  take  college  classes,  receive  naval  training  and  preparation  to  become  officers.Murphy  was  black,  but  university  officials  did  not  know  that.  He  had  a  white  complexion  and  wavy  brown  hair.  A  military  official  checked  the  "W"  box  for  white  when  Murphy  enlisted  in  the  Navy.This  official  unwittingly  set  Murphy  on  an  entirely  new  path.  Murphy  explained  that  he  had  no  intention  to  "pass,"  and  once  at  Ole  Miss  in  Oxford,  no  one  inquired  about  his  race."I  guess  they  just  assumed  I  was  white,"  Murphy  said.If  no  one  asked,  why  tell?Passing  --  the  choice  to  leave  behind  a  black  racial  identity  and  present  oneself  as  white  --  allowed  many  African-Americans  to  navigate  a  racist  society.  In  today's  multiracial  America,  the  decision  to  pass  may  seem  unnecessary  and  unwarranted.But  historically,  erasing  one's  black  identity  was  one  of  a  limited  number  of  avenues  available  to  light-skinned  African-Americans  to  secure  a  better  life  in  the  era  of  legalized  segregation.Those  who  passed  often  reaped  financial  rewards,  gained  social  privileges  and  enjoyed  the  fun  of  "getting  over"  by  playing  a  practical  joke  on  unsuspecting  whites  and  winning  a  clandestine  war  against  Jim  Crow  America.Murphy  settled  into  campus  life  with  ease.  He  was  accepted  as  "just  another  student."  He  wore  the  college's  colors  as  a  member  of  the  track  team,  made  close  friends  with  white  students,  danced  with  and  dated  white  women  and  ate  at  local  restaurants  without  incident.He  was  active  on  campus.  Described  by  one  classmate  as  "arrogant"  and  "a  loud  talker,"  he  even  participated  in  a  protest  against  Sen.  Theodore  Bilbo,  the  fanatical  segregationist,  when  he  spoke  at  Ole  Miss  while  Murphy  was  on  campus.When  the  military  ended  the  V-12  program,  Murphy  transferred  to  Morehouse  College  in  his  hometown  of  Atlanta.  University  officials  at  Ole  Miss  never  questioned  why  one  of  their  ostensibly  white  students  had  made  plans  to  attend  a  historically  black  college.Murphy's  white  skin  functioned  as  a  cloak  and  allowed  him  to  pass  as  white  at  the  University  of  Mississippi.  But  when  James  Meredith,  another  black  student,  attempted  to  integrate  Ole  Miss  in  1962,  it  ignited  widespread  riots  across  the  campus.Ole  Miss  prided  itself  on  114  years  as  a  lily-white  institution.  Murphy  observed  the  violent  resistance  to  integration  and  declared,  "they're  fighting  a  battle  they  don't  know  they  lost  years  ago."Once  at  Morehouse,  Murphy  returned  to  life  as  a  black  man.  He  later  entered  the  printing  business  and  moved  to  New  York.Harry  S.  Murphy  told  his  story  to  the  press  and  gave  readers  a  rare  and  intimate  look  at  the  lived  experience  of  passing.  But  he  was  not  the  only  African-American  enlisted  man  whose  military  records  identified  him  as  "white"  or  "Caucasian."This  type  of  temporary  passing  flourished  during  the  Jim  Crow  era.Murphy's  story  appears  to  be  one  of  levity  and  laughter,  of  exposing  the  absurdity  of  racial  categories,  and  poking  fun  at  erroneous  beliefs  in  racial  purity  and  white  supremacy.But  his  story  ends  in  tragedy.  Murphy  committed  suicide  at  63  in  New  York  in  1991.We  will  never  know  why  he  took  his  own  life.  There  is  no  evidence  to  link  Murphy's  death  to  any  conflict  that  he  may  have  had  about  his  racial  identity.  But  still,  his  suicide  leads  us  to  wonder  about  the  personal  and  psychological  losses,  in  addition  to  the  gains,  associated  with  passing.The  history  of  passing  offers  a  richer  understanding  of  lives  lived  along  the  color  line.  But  this  history  is  never  complete.It  remains  shadowy  and  blurred.Was  there  ever  a  time  people  assumed  you  were  something  that  you  were  not?

Here's  an  overview  of  what  has  been  happening  over  the  past  month.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Peace  talks,  a  gruesome  report  complete  with  images  detailing  alleged  torture,  and  frigid  temperatures  that  have  left  thousands  of  refugees  freezing  in  makeshift  camps  --  it  has  been  an  unsettling  and  uncertain  start  to  the  year  for  Syria.  To  help  make  sense  of  the  latest  developments,  CNN  has  put  together  an  overview  of  what  has  been  happening  over  the  past  month.A  smoking  gun?"Any  prosecutor  would  like  this  kind  of  evidence  --  the  photos  and  the  process.  This  is  direct  evidence  of  the  regime's  killing  machine."  So  says  one  of  the  authors  of  a  new  report  on  the  Syrian  regime,  revealed  exclusively  by  CNN,  which  was  put  together  by  a  team  of  war  crimes  prosecutors  and  forensic  experts.The  photos  in  the  report  allegedly  show  bodies  with  clear  signs  of  starvation,  brutal  beatings  and  strangulation,  among  other  forms  of  torture.  The  regime  of  Syrian  President  Bashar  al-Assad  has  consistently  denied  abusing  human  rights,  instead  blaming  rebels  for  any  wrongdoing.  But  human  rights  organizations,  including  Amnesty  International,  say  the  images  in  the  report  are  in  keeping  with  their  own  findings."The  allegations  are  consistent  with  aspects  of  Amnesty  International's  own  research  into  torture  and  enforced  disappearance  by  the  Syrian  government  and  must  be  taken  seriously,"  Philip  Luther,  Amnesty's  Middle  East  and  North  Africa  director,  said  Tuesday."The  Geneva  II  peace  conference  must  treat  this  as  an  absolute  priority."Gruesome  Syria  photos  may  prove  torture  by  Assad  regimePeace  conference  --  Part  2The  peace  conference  Luther  is  referring  to  is  the  latest  international  effort  aimed  at  ending  Syria's  civil  war.  Scheduled  to  start  Wednesday  in  Switzerland,  the  talks  are  to  be  attended  by  the  five  permanent  members  of  the  U.N.  Security  Council  --  Britain,  China,  France,  Russia  and  the  United  States  --  Syria's  main  opposition  Syrian  National  Coalition,  and  more  than  two  dozen  other  countries.  A  preliminary  international  session  is  scheduled  for  Wednesday  in  Montreux,  with  talks  between  the  Syrian  government  and  opposition  delegations  slated  to  begin  Friday  in  Geneva.  The  talks,  which  follow  on  an  "action  group"  meeting  held  in  June  2012,  will  mark  the  first  time  that  opposition  representatives  will  have  been  in  face-to-face  talks  with  the  Assad  regime  since  the  conflict  erupted  in  March  2011.Russia  criticizes  rescinding  of  Iran's  invitationIran  is  invited.  No  it  isn'tTehran  looked  like  it  might  also  be  joining  the  talks  after  the  United  Nations  issued  a  surprise  invitation  Sunday.  However,  the  move  sparked  outrage  and  threats  to  boycott  the  talks  from  Syria's  opposition.  The  United  States  weighed  in  against  Iran  taking  part,  and  U.N.  Secretary  General  Ban  Ki-moon  announced  Monday  that  the  invitation  had  been  rescinded  (although  Iran  had  already  announced  it  would  not  be  attending  because  it  refused  to  accept  any  preconditions  for  joining  the  talks.)  Russia,  for  its  part,  criticized  Ban's  reversal,  but  said  the  decision  was  "not  a  catastrophe."Frigid  temperaturesWith  2.4  million  registered  refugees  requiring  shelter,  the  enormity  of  the  humanitarian  crisis  was  already  abundantly  clear.  But  frigid  temperatures  have  left  makeshift  camps  and  host  nations  stretched  thin  as  they  try  to  cope  with  an  influx  of  refugees  from  a  conflict  that  has  already  claimed  more  than  100,000  lives.For  more  on  Syria's  refugees  and  how  to  help,  visit  Impact  Your  WorldLebanon  alone  is  host  to  around  1  million  refugees,  a  number  the  United  Nations  has  predicted  could  swell  to  1.5  million  by  the  end  of  this  year.  "Syrian  refugees  in  Lebanon's  Bekaa  Valley  thought  life  couldn't  get  much  harsher.  But  that  was  before  winter  storm  'Alexa'  moved  in,"  CNN's  Mohammed  Jamjoom  reported  last  month.  "The  rain  and  snow  have  since  made  things  even  more  miserable."Within  Syria,  with  nighttime  temperatures  hovering  close  to  freezing,  the  struggles  of  refugees  are  being  compounded  by  an  inability  to  get  aid  to  those  who  most  need  it.  Indeed,  only  last  week,  the  United  Nations  warned  that  repeated  obstruction  of  aid  convoys  to  a  Palestinian  camp  just  outside  Damascus  could  be  a  war  crime."The  extent  of  malnutrition,  and  the  numbers  who  have  died  directly  or  indirectly  because  of  it,  are  not  known  for  sure,"  U.N.  High  Commissioner  for  Human  Rights  Navi  Pillay  said.  "But  it  is  crystal  clear  that  the  situation  in  Yarmouk  is  now  extremely  desperate,  and  that  civilians  are  dying  as  a  result.  Government  forces  and  affiliated  militias  appear  to  be  imposing  collective  punishment  on  the  civilians  in  Yarmouk."</TEXT></DOC>

If  you  do,  how  do  you  avoid  tantrums?  We  explore  the  etiquette  of  kids  at  weddings.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Some  people  wouldn't  dream  of  getting  married  without  family  and  friends  of  all  ages  assembled  around  them.  Others  envision  a  more  adult-oriented  and  elegant  affair.Whatever  you  decide,  these  etiquette  guidelines  from  the  editors  of  Martha  Stewart  Weddings  will  help  you  anticipate  and  politely  maneuver  any  potential  pitfalls  and  ensure  a  festive  (and  tantrum-free)  event  for  all.Decide  EarlyUnlike  decisions  about  menus  or  music,  those  related  to  children  should  be  handled  quickly  to  avoid  awkward  questions  from  parents  who  need  to  make  plans.Is  It  Appropriate  to  Not  Invite  Children?Yes  --  especially  if  the  wedding  is  in  the  evening  or  is  very  formal.  "It  may  be  more  of  a  challenge  to  restrict  children  during  a  daytime  or  casual  wedding  without  people  feeling  offended,"  says  Joyce  Scardina  Becker,  a  San  Francisco-based  wedding  designer  and  planner  who  teaches  wedding  and  event  etiquette  at  California  State  University,  East  Bay.The  no-kids  rule  works  best  when  the  majority  of  the  families  are  local,  which  means  parents  can  leave  their  children  with  familiar  babysitters  for  the  entire  day  or  drop  them  off  between  the  ceremony  and  reception,  adds  Karen  Kaforey,  a  wedding  planner  in  Nashville.  If  you're  hosting  a  destination  wedding,  it's  harder  to  not  invite  kids.Martha  Stewart  Living:  The  New  Bridal  Shower  Rules  (Toilet  Paper  Dresses  and  Awkward  Icebreakers  Not  Included!)Address  Invitation  ExplicitlyAddress  your  envelopes  properly.  Becker  says  the  traditional  way  to  indicate  whether  a  child  is  invited  is  to  include  his  name  on  the  invitation.  If  your  card  will  have  both  an  outer  and  inner  envelope,  his  parents'  names  should  appear  on  the  outer  envelope,  but  on  the  inner,  his  name  should  be  written  beneath  his  parents'  names.  (If  you're  using  just  an  outer  envelope,  of  course,  the  child's  name  should  also  be  on  it.)  If  the  child  is  over  age  18,  he  should  receive  a  separate  invitation,  even  if  he's  still  living  at  home.  Becker  feels  that  it's  "generally  not  in  good  taste  to  address  an  envelope  to  'Mr.  and  Mrs.  Jonathan  Smith  and  Family,'"  since  the  wording  can  be  vague.  However,  Kaforey  says  the  phrasing's  okay  as  long  as  you  write  the  names  of  those  invited  on  the  inside  envelope.Call  All  Guests  with  ChildrenAfter  your  invitation  is  sent  (or  better  yet,  before),  make  a  call  to  your  friends  and  family  who  have  children  to  explain  that  your  wedding  is  or  isn't  child-friendly.  "If  you're  willing  to  invite  this  person  to  your  wedding,  you  should  be  willing  to  pick  up  the  phone  and  have  a  conversation  with  her,"  Becker  says.  This  is  an  especially  effective  approach  if  you're  worried  about  a  stubborn  friend  or  flaky  relative  bringing  her  children  against  your  wishes.  Becker  adds:  "And,  if  you're  arranging  for  childcare  services,  a  telephone  call  is  a  great  way  to  let  the  parents  know  that  their  children  will  be  well  taken  care  of  at  the  wedding."Martha  Stewart  Living:  7  Old-School  Wedding  Rules  You  Can  BreakWill  It  Look  Bad  if  You  Invite  Some  Children  and  Not  Others?Opinions  vary,  so  it's  best  to  choose  a  clear  rule  and  stick  to  it.  Kaforey  suggests  drawing  the  line  at  immediate  family,  since  most  children  who  have  wedding  duties  are  close  relatives,  such  as  a  niece  or  stepchild  (but  even  these  children  don't  necessarily  need  to  stay  for  the  reception)."If  there  are  just  a  few  children  from  different  families,  an  age  cut-off  can  work  because  these  older  kids  are  more  likely  to  behave,"  says  Becker,  adding  that  children's  manners  are  as  important  as  their  numbers.  "But  the  more  youngsters  you  have,  the  more  their  behavior  will  change.  If  you're  inviting  150  guests,  and  you  have  only  two  little  girls  that  are  10  and  6,  it's  darling,"  she  says.  "But  if  you  have  20  children  that  are  10  and  older,  you  could  end  up  with  a  playing  field  --  and  that  might  not  be  ideal."Choosing  the  Ring  Bearer  and  Flower  GirlYour  sibling's  children,  obviously,  should  take  priority  over,  say,  a  friend's,  but  if  this  rule  of  thumb  still  leaves  you  in  a  fix,  consider  traditional  etiquette,  which  limits  your  choices  for  flower  girls  and  ring  bearers  to  children  between  3  and  7  years  old.  "Younger  children  simply  don't  make  it  to  the  end  of  the  aisle"  without  some  adult  intervention,  says  Becker.She  adds  that  an  8-year-old  can  be  promoted  to  junior  bridesmaid,  a  title  she  can  hold  until  her  18th  birthday,  when  she's  finally  allowed  to  lose  the  "junior"  label.  "On  the  other  hand,  boys  are  usually  retired  from  the  wedding  business  from  age  8  until  they're  old  enough  to  be  a  groomsman,  at  18,"  she  says.  Of  course,  there  are  exceptions  to  every  rule.  Kaforey  once  planned  a  wedding  in  which  a  toddler  was  pulled  down  the  aisle  in  a  wagon  by  a  little  girl.  "It  was  adorable,"  she  says.Martha  Stewart  Living:  Common  Wedding  Traditions  and  Superstitions  You've  Never  Heard  BeforeAre  There  Other  Duties  for  Children?At  the  ceremony,  children  can  act  as  ushers,  hand  out  programs,  circulate  mass  books  or  yarmulkes,  or  distribute  packets  of  rice  or  rose  petals.  At  the  reception,  kids  can  manage  a  guest  book  or  pass  out  favors  in  a  basket  or  on  a  tray.  Becker  has  also  seen  children  (well  rehearsed,  of  course)  perform  a  group  reading  and  young  boys  act  as  "train  bearers."  Just  be  sure  to  match  the  job  to  the  kid's  personality;  if  a  child  is  introverted  and  prone  to  hiding  behind  his  mom's  skirt,  then  he  most  likely  isn't  going  to  love  giving  a  public  performance,  no  matter  how  talented  he  is.Not  Inviting  the  Ring  Bearer  and  Flower  Girl  to  the  ReceptionThere's  no  rule  that  says  you  must,  but  think  of  the  bad  feelings  you'd  engender  if  you  didn't  invite  them.  It's  not  an  easy  task,  both  emotionally  and  logistically,  for  parents  to  dress  up  kids  in  fancy  clothes,  prod  them  to  do  their  given  jobs,  then  tell  them  they  have  to  miss  the  party.  The  thoughtful  thing  to  do  is  to  invite  them  to  the  reception.  If  you're  really  intent  on  having  a  purely  adult  reception,  at  the  very  least  allow  the  flower  girl  and  ring  bearer  to  attend  the  cocktail  hour  and  offer  to  find  them  babysitters  for  the  rest  of  the  night.Martha  Stewart  Living:  21  Gorgeous  Engagement  Rings  of  Real  BridesDo  Kids  Need  a  Special  Menu?When  it  comes  to  food,  children's  meals  make  kids  happier  and  are  often  less  expensive.  Becker  suggests  a  small  buffet  or  individual  meals  with  kid-friendly  foods  like  spaghetti,  chicken  fingers,  and  fruit  cups.  Kaforey  adds  that  children  13  and  up  should  be  able  to  eat  adult  fare,  though  you  may  want  to  ask  parents  about  this  ahead  of  time.Where  Should  the  Kids  Sit?Donnie  Brown,  a  Dallas-based  celebrity-wedding  planner  and  author  of  "Donnie  Brown  Weddings:  From  the  Couture  to  the  Cake"  (2009,  Abrams)  recommends  seating  kids  aged  7  to  14  at  a  separate  table,  if  you'd  like,  but  he  suggests  seating  those  under  7  in  another  room  entirely,  with  childcare  provided;  children  this  young,  he  says,  will  likely  want  to  be  near  their  parents  and  won't  sit  still  for  long  if  Mom  and  Dad  are  within  eyesight  and  earshot.If  you'd  like  children  to  be  in  the  same  room  as  adults,  Kaforey  suggests  designating  an  area  off  to  the  side  that  both  feeds  kids  and  keeps  them  busy.  She  likes  mini-tables,  small  buffets,  and  kid-friendly  decor,  like  tables  peppered  with  coloring  books  and  crayons  organized  in  galvanized  buckets.  If  it's  in  your  budget,  hire  a  babysitter.  If  you  suspect  that  a  guest  will  need  a  high  chair,  ask  the  venue  if  they  can  provide  one;  if  they  can't,  tell  the  parents  so  they  can  plan  ahead.Martha  Stewart  Living:  Kate  Bosworth's  Wedding:  Behind-the-Scenes  PhotosEntertaining  the  Kids  at  the  Wedding"I'd  always  planned  on  children  being  in  and  at  our  wedding,  so  I  had  to  think  like  a  kid  when  it  came  to  distracting  them,"  says  Jane  Bliss.  "My  favorite  part  of  the  wedding  was  shopping  for  the  kids'  table!"  During  the  reception,  her  young  guests  sat  at  one  table  for  both  food  and  crafts,  with  art  supplies  and  picture  frames,  as  well  as  trinket  toys.  "They  had  a  blast,  and  they  made  things  that  had  to  do  with  the  wedding,  which  was  not  a  requirement,"  she  says.A  Separate  Room  for  KidsIf  little  guests  are  going  to  be  in  their  own  supervised  room,  experts  suggest  filling  it  with  easy-to-coordinate  activities  --  including  board  games;  gender-neutral,  kid-appropriate  movies;  and  simple  art  projects.  Even  better,  create  a  "Kids'  Club,"  says  Becker,  and  hire  insured  childcare  providers  to  act  as  counselors  who  set  up  themed  activities.  During  a  beach  wedding,  for  instance,  she  suggests  painting  shells  and  reading  stories  about  sea  creatures.  For  couples  with  big  budgets,  consider  hired  entertainers  such  as  balloon  artists,  magicians,  and  puppeteers.Martha  Stewart  Living:  Blake  Lively  and  Ryan  Reynolds  Got  Married,  Their  Exclusive  Wedding  PhotosCan  the  Nanny  Come  Too?A  lot  of  parents  prefer  to  leave  their  child  with  a  familiar  sitter,  says  Kaforey,  so  this  isn't  an  unusual  scenario.  If  it's  in  your  budget,  by  all  means  include  the  nanny;  not  only  is  it  a  generous  gesture,  but  it  will  give  the  invited  parents  peace  of  mind.  Seat  the  nanny  wherever  you're  seating  the  children  --  at  the  parents'  table,  a  children's  table,  or  in  a  separate  room  (be  sure  to  include  her  in  the  head  count  for  an  adult  meal).  Also,  remember  that  she'll  require  an  escort  card  and  place  card.  That  said,  you're  in  no  way  obligated  to  say  yes.  Your  guest  list  is  your  guest  list,  and  you  shouldn't  have  to  invite  someone  just  because  someone  wants  you  to.  This  is  especially  true  if  you're  having  an  intimate  affair  with  only  your  family  and  close  friends  in  attendance  or  if  you're  on  a  tight  budget.Did  you  have  kids  at  your  wedding  or  were  they  not  invited?  Let  us  know  in  the  comments  below  how  you  handled  --  or  plan  to  handle  --  the  youngest  folks  in  your  social  circle.</TEXT></DOC>

He  made  some  of  our  favorite  moviesMake  a  list  of  your  all-time  favorite  films  and,  chances  are,  several  of  Hoffman's  are  there.As  prolific  as  he  was  talented,  Hoffman  is  best-known  for  his  portrayal  as  writer  Truman  Capote  in  the  2005  biopic  "Capote."  It  earned  him  an  Academy  Award.He  also  stole  the  screen  in  "The  Master,"  "Doubt"  and  "Charlie  Wilson's  War."But  his  films  weren't  always  so  serious.  Hoffman  could  wear  his  roles  as  light  as  caps.Remember  "Boogie  Nights?"  Or  "Along  Came  Polly?"Hoffman  was  the  sort  of  actor  that  no  matter  who  else  was  in  the  film,  or  what  his  part  was,  if  you  saw  he  was  in  the  cast,  you  knew  it  had  to  be  good.2.  Mr.  Hollywood,  he  was  notHoffman  was  one  of  us.For  all  his  larger-than-life  roles,  he  had  a  reputation  as  a  regular  guy.  He  didn't  live  in  a  mansion  in  Hollywood  but  rather  an  apartment  in  New  York.He  sent  his  children  to  public  school,  and  he  was  routinely  seen  walking  them  there,  said  CNN's  Rose  Arce,  who  lived  two  blocks  from  the  actor  in  Manhattan's  Greenwich  Village."He'd  go  quietly  about  his  business  with  his  children,"  she  said.  "It's  shocking,  and  I  know  everyone  in  the  neighborhood  is  going  to  feel  like  they're  missing  a  friend,  like  a  friend  has  died."Hoffman  was  often  seen  taking  the  subway,  wearing  a  ball  cap  to  avoid  the  paparazzi.3.  He  was  an  accomplished  stage  actorHoffman  got  his  start  on  the  stage  while  studying  drama  at  New  York  University,  where  he  was  a  founding  member  of  the  short-lived  Bullstoi  Ensemble  theater  company.He  earned  two  Tony  nominations,  one  for  best  actor  in  the  2000  revival  of  Sam  Shepard's  "True  West"  and  another  for  best  actor  in  the  revival  of  Eugene  O'Neill's  "Long  Day's  Journey  Into  Night."He  was  a  founding  member  of  the  Labyrinth  Theater  Company,  where  he  served  on  the  board  of  directors  and  directed  productions.  One  of  the  final  plays  he  directed  for  the  company  was  the  2013  off-Broadway  production  of  "A  Family  For  All  Occasions."Asked  once  during  a  2008  interview  with  the  IFC  network  if  he  thought  it  would  be  a  challenge  to  introduce  new  generations  to  live  theater,  he  said,  "It  might  change,  it  might  evolve,  but  I  don't  think  it'll  become  too  niche  because  the  business  of  theater  is  still  everywhere."4.  No  part  was  too  small,  too  weird  or  too  evilHoffman  could  play  a  great  leading  man,  but  he  shone  in  smaller  parts  too  and  never  shied  away  from  playing  conflicted  --  sometimes  downright  unlikeable  --  characters.Who  forget  his  turn  as  Freddie  Miles  in  "The  Talented  Mr.  Ripley?"Or  as  a  creepy  gamemaster  in  the  latest  "Hunger  Games"  movie?  The  near  perfect  villain  in  "Mission:  Impossible  III?"Hoffman  knew  how  and  when  to  let  others  have  the  spotlight.  He  was  an  actor's  actor.5.  He  didn't  forget  his  momWho  doesn't  love  a  man  who  loves  his  mom?When  Hoffman  took  the  stage  to  accept  his  Oscar  for  best  actor  for  "Capote,"  he  remembered  his  roots.He  thanked  his  mom  for  taking  him  to  his  first  play  and  for  doing  so  much  for  him  and  his  siblings."She  brought  up  four  kids  alone  and  she  deserves  a  congratulations  for  that.  Ah,  we're  at  the  party,  Ma,  you  know?  And  she  took  me  to  my  first  play  and  she  stayed  up  with  me  and  watched  the  NCAA  Final  Four,  and  my  passions,  her  passions  became  my  passions.  And,  you  know,  be  proud,  Mom,  because  I'm  proud  of  you  and  we're  here  tonight  and  it's  so  good,"  Hoffman  said.What  made  you  love  Hoffman?

Discover  your  own  eclectic  vintage  and  flea-market  finds  with  the  help  of  these  tips  from  Andrea  Stanford,  One  Kings  Lane  Vice  President  of  Designer  and  Vintage  Sales,  and  General  Manager  of  Hunters  Alley,  the  shopping  site's  just-launched  vintage-  and  handmade-home-goods  destination.Martha  Stewart  Living:  15  kitchen  shortcuts  that  will  change  the  way  you  cookHave  Fun!Never  be  intimidated  by  shopping  for  vintage;  it  should  be  fun!  Start  by  educating  yourself.  I  love  learning  from  people  who  are  experts  in  their  fields  and  truly  passionate  about  their  collections.  Always  ask  questions  about  an  item's  maker  or  history.  Visit  flea  markets  and  antique  shows  and  browse  online.  As  you  become  more  familiar  with  certain  eras  or  categories  of  decor,  shopping  will  become  so  much  more  fun  ---  and  you  can  truly  enjoy  the  hunt!Martha  Stewart  Living:  19  tips  for  perfect  laundry  every  timeStart  SmallOne  of  the  easiest  ways  to  start  collecting  vintage  is  to  buy  catchalls,  vases,  and  books.  They're  inexpensive  and  easy  to  find.  Starting  with  smaller  accents  is  a  low-risk  way  to  get  a  sense  of  what  styles  and  eras  you're  most  drawn  to.Martha  Stewart  Living:  20  super-efficient,  super-effective  ways  to  clean  all  the  thingsGet  Art  SmartArt  is  another  great  way  to  incorporate  vintage  into  your  home!  Learn  the  basics  about  differentiating  between  an  original  and  a  manufactured  piece,  a  limited-edition  print,  or  a  great  giclee  reproduction,  so  you  can  begin  to  understand  value  and  collectability.  Browse  art  from  the  19th  and  20th  centuries  and  take  note  of  the  artists  you  like.  I  love  finding  original  works  from  lesser-known  artists,  as  the  prices  are  much  more  approachable!  And  I  adore  vintage  fashion  sketches,  especially  from  designers  who  are  still  important  today.Martha  Stewart  Living:  Instant  organization:  Get  it  together  in  15  minutes  or  lessEmbrace  the  ImperfectNormal  cracking  and  warping  of  wood  from  shrinkage  over  time  is  a  great  indication  that  you  have  an  original  wood  piece.  Look  for  maker's  marks,  high-quality  materials  (hand-forged  nails  and  dovetailed  joints),  and  great  patina.  Buying  an  original  design,  even  if  something  is  not  perfect,  is  far  more  interesting  than  bringing  a  reproduction  home!Martha  Stewart  Living:  Don't  shelve  these  clever  bookshelf  decorating  ideasSets  and  PairsPairs  of  great-looking  vintage  lamps  are  hard  to  find;  if  you  find  the  perfect  pair,  be  ready  to  pounce!  Focus  on  the  bases  of  lamps,  as  shades  are  often  in  poor  condition  but  can  be  easily  replaced.  Similarly,  full  sets  of  glassware  are  rare.  The  great  news  is  that  mixing  a  variety  of  vintage  barware  makes  cocktail  hour  even  more  fun!Martha  Stewart  Living:  Curb  your  food  cravings  with  yogaMeasure  FirstWhen  ordering  online,  don't  be  fooled  by  how  large  (or  small)  something  looks  in  a  picture!  I  still  have  a  set  of  vintage  French  kitchen  cabinets  in  my  garage  that  were  too  large  to  even  fit  through  my  front  door  (I'd  thought  they  would  be  the  perfect  addition  to  my  daughter's  petite  room)  and  a  wicker  elephant  meant  as  a  toy  chest  that  stands  just  10  inches  tall.Always  check  the  measurements  online  and  bring  your  measuring  tape  when  hitting  the  flea  markets.  Some  vintage  coffee  and  side  tables  are  too  low  when  placed  alongside  contemporary  furniture.  By  contrast,  many  midcentury  lamps  are  more  than  three  feet  tall  and  can  be  tricky  to  incorporate  into  today's  interiors.  But  most  important  of  all,  buy  what  you  love!  Regardless  of  the  provenance,  if  you  have  a  special  place  for  it  and  the  price  works  for  you,  buy  it!</TEXT></DOC>

Coates  was  having  excruciating  pain  and  rectal  bleeding  in  2011.  For  a  year  the  Army  veteran  went  to  several  VA  clinics  and  hospitals  in  South  Carolina,  trying  to  get  help.  But  the  VA's  diagnosis  was  hemorrhoids,  and  aside  from  simple  pain  medication  he  was  told  he  might  need  a  colonoscopy.Congress  demands  answers  on  VA  deaths"The  problem  was  getting  worse  and  I  was  having  more  pain,"  Coates  said,  talking  about  one  specific  VA  doctor  who  he  saw  every  few  months.  "She  again  examined  me  and  gave  me  some  prescriptions  for  other  things  as  far  as  pain  and  stuff  like  that  and  I  noticed  again  she  made  another  comment  --  'may  need  colonoscopy.'"I  told  her  that  something  needed  to  be  done,"  said  Coates.  "But  nothing  was  ever  set  up  ...  a  consult  was  never  set  up.""I  had  already  been  in  pain  and  suffering  from  this  problem  for  over  six  months  and  it  wasn't  getting  better,"  Coates  said.  "I  told  her  that  if  you  were  in  as  much  pain  as  I  was  and  had  been  going  through  you  wouldn't  wait  another  two  months  to  see  what's  going  on.  You  would  probably  do  it  this  week."Coates  waited  months,  even  begging  for  an  appointment  to  have  his  colonoscopy.  But  he  only  found  himself  on  a  growing  list  of  veterans  also  waiting  for  appointments  and  procedures.  He  was  finally  told  he  could  have  a  colonoscopy,  many  months  later."I  took  it  upon  my  own  self  to  call  the  department  that  scheduled  that  and  ask  them  about  it.  And  they  said  this  was  the  earliest  appointment  that  I  could  get.  And  I  explained  to  the  lady  what  I  had  already  been  through  and  how  much  pain  I  had,  and  I  said  if  I  wait  this  long  there  might  not  be  ...  (anything)  we  can  do  about  it  then.  I  could  be  even  dead  by  then.  And  the  only  thing  she  could  tell  me  was  'I  understand  that,  sir,  but  I  don't  have  any  control  over  that.'  "Finally  about  a  year  after  first  complaining  to  his  doctors  of  the  pain,  Coates  got  a  colonoscopy  and  doctors  discovered  a  cancerous  tumor  the  size  of  a  baseball.The  now  44-year-old  veteran  is  undergoing  chemotherapy  in  an  effort  to  save  his  life.It  is  unclear  whether  anyone  responsible  at  the  VA  has  been  fired,  demoted  or  even  admonished  for  the  delays  in  care  and  treatment.  Some  of  the  people  responsible  may  have  even  received  bonuses  in  recent  years  for  their  work,  despite  the  delays  in  care  or  treatment  for  the  veterans.According  to  the  document  obtained  by  CNN,  10  veterans  are  confirmed  to  have  died  in  the  South  Carolina  and  Georgia  region  alone.  And  the  document  shows  29  vets  or  their  families  were  sent  the  disclosures,  notifying  them  they  had  serious  "adverse  events"  because  of  delayed  care.  And  according  to  the  document  the  problems  go  far  beyond  Georgia  or  South  Carolina.In  the  Florida  region,  five  veterans  are  dead,  and  14  vets  or  their  families  were  sent  the  disclosures,  notified  that  they  suffered  "adverse  events"  because  of  delayed  or  denied  care  or  diagnosis,  according  to  the  exclusive  document.In  the  Rocky  Mountain  region,  two  veterans  died,  and  four  families  were  sent  the  disclosures  or  notified.  In  the  Texas  region,  seven  vets  or  their  families  were  sent  disclosures  about  adverse  events  and  serious  injuries  suffered  because  of  delayed  care.Coates  filed  a  legal  claim,  citing  the  "failure  of  the  Columbia  (South  Carolina)  VA  Medical  Center  to  timely  diagnose  his  rectal  cancer."  The  VA  settled,  but  admitted  no  wrong-doing."I  don't  know  what  my  outcome  is  going  to  be,"  said  Coates."I  just  try  to  live  every  day  like  it's  my  last  day."The  new  document  obtained  by  CNN  shows  a  worse  problem  than  has  previously  been  made  public  by  the  VA.As  CNN  has  previously  reported,  as  many  as  7,000  veterans  were  on  a  backlog  list  --  waiting  too  long  for  colonscopies  or  endoscopies  --  at  VA  facilities  in  Columbia,  South  Carolina  and  Augusta,  Georgia.After  CNN's  detailed  accounting  of  dela-related  deaths  at  the  Columbia  and  Augusta  VA  hospitals,  a  bi-partisan  group  of  Congressmen  visited  the  hospitals,  demanding  answers."We  have  a  duty  to  make  sure  that  the  veterans  who  serve  get  the  best  health  care  possible,"  said  Rep.  John  Barrow,  D-Georgia.  "And  it  is  very  obvious  that  for  too  long  and  for  too  many  folks  that  hasn't  happened."The  VA  said  the  backlog  at  those  two  hospitals  has  been  solved,  but  that  is  not  a  good  enough  explanation  for  Rep.  Jeff  Miller,  the  chair  of  the  House  Veterans  Affairs  Committee."The  fact  that  we've  had  veterans  who  have  died  in  the  very  facilities  that  are  supposed  to  be  taking  care  of  them,  and  not  by  natural  means,  by  means  that  could  have  been  prevented  is  egregious,"  said  Miller,  R-Florida.  "And  it's  not  acceptable."Miller  said  the  VA,  from  the  top  down,  has  consistently  ignored  his  committee's  requests  to  find  out  who  is  responsible.  Even  with  the  delays  in  care  which  have  led  to  deaths  and  serious  injuries,  the  congressman  said  not  a  single  person  has  been  fired  or  even  demoted,  and  in  fact  some  of  those  responsible  may  have  even  gotten  bonuses."I  grieve  for  the  families  who  lost  loved  ones  that  could  have  been  with  them  this  Christmas  that  would  be  celebrating  2014  today  had  the  backlog  not  existed,"  said  Miller.  "That's  not  what  anybody  in  this  country  wants  for  our  veterans."He  said  the  lack  of  accountability  is  what  angers  him  most."That's  why  we  asked  the  question  again  today,  with  members  of  the  South  Carolina  delegation  and  Georgia  delegation,  tell  us  exactly  who  was  disciplined  and  how.  I  don't  want  to  hear  the  excuse  anymore  that  'It  was  multi-faceted.  ...There  were  many  people  involved'  "  said  Miller."Well  if  there  were  many  people  involved  then  they  all  need  to  go.  We  are  not  asking  for  one  particular  person,  we  want  to  know  exactly  why  things  happened  and  who  was  held  responsible,  At  this  point  publicly,  we  haven't  seen  anybody  held  responsible."CNN  has  made  repeated  requests  for  interviews  with  top  officials  at  the  VA,  including  President  Obama's  appointed  head  of  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs,  Secretary  Eric  Shinseki.  The  requests  have  all  been  denied,  or  ignored.The  VA  did  issue  a  written  statement  from  Dr.  Robert  Petzel,  the  Under  Secretary  for  Health  at  the  department  of  Veterans  Affairs.  In  the  statement,  Petzel  wrote  that  "The  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  cares  deeply  for  every  Veteran  we  are  privileged  to  serve.  Our  goal  is  to  provide  the  best  quality,  safe  and  effective  health  care  our  Veterans  have  earned  and  deserve.  We  take  seriously  any  issue  that  occurs  at  any  one  of  the  more  than  1,700  VA  health  care  facilities  across  the  country."He  also  stated:  "As  a  result  of  the  consult  delay  issue  VA  discovered  at  two  of  our  medical  centers,  the  Veterans  Health  Administration  (VHA)  conducted  a  national  review  of  consults  across  the  system.  We  have  redesigned  the  consult  process  to  better  monitor  consult  timeliness.  We  continue  to  take  action  to  strengthen  oversight  mechanisms  and  prevent  a  similar  delay  at  another  VA  medical  center.  We  take  any  issue  of  this  nature  extremely  seriously  and  offer  our  sincerest  condolences  to  families  and  individuals  who  have  been  affected  and  lost  a  loved  one."In  August  2007,  presidential  candidate  Barack  Obama  gave  a  campaign  speech  to  veterans  specifically  addressing  wait  lists,  denied  care  and  poor  treatment  of  vets.  He  promised  his  administration  would  be  different."No  veteran  should  have  to  fill  out  a  23-page  claim  to  get  care,  or  wait  months  --  even  years  --  to  get  an  appointment  at  the  VA,"  said  then-candidate  Obama."When  we  fail  to  keep  faith  with  our  veterans,  the  bond  between  our  nation  and  our  nation's  heroes  becomes  frayed.  When  a  veteran  is  denied  care,  we  are  all  dishonored."But  Coates  said  for  him  the  speech  is  an  empty  promise."Someone  needs  to  stand  and  face  the  person  who  suffered  and  the  veterans  who  have  died  and  say,  'Hey  it  was  me,  I  let  the  ball  drop,'  "  he  said."How  many  lives  are  we  going  to  lose  from  this?""When  is  it  going  to  be  corrected?"</TEXT></DOC>

With  a  combination  of  votes  from  viewers  and  scores  from  the  judges,  each  celebrity  competing  vies  to  be  the  star  with  the  highest  score  weekly  so  he  or  she  can  advance  to  the  next  round.  Those  who  land  in  the  bottom  are  eliminated  from  the  show.But  to  shake  up  the  process,  "DWTS"  is  now  allowing  viewers  to  vote  for  stars  to  switch  pro  partners  midway  through  the  season.The  cast  this  year  includes  child  stars  such  as  Danika  McKellar  (aka  Winnie  from  "The  Wonder  Years")  and  Candace  Cameron  Bure  (D.J.  Tanner  from  "Full  House"),  plus  "The  Real  Housewives  of  Atlanta's"  NeNe  Leakes,  comedian-TV  host  Drew  Carey,  and  champion  ice  dancers  Charlie  White  and  Meryl  Davis.White,  who's  paired  with  Sharna  Burgess,  and  Bure,  who's  dancing  with  Mark  Ballas,  had  the  top  two  routines  of  the  night.  (The  "Full  House"  actress  caught  the  judges  off  guard  with  her  skills.)Carey,  Leakes  and  McKellar,  whose  fox  trot  got  thunderous  applause,  all  earned  scores  that  landed  them  in  the  middle.  Davis  ended  up  scoring  below  her  ice-dancing  partner  White,  earning  just  a  24  to  White's  score  of  27.  (That  difference  made  at  least  one  viewer  wonder  if  the  judges  are  playing  favorites.)The  real  standout  of  the  night  was  Billy  Dee  Williams  (as  we  predicted).  The  76-year-old  "Star  Wars"  actor  not  only  pulled  off  a  cha-cha  with  pro  partner  Emma  Slater  to  the  movie's  theme  music,  but  he  did  it  with  two  Stormtroopers  and  R2-D2.The  audience  --  which  included  some  Ewoks  --  loved  it,  but  the  judges  thought  his  routine  was  lacking  energy  and  gave  him  the  lowest  score  of  the  night,  a  15.The  first  elimination  in  the  18th  season  of  "Dancing  With  the  Stars"  will  take  place  next  week.</TEXT></DOC>

A  handful  of  educators  are  beta  testers  in  Google's  Glass  Explorer  ProgramThey're  capturing  videos  and  images  of  classroom  activities  through  a  small  camera  built  into  Glass'  frame,  and  sharing  them  online.  They  use  Glass  to  teach  lessons  from  their  perspective  to  share  with  others,  or  for  their  own  reference.  They're  propping  the  glasses  on  students,  and  using  the  footage  and  images  from  young  people  to  understand  what  they  see  and  how  they  learn.Even  with  limited  applications  and  functionality  in  these  early  versions  of  Google  Glass,  some  teachers  and  technology  enthusiasts  see  huge  potential."The  possibilities  are  endless  as  more  applications  are  developed  for  the  device  and  as  Glass  gets  into  the  hands  of  more  teachers  and  students,"  said  Kathy  Schrock,  a  former  librarian  and  technology  consultant  who  serves  on  the  board  of  International  Society  for  Technology  in  Education."Having  a  single  pair  of  Google  Glass  in  the  classroom  reminds  me  of  the  days  of  the  one-computer  classroom.  Everyone  had  to  wait  for  a  turn  to  use  the  device,"  Schrock,  a  Google  Certified  Teacher,  said  in  an  e-mail.  "I  think  once  we  see  a  K-12  school  pilot  with  a  classroom  set  of  Glass,  there  will  be  many  more  practical  and  creative  uses  showcased."The  virtual  field  trip  is  often  touted  as  a  use  for  Glass,  and  there  are  apps  in  development  expected  to  display  information  about  locations  the  Glass  wearer  sees.Google  sent  online  educator  Andrew  Vanden  Heuvel  to  Switzerland  in  2013  so  he  could  lead  students  on  a  virtual  tour  of  the  Large  Hadron  Collider  at  the  European  Organization  for  Nuclear  Research  known  as  CERN.  Through  a  Google+  hangout,  students  from  South  Christian  High  School  in  Michigan  watched  Vanden  Heuvel  walk  through  the  world's  largest  and  most  powerful  particle  accelerator,  taking  their  questions  and  pointing  out  features.Even  more  common,  educators  broadcast  from  inside  the  classroom,  leading  science  labs,  group  discussions  or  even  performing  surgery  for  remote  audiences.  They  show  it  in  real  time  through  Google+  hangouts  and  as  videos  shared  later  through  YouTube,  personal  blogs  and  other  forms  of  social  media.After  his  field  trip,  Vanden  Heuvel  continued  using  Glass  by  making  a  series  of  instructional  science  and  math  videos  called  STEMBites.  Another  teacher  asked  students  to  wear  Glass  during  science  labs,  then  broadcast  the  lessons  to  a  student  who  missed  school  for  medical  reasons.But  Google  Glass  in  every  classroom  could  be  a  long  way  off.  There's  a  long  list  of  reasons  why  the  most  intriguing  device  in  tech  just  isn't  ready  for  school:  Glass  is  expected  to  be  more  widely  available  toward  the  end  of  2014,  but  the  $1,500  price  tag  is  a  significant  barrier  for  schools  and  teachers.  So  far,  there's  no  educational  discount,  teachers  said,  and  Google  hasn't  announced  plans  to  partner  with  educational  institutions.  Its  short  battery  life  needs  to  be  resolved  before  broader  implementation  is  possible,  teachers  said,  and  Glass  is  mired  in  privacy  concerns,  especially  when  children  are  involved."To  me,  the  greatest  value  of  Glass  so  far  isn't  what  it's  able  to  do,  but  the  conversation  being  had  nationally  about  how  we  interact  with  technology  and  how  we  want  it  to  be  part  of  society,"  said  Vanden  Heuvel,  who  teaches  online  math  and  science  classes.Vanden  Heuvel  views  Glass  as  another  tool  in  his  arsenal,  but  it's  "not  necessarily  the  best  for  every  situation,"  he  said."I  think  the  $1,500  would  be  better  spent  on  three  Chromebooks,"  he  said.Still,  early  adopters  in  education  are  looking  for  ways  to  make  it  work.  Margaret  Powers,  lower  school  technology  coordinator  at  the  Episcopal  Academy  in  Newtown  Square,  Pennsylvania,  has  been  documenting  her  experiences  using  Glass  in  class  on  on  her  blog,  365  Days  of  Glass.  She  saw  potential  in  Glass  as  a  tool  to  capture  moments  of  discovery  and  learning  through  her  students'  eyes,  in  line  with  the  Reggio  Emilia  philosophy  she  embraces  as  an  educator.Since  April  2013,  she's  used  Glass  to  document  the  day's  activities  and  post  video  highlights  online.  Glass  gives  her  the  benefit  of  doing  it  hands-free,  so  she  can  maintain  eye  contact  and  interact  with  students  while  gathering  information,  she  said.Periodically,  she  puts  together  video  clips  around  specific  topics,  like  teaching  students  about  coding,  as  presentations  for  parents.  She  lets  students  use  the  device  to  document  their  experience  making  Native  crafts  or  playing  in  the  snow  to  share  with  partner  classrooms  around  the  country.Among  its  greatest  benefits  so  far?  Powers  said  she  can  finally  see  the  classroom  through  the  eyes  of  her  students,  who  range  from  pre-K  to  second  grade.  It  shows  which  details  catch  their  attention,  and  sometimes  reveals  simple  problems,  like  when  Powers  realized  she  was  posting  some  information  too  high  for  her  young  students  to  see."It  has  been  really  interesting  to  try  it  because  their  perspective  is  so  unique  and  different  from  ours,  which  is  why  I  think  (Glass)  has  a  lot  of  potential  with  these  age  ranges,"  she  said.  "To  get  just  a  few  moments  to  see  how  they  learn  to  do  a  math  problem,  or  to  get  a  sense  of  their  vantage  point  is  so  great  for  teachers."</TEXT></DOC>

Follow  him  on  Twitter  @locs_n_laughs.  The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  the  author.(CNN)  --  Pope  Francis  sent  shock  waves  around  the  globe  last  July  when  in  addressing  the  issue  of  gays  in  the  church,  he  opted  not  to  remind  his  1.6  billion  followers  about  the  fiery  pits  of  hell  but  instead  posed  a  question:  "Who  am  I  to  judge?"Not  exactly  a  ringing  endorsement  for  equality,  but  the  rhetorical  question  was  light  years  away  from  what  we  have  grown  accustomed  to  hearing  from  his  predecessors.  And  because  of  that,  we  felt  a  glimmer  of  hope  that  maybe  the  needle  within  the  larger  Christian  community  had  moved  from  hostile  rhetoric  to  civil  engagement.Maybe  even  tolerance.In  their  nearly  one-hour  meeting  this  week,  Pope  Francis  and  President  Barack  Obama  reportedly  spent  the  bulk  of  their  time  discussing  empathy."It's  the  lack  of  empathy  that  makes  it  very  easy  for  us  to  plunge  into  wars,"  the  President  said  afterwards.Presumably  he  was  referring  to  military  wars,  though  that  sentiment  is  obviously  applicable  to  the  culture  war  as  well.For  only  a  lack  of  empathy  could  prompt  officials  at  a  Christian  school  in  Virginia  to  suggest  an  8-year-old  girl  attend  a  different  school  because  she  wasn't  behaving  in  a  feminine  enough  way  to  stay  at  theirs.  (The  school  says  it  can't  provide  details  because  of  confidentiality,  but  "this  matter  is  far  beyond  a  simple  'hairstyle  and  tomboy  issue'  as  inaccurately  portrayed.")Only  a  lack  of  empathy  could  lead  Catholic  school  officials  to  fire  a  beloved  teacher  for  planning  to  marry  the  love  of  his  life.  Lack  of  empathy  explains  how  "The  "700  Club's"  Pat  Robertson  can  be  flippant  about  stoning  gay  people  to  death  in  the  days  of  Jesus,  or  how  Franklin  Graham  --  Billy  Graham's  son  --  can  suggest  that  LGBT  people  might  adopt  children  in  order  to  "recruit."All  of  these  incidents  occurred  after  Pope  Francis  asked  "who  am  I  to  judge?"  as  if  ostracizing  an  elementary  school  tomboy  was  the  best  answer  some  of  the  Christian  faith  had  to  that  question.On  the  day  the  story  of  the  little  girl  made  national  headlines,  Dan  Haseltine,  lead  singer  for  the  Christian  band  Jars  of  Clay,  tweeted,  "why  do  I  find  myself  regularly  shaking  my  head,  or  rolling  my  eyes  at  supposed  Christian  leaders."  He  followed  with,  "I  am  learning  that  love's  most  potent  manifestation  happens  when  we  make  room  at  the  table  for  everyone."Haseltine's  remarks  were  refreshing,  because  many  Christians  in  his  position  prefer  silent  disapproval  in  response  to  over-the-top  quotes  and  head-scratching  stories  like  the  one  involving  the  little  girl.  If  you're  curious  why  more  and  more  people  are  leaving  the  church,  maybe  it's  because  they  hear  "love  the  sinner  but  hate  the  sin"  from  the  pulpit  --  and  then  see  so  many  followers  go  about  their  day  as  if  simply  saying  the  word  "love"  excused  them  from  actually  having  to  show  any.Many  followers  of  Christ  may  find  silence  on  this  topic  easier,  not  noticing  silence  is  being  interpreted  as  endorsement  --  whether  they  agree  with  the  anti-gay  rhetoric  or  not.  For  each  time  "Who  am  I  to  judge?"  is  asked,  an  anti-gay  quote  from  the  Catholic  League's  Bill  Donahue  is  there  to  answer.To  move  Pope  Francis'  question  from  a  global  headline  to  global  change,  Christians  must  stop  allowing  silence  to  be  the  de  facto  weapon  of  choice  against  the  senseless  persecution  of  gay  people.Forty  percent  of  the  country's  homeless  youth  identify  as  LGBT,  with  nearly  half  kicked  out  of  their  homes  by  those  who  are  supposed  to  love  and  care  for  them.  There's  a  sermon  topic  we  don't  hear  every  week  --  but  we  should.Slave  owners  used  to  start  and  end  each  service  on  the  plantation  with  Ephesians  6:5  --  "Servants,  be  obedient  to  them  that  are  your  masters  according  to  the  flesh,  with  fear  and  trembling,  in  singleness  of  your  heart,  as  unto  Christ.""Who  am  I  to  judge?"  was  not  enough  to  change  that.Women  were  once  compelled  to  stay  with  abusive  husbands  with  the  words  "wives,  submit  yourselves  unto  your  own  husbands,  as  unto  the  Lord.""Who  am  I  to  judge?"  was  not  enough  to  empower  women  and  get  the  legal  system  to  prosecute  their  assailants.It  was  in  such  silence  that  laws  in  Uganda  were  originally  drafted  to  make  being  gay  punishable  by  death.  Laws  that  found  validation  from  the  ties  some  Ugandan  politicians  had  to  well-known  U.S.  evangelicals  who  regularly  visited  the  country.  The  evangelicals  have  since  distanced  themselves  from  the  anti-gay  politics  of  Uganda.  Not  because  of  some  moral  stirring  within  their  soul  but  because  they  were  called  out  on  it.Because  the  silence  ended.Cardinal  Timothy  Dolan  --  when  asked  about  NFL  prospect  Michael  Sam  coming  out  of  the  closet  --  said  on  NBC's  "Meet  The  Press,"  "The  same  Bible  that  tells  us  --  that  teaches  us  well  about  the  virtues  of  chastity  and  the  virtue  of  fidelity  and  marriage  also  tells  us  not  to  judge  people."It's  a  truism  ignored  way  too  often  by  anti-gay  Christian  leaders.  A  truism  that  isn't  reiterated  enough  by  those  who  follow  them.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.</TEXT></DOC>

The  new  youthful  offender  indictment  alleges  that  Chism  forcibly  had  sexual  intercourse  with  the  victim."Aggravated  rape  is  charged  when  there  is  serious  bodily  harm  and/or  when  the  rape  was  committed  during  the  commission  of  another  felonious  and  assaultive  crime,"  the  district  attorney's  office  said  in  a  statement.Denise  Regan,  Chism's  public  defender,  could  not  be  reached  for  comment.Chism,  who  is  being  held  without  bail,  is  set  to  appear  January  30  in  Salem  Superior  Court  for  a  pre-trial  conference.According  to  a  police  affidavit,  a  ninth-grade  student  told  investigators  that  Chism  became  visibly  upset  when  Ritzer  spoke  after  class  on  the  day  of  the  crime  about  his  home  state  of  Tennessee.When  Ritzer  noticed  that  Chism  was  upset,  she  changed  the  subject,  said  the  unidentified  student,  who  described  Chism  as  "talking  to  himself."The  affidavit  includes  testimony  from  witnesses  as  well  as  a  school  video  surveillance  timeline  showing  Chism  and  Ritzer  in  the  same  area  of  the  school  during  the  teacher's  final  moments.In  the  video,  Ritzer  appears  to  enter  a  second-floor  girls'  restroom  --  apparently  a  faculty  restroom  was  occupied  --  and  Chism,  wearing  gloves  and  red  sweatshirt  with  the  hood  pulled  over  his  head,  appears  to  enter  the  restroom  about  a  minute  later,  according  to  the  affidavit.Shortly  after,  a  female  student  enters  the  bathroom  and  then  quickly  walks  out,  according  to  the  court  papers.  She  told  investigators  she  saw  the  back  of  a  person  who  appeared  to  be  changing  clothes;  the  person's  rear  was  exposed,  with  clothes  piled  on  the  floor.The  video  shows  Chism  leaving  the  restroom,  returning  later  with  a  recycling  barrel,  and  again  leaving  the  restroom  pulling  the  barrel  --  this  time  with  a  black  mask  on  his  forehead,  the  court  papers  say.  He  pulls  the  barrel  outside  the  building  and  toward  the  student  parking  lot.  Investigators  said  the  video  shows  what  appear  to  be  blood  stains  near  the  bathroom  and  on  Chism's  pants.Court  papers  detail  horrifying  final  moments  of  teacher's  lifeAfter  Chism  was  reported  missing  by  his  mother  on  the  evening  of  October  22,  police  had  his  cellular  phone  company  "ping"  the  location  of  his  phone.  The  phone  was  found  to  be  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Hollywood  Hits  Theater,  where  investigators  learned  the  teen  had  purchased  a  movie  ticket  and  then  left.The  affidavit  said  that,  when  Chism  was  spotted  by  a  police  officer  the  next  day,  he  was  carrying  a  knife;  a  search  of  his  backpack  turned  up  a  bloodstained  box  cutter.  Asked  where  the  blood  came  from,  Chism  allegedly  responded:  "The  girl."  He  was  also  allegedly  carrying  credit  cards  and  driver's  licenses  belonging  to  Ritzer,  as  well  as  a  pair  of  woman's  underwear.Friends,  relatives  bewildered  by  arrest  of  'storybook  kid'  in  teacher  slayingThe  armed  robbery  indictment  alleges  that  Chism  robbed  Ritzer  of  credit  cards,  an  iPhone  and  her  underwear.Police  discovered  Ritzer's  body  in  a  wooded  area  near  the  school,  covered  with  leaves  and  debris  in  an  apparent  attempt  to  conceal  it,  the  court  papers  said.  Her  throat  was  slit.Dressed  in  pink,  hundreds  mourn  Colleen  Ritzer</TEXT></DOC>

It  appears  the  teenagers  later  turned  the  gun  on  themselves.German's  death  has  profoundly  affected  the  small  town,  where  he  was  employed  as  a  police  officer  for  five  years.Just  west  of  Orlando,  Windermere  is  known  for  its  luxurious  homes  and  close-knit  residents.  German  was  one  of  only  12  full-time  officers  in  the  town  with  about  2,500  people.He  left  behind  parents  Tim  and  Deborah  German  as  well  as  twin  sisters."Debbie  and  I  have  been  complimented  routinely  this  week  by  many  on  what  a  great  job  we  as  parents  did  in  raising  Robbie:  Someone  so  loyal,  fun,  helpful,  prankish,  caring  of  others  --  a  hero,"  Tim  German  said,  his  voice  quavering  during  the  memorial  Thursday  in  Longwood,  Florida."Son,  we  love  you  so  much,  and  we'll  miss  you  dearly  beyond  earthly  measure  ...  but  your  legacy  of  caring,  in  your  Robbie  way,  will  live  on  through  all  of  us  who  remember  you,  knew  you,  loved  you."Tim  spoke  with  affection  about  his  son's  fun-loving,  endearing  personality  that  dovetailed  with  his  drive  to  become  a  law  enforcement  officer.  For  Robert  German,  that  meant  working  during  the  day  and  going  to  night  school."He  didn't  give  up.  He  had  a  dream,  finally  got  a  job  at  Windermere.  He  was  thrilled  and  very  excited.  From  that  point,  we  saw  him  grow  again,  and  he  became  increasingly  service-oriented  and  caring  of  others,"  the  father  said.At  the  time  of  his  shooting,  German  had  just  returned  to  the  force  after  being  on  "light-duty  status"  following  surgery  for  an  injury  he  suffered  six  months  earlier.He  had  responded  to  a  scene  involving  an  autistic  person,  Windermere  police  Chief  Dave  Ogden  said,  standing  before  German's  flag-draped  casket.Recognizing  the  situation,  German  "de-escalated  the  situation,  he  went  hands-on,  and  he  ended  up  receiving  the  injury."Following  the  matter,  German  simply  asked  after  the  other  individual  involved."'Chief,  I'm  OK,  but  I  really  hope  that  boy's  OK.  I  know  he  didn't  mean  it,'"  Ogden  recalled  German  telling  him.  "But  that's  Robbie.  Without  care  or  concern  for  himself,  he  knew  the  situation."Investigators  are  still  trying  to  piece  together  the  events  leading  up  to  German's  death.Two  days  before  the  shooting,  Brandon  Goode,  18,  and  Alexandria  "Alex"  Hollinghurst,  17,  both  of  Davenport,  Florida,  reportedly  ran  away  from  home,  leaving  only  letters  behind  for  their  families  to  find."To  my  loving  parents,  I  am  sorry  for  all  the  pain  and  misery  I  have  brought  you  both,  not  just  now  but  from  these  past  few  years  as  well,"  begins  Goode's  note,  handwritten  in  neat,  even  letters."I  don't  want  to  go  through  life  knowing  because  of  my  mistakes  that  I  amounted  to  nothing  and  was  there  fore  a  disappointment.  Don't  take  that  as  me  putting  the  blame  on  you  because  that  is  the  furthest  thing  from  the  truth.  Both  of  you  have  been  so  amazing  with  your  constant  help  and  support  through  my  life."Goode  was  arrested  in  February  on  charges  of  possession  of  alcohol  while  underage  and  possession  of  marijuana  and  drug  paraphernalia.  He  had  also  been  arrested  in  2012  in  an  alleged  aggravated  assault  on  his  mother,  according  to  incident  reports  from  the  Polk  County  Sheriff's  Office."I  love  you  with  all  my  heart,"  the  letter  continues.  "Please  don't  be  sad,  this  is  what  I  want  now,  I  get  to  die  peacefully  with  the  woman  I  love,  the  woman  of  my  dreams,  my  fiancé  (yes  we  were  engaged!).  I  miss  you  both  so  much  already."Hollinghurst  penned  two  loving  missives  addressed  to  her  sister  and  father,  but  to  her  mother,  she  directed  a  bitter  letter  that  suggests  the  two  had  a  turbulent  relationship.Once  the  letters  were  found,  the  couple's  parents  called  police  to  alert  them  to  the  teens'  disappearances.Using  cell  phone  tracking  technology,  Kissimmee  police  officers  found  the  two  parked  in  Goode's  car.  When  the  officer  asked  Goode  to  step  out  of  the  automobile,  he  "cranked  the  vehicle,  put  the  vehicle  in  drive  and  sped  away,"  according  to  a  Polk  County  Sheriff's  Office  incident  report.Later,  Kissimmee  police  filed  a  warrant  to  charge  Goode  with  resisting  a  law  enforcement  officer  without  violence  and  reckless  driving.Early  Saturday,  German  encountered  the  duo  walking  along  a  street  and  called  for  assistance.When  deputies  responded  to  the  scene,  they  found  German  "lying  on  the  roadway,  mortally  wounded,"  the  Orange  County  Sheriff's  Office  said.  The  deputies  performed  what  is  called  a  tactical  rescue,  using  a  patrol  car  to  shield  their  fallen  comrade.That's  when  they  heard  two  gunshots.Upon  searching  nearby  woods,  Orange  County  sheriff's  deputies  found  Goode  and  Hollinghurst  dead,  lying  in  some  brush,  from  what  are  believed  to  be  self-inflicted  wounds.It's  perhaps  the  lack  of  any  available  explanations  after  Goode's  death  that  will  haunt  his  parents  the  most."We  cannot  comprehend  the  senseless  loss  of  Officer  German's  life,  the  death  of  Alexandria  Hollinghurst  and  for  our  family,  the  loss  of  our  18-year-old  son,  Brandon,"  Ricke  and  Connie  Goode  said  in  a  statement  issued  Wednesday  to  CNN  affiliates  WESH-TV  and  Central  Florida  News  13."Words  do  not  exist  to  express  the  measure  of  our  sorrow  and  sadness.  Our  deepest  sympathy  and  our  heartfelt  prayers  go  out  to  the  friends  and  family  of  Officer  German.  We  are  so,  so  sorry  to  them  for  what  happened  and  they  will  be  forever  in  our  prayers.  We  know  a  community  grieves  and  like  everyone  else  in  our  community,  we  ourselves  are  struggling  to  understand  this  most  horrific  tragedy.  We  have  no  answers,  only  questions."</TEXT></DOC>

That  may  be  especially  true  in  India,  a  country  so  vastly  different  in  every  respect  from  the  United  States.But  when  the  call  came  from  my  husband's  niece  and  nephew,  Larkin  and  Nelson,  to  accompany  them  and  their  father,  Raymond  Broussard,  on  a  trip  to  the  Himalayan  region  of  Ladakh,  I  couldn't  say  no.Part  of  it  was  purely  selfish.I'd  never  been  to  Ladakh,  a  region  off  India's  northern  Jammu  and  Kashmir  state  that  borders  Tibet.  It's  fairly  accessible  these  days  by  plane  --  at  least  in  the  summer  --  but  during  my  childhood  in  India,  Ladakh  was  not  a  destination.  Back  then,  most  Indians  visited  picturesque  Srinagar,  the  summer  capital  of  Jammu  and  Kashmir.  That  was  long  before  a  violent  insurgency,  aimed  at  wresting  part  of  Kashmir  from  Indian  control,  ravaged  the  area.I'd  heard  from  friends  who'd  been  to  Ladakh  in  recent  years  about  how  glorious  a  place  it  was,  surrounded  by  towering,  snow-capped  peaks  and  Buddhist  monasteries.  I'd  yearned  to  go  for  a  very  long  time,  so  the  invitation  was  instantly  appealing.But  there  was  a  deeper  reason.Raymond  is  a  pediatric  dentist  in  Albuquerque,  New  Mexico.  He  told  me  that  when  he  was  young,  his  father,  also  a  dentist,  had  taken  him  on  a  goodwill  mission  to  Haiti.It  was  a  trip  that  became  indelibly  etched  in  his  mind.  What  American  kid  wouldn't  learn  from  helping  others  so  much  less  fortunate?Raymond  told  me  he  wanted  his  own  children  to  experience  something  similar.  He'd  been  thinking  about  it  for  a  long  time  and  then  suddenly,  just  like  that,  Larkin  was  entering  her  senior  year  in  high  school.  This  was  Raymond's  last  window  of  opportunity.He  signed  on  with  a  group  called  Global  Dental  Relief,  a  Colorado-based  charitable  organization  that  provides  dental  care  for  poor  kids  in  India,  Nepal,  Vietnam,  Cambodia,  Kenya  and  Guatemala.  He  was  going  as  one  of  six  volunteer  dentists.  But  the  group  needed  nondental  volunteers  as  well.Larkin  and  Nelson  were  going  --  it  was  their  first  trip  to  India  --  and  they  inspired  me  to  sign  up  as  a  nondental  assistant.  If  they  could  do  it,  why  not  me?I  wasn't  so  sure  about  how  much  help  I'd  be.  I  couldn't  tell  you  what  "scaler"  or  "explorer"  tools  looked  like,  but  it  wouldn't  hurt,  I  thought,  to  learn  new  skills.I  rescheduled  my  previously  planned  trip  to  India.  I  almost  always  visit  home  in  the  winter  when  the  humidity  and  sizzling  temperatures  subside  in  Delhi  and  in  my  hometown,  Kolkata.  But  there  is  no  easy  way  to  reach  Leh,  the  Ladakhi  capital,  in  the  winter.  The  city  is  snowbound.So  on  a  late  August  evening,  I  boarded  a  flight  in  Atlanta  bound  for  Delhi.  After  a  day  getting  over  jet  lag  and  visiting  family,  I  joined  the  Global  Dental  Relief  group  and  was  immediately  relieved  to  know  that  few  of  the  nondental  volunteers  had  any  experience  with  cavities  or  extractions.But  we  all  had  two  things  in  common:  We  wanted  to  do  something  good,  and  we  wanted  to  see  what  one  of  the  most  breathtaking  places  in  the  world.Less  than  an  hour  after  the  Indigo  jet  left  smoggy  Delhi  behind,  passengers  strained  to  see  out  the  windows.  The  view  was  nothing  short  of  magnificent.The  rising  sun  kissed  the  tall,  stark  peaks  of  the  Himalayas.  Some  of  them  looked  like  they  were  on  fire,  the  orange  hues  so  startlingly  bright.After  we  settled  into  the  Snow  View  Guest  House,  we  ventured  out  into  town  --  even  though  it  had  been  strongly  suggested  that  we  take  it  easy  in  our  rooms.  Leh  is  about  12,000  feet  above  sea  level  and  many  a  visitor  has  fallen  prey  to  altitude  sickness.We  filled  up  on  Tibetan  momos  (dumplings  filled  with  lamb,  chicken  or  vegetables)  and  got  up  early  the  next  morning  to  begin  setting  up  the  dental  clinic.David  Sonam,  the  owner  of  the  guesthouse,  helps  set  up  the  clinic  every  year.  He's  a  businessman  and  a  former  dean  at  a  school  who  wants  to  do  something  for  the  kids  in  Ladakh,  many  of  whom  hail  from  impoverished  homes  and  lack  the  services  they  need."Dental  care,"  Sonam  told  me,  "is  not  so  good  here."The  kids  don't  get  check-ups.  Many  don't  even  have  toothbrushes  or  paste  at  home.  The  only  care,  Sonam  said,  is  for  emergencies  --  bad  infections  and  painful  teeth  extractions.Downstairs  from  our  makeshift  clinic  is  a  permanent  center  that  Sonam  set  up  for  kids  with  special  needs.  There's  a  room  painted  with  stars  where  children  with  autism  can  relax.  There's  also  a  physiotherapy  center  for  children  who've  had  corrective  surgery  so  they  can  walk  again.  A  wheelchair  can  be  a  curse  in  a  place  like  Leh.  It's  hilly  and  hardly  anywhere  is  handicapped  accessible.Sonam  said  the  biggest  problem  here  is  lack  of  water  and  hygiene.  Most  children  grow  up  with  a  mouthful  of  rotting  teeth,  which  can  lead  to  other  problems  later  in  life.  And  that's  what  we  begin  to  see  the  next  day  when  the  long  lines  begin  to  form  at  our  humble  dental  clinic.One  day,  we  encountered  about  250  students  from  Siddhartha  School  who  traveled  for  hours  from  mountain  villages."They  are  kids  who  only  go  to  see  a  dentist  when  they  are  in  a  lot  of  pain,"  said  their  teacher  Tanzin  Dolma,  38.That  includes  Tesering  Chonzom,  14.  She's  already  had  to  have  two  fillings;  now  she's  in  for  a  third.  She  cowered  from  Raymond's  anesthesia  needle.  Her  friend  Stanzin  Anmol  tried  to  calm  her  down.  I  wiped  the  tears  flowing  down  her  cheeks.But  within  an  hour,  she  was  out  the  door,  her  cavity  filled.Over  six  days,  the  Global  Dental  Relief  volunteers  saw  715  patients  --  fillings,  extractions,  cleanings,  sealants.  In  all,  the  group  estimated  the  value  of  the  service  at  about  $170,000.  But  we  felt  like  a  million.The  clinic,  I  think,  was  especially  meaningful  for  the  Indians  among  the  volunteers  --  there  were  three  Indian  dentists  and  one  other  Indian  dental  assistant.I'd  covered  international  aid  organizations  in  my  homeland  --  in  conflict  and  the  aftermath  of  natural  disaster  --  but  I'd  never  been  a  participant  in  anything  like  this.My  crash  course  in  dentistry  probably  won't  take  me  very  far  though  the  next  time  I  am  sitting  in  a  chair  (take  note,  Dr.  Elise  Ashpole),  I  will  know  what  you  mean  when  you  say:  "18  occlusal."  I  will  also  know  when  you  pick  up  the  dread  extraction  tool.Eventually,  the  names  of  the  children  I  met  will  fade  in  my  mind.  What  I  will  remember  are  the  expressions  of  awe  and  astonishment  on  the  faces  of  Larkin  and  Nelson,  who,  as  teenagers,  discovered  a  slice  of  a  strange  new  land.  They,  like  their  father,  Raymond,  who  never  forgot  his  trip  to  Haiti,  will  hopefully  look  back  on  India  in  2013  as  a  necessary  stepping  stone  in  the  path  of  life.What  I  will  also  remember  are  moments  that  will  remain  etched  in  my  mind  --  Angmo  Rigzin's  hand  clutching  mine  so  tightly  that  I  thought  the  bones  in  my  fingers  might  break.She  was  11,  suffered  from  anxiety  and  deathly  afraid  of  Raymond's  needle.  When  her  ordeal  was  over  and  she  finally  was  able  to  smile  again,  I  handed  her  a  toothbrush  to  take  home.  She  ran  out,  down  the  stairs  and  out  into  the  afternoon  light.  Two  minutes  later,  she  returned  with  an  older  student  who  spoke  a  smattering  of  English."Thank  you,"  the  older  girl  told  me.  "She  would  not  have  been  able  to  bear  this  without  you."I  watched  Angmo  return  to  her  schoolmates  playing  on  a  swing  set  in  the  shadows  of  a  17th  century  Tibetan-style  palace.  Every  visitor  to  Leh  makes  the  trek  up  to  that  palace.  From  up  there,  tourists  gasp  at  the  breathtaking  scenery  before  them,  the  majesty  of  the  Himalayas  ahead  and  all  of  the  city  below.But  most  tourists  will  never  see  what  I  did  in  Leh.  I  saw  a  part  of  my  homeland  through  a  new  lens.  For  that,  I  am  grateful.Follow  Moni  Basu  on  Twitter</TEXT></DOC>

"There's  a  lot  of  unknowns  about  this  potential  chemical  that  have  the  chance  to  do  some  harm  to  humans."The  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  have  said  as  long  as  the  chemical  is  diluted  enough,  the  water  should  be  safe  to  drink.But  other  experts  say  they  aren't  so  sure,  because  studies  about  the  chemical  --  4-methylcyclohexane  methanol  --  are  sparse,  and  investigators  are  still  looking  into  them."Due  to  limited  availability  of  data,  and  out  of  an  abundance  of  caution,  you  may  wish  to  consider  an  alternative  drinking  water  source  for  pregnant  women  until  the  chemical  is  at  non-detectable  levels  in  the  water  distribution  system,"  CDC  director  Dr.  Thomas  Frieden  said  in  a  letter  to  West  Virginia  health  officials  advising  them  on  the  situation.It's  not  uncommon  for  officials  to  issue  different  guidance  for  pregnant  women,  who  are  considered  to  be  more  vulnerable  to  illness  than  the  general  population.  One  reason  why:  even  when  chemicals  have  been  studied,  research  into  the  impact  on  pregnant  women  is  less  common.But  some  have  expressed  concern  that  ever  since  the  spill  started,  guidance  to  the  public  about  the  contaminated  water  has  been  murky.Expert:  'We  don't  know  enough'Residents  first  got  word  of  the  situation  on  January  9,  when  authorities  warned  hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  living  in  nine  West  Virginia  counties  not  to  use  tap  water  or  do  anything  except  flush  their  toilets  with  it.More  than  7,000  gallons  of  the  chemical,  known  as  MCHM,  has  leaked  from  a  storage  tank  into  the  Elk  River  --  a  key  water  supply  source.A  strong  licorice  odor  was  the  telltale  sign  that  the  chemical  was  present,  and  officials  warned  that  they  couldn't  say  the  water  was  safe.Over  the  weekend,  state  health  officials  said  they'd  gotten  guidance  from  the  CDC.  And  starting  Monday,  they  began  giving  the  go-ahead  to  people  in  certain  areas  to  start  using  tap  water  again.Asked  about  the  chemical,  the  CDC  issued  guidance  to  state  authorities  in  West  Virginia  suggesting  the  water  would  be  safe  to  drink  if  samples  met  the  safety  standard  of  1  part  per  million  --  meaning  that  there  is  no  more  than  1  milligram  of  the  chemical  in  1  liter  of  water.Does  that  mean  it's  safe?"Based  on  the  water  sampling  data  that  we  have  seen,  we  think  that  allowing  the  water  to  be  used  for  drinking  and  cooking  and  all  the  other  things  is  perfectly  appropriate,"  said  Dr.  Vikas  Kapil,  chief  medical  officer  for  the  CDC's  National  Center  for  Environmental  Health.The  1  part  per  million  guideline,  he  told  reporters  Thursday,  "is  a  level  not  likely  to  be  associated  with  adverse  health  effects."But  during  situations  like  this,  he  admitted,  there  are  often  questions  investigators  can't  answer  --  at  least  not  at  first.Scott  Simonton,  vice  chairman  of  the  West  Virginia  Environmental  Quality  Board,  said  he  isn't  so  sure  the  water  is  safe."I  don't  think  that  just  because  it's  below  that  number,  it's  magically  safe,"  said  Simonton,  a  professor  of  environmental  science  at  Marshall  University.  "We  don't  know  enough  about  the  toxicity  of  this  particular  chemical  to  know  what  its  long-term  effects  are  and  what  the  maximum  contaminant  level  really  should  be."Officials  had  to  come  up  with  guidelines  quickly  when  the  spill  happened,  he  said.  Normally,  establishing  a  standard  would  be  a  lengthier  process."Right  now,  it's  an  acceptable  standard,"  he  said.  "I  don't  think  anybody  can  genuinely  call  it  a  safe  standard."Gupta,  the  director  of  the  local  health  department,  said  hospital  visits  in  the  area  spiked  mid-week  as  more  people  started  using  their  tap  water."People  come  to  us  and  report  that  right  after  they've  taken  a  shower,  they've  had  this  rash,"  he  said.  "We've  had  people  walk  in  here  with  scary-looking  rashes."Angry  motherCharleston  mother  Jacqueline  Bevan  told  CNN  Thursday  she's  not  going  to  let  her  7-year-old  drink  the  water  even  though  she's  been  told  by  officials  that  it's  safe."If  a  pregnant  woman  can't  drink  this...  no,  we're  not  feeling  safe  here  in  West  Virginia,"  she  said,  adding  that  the  caution  about  pregnant  women  feels  like  "more  disturbing  news."It  "most  upsets  us"  that  "we're  not  given  any  details  about  this  chemical,"  she  said.  The  public  hasn't  been  given  much  information  about  4-methylcyclohexane  methanol.  She  and  others  want  to  know  about  the  chemical's  long-term  effects.The  chemical  is  used  to  wash  coal  before  it  goes  to  market  to  reduce  ash.  Exposure  to  it  can  cause  vomiting,  dizziness,  headaches,  diarrhea  and  irritated  skin,  among  other  symptoms,  the  American  Association  of  Poison  Control  Centers  and  CNN's  previous  reporting  shows.READ:  What  is  4-methylcyclohexane  methanolSaying  that  there's  little  research  on  the  chemical  is  not  good  enough  for  Bevan  and  other  residents,  she  said."This  story  is  going  to  go  away,"  she  said,  but  health  concerns  among  West  Virginians  will  linger  for  a  long  time.Independent  testing  and  what  the  state  saysOn  Wednesday,  independent  testing  of  water  supplies  from  a  hotel  and  a  home  in  southwest  West  Virginia  showed  the  presence  of  4-methylcyclohexane  methanol,  but  both  samples  tested  at  levels  believed  to  be  acceptable  for  consumption.CNN  commissioned  the  testing  of  the  samples  by  TestAmerica,  a  private  company.According  to  the  TestAmerica  study,  samples  taken  Tuesday  showed  the  presence  of  4-methylcyclohexane  methanol  well  below  the  1  part  per  million  considered  safe  to  drink.  Water  in  the  private  residence  tested  at  0.27  parts  per  million,  or  about  a  fourth  of  the  limit,  while  water  at  the  hotel  tested  at  .011  parts  per  million,  roughly  a  hundredth  of  the  limit,  according  to  the  testing  firm.More  than  half  of  the  300,000  West  Virginians  who  hadn't  been  able  to  turn  on  their  faucets  since  last  week  now  have  access  to  safe  water  again,  the  state  said.Wednesday  night,  Laura  Jordan,  external  affairs  manager  for  West  Virginia  American  Water,  said  that  about  51,000  customers  --  or  153,000  people  --  have  had  their  "do  not  use"  water  order  lifted.READ:  Spill  shines  spotlight  on  loose  regulationCNN's  Miriam  Falco  and  Dana  Garrett  contributed  to  this  report</TEXT></DOC>

Literally.A  photo  shared  on  Facebook  some  7,000  times  (a  related  video  got  over  10,000  shares)  shows  the  wild  man  in  mid-leap.  "I  did  a  good  deed  today  by  proving  it's  not  safe  to  jump  off  the  bridge  at  the  San  Antonio  River  Walk,"  he  wrote.  "It's  shallow  —  I  hit  the  bottom  when  I  landed  this  gainer  flip.  #notagoodidea"Not  safe  because  the  water  is  only  about  4  feet  deep.  It's  also  illegal.City  statutes  forbid  anyone  jumping  into  or  swimming  in  the  San  Antonio  River.  Doing  so  can  mean  a  $500  fine.San  Antonio  Police  Sgt.  Javier  Salazar  said  authorities  are  looking  into  the  incident  "to  determine  the  appropriate  course  of  action."It's  not  clear  if  the  entertainer  will  have  to  open  up  his  wallet.  Maybe  he  should  consider  himself  lucky  by  walking  away  from  the  river  stunt."It's  all  fun  and  games  until  you  shatter  the  bottom  of  your  legs,"  wrote  one  fan  on  his  Facebook  page.  Another  chiming  in:  "Wouldn't  you  check  how  deep  the  water  is  first?"Apparently  not.Steve-O  told  the  Houston  Chronicle  he  "had  no  idea  the  water  was  only  four  feet  deep  when  I  jumped  off  this  bridge."  Later,  he  issued  a  statement  blaming  city  officials  for  being  "quite  irresponsible  in  neglecting  to  post  'no  diving'  signs  on  the  various  bridges  along  the  river.""They've  given  no  indication  that  people  shouldn't  jump,  and  done  nothing  to  warn  anyone  about  the  serious  dangers  of  that  shallow  water,"  Steve-O  said.  "Very  irresponsible,  indeed."The  actor/daredevil  added  that  authorities  should  be  thanking,  not  investigating,  him  for  his  jump."I  think  they  should  be  thanking  me  for  informing  people,  rather  than  wasting  their  citizens'  time  and  money  trying  to  vilify  me,"  he  said.Although  he  has  thrilled  and  disgusted  audiences  with  low-brow  antics,  in  recent  years  Steve-O  has  showed  a  more  thoughtful  side.  Last  year,  he  talked  to  HLN's  Jane  Velez  Mitchell  about  his  involvement  in  a  documentary  about  farm  animals  and  his  recent  decision  to  go  vegan  and  get  sober.But  it's  not  all  high  brow.  Just  three  days  before  his  San  Antonio  plunge,  Steve-O  posted  an  Instagram  video  of  a  throwback  stunt  with  striking  similarities."Back  in  1996,  I  did  a  flip  off  a  building  into  4  feet  of  water  while  it  was  snowing,  and  landed  on  my  face,"  he  wrote  "#yeahdude."CNN's  Greg  Botelho  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

It's  the  most  common  cancer  in  children.His  mother  says  his  condition  has  improved  so  much  following  treatment  with  medical  marijuana  that  chemotherapy  isn't  needed.  But  the  Children's  Hospital  of  Colorado,  she  says,  disagreed.It  all  started  back  in  September  2012.  Landon,  then  2,  was  living  with  his  mother,  Sierra  Riddle,  in  St.  George,  Utah,  when  he  developed  a  sore  throat  and  swollen  lymph  nodes.  The  emergency  room  doctor  said  it  was  a  virus  and  sent  him  home.Two  days  later  he  went  back.  His  armpits  were  swollen."They  thought  it  was  either  a  virus  or  infection  in  the  lymph  nodes,  so  they  gave  him  some  antibiotics,"  Sierra  Riddle  says.But  on  the  fifth  day,  his  mother  says  she  was  changing  his  diaper  and  noticed  his  groin  was  also  swollen,  as  well  as  his  abdomen  and  throat.  He  was  having  trouble  breathing.That  time,  she  got  a  frightening  diagnosis:  cancer.New  York  governor  announces  plan  for  medical  marijuana  at  hospitalsLandon  was  flown  to  a  children's  hospital  in  Salt  Lake  City."His  whole  chest  was  full  of  leukemia  tumors,  which  is  why  he  couldn't  breathe,"  his  mother  says.  "They  started  him  on  chemo,  but  told  us  that  he  probably  wasn't  going  to  make  it."Landon's  cancer  had  quickly  progressed,  leading  doctors  to  give  him  an  8%  chance  of  survival,  she  says.In  general,  ALL  is  one  of  the  most  curable  cancers.  According  to  the  American  Cancer  Society,  more  than  90%  of  children  diagnosed  with  the  disease  survive.Chemotherapy  is  the  standard  treatment,  and  Riddle  says  doctors  put  Landon  on  a  four-year  treatment  plan.  The  first  two  months  of  chemo  went  fairly  well,  but  then  Landon  became  extremely  ill."Most  days  he  couldn't  get  off  the  couch,"  Riddle  remembers.  "He  would  just  lay  there  and  throw  up  and  throw  up."Riddle  says  he  also  developed  neuropathy  --  a  symptom  of  nerve  damage  that  can  cause  weakness,  numbness  and  pain  --  in  his  legs  that  left  him  barely  able  to  walk.Around  that  time,  a  friend  set  up  a  Facebook  page  called  Offer  Hope  for  Landon,  and  recommendations  started  streaming  in,  including  several  endorsing  cannabis  --  medical  marijuana  --  as  a  treatment.Medical  marijuana,  however,  isn't  legal  in  Utah.  Still,  desperate  for  answers,  Sierra  Riddle  and  her  mother,  Wendy  Riddle,  started  looking  into  it.They  considered  going  to  California  or  Oregon.  Then  their  research  led  them  to  the  Stanley  brothers  in  Colorado.  The  six  brothers  are  one  of  that  state's  biggest  cannabis  growers  and  dispensary  owners.The  Stanleys  produce  about  500  pounds  of  medical  marijuana  a  year.  At  the  time,  much  of  it  was  high  in  THC  --  tetrahydrocannabinol,  the  psychoactive  ingredient  in  pot  that  gets  users  high  but  also  helps  patients  with  an  array  of  conditions  including  pain  and  nausea.But  the  Stanleys  were  also  growing  something  quite  revolutionary:  a  plant  cross-bred  to  reduce  the  THC  and  increase  another  compound  found  in  cannabis  called  cannabidiol,  or  CBD.  Many  researchers  believe  CBD  is  one  of  the  compounds  in  marijuana  that  has  medicinal  benefits.  According  to  the  National  Cancer  Institute,  it's  thought  to  have  significant  analgesic,  anti-inflammatory  and  anti-tumor  activity  without  the  psychoactive  effect.The  Stanleys  expect  to  produce  over  1,000  pounds  this  year,  most  of  it  the  cross-bred  variety,  according  to  Joel  Stanley.Dr.  Sanjay  Gupta:  Why  I  changed  my  mind  on  weedRiddle,  herself  a  recovering  heroin  addict,  struggled  with  the  idea  of  giving  Landon  marijuana."I  was  telling  my  mom,  you  know,  'We  really  need  to  think  about  this.'"But,  says  Riddle,  her  son  was  already  prescribed  medications  like  OxyContin  and  morphine  --  medications  with  significant  side  effects.Landon  suffered  from  stomach  failure,  and  "the  OxyContin  made  him  so  miserable,  when  he  had  hair,  he  would  literally  try  to  pull  his  hair  out."In  the  end,  she  decided  she  had  nothing  else  to  lose  and  moved  to  Colorado.  She  rented  a  room,  got  Landon's  medical  marijuana  card  and  began  giving  him  marijuana  --  THC  for  the  pain  and  nausea,  but  also  CBD.  The  dose  was  based  on  Landon's  weight.  He  first  took  it  in  oil  form,  but  now  takes  a  pill.Once  the  doses  started,  "Landon's  (red  and  white  blood  cell)  counts  increased  dramatically,"  she  says.Six  months  later,  encouraged  by  Landon's  progress,  she  stopped  his  chemotherapy  treatments  completely."Once  I  took  the  chemo  out,  I  see  these  amazing  results.  And  no  more  need  for  blood  transfusion  and  platelet  transfusions,"  Riddle  says.  "I  think  that  the  chemo  in  combination  with  the  cannabis  did  put  him  into  remission  and  now  the  cannabis  will  keep  him  there."But  Landon's  doctor  at  the  Children's  Hospital  of  Colorado  was  shocked."She  told  me  with  no  uncertainty  that  if  I  refused  chemo,  she  would  have  no  choice  but  to  report  me  to  the  proper  authorities,"  Riddle  says.So  Riddle  found  a  lawyer  willing  to  take  her  case."Nobody  wants  to  hurt  Landon  here,"  says  attorney  Warren  Edson.  "This  is  about  making  him  better.  We  have  no  problem  making  sure  he's  monitored  throughout  this  process.  And  again,  if  there's  any  indication  this  is  doing  him  harm,  I  can't  imagine  Sierra  doing  anything  other  than  the  right  thing."Medical  marijuana  helps  stem  6-year-old's  seizuresChildren's  Hospital  Colorado,  in  a  statement,  says  it  is  "committed  to  protecting  the  well-being  of  our  patients."  The  hospital  says  it  cannot  discuss  specific  cases,  but  provided  information  from  Dr.  Stephen  Hunger,  director  of  the  hospital's  Center  for  Cancer  and  Blood  Disorders.Hunger  noted  that  childhood  cancer  remains  the  leading  cause  of  death  by  disease  among  American  children;  that  about  25%  of  childhood  cancers  are  ALL;  and  that  the  survival  rate  for  children  with  ALL  treated  by  Children's  Oncology  Group  research  trials  is  over  90%,  attained  with  two  to  three  years  of  chemotherapy.Children's  Hospital  Colorado  is  "one  of  the  largest  centers  in  the  country  that  treats  children  with  ALL,"  the  statement  says."The  Center  for  Cancer  and  Blood  Disorders  at  Children's  Hospital  Colorado  has  always  done  its  best  to  work  closely  with  families  to  provide  the  most  appropriate  treatment  for  cancer,  while  also  seeking  to  minimize  side  effects  and  maximize  quality  of  life."Today,  chemotherapy  is  a  required  part  of  therapy  for  children  with  leukemia.  Many  supportive  care  medications  are  used  in  children  and  adults  with  cancer,  including  those  considered  to  be  complementary  and  alternative  medicine  (also  referred  to  as  integrative  health)."Marijuana  or  a  product  derived  from  marijuana  is  often  used  to  decrease  side  effects  in  adults  with  cancer,"  the  hospital  says.  "There  are  several  FDA-approved  and  commercially  available  anti-nausea  medicines  derived  from  marijuana  (cannabinoids)  that  are  frequently  used  by  adults  and  children  with  cancer,  and  we  often  prescribe  these  medications."In  an  effort  to  stave  off  a  legal  wrangle,  Riddle,  her  mother  and  Edson  met  with  the  doctors  in  charge  of  Landon's  care  in  October."They  said  they  were  willing  to  work  with  us.  They  said  they  were  willing  to  alter  the  chemo  plan,  and  they  did  not,"  Riddle  says.Child  protective  services  --  which  Riddle  says  had  already  been  notified  and  visited  the  family's  home  --  was  also  at  the  meeting,  along  with  Dr.  Margaret  Gedde,  who  wrote  Landon's  original  prescription  for  marijuana  and  is  monitoring  his  care."I  could  see  a  large  gulf  between  the  doctors  who  were  making  the  point  this  is  a  fatal  disease  --  'You  know,  he  needs  this  treatment  to  survive,'  and  pretty  much  that  was  their  stance,"  says  Gedde."The  family  wanted  to  discuss  more  alternative  modes  of  treatment  and  really  things  that  wouldn't  make  him  so  sick,  but  again,  the  doctors  being  convinced  that  really  it  had  to  be  done  the  way  that  they  were  used  to  it  (being  done)  --  that  just  made  it  very  much  really  a  confrontation  there  of  two  different  mindsets.  I  felt  sympathetic  to  both."Child  protection  officials  declined  comment  on  the  case.The  American  Cancer  Society,  meanwhile,  cautions  that  cannabinoids  have  not  been  tested  in  humans  to  determine  if  they  can  lower  cancer  risk."There  are  many  challenges  with  marijuana  research  as  it  relates  to  cancer,"  the  organization  says  in  a  statement.  "While  it  shows  promise  for  controlling  cancer  pain  among  some  patients,  there  is  still  concern  that  marijuana  may  cause  toxic  side  effects  in  some  people  and  that  the  benefits  of  THC  must  be  carefully  weighed  against  its  potential  risks.  There  is  no  available  scientific  evidence  from  controlled  studies  in  humans  that  cannabinoids  can  cure  or  treat  cancer."Is  medical  marijuana  safe  for  children?For  now,  Landon  is  still  in  remission  with  no  sign  of  recurrence.  Still,  Gedde  is  cautious  and  says  she  can't  recommend  cannabis  over  chemo."When  you  look  at  children  who  go  through  that  same  course  of  treatment  and  compare  Landon  to  them,  it  seems  like  he's  doing  better  than  what  would  be  expected,"  she  says."I'm  very  hopeful  and  very  encouraged  that  the  CBD  is  probably  having  a  beneficial  effect  for  him,  but  I  think  we're  still  looking  to  have  the  disease  course  play  out  and  find  out.  I  think  in  cancer,  you  don't  really  know  until  later."Meanwhile,  Edson  says  child  protection  officials  have  not  yet  filed  a  case."We  will  continue  to  monitor  Landon's  health,  make  sure  he's  getting  the  proper  blood  tests  and  other  checks  to  see  what's  going  on  with  him  healthwise,"  he  says.In  December,  Sierra  Riddle  notified  Landon's  doctors  that  she  plans  to  transfer  his  care.  She's  searching  for  a  physician  willing  to  work  with  her  to  reduce  the  amount  of  steroids  and  chemotherapy  he  takes.Wendy  Riddle  says  they  have  no  regrets  and  will  continue  to  fight."It's  not  just  fighting  for  Landon.  It's  not  just  about  him,  it's  about  all  of  the  kids  to  come,"  she  says.  "When  Landon  is  15  years  old  and  we  talk  about  this,  I  want  Landon  to  know  that  we  did  everything  in  our  power  to  be  compassionate  in  his  care  and  to  protect  him."</TEXT></DOC>

Local  security  guards  reported  seeing  Kitterman's  car  leave  the  compound  at  11  p.m.  that  night.  His  body  was  found  the  next  day  in  the  Green  Zone.Andrew  Ames,  a  spokesman  for  the  FBI,  said  Friday  that  "the  manner  in  which  the  murder  was  carried  out  has  not  been  released."  CNN  reported  in  June  2009  that  Kitterman  was  found  bound,  blindfolded  and  fatally  stabbed.His  now-defunct  company  had  about  45  employees  that  were  primarily  from  the  United  States  and  Philippines,  the  FBI  said.The  agency  has  distributed  posters  in  Arabic  and  Tagalog  announcing  the  award  money  for  any  information  leading  to  the  arrest  of  those  responsible,  because  it  believes  a  former  employee  may  have  some  clues."The  investigation  itself  has  included  hundreds  of  interviews  during  the  past  five  years  with  potential  witnesses  in  the  U.S.,  Iraq,  Afghanistan  and  the  Philippines,  but  despite  that  we  still  need  the  public's  help,"  the  FBI  said.The  reward  is  for  information  leading  to  the  identification,  arrest  and  conviction  of  the  person  or  persons  responsible  for  the  death,  the  agency  said.</TEXT></DOC>

(In  his  letter  to  the  singer,  Ramirez  explains  that  he  believes  that  a  "normal"  family  is  comprised  of  a  man  and  a  woman  and  children).His  comments  were  met  with  critics  who  accused  him  of  censorship,  but  others  supported  his  stance,  saying  the  video  goes  too  far."I  think  the  message  that  Shakira  is  sending  to  the  youth  and  children  around  the  world  is  a  message  that  sells  a  lifestyle  and  promotes  a  particular  orientation,  that  in  my  opinion,  does  not  reflect  the  views  of  most  Colombians,"  Ramirez  said.In  Colombia,  Shakira  is  more  than  a  music  star.  She  is  an  important  advocate  and  philanthropist  who  has  a  foundation  to  help  impoverished  children  in  Colombia  and  has  been  a  UNICEF  goodwill  ambassador.Ramirez  calls  himself  a  fan  of  Shakira,  and  argues  that  precisely  because  of  her  talent  and  fame,  she  doesn't  need  sex  to  sell  her  albums.She  has  a  social  responsibility,  Ramirez  said,  to  not  repeat  stereotypes  of  women  in  music.Asked  if  he  would  back  the  ban  of  dozens  of  other  artists  who  depict  sex,  smoking  or  drinking  in  their  music  or  videos,  Ramirez  said  Shakira's  case  is  different  because  so  many  children  look  up  to  her.Shakira  has  not  responded  to  CNN  requests  for  response  to  the  politician's  claims.READ:  Gerard  Pique  and  Shakira:  Power  couple  'a  normal  family'</TEXT></DOC>

While  it  may  seem  harmless  to  portray  Latinos  as  sexy,  these  typecasts  limit  the  roles  for  actors  in  Hollywood,  says  actor  Esai  Morales.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  The  headlines  for  the  new  season  of  ABC's  "The  Bachelor"  read:  "The  Bachelor  returns  with  its  first  Latino,"  "Hola,  Juan  Pablo,"  and  "Expect  'lots  of  Latino'  fun."And  millions  are  tuning  in  to  watch  Juan  Pablo  Galavis,  a  32-year-old  former  professional  soccer  player  who  is  American-born  but  grew  up  in  Venezuela.The  "sexy,  hot-blooded  Latino"  is  one  of  many  stereotypes  that  is  prevalent  in  Hollywood.  And,  as  the  Hispanic  population  continues  to  grow,  more  and  more  attention  is  being  drawn  to  how  Latinos  are  represented  in  television  and  film.While  it  may  seem  harmless  to  portray  Latinos  as  sexy,  these  typecasts  limit  the  roles  for  actors  in  Hollywood,  said  actor  Esai  Morales."Latinos  are  either  cast  as  either  the  overly  hormonal  ("Oh  mamacita,  I  have  to  have  you"),  overly  hysterical  ("Lucy!"),  overly  hostile  ("I'll  cut  you  sucka!"),  or  overly  humble  ("We  are  a  poor  people"),"  Morales  told  CNN  in  a  recent  interview.Those,  according  to  Morales,  are  the  "four  H's  of  Hollywood"  that  make  up  Hollywood's  patronizing  formula  for  Latino  actors.  And,  Morales  said,  it's  the  reason  why  Hispanics  rarely  play  heroes  or  leaders."It's  just  broad  strokes,"  said  Morales,  whose  acting  credits  include  "24,"  "NYPD  Blue,"  and  "Criminal  Minds.""I  don't  want  to  be  the  'spice'  added  to  a  show,  I'm  not  a  condiment!"Just  last  month,  Britney  Spears  unknowingly  touched  on  two  of  those  stereotypes  during  an  interview  with  Univision.When  asked  what  Spears  likes  most  about  Latino  culture,  she  said:  "I  think  it's  very  sexy.  I've  always  loved  Latinos.  They  make  me  think  of  a  bad-boy  type  that  your  father  wouldn't  let  you  go  out  with."Some  gossip  websites  seized  on  her  comments,  describing  them  as  "racist,"  which  might  be  a  stretch."She  didn't  mean  it  badly,  but  it  shows  how  seriously  under-educated  she  is  and  how  little  big  stars  know  about  the  Latino  community,"  Morales  said.Hispanic  marketing  expert  Gabriel  Reyes  said  America's  pervasive  need  to  sexualize  Latinos  as  "exotics"  is  based  on  strong  archetypes  that  have  been  built  up  for  generations  within  Latino  culture.Because  of  that,  Reyes  said,  stereotypes  like  the  Latin  lover,  the  Latina  bombshell,  or  the  meek  and  lowly  servant  will  take  a  long  time  to  be  eradicated  from  film  and  television.The  National  Hispanic  Media  Coalition  commissioned  a  study  on  the  impact  of  media  portrayals  of  Latinos  and  immigrants  that  revealed  that  news  and  entertainment  media  have  a  strong  influence  on  non-Latinos'  perceptions  of  Latinos  and  immigrants.In  other  words,  media  plays  an  integral  part  in  how  a  certain  group  of  people  are  viewed  and  that  has  profound  consequences  in  society.  That's  something  Spears'  comments  reflect,  according  to  Reyes."Britney  is  simply  another  non-Latino  stating  what  so  many  already  believe,"  said  Reyes,  president  of  Reyes  Entertainment.The  National  Hispanic  Media  Coalition  supports  ABC  in  selecting  the  first  minority  bachelor  in  the  show's  11-year  history.  But  the  coalition's  president  said  there's  room  for  improvement."Within  one  Latino  family  you'll  have  those  who  are  very  light  to  a  very  dark  complexion,  a  whole  spectrum  of  coloration,"  said  coalition  president  and  CEO  Alex  Nogales.  "While  Juan  Pablo's  presence  on  'The  Bachelor'  is  a  step  in  the  right  direction,  I  would  love  to  see  more  Latinos  on  screen  that  are  mestizos."The  New  York  Post  wrote  that  ABC's  bachelor  pick  "looks  so  white  he  could  easily  slip  into  a  Mitt  Romney  family  photo."Most  Latinos  identify  as  mestizo,  a  mix  of  indigenous  and  European  descent,  but  --  like  "The  Bachelor"  star  --  not  all  Latinos  are  olive-skinned  with  dark  hair.  Some  Latinos  are  black  like  Victor  Cruz  or  Tristan  Wilds  and  others  look  completely  European,  like  Vanna  White  or  Ryan  Lochte.Latin  America's  diverse  racial  demographics  are  from  a  mixed-race  background  made  up  of  European,  African  and  indigenous  cultures.  Galavis  may  not  represent  the  typical  Hispanic  man,  but  he  is  very  much  Latino.The  show  declined  to  comment  on  why  it  chose  Galavis,  but  his  "Latino"  presence  seems  more  like  a  strategic  business  move  than  a  newfound  love  for  the  Latino  community.In  2012,  a  class  action  lawsuit  was  filed  against  the  reality  show's  producers,  accusing  them  of  racial  discrimination.  The  suit  was  eventually  dismissed  by  a  judge  who  ruled  it  couldn't  survive  First  Amendment  review.No  network  wants  that  kind  of  publicity,  especially  since  ABC  falls  within  the  top  three  rated  networks  in  measured  Hispanic  households,  a  coveted  audience  with  a  collective  buying  power  of  more  than  $1  trillion,  mostly  driven  by  Latinas,  according  to  Nielsen.Galavis'  ethnicity  and  the  fact  he  has  such  a  light  complexion  can  kill  two  birds  with  one  stone:  appealing  to  the  Hispanic  audience  while  still  carrying  general  market  appeal.Reyes  believes  Latinos  have  bigger  fish  to  fry,  with  immigration  reform  high  on  the  list  of  priorities  for  many  and  midterm  elections  around  the  corner."Latinos  have  other  things  to  worry  about,  like  the  lack  of  voter  participation.  That's  where  the  key  to  exercising  our  power  lies,"  Reyes  said.When  "Modern  Family"  debuted,  the  show  received  a  lot  of  flak  and  praise  for  casting  Sofia  Vergara  as  Gloria  Pritchett,  the  trophy  wife  of  Jay  Pritchett.  Supporters  applauded  ABC  for  giving  the  role  to  a  Latina  actress,  but  critics  said  she  was  playing  up  the  role  of  the  stereotypical  "hysterical  loud  Latina."Morales  believes  in  order  to  break  the  stereotype  cycle  in  Hollywood,  a  combination  of  things  need  to  happen:  Sought  after  talents  like  director  Steven  Spielberg  need  to  tell  the  stories  of  the  Hispanic  community,  and  more  Latinos  need  to  be  producers  and  directors,  to  help  tell  these  stories  the  right  way.He  said  that's  starting  to  happen."Did  I  mention  I'm  taking  on  a  new  job?"  Morales  said.  "I  get  to  play  the  president  of  the  United  States!"Morales  is  referring  to  his  starring  role  as  President  Julian  Navarro  on  "The  Brink,"  an  upcoming  pilot  on  HBO  that  also  stars  Tim  Robbins  and  Jack  Black,  who  are  also  reportedly  producing  the  new  series.While  the  Spearses  of  the  world  and  tacky  marketing  tactics  may  still  get  their  moment  in  the  sun,  Morales  said  he  thinks  Hollywood  has  gotten  better  than  when  he  started."It's  up  to  us  (Latino  actors)  now.  There  are  a  lot  more  Latino  characters  on  TV  now.  The  key  is  to  not  let  it  just  be  a  'Latino  wave,'  and  to  be  undeniably  good."</TEXT></DOC>

You  can  write  it  with  one  fluid  swoop  of  a  pen  or  one  tap  of  the  keyboard.  The  most  commonly  used  letter  in  the  English  dictionary.  Simple,  right?Now  imagine  it  printed  out  millions  of  times  on  thousands  of  forms  and  documents.  Then  think  of  how  much  ink  would  be  needed.OK,  so  that  may  have  been  a  first  for  you,  but  it  came  naturally  to  14-year-old  Suvir  Mirchandani  when  he  was  trying  to  think  of  ways  to  cut  waste  and  save  money  at  his  Pittsburgh-area  middle  school.It  all  started  as  a  science  fair  project.  As  a  neophyte  sixth-grader  at  Dorseyville  Middle  School,  Suvir  noticed  he  was  getting  a  lot  more  handouts  than  he  did  in  elementary  school.Interested  in  applying  computer  science  to  promote  environmental  sustainability,  Suvir  decided  he  was  going  to  figure  out  if  there  was  a  better  way  to  minimize  the  constant  flurry  of  paper  and  ink.Reducing  paper  use  through  recycling  and  dual-sided  printing  had  been  talked  about  before  as  a  way  to  save  money  and  conserve  resources,  but  there  was  less  attention  paid  to  the  ink  for  which  the  paper  served  as  a  canvas  for  history  and  algebra  handouts."Ink  is  two  times  more  expensive  than  French  perfume  by  volume,"  Suvir  says  with  a  chuckle.He's  right:  Chanel  No.  5  perfume  costs  $38  per  ounce,  while  the  equivalent  amount  of  Hewlett-Packard  printer  ink  can  cost  up  to  $75.So  Suvir  decided  to  focus  his  project  on  finding  ways  to  cut  down  on  the  costly  liquid.Collecting  random  samples  of  teachers'  handouts,  Suvir  concentrated  on  the  most  commonly  used  characters  (e,  t,  a,  o  and  r).First,  he  charted  how  often  each  character  was  used  in  four  different  typefaces:  Garamond,  Times  New  Roman,  Century  Gothic  and  Comic  Sans.  Then  he  measured  how  much  ink  was  used  for  each  letter,  using  a  commercial  tool  called  APFill®  Ink  Coverage  Software.Next  he  enlarged  the  letters,  printed  them  and  cut  them  out  on  cardstock  paper  to  weigh  them  to  verify  his  findings.  He  did  three  trials  for  each  letter,  graphing  the  ink  usage  for  each  font.From  this  analysis,  Suvir  figured  out  that  by  using  Garamond  with  its  thinner  strokes,  his  school  district  could  reduce  its  ink  consumption  by  24%,  and  in  turn  save  as  much  as  $21,000  annually.Encouraged  by  his  teacher,  Suvir  looked  to  publish  his  findings  and  stumbled  on  the  Journal  for  Emerging  Investigators  (JEI),  a  publication  founded  by  a  group  of  Harvard  grad  students  in  2011  that  provides  a  forum  for  the  work  of  middle  school  and  high  school  students.  It  has  the  same  standards  as  academic  journals,  and  each  submission  is  reviewed  by  grad  students  and  academics.Sarah  Fankhauser,  one  of  JEI's  founders,  says  that  of  the  nearly  200  submissions  they  have  received  since  2011,  Suvir's  project  was  a  real  standout:"We  were  so  impressed.  We  really  could  really  see  the  real-world  application  in  Suvir's  paper."Fankhauser  said  Suvir's  findings  were  so  clear,  simple  and  well  thought-out,  it  had  the  peer  reviewers  at  JEI  asking,  "How  much  potential  savings  is  really  out  there?"For  the  answer,  JEI  challenged  Suvir  to  apply  his  project  to  a  larger  scale:  the  federal  government.With  an  annual  printing  expenditure  of  $1.8  billion,  the  government  was  a  much  more  challenging  task  than  his  school  science  project.Suvir  repeated  his  tests  on  five  sample  pages  from  documents  on  the  Government  Printing  Office  website  and  got  similar  results  --  change  the  font,  save  money.Will  government  printers  embrace  a  change?Using  the  General  Services  Administration's  estimated  annual  cost  of  ink  --  $467  million  --  Suvir  concluded  that  if  the  federal  government  used  Garamond  exclusively  it  could  save  nearly  30%  --  or  $136  million  per  year.  An  additional  $234  million  could  be  saved  annually  if  state  governments  also  jumped  on  board,  he  reported.Gary  Somerset,  media  and  public  relations  manager  at  the  Government  Printing  Office,  describes  Suvir's  work  as  "remarkable."  But  he  was  noncommittal  on  whether  the  GPO  would  introduce  changes  to  typeface,  saying  the  GPO's  efforts  to  become  more  environmentally  sustainable  were  focused  on  shifting  content  to  the  Web."In  1994,  we  were  producing  20,000  copies  a  day  of  both  the  Federal  Register  and  Congressional  Record.  Twenty  years  later,  we  produce  roughly  2,500  print  copies  a  day,"  he  said.On  top  of  this,  the  Congressional  Register  is  printed  on  recycled  paper,  which  GPO  has  been  doing  for  five  or  six  years,  Somerset  says.Suvir  said  he  appreciates  the  government's  efforts  to  transition  from  paper  to  digital,  but  he  still  thinks  his  project  is  relevant."They  can't  convert  everything  to  a  digital  format;  not  everyone  is  able  to  access  information  online.  Some  things  still  have  to  be  printed,"  Suvir  argues.And  even  if  it's  not  the  government  but  consumers  doing  the  printing,  ink  savings  could  still  be  made.Holding  out  hopeEven  at  14,  Suvir  understands  how  difficult  such  a  project  might  be  to  implement  --  "I  recognize  it's  difficult  to  change  someone's  behavior.  That's  the  most  difficult  part."But  he  holds  out  hope:  "I  definitely  would  love  to  see  some  actual  changes  and  I'd  be  happy  to  go  as  far  as  possible  to  make  that  change  possible."With  decades  ahead  to  lend  a  hand,  Suvir  and  other  young  men  and  women  like  him  may  even  be  able  to  untangle  some  of  the  knotty  political  and  technical  issues  that  beset  Washington,  corporate  suites  and  the  world  at  large.Know  a  young  entrepreneur?'Godfather'  of  Helvetica  font  dies  at  84</TEXT></DOC>

Setting  aside  arguments  around  the  medical  efficacy  of  marijuana,  these  iReporters  shared  their  opinions  on  the  recreational  benefits  of  the  herb  --  some  citing  increased  relaxation,  creativity  and  a  viable  alternative  to  alcohol.  No  current  marijuana  users  wanted  their  names  used;  recreational  weed  is  still  illegal  in  most  of  the  country  at  the  state  and  federal  levels.From  college  students  to  seasoned  computer  engineers,  meet  some  of  the  people  who  want  their  cannabis  hobby  legalized:People  are  'missing  out'Twenty-year-old  iReporter  carcar1  started  smoking  pot  to  help  her  fall  asleep  at  night.  But  marijuana  is  more  than  just  a  sleep  remedy  for  her  nowadays.  The  university  student  from  Allentown,  Pennsylvania,  works  as  a  security  dispatcher  at  her  school  and  uses  marijuana  recreationally.To  say  she  enjoys  smoking  marijuana  is  an  understatement.  "I  LOVE  POT!"  she  enthusiastically  wrote  in  an  e-mail  to  CNN.  "I  like  to  smoke  with  a  couple  people  after  all  my  work  is  done  and  the  day  is  over  to  unwind  and  relax.  I  recommend  everyone  does  that."Since  she  started  smoking  regularly  in  college,  she  said  she  feels  well  rested.  "It  definitely  does  not  affect  my  grades,"  she  said.  "This  semester  I  got  straight  As  and  I  am  also  on  the  Dean's  List."  Even  her  parents  and  grandmother  know  she  smokes  pot,  and  they  don't  mind  it.  But  she  says  they  do  worry  about  her  getting  caught.She  can't  understand  why  other  states  are  not  going  toward  legalization.  "I  am  very  pro  pot,"  she  said.  "Many  people  have  no  idea  what  they  are  missing  out  on."Marijuana  'makes  me  a  better  person'Computer  engineer  farmer808  has  been  smoking  since  middle  school,  when  he  says  he  saw  his  parents  doing  it.  Now  he's  in  his  forties  and  still  turns  to  marijuana  after  work  to  relax.  Toking  up  is  a  family  activity  --  his  wife  and  college-age  children  partake  in  it,  too."My  day  gets  better  and  my  emotional  health  improves  the  moment  I  spark  up.  For  me,  it  is  a  beautiful  thing  that  allows  me  to  be  more  of  a  positive  person,"  he  said.  "I  can't  speak  for  anyone  else,  but  for  me,  marijuana  is  a  boon  to  my  life  and  helps  me  treat  my  fellow  humans  with  the  patience  and  kindness  they  deserve."Regular  marijuana  use  on  the  riseHe'd  like  to  see  his  state  of  Hawaii  take  the  next  steps  toward  legalizing  retail  sales  of  marijuana.  He  asked  not  to  be  identified  because  "there  are  many  people  who  still  despise  marijuana  users"  and  he  worried  about  it  affecting  his  career  at  a  multinational  company."I  am  a  high  performing,  innovative,  overachiever  who  uses  marijuana  to  relax  after  a  hard  day's  work,"  he  said.  "I  have  two  college  degrees  and  over  a  dozen  patents  in  computer  science.  Like  any  habit,  abuse  leads  to  problems,  but  properly  used  in  moderation  I  feel  that  marijuana  is  a  boon  to  society."Just  want  to  enjoy  the  'blessed  herb'CELESTIAL96  says  he  grew  up  in  the  "Flower  Child  Revolution."  The  magazine  writer,  author  and  journalist  first  started  smoking  marijuana  recreationally  in  the  1970s  while  living  in  Los  Angeles."It  made  a  person  feel  mellow  and  creative,  it  gave  you  a  high  without  a  hangover,  and  it  even  had  a  spiritual  touch  to  it,"  he  wrote  in  his  iReport.But  it  wasn't  until  he  relocated  to  the  Caribbean  to  become  an  editor  at  a  weekly  paper  that  he  started  smoking  marijuana  regularly,  about  once  a  month.  "I  cut  down  on  my  drinking  and  my  quality  of  life  as  well  as  my  creativity  as  a  writer  took  off,"  he  said.  "It  just  gives  a  very  warm,  mellow  creative  high  that  can't  be  explained.  It  has  to  be  experienced."My  relationship  to  the  'blessed  herb,'  as  the  islanders  call  it,  is  one  of  respect  and  awe,"  he  said.He  says  ganja,  another  Caribbean  colloquialism  for  marijuana,  awakens  his  mind  and  spirit  when  it  is  smoked  properly.  "I  have  never  had  a  bad  experience  with  cannabis,"  he  said.Now  in  his  seventies  and  back  in  the  states,  he  wants  to  be  able  to  enjoy  smoking  recreationally  again.  "I  think  marijuana  should  be  decriminalized  and  made  legal  in  every  state,"  he  said.  "I  divide  my  time  between  Pennsylvania  and  Missouri,  and  wish  both  states  would  change  the  law  on  recreational  use  of  marijuana."Pot  lets  me  'be  a  productive  citizen'If  recreational  marijuana  were  legal,  security  guard  and  father  Tokahontas  (yes,  we  chuckled  at  the  username  too)  says  he  would  never  drink  alcohol  again.It's  a  bold  statement,  but  he's  been  a  firm  Mary  Jane  fan  for  the  past  30  years,  smoking  occasionally  whenever  he  can  get  his  hands  on  marijuana.  He  says  it  allows  him  "to  get  up  the  next  day,  hangover  free,  and  be  a  productive  citizen."It  sounds  like  his  wife  prefers  him  that  way,  too."She  says  that  when  my  friends  and  I  get  together  and  drink  alcohol  ...  we  act  childish  and  stupid  and  sometimes  even  furniture  gets  broken.  Plus  she  usually  has  to  fight  with  one  of  us  not  to  get  behind  the  wheel,"  he  wrote  in  his  iReport.  "But  when  we  gather  to  smoke  a  little  bit,  she  says  we  are  all  easygoing  and  hassle  free.  Our  biggest  concern  on  pot  night  is  whether  or  not  we  gave  the  Domino's  guy  the  right  address."Even  Lady  Gaga  knows  pot  isn't  harmlessIf  pot  were  legalized  in  North  Carolina,  the  "sweet  leaf"  would  be  "my  wine  at  the  end  of  the  day,"  he  said.  "If  pot  is  the  gateway  drug,  the  only  drug  it  has  led  me  to  is  more  pot."Benefits  'far  outweigh'  the  downsidesDavid  Harper,  65,  says  if  pot  sales  were  legalized  where  he  lives  he  would  absolutely  buy  --  although  he's  skeptical  it  will  ever  happen  in  his  home  state  of  Texas.  The  veteran  and  retired  electrical  engineer  took  his  first  hit  when  he  was  24."Back  in  the  early  '70s  you  took  what  you  could  get,"  he  said.  Whether  the  marijuana  was  called  "Mexican"  or  "Jamaican"  or  "Maui  Wowi"  he  tried  it.  His  college  was  lax  about  marijuana  use,  so  he  and  his  roommates  smoked  whenever  they  wanted  in  school."For  me,  the  best  part  was  the  relaxation  of  both  mind  and  body,"  he  said.  The  former  engineering  major  used  to  use  it  as  a  study  aid  because  his  mind  would  wander  while  reading  his  textbooks  at  night.  "After  taking  a  couple  of  tokes  --  enough  to  get  a  nice  buzz  --  I  found  that  it  was  much  easier  to  concentrate."He  smoked  pot  throughout  college,  but  stopped  after  graduating  out  of  fear  he'd  get  arrested.  "This  was  unfortunate  as,  looking  back,  I  would  definitely  say  that  some  of  my  best  [electrical]  work  was  done  during  the  early  years  of  my  career  when  I  was  using  pot,"  he  said.Although  he  no  longer  uses  marijuana,  he  is  thrilled  to  see  that  states  like  Colorado  and  Washington  are  taking  progressive  steps  toward  legalizing  the  retail  sale  of  marijuana."The  benefits  far  outweigh  any  potential  downsides,"  he  said.</TEXT></DOC>

"Because  we  were  concerned  that  there  may  have  been  a  breach  or  vulnerability  in  the  CIA  local  area  network  on  which  CIA  stored  these  documents,  CIA  information  technology  specialists  were  asked  to  conduct  a  limited  review  to  determine  whether  these  files  were  located  on  the  side  of  the  CIA  network  the  committee  was  authorized  to  use.  That  review  appeared  to  confirm  the  committee's  unauthorized  access  to  the  documents."</TEXT></DOC>

"So  what's  been  valuable  about  this  summit  is  that  it  has  not  just  been  talk,  it's  been  action."Hours  after  Obama  landed  Monday  in  The  Netherlands  for  the  summit,  the  White  House  announced  a  deal  to  dispose  of  huge  quantities  of  nuclear  material  from  Japan.Obama  credited  the  heads  of  state  who  participated  in  the  effort,  "as  well  as  the  extraordinary  work  of  foreign  ministers  and  sherpas  and  others  who  have  helped  to  move  this  process  forward."The  United  States  is  doing  its  part,  too,  by  installing  more  radiation  detection  equipment  at  ports  and  other  transit  sites  to  thwart  would-be  smugglers  of  nuclear  materials;  by  developing  guidelines  to  strengthen  cybersecurity  at  nuclear  power  plants;  and  by  pursuing  production  of  an  isotope  used  in  medicine  that  does  not  require  weapons-usable  materials,  he  said.But  more  work  is  to  be  done  "to  fully  secure  all  nuclear  and  radiological  material  ...  so  that  it  can  no  longer  pose  a  risk  to  our  citizens,"  he  added."Given  the  catastrophic  consequences  of  even  a  single  attack,  we  cannot  be  complacent."He  noted  that  Ukraine  agreed  at  the  first  such  summit,  in  2010,  to  remove  its  highly  enriched  uranium  from  its  nuclear  fuel  sites.  "Had  that  not  happened,  those  dangerous  nuclear  materials  would  still  be  there  now,  and  the  difficult  situation  we  are  dealing  with  in  Ukraine  today  would  involve  yet  another  level  of  concern."Before  the  next  such  summit,  to  be  held  in  2016  in  Chicago,  "we  have  to  set  very  clearly  what  are  the  actionable  items  that  we've  already  identified  that  we  know  can  get  done  if  we  have  the  political  will  to  do  them,  and  let's  go  ahead  and  get  them  done,"  he  said.Tuesday's  session  marked  the  third  such  gathering  of  world  leaders  since  Obama  helped  launched  the  initiative  in  2009.According  to  a  report  issued  last  year  by  the  Center  for  Nonproliferation  Studies,  the  United  States  will  spend  at  least  $179  billion  over  the  nine  fiscal  years  of  2010-2018  on  its  nuclear  arsenal.CNN's  Tom  Watkins  and  Jason  Hanna  contributed  to  this  report</TEXT></DOC>

Russell  ("Hustle")  are  up  for  the  honor  of  outstanding  directorial  achievement  in  2013,  along  with  Martin  Scorsese  ("The  Wolf  of  Wall  Street")  and  Alfonso  Cuarón  ("Gravity").Although  Spike  Jonze's  "Her"  has  enjoyed  exuberant  praise  from  critics,  he  didn't  make  it  into  this  group  of  nominees.

What  are  the  chances  that  two  California  teens  would  meet  online  in  a  roommate  hunt,  cross  the  country  to  attend  Louisiana's  Tulane  University  and  learn  a  semester  later  they  were  half-sisters,  the  daughters  of  the  same  Colombian  sperm  donor?Emily  Nappi,  18,  of  San  Francisco,  and  Mikayla  Stern-Ellis,  19,  of  San  Diego,  learned  exactly  that  January  7,  when,  acting  on  a  suspicion  they'd  joked  about  since  Father's  Day,  the  women  asked  their  mothers  to  hunt  down  their  sperm  donor  numbers  from  the  Los  Angeles-based  Calfornia  Cryobank.Stern-Ellis  was  in  a  doctor's  office.  She  had  asked  her  mother  to  send  her  the  number.  Nappi  had  done  the  same."They  both  text  me  at  the  same  time,  and  it  was  the  same  number,"  Stern-Ellis  said.  "I  was  just  staring  at  my  phone.  I  didn't  know  what  to  do.  I  think  the  only  way  to  describe  it  is  mind-blowing."Now  that  they  know  they're  sisters,  it  all  makes  sense.  They  have  the  same  build  and  are  able  to  share  clothes  --  but,  sadly,  not  shoes  --  and  they're  science  majors,  with  Stern-Ellis  focusing  on  animals,  Nappi  on  psychology.They  both  sleep-talk  and  sleepwalk,  reported  The  Advocate  in  Baton  Rouge,  and  during  a  Black  Friday  shopping  trip  over  Thanksgiving  break,  they  independently  purchased  the  same  sweater.It  was  their  commonalities  that  drew  them  to  each  other  in  April.  While  preparing  for  college,  they  took  a  roommate  survey  and  found  they  both  had  lesbian  parents  and  a  passion  for  theater,  The  Advocate  reported."We  had  so  much  in  common  that  I  decided  to  e-mail  her,  Facebook  message  her  and  see  if  we  could  be  roommates,"  Stern-Ellis  told  CNN.That  didn't  pan  out,  but  the  two  stayed  in  touch,  and  in  June,  Stern-Ellis  posted  a  tongue-in-cheek  Facebook  message  on  Father's  Day,  thanking  her  Colombian  sperm  donor  father  for  the  X  chromosome.Whoa,  Nappi  thought.  Her  mother,  too,  had  used  a  Colombian  sperm  donor.  She  replied  to  Stern-Ellis  to  let  her  know,  saying  she  didn't  want  to  be  "creepy."The  two  had  fun  with  it  and  "went  all  first  semester  going,  'That  girl  might  be  my  sister,'  "  Nappi  said.  "We  just  thought  it  was  a  joke."Over  winter  break,  their  curiosity  got  the  better  of  them.  They  had  to  know,  so  they  reached  out  to  their  mothers  and  asked  them  to  find  the  sperm  donor  numbers,  and  they  learned  in  the  first  week  of  the  new  year  that  they  had  a  new  sibling,  just  seven  months  separating  them."There's  something  so  familiar  in  her  face  when  I  look  at  her,"  Nappi  said.Added  Stern-Ellis,  "Everything  you  don't  see  in  our  moms  you  see  in  us."According  to  The  Advocate,  Nappi's  mother  said  she  selected  the  19-year-old  sperm  donor  because  he  was  handsome,  tall,  athletic  and  interested  in  ecology.  Stern-Ellis'  mom  had  similar  reasons  and  was  drawn  to  his  Colombian  heritage  and  dark  skin,  the  newspaper  reported.The  sisters  are  now  playing  catch-up.  They're  learning  the  basics  about  each  other  --  Stern-Ellis'  favorite  color  is  purple;  Nappi's  is  gray  --  and  "we're  really  close,  but  there's  little  things  that  are  really  essential  about  our  being  that  we  don't  know  about  each  other,"  Stern-Ellis  said.As  for  hunting  down  this  strapping,  intelligent  Colombian  gent  who  fathered  them,  it's  one  area  where  they  differ.Nappi  says  she'd  be  curious  to  see  what  he  looked  like,  but  she  doesn't  have  any  real  urge  to  meet  him."I  don't  feel  lacking  in  any  way,"  she  said.But  her  sister  has  longed  to  find  him  since  she  was  a  little  girl,  though  finding  a  sister  instead  will  sate  her  for  now."Since  this  happened,  I'm  definitely  going  to  wait  a  while  because  Emily  is  more  than  enough."Watch  New  Day  weekdays  at  6am-9am  ET.

"If  an  airline  has  a  bar  at  the  galley  it  makes  the  flight  a  little  more  fun."Executive  Travel:  Coolest  airport  artworkThe  business-class  experience  also  now  extends  beyond  flying  time.  Frequent  travelers  weigh  lounge  options  and  add  up  additional  perks  such  as  chauffeur  service  to  and  from  the  airport.  "One  really  important  element  is  what  I  call  anticipatory  service,"  Kjellgren  says.  "It  makes  a  big  difference  when  airline  staff  know  what  travelers  want  and  are  prepared  to  customize."And  the  world's  best  airport  is  ...In  compiling  this  list  Executive  Travel  established  certain  baseline  criteria,  like  fully  flat  beds,  something  each  of  the  airlines  on  the  list  offers.  Many  also  have  ample  space  between  seats  and  easy  access  to  the  aisle  --  configurations  that  certain  airlines,  like  Swiss  and  Singapore,  have  mastered.  We  consulted  several  sources,  from  SeatGuru.com  to  London-based  Skytrax,  which  operates  the  World  Airline  Awards,  a  global  benchmark  of  airline  excellence  based  on  extensive  customer  surveys.  We  also  scanned  reader  surveys  from  trusted  sources  like  Travel  +  Leisure  magazine  (a  fellow  American  Express  Publishing  publication)  and  intel  from  industry  insiders  like  veteran  flight  attendants  and  savvy  travel  bloggers.So  who's  the  best  in  business  class?  Here  are  10  of  the  top  airlines:Singapore  AirlinesThis  much-awarded  airline  tops  the  list  in  many  crucial  areas,  not  least  its  impressive  seats,  which,  according  to  SeatGuru,  are  the  world's  widest,  a  generous  34  inches  on  its  Airbus  A380-800,  which  flies  from  Singapore  to  London  and  Los  Angeles,  among  other  destinations.  The  cabin  also  features  ample  room  between  each  seat,  and,  thanks  to  the  1-2-1  layout,  gives  every  passenger  direct  access  to  the  aisle.The  culinary  offerings  are  similarly  stellar:  There's  Givenchy  tableware  and  a  special  "Book  the  Cook"  option  that  enables  passengers  to  preorder  their  main  course  from  a  lengthy  online  menu.  Then  there  are  the  famously  delightful  flight  attendants  known  for  their  thoughtful  and  intuitive  service.Hotel  Insider's  Philippe  Kjellgren  is  a  fan:  "Singapore's  business  class  is  better  than  first  class  on  most  other  airlines,"  he  notes.  "You  get  an  almost  queen-size  bed,  turndown  service  and  proper  linens.  If  they  can  do  it,  why  can't  everyone  else?"  singaporeair.comExecutive  Travel:  Best  hotel  gymsOman  AirFlagship  airlines  out  of  the  Middle  East  --  showcasing  increasingly  luxurious  cabins  and  services  to  keep  pace  with  their  deep-pocketed  clientele  --  have  been  giving  traditional  players  across  the  globe  a  run  for  their  money  in  recent  years.  This  relative  newcomer,  established  in  1981,  has  quietly  been  working  its  way  up  the  ranks,  coming  in  third  for  Best  Business  Class  Airline  Seat  (length  77.5  inches,  pitch  82  inches)  and  nabbing  the  No.  2  slot  for  business  class  overall  in  the  2013  World  Airline  Awards  survey.The  service  is  exemplary  as  well:  A  warm  welcome  with  Arabic  dates  and  coffee  greets  business  passengers  (you'll  have  to  upgrade  to  first  for  caviar  service);  a  solid  Champagne  and  wine  selection  follows  when  country  law  allows  or  once  passengers  are  in  flight.  Another  highlight:  Oman  Air  offers  door-to-door  service  with  complimentary  chauffeur-driven  airport  transfers  in  select  destinations  such  as  Paris,  London,  Muscat,  Oman,  and  Mumbai,  India.  omanair.comWorld's  best  airport  hotelsQatar  AirwaysEstablished  in  1993,  the  national  carrier  of  this  tiny,  prosperous  Arab  state  is  already  one  of  the  world's  most  lauded,  winning  Skytrax's  Best  Business  Class  Overall  award  in  2013  and  ranking  second  in  Best  Business  Class  Lounge  for  its  luxe  facility  in  Doha,  Qatar.  The  business-class  service  has  also  racked  up  a  number  of  firsts:  Its  B787s  have  the  world's  first  dual-screen  interfaces,  which  enable  passengers  to  play  games  on  handheld  devices  while  waiting  for  movies  to  load.The  airline  was  also  the  first  to  offer  different  wine  selections  (handpicked  by  two  Masters  of  Wine)  going  East  and  West  out  of  Doha,  Qatar,  so  that  frequent  fliers  enjoy  different  selections  on  each  leg;  and  it's  the  only  airline  to  offer  rosé  Champagne  in  business  --  Billecart-Salmon,  no  less.  Having  star  chef  Nobu  Matsuhisa  oversee  the  in-flight  menu  hasn't  hurt  either.  qatarairways.comExecutive  Travel:  Tips  for  travel  upgradesBritish  AirwaysThis  veteran  airline  is  still  going  strong,  consistently  polling  well  with  business  travelers  thanks  to  features  like  its  Elemis  amenity  kits  and  an  onboard  "Club  Kitchen,"  where  fliers  can  graze  between  meals.  Its  lie-flat  seats  also  have  a  distinctive  "Z"  position  that  extends  to  6  feet,  6  inches  and  is  ideal  for  watching  movies.The  carrier's  lounges  also  garner  top  marks  --  the  Heathrow  Club  World  Lounge  nabbed  the  third  slot  in  the  2012  World  Airline  Awards  Best  Business  Class  Lounge  category  --  with  special  mention  going  to  the  Galleries  Arrivals  lounge,  which  features  an  Elemis  Travel  Spa,  94  shower  rooms,  cabanas  with  infinity  bathrooms  and  a  garment-pressing  service.  britishairways.comEtihad  AirwaysThis  precocious  youngster,  launched  in  2003  as  the  flagship  carrier  of  the  United  Arab  Emirates,  has  been  busy  winning  the  hearts  of  well-heeled  travelers,  not  to  mention  several  awards,  including  top-10  ranks  for  food,  lounge  and  business  class  overall,  according  to  Skytrax.  The  Pearl  business-class  cabin  features  6-foot-1-inch  flat  beds  with  privacy  shells  and  direct  aisle  access  from  every  seat;  food  and  beverage  managers  for  each  passenger;  and  thoughtful  touches  like  mood  lighting  to  help  ease  jet  lag.On  the  ground,  meanwhile,  expect  to  be  pampered  in  the  business  lounge's  Six  Senses  Spa.  There's  also  a  library  stocked  with  papers  and  magazines  and  speedy  services—ironing  and  shoe  polishing—you  can  cue  up  while  you  shower.  etihad.comSwiss  International  Air  LinesAttention  to  detail  is  what  sets  this  airline's  business  cabin  apart:  Expect  out-of-the-box  touches  like  all-veggie  menus  from  Zurich's  Haus  Hiltl,  the  world's  oldest  vegetarian  restaurant.  The  new  angled  seats  and  seating  configuration  (1-2-1/2-2-1,  offering  better  access  to  the  aisle)  are  also  innovative,  and  the  airline  keeps  the  middle  seat  in  three-seat  rows  empty  on  all  European  flights.  "The  seating  configuration  is  one  of  our  favorite  options  right  now,"  writes  Robeel  Haq  on  the  well-regarded  travel  blog  The  Aviation  Writer,  "providing  privacy  when  you  need  it  and  the  ability  to  travel  and  talk  with  a  partner  if  you  desire,  plus  it  solves  the  dreaded  'step-over-a-sleeping-stranger'  maneuver  for  the  usual  2x2x2  seating  configuration."  swiss.comVirgin  AtlanticBusiness  travelers  love  this  perennially  popular  carrier  for  all  the  reasons  you'd  imagine  --  modern  planes,  an  upbeat  staff  and  loads  of  perks  in  the  cheekily  named  "Upper  Class"  like  22-inch-wide  beds  that  convert  to  33  inches  when  it's  time  to  sleep.  Night  owls  can  also  head  to  the  onboard  galley  bar  to  throw  back  a  cocktail  and  mingle  with  fellow  passengers.It's  back  on  earth  where  this  airline  really  shines,  though,  largely  thanks  to  its  flagship  London  Heathrow  Clubhouse.

Cathay's  highly  regarded  food  and  beverage  program  and  legendary  service  also  top  the  charts:  In  2013,  the  airline  came  in  No.1  in  Skytrax's  poll  for  World's  Best  Cabin  Staff.  cathaypacific.comQantasGiven  that  its  transpacific  flights  are  some  of  the  longest  in  the  world,  we're  thankful  that  Australia's  pride  and  joy  has  committed  to  a  superior  flying  experience  in  business  class.

The  restitution  they  are  seeking  now  totals  $26,000.Suleman  has  already  pleaded  not  guilty  to  the  first  three  welfare  fraud  charges,  and  she  will  return  to  court  on  March  11  for  arraignment  on  the  newest  charge.Los  Angeles  County  District  Attorney  Jackie  Lacey  said  that  while  Suleman  applied  for  public  aid,  the  mother  of  14  children  "allegedly  failed  to  disclose  that  she  was  also  getting  checks  for  personal  appearances  and  residuals  from  videos."Suleman  --  known  in  tabloids  as  "Octomom"  --  allegedly  did  not  report  nearly  $30,000  in  earnings.Her  work  was  no  secret,  though.  Suleman,  38,  performed  in  adult  videos  and  danced  topless  at  a  Florida  strip  club  last  year."This  is  not  a  new  career  for  her,"  her  rep,  Gina  Rodriguez,  told  CNN  in  June  when  asked  about  her  stripping  gig.  "She  is  just  promoting  her  new  video."  An  adult  video  featuring  Suleman  was  released  in  June.Suleman  revealed  in  April  that  she  was  so  determined  to  build  a  future  for  her  14  young  children  that  she  would  accept  adult  entertainment  offers,  although  she  would  not  touch  another  "human's  flesh."Suleman,  who  collected  food  stamps  to  feed  her  children,  filed  for  bankruptcy  in  May,  but  the  case  was  tossed  out  of  court  because  of  paperwork  issues.Suleman  dreams  of  building  a  business  "empire"  that  will  pay  for  food,  shelter  and  college  educations  for  her  14  children,  she  told  CNN's  Nischelle  Turner.She  ultimately  hopes  to  become  a  role  model  for  other  women  facing  major  struggles,  she  said."I've  got  to  win  the  battle,"  she  said.  "But  right  now,  people  don't  understand  that."Suleman  faces  up  to  six  years  and  four  months  in  prison  if  convicted,  the  prosecutor  said.Octuplets  mom  Suleman  books  stripper  gigs  to  save  homeCNN's  Rosalina  Nieves  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

If  it  wasn't  for  receiving  my  DACA  last  summer  I  wouldn't  have  been  able  to  attend  the  State  of  the  Union,"  Avila  told  CNN.The  23-year-old  and  his  siblings  are  just  one  of  the  many  thousands  of  recipients  of  the  Deferred  Action  for  Childhood  Arrivals  (DACA).  Avila  was  illegally  brought  into  the  United  States  with  his  younger  brother  and  sister  when  he  was  9  years  oldDACA  is  a  government  program  enacted  in  2012  that  stopped  deporting  some  undocumented  young  people  and  instead  granted  them  temporary  work  authorization  and  a  two-year  reprieve  from  deportation.Obama  hits  the  road  to  push  State  of  the  Union  messageThe  recipients  have  become  one  of  the  most  visible  groups  advocating  for  immigration  reform.Avila  caught  the  attention  of  the  Obama  administration  during  his  22-day  fast  on  the  National  Mall  in  support  of  immigration  reform  last  November.  And,  for  the  last  two  years,  Avila's  been  working  as  a  voter  engagement  coordinator  for  Mi  Familia  Vota,  a  non-profit  Latino  civic  engagement  program."At  the  time,  immigration  reform  seemed  like  it  was  dead.  We  won  the  hearts  of  the  American  people.  We  revived  the  conversation,"  Avila  said.Obama  pleaded  for  cooperation  and  pointed  out  how  getting  immigration  reform  done  this  year  was  important  for  the  country's  recovering  economy."If  we  are  serious  about  economic  growth,  it  is  time  to  heed  the  call  of  business  leaders,  labor  leaders,  faith  leaders,  and  law  enforcement  --  and  fix  our  broken  immigration  system,"  Obama  said.Without  attacking  House  Republicans,  the  President  described  how  both  parties  in  the  Senate  passed  a  comprehensive  bill  last  summer  and  said  both  parties  in  the  House  want  to  do  the  same.  He  said  immigration  reform  would  not  only  help  the  economy  but  shrink  the  deficit  by  almost  $1  trillion  in  the  next  two  decades."When  people  come  here  to  fulfill  their  dreams  --  to  study,  invent,  contribute  to  our  culture  --  they  make  our  country  a  more  attractive  place  for  businesses  to  locate  and  create  jobs  for  everybody.  So  let's  get  immigration  reform  done  this  year,"  he  said.Obama  spoke  of  immigration  reform  in  broad  strokes  but  that  might  have  something  to  do  with  the  plans  of  House  Republican  leaders  to  outline  their  principles  for  immigration  reform  at  a  party  meeting  this  week.Opinion:  Can  Obama  deliver  action  on  inequality?"We're  going  to  outline  our  standards,  principles  of  immigration  reform  and  have  a  conversation  with  members,"  House  Speaker  John  Boehner  said  during  a  news  conference  after  a  party  meeting.Obama  steered  clear  of  specific  immigration  reform  policies.  There  was  no  mention  of  stopping  the  deportations  of  undocumented  immigrants  without  criminal  records,  despite  countless  pleas  from  activists  all  over  the  country.Avila  and  his  siblings  no  longer  live  in  fear  of  being  deported  but  his  parents  face  that  threat  every  time  they  leave  their  homes  for  work."I  grew  up  with  the  fear  of  being  deported.  My  mom  would  always  tell  me  to  put  my  head  down,"  Avila  said."I  still  have  the  constant  fear  of  my  parents  being  deported.  They  are  fearful  and  targeted  even  though  they  earn  their  living  in  an  honest  way,"  said  Avila,  "One  of  the  reasons  that  I  keep  strong  is  for  them."Still,  Avila  remains  optimistic  that  immigration  reform  will  happen  in  2014."We  are  closer  than  ever  before.  It  shouldn't  take  any  longer,"  Avila  said.</TEXT></DOC>

Did  the  star  gain  or  lose  much  weight  to  better  perform  the  role?  It  worked  for  Robert  De  Niro  ("Raging  Bull"),  Tom  Hanks  ("Philadelphia")  and  Charlize  Theron  ("Monster").Or  is  there  a  sense  of  being  overdue  for  recognition  --  the  "lifetime  achievement"  factor?  Welcome  to  the  club,  Don  Ameche  ("Cocoon")  and  Geraldine  Page  ("The  Trip  to  Bountiful")!Maybe  you're  on  the  cusp  of  stardom.  That  helps  --  especially  if  you're  an  actress,  because  the  Academy  always  wants  to  be  au  courant  with  the  kids.  Just  look  at  the  best  actress  winners  of  the  last  20  years,  a  list  that  includes  Gwyneth  Paltrow,  Hilary  Swank,  Reese  Witherspoon,  Marion  Cotillard,  Natalie  Portman  and  Jennifer  Lawrence.And  you  can't  ignore  publicity  campaigns  --  Harvey  Weinstein  is  particularly  good  at  this  --  and  box  office,  because  nothing  says  success  like  success.What,  you  thought  it  was  all  about  quality  and  talent?Those  play  a  role  as  well,  of  course,  but  you  can't  forget  about  the  rest  --  which  sometimes  makes  predicting  Oscar  nominees  into  a  game  of  11-dimensional  chess.  (We're  not  even  going  to  talk  about  the  voting  system.)With  all  that  in  mind,  here  are  some  educated  guesses  --  or,  if  you  prefer,  random  dartboard  throws  --  as  to  who  will  earn  the  Academy's  blessing  on  Thursday  morning:Best  supporting  actorJared  Leto,  who  portrays  a  transgender  woman  with  AIDS  in  "Dallas  Buyers  Club,"  has  earned  raves  for  his  performance  and  has  already  received  a  Golden  Globe  for  his  work.  He's  a  shoo-in.  Close  to  a  lock  is  Barkhad  Abdi,  the  former  Minnesota  limo  driver  who  plays  a  Somali  pirate  in  "Captain  Phillips."  He  received  nods  from  both  the  Globes  and  the  SAG  Awards,  and  his  exotic  story  --  he's  a  Somali  immigrant  --  doesn't  hurt.After  that,  things  get  a  little  hazier.  The  late  James  Gandolfini  received  praise  for  his  performance  as  a  softhearted  librarian  in  "Enough  Said,"  and  that  --  plus  some  good  feelings  about  Gandolfini  the  man  --  may  help  him  nab  a  posthumous  nomination,  a  rarity.  Bradley  Cooper  was  terrific  in  "American  Hustle"  and  should  get  a  second  straight  nomination,  following  his  best  actor  nod  last  year  for  "Silver  Linings  Playbook."  And  Jonah  Hill,  who's  all  schlubby  id  in  "The  Wolf  of  Wall  Street,"  could  get  the  fifth  slot.Wild  cards:  Michael  Fassbender  was  brutal  as  a  slave  owner  in  "12  Years  a  Slave,"  but  will  the  Academy  be  willing  to  nominate  such  an  unredeeming  character?  (Of  course  they  have  before,  but  not  everybody  is  Christoph  Waltz  in  "Inglourious  Basterds.")  Matthew  McConaughey  has  a  small  but  key  role  in  "Wolf,"  and  he's  been  so  good  in  all  his  films  this  year  he  may  pick  up  two  nominations  (he's  a  certainty  for  best  actor  in  "Dallas  Buyers  Club").  And  with  all  the  larger-than-life  con  artists  in  "American  Hustle,"  someone  should  save  a  prayer  for  Jeremy  Renner,  who  plays  a  good-guy  New  Jersey  mayor  caught  up  in  all  the  mess.  Oh,  and  maybe  Steve  Coogan  ("Philomena")  can  find  a  place  here?Best  supporting  actressOprah,  Oprah,  Oprah.  She's  powerful,  well-liked  and  --  not  least  --  great  in  "Lee  Daniels'  The  Butler,"  willing  to  show  a  slovenly  side  as  a  long-suffering  butler's  wife.  Jennifer  Lawrence,  last  year's  best  actress  winner,  is  the  Oscar  It  Girl  of  the  moment,  and  her  performance  in  "American  Hustle"  does  nothing  to  change  her  status.  Julia  Roberts  was  a  previous  Oscar  It  Girl,  and  gets  to  show  more  range  in  "August:  Osage  County"  than  usual.After  that,  I'm  going  with  two  relative  unknowns.  June  Squibb  was  terrific  in  "Nebraska"  as  a  no-nonsense  wife  to  Bruce  Dern's  dementia-afflicted  curmudgeon;  after  years  of  TV  guest  spots  and  small  movie  roles,  the  84-year-old  actress  is  having  her  moment.  And  Lupita  Nyong'o,  fresh  out  of  Yale's  drama  school,  has  won  a  zillion  awards  for  her  performance  as  the  much-abused  slave  in  "12  Years  a  Slave."Wild  cards:  Though  Sally  Hawkins'  part  (and  performance)  in  "Blue  Jasmine"  are  much  less  showy  than  Cate  Blanchett's,  she  could  nudge  into  the  running.  Jennifer  Garner,  as  a  doctor  who  eventually  befriends  McConaughey's  HIV-positive  patient  in  "Dallas  Buyers  Club,"  could  pick  up  her  first  Oscar  nomination.Best  actorIn  a  bit  of  a  shock,  Matthew  McConaughey  won  a  Golden  Globe  for  best  dramatic  actor  for  his  performance  in  "Dallas  Buyers  Club."  An  Oscar  nomination  seems  a  sure  bet;  at  this  point,  he  may  be  the  front-runner  for  the  prize  itself.  Chiwetel  Ejiofor  leads  "12  Years  a  Slave's"  strong  cast  and  gives  a  moving,  restrained  performance  --  especially  given  the  subject  matter.  Tom  Hanks,  always  an  Oscar  favorite,  is  great  as  the  title  character  in  "Captain  Phillips."  Given  his  strong  year  --  he  plays  Walt  Disney  in  "Saving  Mr.  Banks"  --  some  kind  of  recognition  is  expected.The  remaining  slots,  I  believe,  will  go  to  the  "old  guys."  Robert  Redford,  77,  has  just  one  Oscar  acting  nomination  in  his  career,  for  1973's  "The  Sting."  (Yep,  he  was  overlooked  for  "Downhill  Racer,"  "The  Candidate"  and  "All  the  President's  Men.")  In  "All  is  Lost,"  his  grim  sailor  says  few  words  but  conveys  many.  And  Bruce  Dern,  also  77,  is  brilliantly  understated  in  "Nebraska,"  a  character  that's  the  opposite  of  the  egocentric  crazies  he  played  in  such  '70s  films  as  "The  King  of  Marvin  Gardens"  and  "Black  Sunday."  With  just  one  previous  nomination  --  for  1978's  "Coming  Home"  --  he's  overdue.Wild  cards:  Martin  Scorsese's  "The  Wolf  of  Wall  Street"  has  inspired  both  love  and  hate,  and  Leonardo  DiCaprio's  over-the-top  performance  has  engendered  the  same.  He  might  end  up  on  the  outside  looking  in.  Christian  Bale's  hair  deserves  its  own  nomination,  but  the  "American  Hustle"  performer  might  not  get  one  otherwise.  Oscar  Isaac  had  the  thankless  task  of  making  the  unlikable  folksinger  Llewyn  Davis  sympathetic  in  the  Coen  brothers'  "Inside  Llewyn  Davis."  He  gave  the  movie  a  surprising  amount  of  heart,  though  his  character  keeps  his  own  --  damaged  by  the  suicide  of  his  singing  partner  --  well  hidden.  At  least  cats  would  cheer  a  nomination.Best  actressCate  Blanchett,  who  plays  a  delusional  (and  newly  broke)  socialite  in  Woody  Allen's  "Blue  Jasmine,"  won  the  Globe  and  has  been  considered  the  front-runner  for  months,  according  to  handicapping  site  Goldderby.com.  She's  a  shoo-in,  as  is  "American  Hustle's"  Amy  Adams  --  who  plays  a  slinkily  dressed,  ice-sharp  con  artist  --  and  "Saving  Mr.  Banks'"  Emma  Thompson,  as  "Mary  Poppins"  author  P.L.  Travers.Judi  Dench,  a  former  Oscar  winner  and  regular  collector  of  Oscar  nominations,  should  pick  up  another  one  for  her  performance  in  "Philomena,"  about  a  woman  pursuing  a  son  given  up  for  adoption  long  ago.  And  Sandra  Bullock  puts  "Gravity"  on  her  shoulders  and  gives  humanity  to  a  film  that  easily  could  have  turned  into  a  cardboard  thriller.Wild  cards:  What?  No  Meryl  Streep?  Maybe  not  this  year.  "August:  Osage  County"  has  divided  critics  and  Streep,  who  plays  the  pill-popping,  cancer-afflicted  matriarch  of  a  feuding  clan,  could  end  up  on  the  sidelines  despite  her  amazing,  much-honored  career.  Julia  Louis-Dreyfus  has  the  opposite  problem.  She  stars  in  a  low-key  independent  movie,  "Enough  Said,"  and  may  not  be  taken  seriously  by  some  voters.  They  could  look  at  her  and  think  "TV."Best  directorThe  three  strongest  best  picture  possibilities  are  "12  Years  a  Slave,"  "American  Hustle"  and  "Gravity,"  and  all  three  of  those  films'  directors  --  respectively,  Steve  McQueen,  David  O.  Russell  and  Alfonso  Cuaron  --  should  also  get  directing  nods.  McQueen,  a  firm  hand,  helps  make  "12  Years"  almost  unbearable  to  watch.  (With  its  subject  matter,  that's  a  good  thing.)  Russell's  shambling  style  fits  "Hustle's"  crisscrossing  characters,  and  Cuaron  practically  willed  "Gravity"  into  being.  A  nomination  for  each  would  be  well  deserved.After  that?  "Nebraska's"  Alexander  Payne  is  probably  the  best  actors'  director  working  today;  "Nebraska"  manages  to  walk  a  fine  line  between  bleak  and  sweet,  and  it's  Payne's  grasp  of  tone  that  keeps  it  from  falling  in  one  direction  or  another.  Finally,  however  you  feel  about  "The  Wolf  of  Wall  Street,"  you  can't  ignore  Martin  Scorsese's  sheer  bravura.  It's  something  to  see  (and,  a  critic  might  say,  see  and  see  and  see  and  see).  With  his  reputation,  he  could  get  a  nomination  even  if  DiCaprio  does  not.Wild  cards:  Paul  Greengrass'  documentary-style  shooting  is  a  perfect  complement  to  "Captain  Phillips."  He  could  take  Payne's  spot.  And  the  Academy  occasionally  likes  to  recognize  an  up-and-comer.  In  this  category,  that  might  be  "Fruitvale  Station's"  Ryan  Coogler.Best  pictureUp  to  10  movies  may  be  nominated  for  best  picture,  so  there's  no  sense  in  designating  fewer  than  that.  "12  Years  a  Slave,"  "American  Hustle"  and  "Gravity"  are  sure  things.  "Captain  Phillips"  is  a  very  strong  possibility.  "Dallas  Buyers  Club,"  thanks  to  its  performances  and  Oscar-friendly  subject  (the  AIDS  crisis),  will  probably  get  in  as  well.  "The  Wolf  of  Wall  Street,"  as  noted  previously,  seems  impossible  to  ignore.Then  it  gets  hard.  "Lee  Daniels'  The  Butler"  was  a  box-office  success,  features  fine  performances  and  also  has  an  Oscar-friendly  subject  (history  and  race),  so  we'll  pencil  that  in.  "Inside  Llewyn  Davis"  has  the  Coen  brothers,  which  should  help  despite  its  dark  touches.  "Nebraska"  is  finely  wrought  and  beautifully  acted  (and  photographed).  And  for  the  10th  spot  I'll  go  with  Spike  Jonze's  "Her,"  a  heartbreaking  and  delicate  story  of  a  near-future  romance  between  a  man  and  an  operating  system.Yes,  that  leaves  out  "Saving  Mr.  Banks,"  which  has  Disney  behind  it.  And  "August:  Osage  County,"  which  has  Harvey  Weinstein.  And  "Before  Midnight,"  which  will  probably  end  up  where  good  small  films  do  --  with  a  screenplay  nomination.  But  you  have  to  stop  somewhere.Wild  cards:  If  there's  a  spot  for  a  comic-book  blockbuster,  perhaps  "Iron  Man  3"  can  find  a  way  in.  And  the  much  talked  about  "Blue  Is  the  Warmest  Color"  could  take  the  slot  that  foreign-language  films  occasionally  receive.One  thing's  for  sure:  2013  was  a  terrific  year  for  movies,  and  there  are  lots  of  possibilities.</TEXT></DOC>

He  will  be  charged  with  second-degree  homicide,  according  to  Nocco.Nocco  identified  the  victims  as  Chad  and  Nicole  Oulson,  who  he  said  were  sitting  in  a  row  in  front  of  another  couple.  An  earlier  release  from  the  sheriff's  department  said  the  shooting  occurred  before  a  showing  of  the  movie  "Lone  Survivor.""There  was  an  altercation  because  the  victim  was  using  his  cell  phone.  He  was  texting,"  Nocco  said.  "This  led  to  a  verbal  altercation,  the  verbal  altercation  escalated."Reeves  pulled  out  a  .380-caliber  handgun  and  as  Nicole  Oulson  raised  her  hand,  the  shooter  fired  once,  Nocco  said.A  witness  said  the  shooting  happened  during  previews  to  the  movie.  Charles  Cummings  told  reporters  that  Chad  Oulson  sat  two  seats  from  him  and  his  son.  Reeves  was  upset  by  Oulson's  cell  phone  use  and  the  two  argued,  Reeves  then  got  up  and  left  the  theater  for  a  brief  time,  Cummings  said."He  came  back  very  irritated,"  Cummings  said.  Nocco  told  reporters  that  the  shooter  had  gone  to  report  the  encounter  to  an  employee.The  two  men  started  arguing  again  and  the  cell  phone  user  told  the  other  man  he  was  just  texting  his  daughter,  Cummings  said.  A  few  silent  seconds  elapsed  and  the  argument  started  again.Nocco  said  Oulson  confronted  the  shooter  about  going  to  the  theater  employee.Cummings  said  the  argument  got  louder."Their  voices  started  going  up.  There  seemed  to  almost  be  a  confrontation,"  Cummings  said.  "Somebody  throws  popcorn;  I'm  not  sure  who  threw  it.  And  then  bang,  he  was  shot."The  victim  staggered  over  and  fell  on  Cummings  and  his  son.  A  nurse  who  was  in  the  theater  performed  CPR  on  the  victim  until  the  paramedics  arrived,  said  Cummings,  who  like  his  son,  had  spatters  of  blood  on  his  clothes.The  shooter  sat  down  and  put  the  gun  on  his  lap,  and  an  off-duty  deputy  from  Sumter  County  who  was  there  to  watch  the  film  made  sure  the  shooter  didn't  leave.Nocco  said  Reeves  was  at  the  theater  with  his  wife,  and  there  was  no  indication  that  the  two  couples  involved  knew  each  other.The  shooting  happened  at  about  1:30  p.m.  inside  one  of  the  theaters  at  the  Grove  16  complex,  sheriff's  spokeswoman  Melanie  Snow  said."This  was  an  isolated  altercation  between  two  guests  that  escalated  unexpectedly.  The  safety,  security  and  comfort  of  our  guests  and  team  members  are  always  our  top  priorities,  and  we  are  truly  heartbroken  by  this  incident,"  Cobb  Theatres,  which  operates  the  Grove  complex,  said  in  a  written  statement.CNN's  Suzanne  Presto  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

I  will  never  forget  the  moment  I  received  the  call  from  Dr.  Bill  Moreau,  medical  director  of  the  U.S.  Olympic  Committee,  letting  me  know  that  I'd  been  chosen.  While  I  feel  like  my  entire  career  has  been  leading  up  to  that  moment,  it  still  came  as  a  great  surprise.I  decided  to  study  orthopedic  surgery  because  of  an  injury  I  sustained  when  I  was  16.  An  athlete  myself,  I  have  always  been  drawn  to  working  with  athletes.  I  love  and  admire  their  competitive  spirit.I  practice  in  Crested  Butte  and  Gunnison,  Colorado.  For  several  years,  I've  served  as  team  physician  for  many  sports  including  football,  wrestling,  track,  basketball,  volleyball  and  skiing  at  our  local  university,  Western  State  Colorado  University.  I've  served  as  team  physician  for  the  U.S.  Track  Cycling  Team  in  at  least  a  dozen  Track  Cycling  World  Championships.And  this  wasn't  my  first  Olympic  experience.  I  was  part  of  the  medical  team  during  the  Athens  and  London  Olympics,  and  have  worked  for  world  championships,  World  University  Games  and  the  Pan  American  Games.  Over  my  career,  I've  worked  with  skiers,  cyclists,  ballet  dancers,  Taekwondo  competitors  and  more.If  there  is  a  sports  injury  to  be  had,  it's  likely  I've  seen  it,  or  a  close  approximation.  And  that  is,  I  believe,  one  of  the  reasons  I  was  fortunate  enough  to  be  selected  to  lead  the  Sochi  medical  team.  I've  always  been  curious  and  eager  to  increase  my  knowledge,  education  and  experience  in  any  way  possible.Of  course  as  CMO,  I  am  only  one  of  many  providing  medical  care  to  the  U.S.  Olympic  Team.  In  Sochi,  I  worked  with  Moreau  and  a  team  of  more  than  70  staff  members  to  coordinate  and  deliver  care  to  the  athletes.  We  had  thre  clinics  on  site,  and  were  responsible  for  230  U.S.  athletes.We  treated  sprains,  sniffles  and  sore  throats,  and  while  it  was  inevitable  that  we  deal  with  injuries,  I  had  my  fingers  crossed  I  wouldn't  have  to  exercise  my  capabilities  for  anything  serious.The  months  leading  to  my  departure  were  packed.  I  made  the  trek  across  the  mountains  to  the  U.S.  Olympic  Center  in  Colorado  Springs  for  training  and  preparation  several  times  before  I  left  for  Sochi.  In  preparation  for  our  journey,  we  secured  equipment,  medications  and  supplies,  and  supervised  the  shipment  to  Sochi.Our  pre-games  homework  included  ensuring  that  every  one  of  the  health  care  providers  --  athletic  trainers,  physicians,  sports  chiropractors,  massage  therapists  and  physical  therapists  --  had  the  appropriate  licenses  and  insurance  to  participate.  As  you  might  imagine,  there  was  a  lot  of  paperwork  to  make  sure  everyone  could  legally  practice  medicine  in  Russia.There  was  a  lot  to  prepare  for,  and  part  of  my  job  was  to  help  the  volunteer  medical  staff  understand  what  to  expect  in  an  unusual  situation  --  practicing  medicine  in  another  country  and  being  in  the  fast-paced  Olympic  environment.  Another  of  our  pre-games  activities  was  hosting  a  Webinar  with  information  on  what  to  expect  in  Sochi,  including  the  hours  our  medical  staff  were  required  to  work,  what  the  living  quarters  were  like,  doping  controls  and  other  logistics.As  soon  as  I  found  out  about  my  appointment,  I  also  began  learning  Russian.  It  has  been  a  blast,  and  I  knew  it  would  help  me  ensure  the  best  medical  care  for  our  athletes.  I  also  believe  that  my  Russian  colleagues  appreciated  me  trying  to  speak  to  them  in  their  own  language.Part  of  the  fun  of  being  involved  in  the  Olympics  is  learning  new  things  and  seeing  new  places,  and  I  wanted  to  get  all  I  could  out  of  the  experience.  I  knew  communicating  to  our  generous  hosts  in  their  native  tongue  would  help.</TEXT></DOC>

"I've  never  hidden  my  sexuality  from  anyone,  my  whole  life  in  fact,  and  I've  been  waiting  for  someone  to  ask  about  it  in  an  interview,  (because)  it's  not  something  you  just  blurt  out.  I've  tried  to  lead  the  questions  a  few  times,  to  no  avail!"Now  that  the  moment  has  come,  Nairn  was  more  than  happy  to  "come  out"  in  the  media."I  had  an  upbringing  to  respect  other  people's  privacy,  and  their  right  to  be  and  choose  what  they  want,  and  I  expect  --  no,  demand  --  no  less  for  myself,"  Nairn  continued.  "It's  a  very  small  part  of  who  I  am  on  the  whole,  but  nonetheless,  in  this  day  and  age,  it's  important  to  stand  up  and  be  counted.  I  have  and  always  will  stand  my  ground."Nairn  told  Winter  Is  Coming  that  the  crew  on  HBO's  fantasy  series  "have  been  great,"  and  he's  quite  appreciative  of  the  gay  community's  support."I  am  aware  of  it,"  he  said  of  his  LGBT  fans,  "and  I  think  it's  really  lovely.

"Things  seem  to  keep  happening  that  I  constantly  have  to  check  myself  and  think  'Really?  Is  this  real?'

It  seems  Google  is  under  fire  from  state  authorities  for  not  having  the  proper  permits  necessary  to  construct  the  barge  in  its  current  location.  The  four-story  structure  is  housed  at  Treasure  Island,  a  small  piece  of  land  between  San  Francisco  and  Oakland.The  barge  rose  to  fame  late  last  year  as  a  delightful  floating  enigma  in  the  San  Francisco  Bay.  The  vessel  was  originally  spotted  by  a  CNET  reporter  and  Google  would  not  comment  on  its  purpose.  People  had  great  fun  speculating  about  the  barge,  guessing  that  it  was  a  floating  data  center,  a  Google  Glass  shop  or  a  luxury  event  space.It  was  dubbed  the  Google  Mystery  Barge.Eventually,  Google  killed  the  mystery,  and  some  of  the  fun,  by  announcing  the  structure  was  going  to  be  an  "interactive  space  where  people  can  learn  about  new  technology."But  shortly  after  the  story  picked  up  steam,  Google  hit  pause  on  construction  of  the  barge.  The  U.S.  Coast  Guard  inspected  the  structure  and  the  San  Francisco  Bay  Conservation  and  Development  Commission  (BCDC)  announced  it  was  meeting  with  Google  about  the  matter  in  December.  The  opening  date  for  the  barge  was  delayed  until  late  2014,  according  to  CNET,  and  the  boat  sat  idle  in  its  Treasure  Island  home.This  week,  the  BCDC  officially  notified  The  Treasure  Island  Development  Authority  (TIDA)  that  it  did  not  have  the  necessary  permits  to  construct  and  lodge  any  ships  at  the  pier  where  the  Google  barge  is  currently  moored.  TIDA  manages  the  island  on  behalf  of  the  city  of  San  Francisco."We  are  asking  TIDA  to  work  with  us  so  that  the  necessary  permits  can  be  applied  for  and  completed  to  enable  lawful  activities  to  be  undertaken  at  the  site  in  the  future  (perhaps  including  shipbuilding  and  repair),"  said  Larry  Goldzband,  executive  director  of  the  BCDC.That  means  that  for  now,  Treasure  Island  must  relocate  the  Google  ship  to  another  shipbuilding  facility  in  order  to  comply  with  state  law.  To  get  its  paperwork  into  ship  shape,  Google  will  also  have  to  get  the  proper  permits  from  the  BCDC  to  moor  its  marketing  vessel  in  an  approved  area  in  San  Francisco  Bay,  one  that  is  already  permitted  to  do  this  type  of  construction."We  just  received  the  letter  from  the  San  Francisco  Bay  Conservation  and  Development  Commission  and  we  are  reviewing  it,"  said  a  Google  spokesperson  in  an  e-mail.Now  the  biggest  mystery  is  when,  if  ever,  the  project  will  be  finished  and  open  its  doors  to  the  public.</TEXT></DOC>

It's  just  one  of  435  seats  in  the  U.S.  House,  and  the  winner  will  serve  out  a  term  that  comes  to  a  close  at  the  end  of  the  year.But  the  contest  for  Florida  13  has  landed  smack  in  the  middle  of  the  national  political  spotlight.  It's  seen  by  some  pundits  as  a  bellwether  for  November's  midterm  elections,  and  there's  been  a  massive  infusion  of  outside  ad  money  into  the  race  to  try  to  influence  the  outcome.A  special  election  this  far  out  from  Election  Day  rarely  gives  us  a  preview  of  what  will  actually  happen  in  November,  but  the  party  that  does  come  out  on  top  gets  bragging  rights  until  the  next  election.Empty  your  notebook:  Republican  finger-pointing  in  FloridaDemocrat  Alex  Sink  is  running  against  Republican  David  Jolly  to  fill  out  the  term  of  Republican  Bill  Young,  who  died  in  October.  Young,  first  elected  to  Congress  in  1970,  was  the  longest-serving  Republican  in  the  House.Sink  was  Florida's  chief  financial  officer  and  narrowly  lost  the  2010  gubernatorial  election  to  Rick  Scott.  Jolly  served  as  a  former  general  counsel  for  Young  and  also  worked  as  a  lobbyist.  There's  also  a  libertarian  candidate  in  the  race.Here  are  five  things  we  can  learn  from  the  race:National  parties  test  their  pitches  in  Florida  special  election1.  Swing  district  in  a  swing  state:  The  district  covers  most  of  Pinellas  County  and  parts  of  St.  Petersburg  near  Tampa,  and  it's  up  for  grabs.  While  Young  captured  58%  of  the  vote  in  his  2012  re-election,  President  Barack  Obama  narrowly  carried  the  district.  Obama  also  won  it  in  2008,  grabbing  51%  of  the  vote.  It  went  for  George  W.  Bush  before  that.Of  those  registered  to  vote  in  the  district,  37%  are  Republicans,  about  35%  are  Democrats  and  28%  are  unaffiliated.  Public  opinion  polls  suggest  the  race  remains  close.  With  the  number  of  competitive  House  seats  shrinking  with  every  cycle,  Florida  13  is  becoming  something  of  a  rarity.While  both  parties  have  a  lot  at  stake,  and  both  have  tried  to  lower  expectations,  a  top  nonpartisan  political  handicapper  says  the  Democrats  have  more  to  lose."It's  rare  in  politics  that  anything  other  than  a  presidential  contest  is  viewed  as  a  must-win,  but  the  special  election  in  Florida's  13th  District  falls  into  that  category  for  Democrats,"  wrote  Stuart  Rothenberg,  editor  of  the  nonpartisan  Rothenberg  Political  Report.Rothenberg  points  out  that  all  things  being  equal,  Sink  should  win,  since  she  didn't  have  a  primary  challenge  and  had  a  money  advantage,  and  Jolly  had  to  continuously  battle  the  lobbyist  label."Since  most  nonpartisan  handicappers  and  analysts  have  for  years  expected  this  seat  to  go  Democratic  when  it  became  open,  a  Republican  victory  would  likely  say  something  about  the  national  political  environment  and  the  inclination  of  district  voters  to  send  a  message  of  dissatisfaction  about  the  President.  And  that  possibility  should  worry  the  White  House,"  Rothenberg  said.Eight  things  to  watch  till  Election  Day2.  Is  it  all  about  Obamacare?:  National  Republicans  are  framing  the  election  as  a  referendum  on  Obamacare.  The  National  Republican  Congressional  Committee  and  pro-GOP  outside  groups  link  Sink  to  the  health  care  law,  to  President  Obama  and  to  House  Democratic  Leader  Nancy  Pelosi."Canceled  health  plans.  Higher  premiums.  Medicare  cuts.  People  losing  their  doctors.  A  disaster  for  families  and  seniors.  For  Alex  Sink  the  priority  is  Obamacare.  Not  us,"  says  the  narrator  in  a  TV  commercial  by  the  Chamber  of  Commerce,  which  is  backing  Jolly.That's  a  potent  message  in  a  district  that's  one  of  the  grayest  in  the  nation.  Nearly  a  quarter  of  all  residents  in  Florida  13  are  65  or  older.Jolly  says  he  remains  committed  to  getting  rid  of  Obamacare  entirely.Sink  recognizes  that  Obamacare  is  a  major  issue.  While  she  highlights  how  the  Affordable  Care  Act  has  helped  people,  she  also  notes  that  the  law  has  flaws,  and  says  she's  open  to  GOP  proposals  to  amend  some  of  the  measure's  requirements."Regardless  of  whether  or  not  the  election  will  tell  us  anything  about  November,  the  two  political  parties  will  learn  lessons  from  this  contest  and  apply  them  to  future  races,"  Rothenberg  said.  "If  Jolly  wins,  it's  all  about  Obamacare  for  the  GOP.  And  if  Sink  wins,  Democrats  will  say  that  attacking  Republican  candidates  on  Medicare  and  Social  Security  works."3.  Excitement  could  translate  to  turnout:  While  special  elections  typically  see  far  lower  turnout  than  general  elections,  the  race  in  Florida  could  have  a  strong  showing  --  a  statistic  both  sides  will  be  eagerly  trying  to  gauge  to  predict  turnout  in  November.Early  voting  turnout  is  already  higher  than  the  total  turnout  for  the  last  special  election  in  Florida,  when  Democrat  Ted  Deutch  won  in  2010  after  Democrat  Robert  Wexler  resigned.Nancy  Whitlock,  a  spokeswoman  for  Pinellas  County  elections,  said  about  27%  of  eligible  voters  in  the  district  have  already  voted  by  mail  or  in  person.By  contrast,  turnout  for  that  2010  special  election  was  about  15%  of  eligible  voters.  That's  the  total  figure,  not  just  early  voting.While  registered  Republicans  outnumber  registered  Democrats  in  the  13th  District  by  about  11,350  voters,  Democrats  seem  to  be  excited  about  the  high  early  voting  turnout  so  far."These  are  tests  of  turnout  to  some  extent,"  Rothenberg  said.  "Democrats  are  already  talking  about  how  they  are  doing  better  in  the  early  voting  than  they  thought  they  would."4.  Most  expensive  race  so  far:  The  contest  has  seen  an  outsized  level  of  third-party  spending,  making  it  the  most  expensive  race  this  election  cycle,  even  more  than  last  year's  Senate  special  election  in  Massachusetts  to  replace  former  Sen.  John  Kerry.Outside  spending  also  tops  the  current  Senate  race  in  Kentucky,  where  Senate  Minority  Leader  Mitch  McConnell  is  defending  his  seat.In  addition  to  the  $2.4  million  spent  by  the  campaigns  themselves,  as  of  mid-February  nearly  $9  million  had  been  spent  by  outside  groups,  according  to  the  Center  for  Responsive  Politics,  which  monitors  outside  spending.Sheila  Krumholz,  executive  director  of  the  CRP,  said  the  influx  of  cash  has  to  do  with  the  start  of  the  2014  midterms."It  seems  like  an  anomaly  that  there  would  be  all  this  outside  interest  when  it's  going  to  have  to  be  fought  again  in  November,"  she  said.  But  she  added  that  groups  are  interested  in  this  race  in  part  because  there's  "no  other  show  in  town  yet."Outside  money,  she  said,  can  significantly  strengthen  or  weaken  the  eventual  victor  when  the  race  plays  out  again  in  November,  but  it  also  plays  a  large  role  in  determining  the  dialogue  and  themes  in  the  contest.Breaking  the  numbers  down,  Jolly  appears  to  have  an  advantage  in  third-party  spending.About  $623,000  has  been  spent  in  efforts  to  oppose  Sink,  and  Jolly  has  benefited  from  about  $600,000  more  to  support  him  than  his  opponent.American  Crossroads,  the  conservative  super-PAC  backed  by  Karl  Rove,  and  the  U.S.  Chamber  of  Commerce  are  two  of  the  largest  super-PACs  that  have  backed  Jolly.  On  the  Democratic  side,  House  Majority  PAC  put  in  nearly  $1  million.The  two  campaign  arms  in  the  House  dished  out  the  most  cash  in  the  race  --  the  National  Republican  Congressional  Committee  slightly  outspent  the  Democratic  Congressional  Campaign  Committee,  $2.2  million  to  $2.1  million.5.  From  Barker  to  Biden  to  Bowzer  to  Bubba:  Beside  the  national  money  and  attention,  the  race  also  landed  some  big-time  surrogates.  Vice  President  Joe  Biden  flew  in  to  headline  a  fundraiser  for  Sink,  and  former  President  Bill  Clinton  recorded  an  automated  call  for  the  Democratic  candidate.Sen.  Rand  Paul  of  Kentucky,  a  rock  star  among  grassroots  conservatives,  recorded  a  robocall  for  Jolly,  and  former  Florida  Gov.  Jeb  Bush  starred  in  pro-Jolly  TV  commercial.But  it  wasn't  just  politicians.Bob  Barker,  the  longtime  host  of  "Price  is  Right,"  starred  in  an  ad  for  Jolly  in  December.  And  in  another  blast  from  the  past,  Jon  "Bowzer"  Bauman  from  Sha-Na-Na  fame  campaigned  for  Sink.Bowzer  to  campaign  for  Democrat  in  Florida</TEXT></DOC>

A  blood  disease  similar  to  hemophilia  forced  doctors  to  make  him  a  triple  amputee,  removing  his  right  hand  and  the  ends  of  his  feet.A  blog  post  by  amateur  pilot  and  journalist  Miles  O'Brien  revealed  this  week  that  the  former  CNN  anchor  was  also  the  victim  of  a  medical  condition  that  required  amputation.  O'Brien  lost  his  left  arm,  sending  concern  throughout  the  online  news  and  aviation  communities.O'Brien,  a  correspondent  for  PBS  "NewsHour,"  appeared  on  CNN  for  17  years,  mostly  focusing  on  science,  technology  and  aerospace  coverage.Thomas,  30,  has  an  idea  of  what  O'Brien  might  be  going  through  after  his  amputation."It'll  take  some  time  for  him  to  adapt,  but  he'll  be  back  in  it  in  no  time,"  Thomas  said  Wednesday  from  his  workplace  in  Lincoln,  Nebraska.Former  CNN  anchor's  arm  amputated  after  accidentThomas  had  idiopathic  thrombocytopenic  purpura.  The  Mayo  Clinic  describes  it  as  a  "disorder  that  can  lead  to  easy  or  excessive  bruising  and  bleeding"  resulting  "from  unusually  low  levels  of  platelets  —  the  cells  that  help  your  blood  clot."He  had  been  flying  his  father's  tiny  Cessna  single-engine  plane  for  about  a  decade  when  one  day  he  fell  into  a  coma  and  was  rushed  to  a  hospital.  When  he  awoke,  doctors  told  Thomas  he  would  probably  face  amputations.  Thus  began  a  battle  against  the  disorder  and  against  depression,  which  he  won  thanks  to  encouragement  from  his  family.  Thomas  then  started  his  journey  back  to  the  cockpit.First,  Thomas  had  to  get  a  health  evaluation.  The  FAA  requires  all  pilots  to  be  medically  fit  before  they  can  be  certified  to  fly  solo."They  see  if  you're  able  to  meet  the  regulations  performance-wise,  even  though  you  have  a  physical  deficiency,"  Thomas  said.He  sent  his  medical  records  to  be  reviewed  by  an  aviation  medical  examiner,  who  recommended  that  the  FAA  allow  him  to  take  a  medical  flight  evaluation  test.Only  18  months  after  his  amputations  and  rehabilitation,  Thomas  was  finally  sitting  in  the  pilot's  seat  of  a  tiny  rented  airplane  with  an  instructor,  ready  to  show  what  he  could  still  accomplish."I  was  a  little  nervous,  because  I  was  having  trouble  getting  the  airplane  started,"  Thomas  laughed.  "It  was  giving  me  fits."  Eventually,  the  engine  revved  to  life,  and  they  were  airborne.The  instructor  was  mostly  interested  in  judging  Thomas'  access  to  the  plane's  instruments  and  how  well  he  could  control  the  plane.  Thomas  practiced  several  takeoffs  and  landings  and  checked  his  braking.After  the  test,  the  instructor  handed  Thomas  his  paperwork.  "And  I  was  a  pilot  again!"  he  recalled.  "It  was  just  a  huge  sigh  of  relief,  because  I  wasn't  sure  what  to  expect."He  celebrated  by,  what  else,  taking  a  solo  flight.  The  same  day  he  passed  his  test,  Thomas  was  soaring  high  above  Nebraska  after  dark.  "It  was  crystal  clear,"  he  said.  "You  could  see  a  golden  trail  of  headlights  down  the  interstate.""I  can't  believe  I  got  here,"  he  thought.  "It  made  me  feel  so  successful,  like,  'Well  what's  my  next  challenge?'  "Thankfully,  Thomas'  remaining  hand  --  his  left  --  was  the  one  he  most  relied  on  to  fly  before  the  surgery.  He  has  always  used  his  left  hand  to  control  his  steering  wheel,  aka  "the  stick."  Thomas  uses  his  prosthetic  arm  and  hook,  which  now  substitute  for  his  right  hand,  to  control  the  plane's  engine,  or  throttle."The  hook  doesn't  do  a  whole  lot.  It  just  pushes  and  pulls  on  the  throttle,"  Thomas  said.  "The  left  hand  is  where  the  magic  is.  That's  where  you  need  all  the  fine  motor  skills,  is  running  the  stick."Thomas  said  that  for  a  pilot  missing  the  "magic  hand"  --  the  main  steering  hand  --  "it  would  be  considerably  more  challenging  to  get  back  into  it.  But  it  wouldn't  be  insurmountable.  It  just  takes  more  practice,  I  would  say."As  for  the  aircraft's  pedals,  which  control  the  rudder,  Thomas  said  he  doesn't  use  any  special  gear.  "It's  harder  for  me  than  it  used  to  be  to  feel  where  the  rudder  pedals  are,  because  I  don't  have  any  toes.  The  whole  front  half  of  my  feet  are  gone."If  it's  really  windy  and  gusty,  "it  makes  it  more  of  a  big  deal,"  he  said.  "The  taxiing,  takeoff  and  landing  portion,  that's  really  the  most  critical  time  to  have  your  game  on."During  his  career  covering  aviation,  O'Brien  developed  a  reputation  as  a  pilot  and  aircraft  owner.  He  often  used  his  plane  to  travel  to  story  assignments  and  as  a  platform  to  explain  aviation  stories  to  a  wider  audience.The  aviation  community  is  tight-knit,  and  Thomas  is  reaching  out  to  O'Brien  as  he  would  for  any  fellow  pilot.  "I'd  be  more  than  happy  to  help  him  any  way  I  can,"  he  said.The  horizon  looks  bright  for  Thomas,  who's  been  an  aviation  mechanic  in  Lincoln  for  about  eight  years  and  now  flies  about  once  a  week.He  has  co-written  a  book  about  his  experience,  "Modified  Flight  Plan."  And  soon  he  wants  to  fly  across  America  to  inspire  other  amputees."I'm  still  trying  to  figure  out  where  to  go,"  he  said.  But  one  idea  is  Walter  Reed  Army  Medical  Center  in  Washington,  to  help  some  of  the  nation's  troops  who've  lost  limbs  in  combat.  "That  seems  like  it  would  be  a  pretty  cool  place  to  go."</TEXT></DOC>

Witnessing  a  great  animal  migrationAncient  rock  art  images  of  animals  moving  across  the  African  savannah  indicate  that  humans  have  been  marveling  at  animal  migrations  for  more  than  20,000  years.But  poaching,  agriculture,  war  and  deforestation  are  encroaching  on  wildlife  corridors  around  the  world,  placing  these  animal  movements  --  from  Africa's  wildebeest  migration  to  the  annual  pilgrimage  of  North  American  bison  --  under  threat.How  to  do  it:  GAdventures  pairs  good  wildlife  access  with  creature  comforts  on  its  Kenya  Safari  Experience  tour  (eight  days  from  $3,490  per  person;  +1  888  800  4100),  taking  in  Kenya's  Lake  Nakuru,  Amboseli  National  Park  and  the  Masai  Mara,  where  Africa's  wildebeest  end  their  migration.2.  Coming  eye-to-eye  with  a  polar  bearWhile  hunting  is  still  allowed  by  some  Arctic-dwelling  native  communities,  it's  climate  change  that  poses  the  largest  threat  to  polar  bears.Latest  data  from  the  International  Union  for  the  Conservation  of  Nature  (IUCN)  shows  that  eight  of  the  19  sub-populations  of  polar  bear  that  roam  the  Arctic  are  in  decline.Scientists  project  that  two-thirds  of  all  polar  bears  could  disappear  by  2050.Due  to  its  southern  exposure,  Canada's  Hudson  Bay  is  one  of  the  bear  habitats  most  threatened  by  climate  change  --  increasing  temperatures  are  forcing  bears  off  the  ice  earlier  each  year.How  to  do  it:  Churchill  Wild  (+1  866  846  945)  is  one  of  a  handful  of  operators  on  the  western  shores  of  Hudson  Bay  that  facilitate  multi-day  bear  watching  tours  starting  at  around  $3,000  per  person.3.  Counting  the  stripes  on  a  tigerTigers  once  roamed  freely  across  Asia.Today  the  world's  most  endangered  big  cats  have  disappeared  from  90%  of  their  historic  range.Just  six  of  nine  known  tiger  species  are  thought  to  remain,  with  an  estimated  3,200  animals  left  in  the  wild.READ:  Best  places  in  Africa  to  sleep  beneath  the  starsWhile  it's  extremely  rare  to  spot  the  elusive  beasts  in  their  natural  habitat  (the  South  China  tiger,  for  example,  hasn't  been  seen  since  the  early  1970s),  protected  reserves  in  India  and  Nepal  provide  the  best  opportunities.How  to  do  it:  Intrepid  Travel  offers  a  Chitwan  Extension  (four  days  from  $430  per  person;  +1  800  970  7299)  tour  to  Nepal's  Chitwan  National  Park  from  Kathmandu.Once  a  royal  hunting  reserve,  Chitwan  is  home  to  elephant,  rhino,  crocodile,  monkeys,  deer  and  about  100  Bengal  tigers.4.  Swimming  amid  live  coral  on  Australia's  Great  Barrier  ReefThe  Great  Barrier  Reef,  the  world's  largest  reef  system,  is  in  peril.Temperature  fluctuations  are  primarily  to  blame  for  the  disappearance  of  half  its  coral  since  1985  and  the  Australian  Institute  of  Marine  Science  predicts  that  less  than  a  quarter  could  be  left  within  a  decade.Following  plans  by  the  Australian  government  to  industrialize  parts  of  the  reef,  the  World  Heritage  Committee  passed  a  recommendation  to  consider  listing  the  UNESCO  site  as  "in  danger"  at  a  meeting  in  June  2014.How  to  do  it:  Calypso  Snorkel  and  Dive  (+61  7  4099  6999)  offers  daily  snorkeling  and  diving  day  trips  to  the  reef  from  the  Far  North  Queensland  resort  town  of  Port  Douglas  starting  from  $174  per  person.5.  Tracking  gorillas  in  the  mistEndemic  to  the  forests  of  central  Africa,  both  species  of  the  world's  largest  primate  have  been  decreasing  in  numbers  for  decades  largely  due  to  poaching  and  disease.Worryingly,  a  2010  United  Nations  report  suggested  that  these  gentle  giants  of  the  forest  might  disappear  from  large  parts  of  the  Congo  Basin,  one  of  their  primary  habitats,  by  the  mid-2020s.MORE:  Film  chronicles  destruction  of  "gringo"  travel  trailHow  to  do  it:  Wilderness  Collection  offers  gorilla  tracking  opportunities  during  a  six-day  tour,  from  $6,474  per  person,  split  between  two  luxury  Odzala  camps  (+27  11  807  1800)  in  an  area  of  the  Republic  of  the  Congo  that's  home  to  a  high  density  of  western  lowland  gorilla.Chimpanzee,  leopard,  golden  cat  and  a  large  number  of  other  primate  and  bird  species  are  also  present.6.  Seeing  the  creatures  of  Galápagos  as  Darwin  saw  themRemaining  virtually  undiscovered  for  centuries  did  much  to  preserve  the  living  showcase  of  evolution  described  by  Charles  Darwin  in  "The  Origin  of  Species."But  Ecuador's  best  known  ecosystem  remains  fragile.The  last  remaining  Pinta  Island  tortoise,  fondly  known  as  Lonesome  George,  died  in  2012,  adding  to  the  list  of  several  other  species  that  have  died  out  since  Darwin's  1835  visit.How  to  do  it:  While  it's  possible  to  fly  to  Galapagos  from  mainland  Ecuador  and  visit  several  islands  independently,  you  can  only  reach  the  bulk  of  protected  habitats  on  heavily  regulated  organized  cruises.You  can  expect  to  pay  from  around  $1,500  for  a  last-minute,  week-long  cruise  organized  in  the  capital  Quito  or  Puerto  Ayora  on  the  island  of  Santa  Cruz.Prices  double  (or  more)  for  the  convenience  of  booking  ahead  through  an  international  company  such  as  Ecoventura  (+1  800  633  7972).7.  Hanging  around  with  orangutansSharing  98%  of  our  DNA,  orangutans  are  one  of  the  closest  relatives  to  man,  though  if  predictions  are  accurate,  Asia's  only  two  great  ape  species  could  be  extinct  in  the  wild  within  the  next  decade.Conservation  groups  such  as  Borneo  Orangutan  Survival  have  bolstered  numbers  through  rehabilitation  and  release  programs,  but  the  illegal  pet  trade,  trafficking  and  habitat  destruction  still  present  the  greatest  threats  to  the  survival  of  orangutans  on  the  only  two  islands  they  inhabit:  Borneo  and  Sumatra.READ:  How  to  travel  quietlyHow  to  do  it:  Gecko's  Adventures  include  a  visit  to  two  rehabilitation  centers  in  Malaysian  Borneo  on  their  Orangutanland  tour  (18  days  from  $2,500;  +44  0808  274  5981).The  trip  includes  a  cruise  down  Kinabatangan  River,  where  you  might  spot  orangutans,  proboscis  monkeys,  macaques  and  elephants  in  the  wild.8.  Watching  sea  turtles  nestScientists  have  been  debating  for  decades  why  --  not  to  mention  how  --  sea  turtles  return  to  the  same  beach  every  year  to  lay  their  eggs.But  the  phenomenon  may  soon  be  a  thing  of  legend  thanks  to  the  ravages  of  intense  egg  collection,  fisheries  bycatch  and  light  pollution,  which  have  forced  species  such  as  the  leatherback,  hawksbill  and  green  turtles  onto  endangered  lists.How  to  do  it:  You  can  sign  up  for  a  volunteering  stint  with  an  organization  such  as  Earthwatch  (nine-day  Costa  Rica  program  from  $2,800  per  person;  +1  978  461  0081)  during  which  you'll  help  safeguard  turtle  eggs  and  assist  new  hatchlings.9.  Spotting  Africa's  Big  FiveEuropean  game  hunters  and  the  illegal  wildlife  trade  may  soon  reduce  Africa's  most  prestigious  group  of  game  animals  from  the  legendary  Big  Five  to  four.While  lion,  African  elephant,  Cape  buffalo  and  leopard  populations  are  relatively  stable,  rhinos  are  in  serious  trouble.Poaching  has  increased  dramatically  during  the  past  few  years,  with  800  rhinos  killed  illegally  in  South  Africa  in  2013  alone.MORE:  Best  African  treehouse  staysLast  year,  the  International  Union  for  Conservation  of  Nature  (IUCN)  declared  the  western  black  rhino  officially  extinct.How  to  do  it:  All  members  of  the  Big  Five  can  still  be  found  in  Botswana,  Uganda,  Namibia,  Ethiopia,  South  Africa,  Kenya,  Tanzania,  Zimbabwe,  Malawi  and  the  Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo.If  you're  particularly  eager  to  see  rhinos,  Intrepid  Travel's  Okavango  Experience  (nine  days  from  $1,155  per  person;  +1  800  970  7299)  includes  a  dusk  game  drive  in  Botswana's  Khama  Rhino  Sanctuary  for  a  chance  to  spot  both  white  and  black  rhino.10.  Swimming  alongside  whale  sharksNicknamed  "dominos"  for  their  distinctive  markings,  the  world's  largest  fish  are  among  the  most  placid  of  the  shark  species.Unfortunately,  demand  for  whale  shark  meat,  fins  and  oil,  on  top  of  unregulated  tourism,  remains  an  enormous  threat  to  this  vulnerable  species.How  to  do  it:  A  WWF-sponsored  ecotourism  project  in  the  Philippine  village  of  Donsol  allows  tourists  to  swim  with  whale  sharks  while  following  strict  rules  to  avoid  disturbing  them.Donsol  EcoTour  (+63  2  576  5934)  offers  snorkeling  packages  with  gear  and  a  trained  guide  from  around  $25  per  person.11.

"Just  can't  walk  distances.  Love  my  life,  family,  friends  and  followers."Nimoy  announced  last  week  that  he  has  been  diagnosed  with  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  --  30  years  after  having  given  up  cigarettes."Not  soon  enough,"  tweeted  the  82-year-old  actor  and  director  who  played  Dr.  Spock,  the  half-human  science  officer  aboard  the  Starship  Enterprise  from  1966  to  1969  on  the  TV  series  "Star  Trek"  and  in  movies  during  the  decades  since.  "I  have  COPD.  Grandpa  says,  quit  now!!!  LLAP."The  last  reference  is  to  his  signature  phrase,  "Live  long  and  prosper."Nimoy,  who  told  an  interviewer  last  year  that  he  flunked  chemistry  in  high  school,  may  not  have  grasped  the  long-term  risks  associated  with  smoking,  but  his  announcement  is  not  surprising,  said  Dr.  Richard  Casaburi,  a  pulmonologist  at  Los  Angeles  Biomedical  Research  Institute  in  Torrance,  California.Smoking  could  very  well  be  responsible  for  the  appearance  of  symptoms  of  COPD  decades  after  quitting,  because  it  is  a  progressive  disease  and  lung  function  declines  with  age,  said  Casaburi,  who  is  not  involved  with  Nimoy's  treatment.COPD  is  the  third-leading  cause  of  death  in  the  United  States  --  after  heart  disease  and  cancer  --  and  smoking  is  responsible  for  the  vast  majority  of  cases,  he  said.Some  12  million  people  in  the  United  States  have  been  diagnosed  with  the  disease,  and  perhaps  another  12  million  have  it,  but  don't  know,  he  said,  adding  that  about  30%  of  people  who  smoke  will  get  clinically  significant  COPD.  "The  mystery  really  is  why  everybody  doesn't  get  it."Initial  symptoms  can  include  cough,  sputum  production  and  shortness  of  breath,  especially  on  exertion,  which  limits  their  activity.But  medications  typically  can  ease  the  symptoms,  he  said.  "It's  a  disease  of  the  older  person,  but  the  damage  is  started  when  they're  young."Though  smoking  rates  have  declined  in  the  United  States  in  recent  years,  COPD  takes  years  to  develop,  so  the  incidence  is  rising,  said  the  66-year-old  doctor.  "We're  now  seeing  the  results  of  people  my  age  who  started  smoking  in  the  1960s  and  now  are  reaping  the  consequences."He  predicted  the  incidence  will  decline  sharply  over  the  next  20  to  30  years.More  severe  symptoms  can  require  oxygen  therapy  and  may  lead  to  pneumonia  and  heart  failure,  said  Dr.  Norman  Edelman,  senior  medical  consultant  to  the  American  Lung  Association.He  praised  Nimoy  for  his  announcement  and  his  admonition  to  stay  away  from  tobacco.  "We're  delighted,"  Edelman  said  in  a  telephone  interview.  "The  more  people  speak  out,  the  more  ammunition  we  have  to  fight  --  for  not  only  smoking  cessation  but  for  research  that  will  lead  to  better  treatment  of  COPD."Funding  has  been  limited  by  the  belief  among  some  that  patients  have  only  themselves  to  blame,  a  point  of  view  that  is  unfair,  he  said.  "These  people  deserve  the  best  treatment  that  we  can  provide,"  he  said,  adding  that  most  smokers  take  up  the  habit  before  they  are  adults.But  Nimoy's  illness  has  not  interfered  with  his  goal  of  living  long  and  prospering.  In  2010,  life  expectancy  at  birth  for  someone  born  in  the  United  States  reached  78.7,  and  Nimoy,  who  is  82,  appears  to  be  continuing  to  prosper,  too.  "Just  taped  my  comments  for  Star  Trek  Fest  to  be  aired  on  EPIX  Feb.  16th,"  he  wrote.  "Still  enjoying  my  life.  LLAP."</TEXT></DOC>

I  got  them  dressed  today.  We  fought  over  wearing  hats  because  it  was  cold  outside.  I  packed  their  snacks.  I  dropped  them  off  and  kissed  their  chubby  cheeks.  I  am  the  PTA  treasurer  for  my  daughter's  school.  I  am  a  volunteer  in  the  community.I  am  a  wife  to  a  partner  I  have  been  with  nearly  14  years.  I  live  in  a  suburb.  I  have  all  the  trappings  of  a  comfortable  life.  I  am  content  in  my  daily  life.What  sets  me  apart  from  the  typical  soccer  mom  is  that  I  am  an  outspoken  recovering  heroin  addict.  Many  people  might  be  familiar  with  my  story  from  the  movie  "Black  Tar  Heroin:  The  Dark  End  of  the  Street."I  agreed  to  be  featured  in  the  film  because  I  thought  it  would  live  on  after  I  died  from  an  overdose  as  a  testimonial  to  the  dangers  of  drug  addiction.Yet  I  survived  eight  years  of  heroin  addiction.  I  was  one  of  the  lucky  few  from  that  time  period  when  treatment  options  and  evidence-based  treatment  solutions  were  limited.I  started  my  journey  as  a  heroin  addict  while  a  college  student  in  Cincinnati.  I  had  been  given  Vicodin  after  removal  of  my  wisdom  teeth.I  fell  in  love  with  that  feeling  opiates  provided  me.  My  burdens  seemed  to  slip  away  under  the  influence.  I  longed  for  that  feeling.After  experimenting  with  many  drugs,  I  found  opiates  provided  me  with  the  ability  to  forget  my  problems.  No  longer  was  I  obsessed  with  feeling  different.  I  was  happy  with  being  numb.My  addiction  quickly  spiraled  until  I  ended  up  being  a  homeless  junkie  in  the  streets  of  San  Francisco's  Tenderloin  district.At  first  I  was  doing  the  drugs,  but  in  short  order  the  drugs  began  to  control  every  aspect  of  my  life.  I  was  living  on  the  streets  and  in  and  out  of  rat-infested  hotels.  In  a  few  short  years,  I  was  completely  unrecognizable  as  my  former  self.My  last  day  using  was  February  26,  1998.  I  was  injecting  heroin  into  the  soles  of  my  feet  because  I  no  longer  had  any  usable  veins.  I  could  barely  walk,  I  was  emaciated,  and  I  was  relieved  when  I  was  arrested  that  night.  I  spent  my  first  months  off  drugs  in  the  San  Francisco  County  Jail.This  was  not  my  first  time  detoxing  from  heroin.  Fortunately,  it  would  be  my  last  time.  I  was  able  to  get  into  a  treatment  program  followed  by  a  sober-living  house,  where  I  lived  for  four  years.In  the  years  I  have  been  off  heroin,  I  have  struggled  with  depression,  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  and  anxiety.  Many  addicts  find  that  once  the  drugs  are  removed,  the  underlying  cause  to  the  use  can  be  nearly  as  painful  as  the  use  itself.When  the  drugs  are  removed,  there  can  be  an  overwhelming  sense  of  sadness.  Getting  clean  can  be  seen  as  the  ultimate  solution.  When  the  veil  of  chemicals  lifts,  the  person  may  not  like  what  is  revealed  to  him  or  her.I  dealt  with  these  feelings  without  using  heroin.  However,  the  thought  crossed  my  mind  many  times  that  relief  can  easily  be  found  at  the  bottom  of  a  spoon.  That  is  part  of  my  affliction.Everyone  has  a  different  treatment  story.  The  reality  for  me  was  and  is  that  stopping  use  of  the  substance  is  relatively  easy  compared  with  staying  off  drugs.The  lifetime  commitment  to  abstinence  from  drugs  is  what  kills  many  people.  When  they  have  cravings  to  use,  the  stigma  attached  to  heroin  use  forces  them  to  deal  or  not  deal  with  their  affliction  in  private.This  decision  is  frequently  fatal,  as  in  the  case  of  Philip  Seymour  Hoffman.  If  we  were  courageous  enough  to  try  to  conquer  our  insatiable  desire  for  heroin,  we  feel  weak  telling  another  person  that  we  feel  like  using  is  once  again  a  viable  option.I  know  these  feelings.  Fifteen  years  later,  I  still  deal  with  the  stigma  of  being  a  heroin  addict.  The  track  marks  and  scars  are  visible,  but  the  pain  of  longing  lies  deep  under  the  surface.  Many  heroin  addicts  are  embarrassed  to  admit  they  ever  had  a  problem  with  this  powerful  substance.If  you  are  open  about  it,  it  triggers  speculation  and  scrutiny  as  to  your  personal  well-being.  Addiction  is  a  medical  condition,  yet  there  is  little  sympathy  because  society  views  it  to  be  self-inflicted.I  have  chosen  a  different  path  for  myself.  I  chose  to  be  completely  open  about  my  experience  in  hope  that  others  can  learn  that  recovery  is  possible.What  will  I  tell  my  children?  They  are  too  young  to  understand  drugs,  but  they  know  I  used  to  be  homeless.  I  want  them  to  understand  how  fortunate  they  are  in  hopes  they  will  not  go  down  the  same  path.What  do  I  say  when  people  see  the  movie  and  contact  me  through  social  media  looking  for  answers  to  their  own  addiction?  There  are  many  roads  to  recovery.  The  path  that  I  followed  worked  for  me,  but  I  cannot  dictate  what  may  work  for  another  user  struggling  to  get  off  drugs.  I  can  only  share  my  experience.I  have  spent  my  second  chance  at  life  teaching  both  harm  reduction  and  overdose  prevention  because  all  of  us  have  a  life  worth  saving.  I  feel  blessed  I  am  able  to  bring  a  voice  and  a  face  to  the  issue.</TEXT></DOC>

There,  he  was  heard  conceding  the  trade  issue  was  quickly  becoming  a  source  of  frustration  within  the  party,  especially  among  labor  groups  that  are  key  to  midterms  next  fall."The  jobs  they  seem  to  care  about  most  are  Democrats  in  Congress-not  families  across  the  country  eager  to  join  the  ranks  of  the  employed,"  Senate  Minority  Leader  Mitch  McConnell  said  in  a  statement.Senior  Obama  administration  officials  played  down  reports  about  Biden's  comments  as  coming  from  "second-hand  accounts."  But,  they  added,  the  White  House  remains  firmly  committed  to  its  trade  agenda."It  would  not  be  in  the  interest  of  the  United  States  to  put  this  on  the  back  burner,"  one  official  said.White  House  spokesman  Jay  Carney  insists  that  differences  among  Democrats  over  trade  issues  date  back  several  administrations."The  differing  opinions  on  these  matters  are  not  new,  and  the  fact  that  there  are  differing  opinions  within  both  parties  is  not  new,"  Carney  said  Tuesday.Another  area  of  potential  friendly  disagreement  for  the  "Three  Amigos"  is  over  the  administration's  handling  of  the  Keystone  XL  pipeline.Canadian  officials  have  grown  impatient  with  the  lengthy  approval  process  in  the  United  States  for  the  contested  project,  which  would  transport  oil  from  Alberta  to  the  Gulf  of  Mexico.While  a  recent  State  Department  environmental  impact  study  appeared  to  brighten  prospects  for  approval,  senior  administration  officials  indicated  Prime  Minister  Harper  is  not  likely  to  receive  the  news  many  in  his  nation  want  to  hear  during  the  summit."I  think  what  President  Obama  will  do  is  explain  to  him  where  we  are  in  the  review  of  the  Keystone  pipeline,  and  indicate  that  we'll,  of  course,  let  our  Canadian  friends  know  when  we've  arrived  at  a  decision,"  a  senior  administration  official  said.The  Keystone  project  has  also  divided  Democrats,  namely  environmentalists  who  see  the  pipeline  as  a  symbolic  battle  in  the  larger  fight  over  efforts  to  deal  with  climate  change.While  in  Mexico,  Obama  will  face  another  delicate  balancing  act  over  the  issue  of  immigration  reform.The  plight  of  the  undocumented  in  the  United  States,  notably  the  substantial  number  of  migrants  who  crossed  the  border  from  Mexico,  is  a  major  political  issue  south  of  the  Rio  Grande.Latino  special  interest  groups,  a  core  Democratic  Party  constituency,  have  criticized  the  administration  for  its  aggressive  deportation  policy  as  it  struggles  to  find  a  long-term  solution  to  the  immigration  issue.Senior  administration  officials  told  reporters  last  week  that  Obama  remains  committed  to  comprehensive  immigration  reform  that  includes  a  pathway  to  citizenship  for  undocumented  workers.But  that  legislative  priority  has  hit  a  roadblock  in  Congress  where  Republican  leaders  have  indicated  there  is  little  hope  for  such  a  breakthrough  this  year  before  the  midterms.Obama,  administration  officials  argue,  is  under  no  pressure  to  spell  out  that  political  reality  at  the  summit,  which  is  to  take  place  in  Toluca,  Nieto's  home  town."With  respect  to  immigration,  I  think  President  Peña  Nieto  has  a  very  good  understanding,  frankly,  of  the  state  of  play  in  the  United  States,"  a  senior  administration  official  said.</TEXT></DOC>

Michael  J.  Fox  has  been  heading  a  clan  on  "The  Michael  J.  Fox  Show"  since  September,  and  Bob  Saget,  Dave  Coulier  and  John  Stamos  are  reuniting  for  a  yogurt  commercial  to  air  during  the  Super  Bowl.  (No  word  on  whether  the  Olsen  twins  will  be  in  tow.)"Full  House"  stars  reunite  for  Super  BowlBut  nostalgia  and  Q  scores  --  those  popularity  measuring  sticks  marketers  love  so  much  --  only  go  so  far.Sure,  Cosby  is  a  popular  guy.  People  still  have  warm  feelings  about  the  comedian,  even  if  it's  been  ages  since  he  was  TV's  most  popular  pitchman.  (Don't  laugh  --  the  man's  in  the  Advertising  Hall  of  Fame.)And  "The  Cosby  Show"  was  a  landmark  in  TV  sitcoms,  not  only  showcasing  a  bright  African-American  family  but  leading  the  ratings  for  five  straight  years  in  the  1980s.  NBC  began  more  than  a  decade  of  dominance  thanks  to  "Cosby's"  success."Bill  Cosby  is  always  going  to  be  welcomed  into  people's  homes  because  of  nostalgia  for  the  Huxtables,"  says  Amanda  McClain,  a  communications  professor  at  Holy  Family  University  in  Philadelphia.The  trick,  however,  is  the  show  he'll  be  placed  in."A  famous  name  is  itself  no  guarantee,"  wrote  Time's  James  Poniewozik,  observing  that  Fox's  show  has  suffered  because  it's  depended  too  heavily  on  memories  of  the  lead  instead  of  making  his  show  interesting.  "Bill  Cosby,  like  the  Jell-O  he  once  pitched,  remains  a  beloved  brand.  But  if  his  show  makes  it  to  air,  the  proof  will  be  not  in  the  brand  but  in  the  pudding."'Television  isn't  very  reflective  of  reality'So  what  might  a  new  Cosby  sitcom  look  like?Probably  something  like  America  --  whatever  that  is  these  days.After  all,  TV  families  have  always  reflected  our  culture,  even  if  they've  sometimes  been  a  year  or  two  behind  the  times.In  the  1950s,  "Father  Knows  Best"  showed  off  a  happy  nuclear  family  in  Springfield,  USA.  In  the  1960s,  "The  Dick  Van  Dyke  Show"  offered  a  Kennedyesque  household  in  suburban  New  York.  The  1970s  included  "The  Brady  Bunch,"  about  a  blended  clan  for  a  time  in  which  divorce  and  second  marriages  were  becoming  commonplace.  (However,  divorce  was  still  stigmatized  enough  that  it  was  never  revealed  whether  Carol  Brady  was  a  widow  or  a  divorcee.)In  the  wake  of  "All  in  the  Family"  and  producer  Norman  Lear's  other  edgy  shows,  1970s  TV  families  took  on  the  broader  appearance  of  society.  "Good  Times"  was  set  in  a  Chicago  housing  project;  "One  Day  at  a  Time"  featured  a  single-mother  household  in  Indianapolis.But  TV  is  also  nothing  if  not  aspirational,  says  McClain,  and  Lear's  unflinching  sitcoms  --  exceptional  even  in  their  time  --  were  swept  aside  in  the  1980s."Television  isn't  very  reflective  of  reality,"  she  says.  "There's  underrepresentation  of  people  of  color,  underrepresentation  of  many  different  types  of  people.  Still  today,  there  are  very  few  Asian-American  or  Latino  people  on  television."Even  "The  Cosby  Show,"  with  its  upper-class  doctor  and  lawyer  living  in  Brooklyn  Heights,  was  often  more  aspirational  than  realistic,  she  says.Viewers,  however,  apparently  like  aspirational.Since  the  '80s,  the  dominant  family  shows  have  been  "The  Cosby  Show"  and  "Family  Ties,"  "Home  Improvement"  and  "Everybody  Loves  Raymond,"  "Two  and  a  Half  Men"  and  "Modern  Family."  Some  have  unusual  family  structures  --  "Modern  Family,"  famously,  includes  a  gay  couple,  an  old-young  husband-wife  combination  and  several  stepchildren  --  but  they  generally  feature  white  clans  and  take  place  in  well-off  circumstances.Though  there  have  been  several  sitcoms  featuring  people  of  color  or  folks  in  working-class  circumstances,  about  the  only  breakout  exception  has  been  "Roseanne,"  Roseanne  Barr's  early  '90s  hit,  which  regularly  reflected  genuine  working-class  circumstances."Compared  to  like  the  '70s,  where  you  had  true  diversity  --  'Sanford  &  Son'  and  'Good  Times,'  people  of  all  walks  of  life,  jobs  and  bank  accounts  --  today  it's  as  if  we've  regressed  in  some  ways,"  says  John  Griffiths,  president  of  the  Gay  and  Lesbian  Entertainment  Critics  Association  and  TV  critic  for  Us  Weekly.He  suggests  one  reason  might  be  because  Hollywood  is  somewhat  insular."The  networks  try  really  hard  at  having  diverse  sitcom  writing  staffs,  but  there's  still  an  issue  with  a  lot  of  white  guys  who  maybe  went  to  Harvard  and  live  on  the  west  side  of  L.A.  who  write  these  shows,"  he  says.Next  step:  Senior  citizens?There  have  been  some  attempts  to  change  the  view  on  broadcast  television,  he  points  out,  though  new  styles  have  struggled  to  catch  on.  "The  New  Normal,"  which  featured  a  same-sex  couple  and  their  relationship  with  a  surrogate  and  her  family,  was  canceled  after  one  season;  "The  Middle,"  about  a  middle-class  family  in  Indiana,  has  plodded  along,  "underrated,"  in  Griffiths'  opinion.Cable  television,  which  has  the  luxury  of  targeting  its  "reality"  shows  --  many  of  which  are  simply  sitcoms  in  different  guise  --  at  specific  demographics,  has  opted  for  upscale  families  ("Keeping  Up  With  the  Kardashians"),  heartland  groups  ("Duck  Dynasty")  or  a  mix  of  flavors  ("Here  Comes  Honey  Boo  Boo").Families  come  in  many  forms  on  television,  of  course  --  what  was  "Friends"  if  not  about  a  family  of  sorts?  --  and  the  next  wave  may  include  more  senior  citizens.With  baby  boomers  starting  to  take  care  of  aging  parents  and  being  called  "the  sandwich  generation,"  a  Cosby  show  truly  reflecting  issues  across  generations  could  be  a  hit,  says  McClain,  the  communications  professor.Or  perhaps  a  new  Cosby  show  could  simply  focus  on  the  elderly,  Griffiths  says."The  aged  are  very  underrepresented,"  he  says.  He  observes  that  his  group's  pick  for  unsung  TV  show  of  the  year,  HBO's  "Getting  On,"  is  set  in  an  extended-care  unit  and  includes  a  closeted  homosexual,  an  African-American  nurse  and  a  variety  of  senior  citizens.  (HBO  is  a  unit  of  Time  Warner,  as  is  CNN.)"It's  almost  like  a  Norman  Lear  show,"  Griffiths  says.A  Cosby  show  need  not  go  that  far  --  it'll  be  on  NBC,  not  HBO,  after  all  --  but  the  lead  could  make  of  it  what  he  wants."The  great  thing  is  that  Cosby  is  at  an  age  where  he'll  be  playing  a  grandfather,"  Griffiths  says.All  you  need  is  one  successful  show  to  start  a  trend,  and  if  a  wider  range  of  ages  is  shown  on  a  TV  show,  it  could  lead  to  others.After  all,  the  ultimate  family  show  --  even  in  these  days  of  DVRs  and  second  screens  --  is  watching  TV,  McClain  says."Television  is  a  family  event,"  she  says.  "Families  watch  television  together."</TEXT></DOC>

The  latter  was  an  attempt  by  the  Canadian  firm  to  challenge  Airbus  and  Boeing  at  the  lower  end  of  the  mainline  jet  sector.MORE:  Bombardier's  new  jet  takes  on  Boeing  and  AirbusAnd  American  Airlines  and  US  Airways  merged  in  December  after  negotiating  a  settlement  to  a  surprise  lawsuit  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  (which  sought  to  block  the  merger)  creating  what  is  widely  regarded  as  the  world's  largest  airline.By  comparison,  2014  should  be  relatively  quiet.That's  not  to  say  it  won't  be  fascinating.Here's  what  we  forecast  for  the  major  players  in  the  year  ahead.MORE:  Creative  ways  to  recycle  an  airplaneConsumers:  More  fees,  tighter  seats,  "connected"  flight  attendantsPassengers  will  get  more  opportunities  to  connect  with  the  Internet  while  in-flight,  but  at  a  cost,  as  airlines  continue  to  seek  more  profits  from  ancillary  fees.It's  likely  that  a  number  of  fees  will  rise  in  2014:  ticket  change  fees,  on-board  purchases  and  baggage  fees  being  the  biggies.More  passengers  in  the  United  States  will  be  able  to  apply  for  TSA  Pre-Check,  as  that  program  expands.  Previously,  the  program  has  been  largely  confined  to  frequent  fliers  invited  in  by  the  airlines  and  those  who  applied  for  and  were  approved  for  Global  Security  and  Nexus  programs.TSA  Pre-Check  allows  passengers  to  keep  shoes  and  jackets  on,  laptops  and  3-ounce  liquids  packed  and  even  pockets  filled  --  just  like  the  pre-9/11  days.The  ugliest  projection  for  2014?Tighter  seating."Airlines  will  continue  to  reconfigure  their  aircraft  with  slim  seats  in  super-snug  seating  configurations,  in  a  bid  to  squeeze  in  more  passengers  and  generate  additional  revenue,"  says  Mark  Kirby,  founder  of  the  Runway  Girl  Network  website  that  tracks  passenger  experience."Yet,  in  parallel  with  this  trend,  carriers  are  also  moving  rapidly  to  offer  the  type  of  technology  in-flight  that  will  distract  our  brains  from  the  pain,  including  providing  power  for  our  personal  electronic  devices,  faster/better  connectivity,  wireless  in-flight  entertainment  and,  increasingly,  personalized  service  from  flight  attendants  who  will  be  armed  with  'connected'  tablets."MORE:  How  to  battle  the  shrinking  airline  seatBoeing:  Preserve  or  obliterate  its  largest  union?The  U.S.-based  multinational  behemoth  is  expected  to  announce  in  January  where  it  will  build  its  new  777X.The  decision  may  be  of  limited  global  interest  (though  Japan  is  bidding  on  building  the  wings),  but  it's  a  matter  of  burning  interest  in  the  United  States,  particularly  in  Washington  State,  Boeing's  traditional  base  of  manufacturing.Washington  stands  to  lose  upward  of  27,000  direct  and  indirect  jobs  in  the  2020  decade  if  the  777X  is  built  outside  the  state.The  location  hinges  on  a  January  3  vote  of  Boeing's  "touch  labor"  union,  the  International  Association  of  Machinists  District  751.If  members  vote  to  accept  a  revised  version  of  the  contract  offer  they  rejected  by  a  2-1  margin  on  November  13,  the  777X  assembly  and  wing  production  will  be  placed  in  the  state's  Puget  Sound  area.MORE:  Boeing  through  the  ages  --  planes  that  changed  the  way  we  travelIf  not,  the  jobs  could  go  elsewhere  --  or  the  fuselage  may  stay  in  Washington  with  wing  production  at  another  site.By  March,  Boeing  should  announce  where  it  will  assemble  the  787-10  --  expectations  are  for  its  plant  in  North  Charleston,  South  Carolina.The  787-9  is  in  flight-testing,  which  by  all  reports  is  going  smoothly.Boeing  is  currently  scheduled  to  deliver  the  first  787-9  to  Air  New  Zealand  in  June.MORE:  Poop  Dreams:  Most  outrageous  travel  stories  of  2013Airbus:  End  of  the  line  for  A350-800?The  European  company's  highly  anticipated  A350-900  aircraft  began  flight-testing  just  before  the  2013  Paris  Air  Show  and  is  proceeding  smoothly.Officials  claim  the  program  is  "on  track"  for  first  delivery  to  launch  customer  Qatar  Airways  in  2014,  but  the  precise  date  has  been  a  moving  target.First  it  was  mid-year.Then  the  company  said  September  would  be  the  magic  time.Then  delivery  became  November  or  December.More  generically,  officials  say  delivery  will  come  in  "late  2014."It's  possible  delivery  could  slip  to  early  2015.  Whether  it's  late  2014  or  early  2015  matters  little,  just  so  long  as  delivery  doesn't  slip  beyond  that.MORE:  Google  street  view:  Inside  the  A380More  interesting  for  aviation  geeks  is  what  appears  to  be  the  drip,  drip,  drip  demise  of  the  smallest  family  member,  the  A350-800.There  are  now  just  61  in  backlog,  following  the  widely  expected  decision  by  the  new  American  Airlines  to  swap  merger  partner  US  Airways'  order  of  18  A350-800s  for  the  larger  -900  model.Industry  experts  believe  Airbus  will  continue  to  urge  customers  to  swap  to  the  -900  and  formally  or  informally  discontinue  offering  the  -800  this  year.This  would  be  followed  by  a  decision  to  launch  a  re-engined  version  of  the  popular  A330,  a  model  that  entered  service  in  1994  and  has  sold  more  than  a  thousand  planes.Problem  is,  the  A330's  older  engines  aren't  competitive  with  the  new  technology  power-plants  on  the  787  and  the  A350.A  re-engined  A330-300,  with  derivatives  of  the  Rolls-Royce  and  GEnx  engines  used  on  the  787,  would  make  the  A330  much  more  competitive.Given  its  far  cheaper  price  tag  than  the  A350-800  or  787,  this  could  give  the  aircraft  life  well  into  the  2020s.Bombardier:  Huge  expectations,  precious  little  time  to  reach  themTraditionally  operating  in  the  shadows  cast  by  Boeing  and  Airbus,  the  Canadian  aircraft  company  will  have  to  sweat  a  bit  if  it  wants  to  steal  some  of  the  spotlight  it  bid  for  in  2013.This  makes  it  one  of  the  more  interesting  players  to  watch  in  the  year  aheadBombardier's  CSeries  aircraft  made  its  first  flight  September  16.  Since  then,  company  officials  have  stuck  with  an  aggressive  entry-into-service  (EIS)  plan  to  follow  within  12  monthsSlower  than  expected  progress  on  flight-testing  and  a  test  schedule  largely  discounted  as  too  optimistic,  however,  have  led  most  aerospace  analysts  to  conclude  that  the  aircraft  won't  likely  see  service  until  the  first  quarter  of  2015.Maybe  even  later.Swiss  Airlines,  an  early  customer,  is  supposed  to  receive  its  first  CS100  in  February  2015,  based  on  the  current  September  2014  EIS  plan.Bombardier  officials  told  a  Swiss  newspaper  the  company  is  now  planning  delivery  in  the  summer  of  2015  or  even  later,  at  least  five  months  beyond  projections.Bombardier  is  expected  to  give  an  EIS  update  on  its  2013  year-end  earnings  call  February  11.  A  new  delay  of  six-to-nine  months  is  expected  to  be  announced.An  EIS  date  slip  from  the  original  plan  of  December  2013  to  mid-2015  (a  period  of  about  18  months)  would  put  the  aircraft  on  a  par  with  the  A350's  delays,  but  well  ahead  of  the  3  ½  years  of  delays  for  Boeing's  787.MORE:  World's  most  dramatic  runways</TEXT></DOC>

By  now  it's  an  established  fact:  Television  doesn't  get  much  more  adorable  than  puppies."Puppy  Bowl,"  Animal  Planet's  alternative  programming  to  the  NFL's  Super  Bowl,  is  the  sublime  result  of  pairing  a  bunch  of  wiggly  puppies  --  66,  in  fact  --  with  squeaky  toys  and  a  mini-stadium  set.  Add  a  "rufferee"  and  a  kitty-filled  halftime,  and  every  floppy  tackle  or  slobbered-on  football  inspires  an  unintelligible  burst  of  baby  talk  and  giggles.

Robert  Ondrovic  and  his  friends  are  just  such  fans.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Where  was  your  best  ballpark  experience?  Send  your  photos  to  CNN  iReport.(CNN)  --  Robert  Ondrovic  was  at  Shea  Stadium  for  the  Mets'  first  season  there  in  1964,  and  he  was  there  for  its  last  in  2008.He's  first  to  tell  you  it  was  one  of  the  worst  ballparks  in  America."Shea  was  outdated  within  four  to  five  years.  Everyone  got  tired  of  sitting  in  a  concrete  doughnut,"  said  Ondrovic,  53,  a  New  York  lawyer  and  die-hard  Mets  fan,  having  grown  up  in  Queens.  "The  pitch  of  the  upper  deck  seating  was  too  steep,  and  the  concession  areas  and  ramps  beneath  the  stands  were  dank."To  a  true  fan,  even  the  poorly  designed  venue  offers  an  adventure  when  there's  a  chance  to  be  part  of  baseball  history.Ondrovic  has  become  something  of  an  expert  on  past-their-prime  parks.  Nearly  every  baseball  season  for  the  past  25  years,  he  and  three  buddies  from  law  school  and  college  have  taken  in  a  major-league  series  at  an  "endangered"  ballpark.  They  call  it  the  Dead  Stadium  Tour.The  four  baseball  junkies,  of  whom  Ondrovic  is  the  official  archivist  and  photographer,  have  visited  18  now-defunct  Major  League  parks.  They've  seen  Olympic  Stadium  in  Montreal,  Tiger  Stadium  in  Detroit,  the  Seattle  Kingdome  and  many  spots  in  between."We  felt  it  was  important  to  the  history  of  the  game  to  see  these  ballparks  before  they  were  torn  down"  or  abandoned  by  Major  League  teams,  said  Rich  Hauptschein,  54,  an  information  systems  consultant  in  Kennett  Square,  Pennsylvania,  and  one  of  the  group's  founding  members.  "We  always  knew  we  could  visit  the  new  ones."The  group's  tradition  started  in  1989  with  a  visit  to  Chicago's  Comiskey  Park,  where  the  White  Sox  played  from  1910  to  1990.  One  guy  dropped  out,  and  Ondrovic  joined  the  tour  the  following  year  for  their  trip  to  Baltimore  Memorial  Stadium  to  see  the  Orioles  play  in  their  final  season  there.  The  foursome  has  been  traveling  together  ever  since.During  each  trip,  the  guys  take  in  a  weekend  series,  schedule  a  few  side  trips  and  take  lots  of  pictures.  Ondrovic  takes  hundreds  of  photos  before  the  game  starts  from  high  in  the  bleachers,  far  away  from  the  action,  but  his  favorite  part  of  each  trip  is  the  group  photo  the  quartet  takes  at  each  stadium.A  video  montage  of  the  photos  in  his  archive  show  the  men  gradually  aging  and  their  children  slowly  joining  in  as  the  next  generation.  If  there's  a  year  when  a  team  isn't  planning  to  move,  they  try  to  predict  which  ballpark  might  be  next  to  go,  or  else  pick  another  ballpark  out  of  a  hat.  After  they've  seen  every  existing  major  league  team  once,  the  guys  will  visit  the  teams  in  their  new  homes.They're  committed  to  continue  the  tradition  for  life,  Hauptschein  said."Others  have  visited  all  the  stadiums,  but  they  have  done  it  during  one  summer,"  Hauptschein  said.  "We  are  able  to  bring  our  kids  with  us  now  and  have  them  experience  what  it  means  to  be  committed  to  a  cause  and  to  share  our  love  of  baseball.  I  truly  expect  them  to  do  this  for  their  entire  lives  and  pass  it  down  to  their  kids."Of  the  18  retired  ballparks,  several  dated  to  the  1960s  and  '70s,  during  the  baseball  building  boom  when  practically  every  team  moved  to  a  generic  "super  stadium"  that  was  designed  first  for  football.  Those  decades  saw  the  opening  of  the  Houston  Astrodome,  Veterans  Stadium  in  Philadelphia  and  the  Seattle  Kingdome  among  others.Baseball  teams  began  to  leave  those  multipurpose  facilities  in  the  1990s,  after  Baltimore's  Camden  Yards  introduced  an  era  of  intimate  "retro  ballparks"  built  just  for  baseball.  After  that,  practically  every  team  wanted  a  new  park,  said  Gary  Gillette,  co-chair  of  the  Society  for  American  Baseball  Research's  ballparks  committee  and  the  lead  author  of  "Big  League  Ballparks:  The  Complete  Illustrated  History.""Super  stadiums  with  artificial  turf  was  the  defining  way  baseball  was  played  from  the  mid-'60s  to  the  mid-'80s.  A  big  chunk  of  baseball  history  is  tied  up  in  those  parks,"  said  Gillette.  He  was  impressed  with  the  dead  stadium  tour,  saying  most  people  seem  to  want  to  see  games  in  places  that  are  "big,  new,  shiny  and  comfortable."Many  of  the  parks  on  the  tour  have  been  far  from  ideal  baseball  venues.The  Municipal  Stadium  in  Cleveland,  one  of  the  country's  earliest  multipurpose  stadiums,  was  so  giant  that  if  you  sat  in  parts  of  the  upper  deck,  "you  felt  like  you  weren't  even  in  the  park,"  Ondrovic  said.  "You  might  as  well  sit  at  home."  The  Cleveland  Indians  played  at  the  lakefront  stadium  beginning  in  1932.  It  was  also  known  for  its  biting  winds.Then  there  was  their  2009  trip  to  see  the  Florida  Marlins  at  what  was  then  called  Dolphin  Stadium,  where  "if  you  sat  in  your  seat  and  looked  straight  ahead,  you  couldn't  watch  the  game."  The  stadium,  later  renamed  Sun  Life,  was  home  to  the  Florida  Marlins  from  1993  to  2011.  The  Miami  Dolphins  and  the  University  of  Miami  Hurricanes  football  teams  still  play  there.The  award  for  "world's  ugliest  stadium"  and  "the  worst  place  to  see  any  sporting  event  on  the  planet"?That  would  be  the  Seattle  Kingdome,  Ondrovic  said.  "The  lighting  was  horrible  ....  It's  one  thing  if  you're  not  going  to  play  on  grass,  but  at  least  pretend  that  you're  going  to  play  on  something  that  resembles  grass.  It  was  so  fake,  it  was  just  ugly.  They  could  not  blow  that  up  fast  enough."  It  was  demolished  in  2000.There  have  been  lots  of  other  memorable  moments.  The  bratwursts  at  the  Milwaukee  County  Stadium  were  so  good  that  the  group  went  to  the  factory  that  made  them  and  placed  an  order  to  ship  back  to  New  York,  Ondrovic  said.At  the  Three  Rivers  Stadium  in  Pittsburgh,  where  the  Pittsburgh  Pirates  played  from  1970  to  2000,  anybody  with  a  ticket  to  the  game  could  go  on  the  field  and  meet  the  players  beforehand."We  had  gloves  and  balls  with  us,  and  we  played  catch  in  the  outfield,"  Ondrovic  said.  "It  left  a  great  memory  --  you're  out  there  having  catch  with  your  buddies,  but  you're  out  there  on  a  major  league  field.  It's  wild."Of  all  the  parks  and  stadiums,  Shea  Stadium  will  remain  Ondrovic's  favorite  for  the  memories  it  holds.  It's  where  his  dad  took  him  to  see  his  first  baseball  game,  on  his  4th  birthday.  He  and  his  father  attended  28  consecutive  opening  day  games  at  Shea,  until  2005,  when  Ondrovic's  dad  could  no  longer  walk  on  his  own  and  he  carried  his  father  to  their  seats  for  their  final  game  together."No  fan  really  thought  of  it  as  a  'good  stadium,'  and  it  had  seen  better  times  long  before  we  finally  got  Citi  Field  built,"  he  said.  "But  it  was  home  away  from  home  for  me  for  over  four  decades,  and  I  cherish  every  memory."Talia  Day,  special  to  CNN,  contributed  to  this  story.</TEXT></DOC>

Her  death  was  ruled  a  suicide,  according  to  the  New  York  City  medical  examiner,  who  determined  Scott  killed  herself  by  hanging.Scott's  personal  estate  is  estimated  to  be  worth  $9  million,  according  to  public  records.  Her  main  asset  was  her  Manhattan  apartment,  which  is  worth  a  projected  $8  million,  according  to  the  filings.Noticeably  absent  from  the  will  are  Scott's  two  siblings,  Randy  Bambrough  and  Jan  Shane.  Representatives  of  the  siblings  could  not  be  immediately  reached.Scott  signed  the  will  on  May  23,  2013,  in  Beverly  Hills,  California,  according  to  the  probate  documents.  Scott's  birth  name  was  Lu  Ann  Bambrough,  the  filing  said.Jo  Wood,  the  ex-wife  of  Rolling  Stones  guitarist  Ronnie  Wood,  told  CNN  last  week  that  the  finances  of  Scott's  fashion  business  may  have  played  a  role  in  her  suicide.Annual  accounts  show  her  London-registered  business  --  LS  Fashion  Ltd  --  had  racked  up  debts  of  5.5  million  euros  ($7.6  million)  by  the  end  of  2012  and  was  burning  through  cash  at  a  rapid  rate.The  accounts,  filed  in  October  2013,  show  LS  Fashion's  cash  reserves  were  decimated  over  the  course  of  a  year,  plunging  to  just  under  70,000  euros  at  the  end  of  2012  from  over  750,000  euros  a  year  earlierThe  company's  deficit  ballooned  by  40%  to  surpass  4.2  million  euros  ($5.9  million)  over  the  same  period.However,  in  a  statement  issued  last  Friday,  a  representative  for  Scott  said,  "The  figures  quoted  in  the  media  regarding  the  financial  status  of  LS  Fashion  Limited  are  not  only  highly  misleading  and  inaccurate  but  also  extremely  hurtful  and  disrespectful  to  the  memory  of  L'Wren  Scott.""The  long-term  prospects  for  the  business  were  encouraging.  Ms.  Scott  was  very  focused  on  doing  what  was  right  for  her  global  business  and  for  the  support  of  her  team,"  the  statement  said.Jagger,  70,  posted  a  personal  statement  about  Scott's  death  on  his  website  last  week:  "I  am  still  struggling  to  understand  how  my  lover  and  best  friend  could  end  her  life  in  this  tragic  way.  We  spent  many  wonderful  years  together  and  had  made  a  great  life  for  ourselves.  She  had  great  presence  and  her  talent  was  much  admired,  not  least  by  me."Scott  had  been  dating  the  Rolling  Stones  frontman  since  at  least  2003.  The  lanky  former  model  designed  clothes  worn  by  a  number  of  celebrities,  including  singer  Madonna,  actress  Allison  Williams  of  HBO's  "Girls,"  and  actress  Christina  Hendricks  of  AMC's  "Mad  Men."  She  also  created  many  of  Jagger's  looks  for  the  Rolling  Stones'  50th  anniversary  tour,  which  began  in  2012  and  is  currently  in  Australia.The  Art  of  Elysium,  an  organization  that  brings  the  arts  to  hospitalized  children,  announced  Thursday  that  it  had  created  an  award  in  Scott's  name.A  private  service  for  Scott  was  held  Tuesday  at  a  Hollywood  cemetery.CNN's  Alan  Duke  and  CNN  Money's  Alanna  Petroff  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Another  sat  at  the  controls  of  a  helicopter.  A  mixed  martial  arts  instructor  posed  with  arms  crossed.  They're  seen  riding  motorcycles,  hauling  in  massive  sailfish,  slugging  softballs  for  the  "NYPD  Blues,"  taking  jump  shots,  running  half  marathons  and  golfing,  and  even  giving  television  news  interviews  while  selling  cannoli  at  Manhattan's  famed  San  Genaro  festival.They  are  among  the  more  than  100  retired  New  York  City  police  and  firefighters  indicted  in  a  massive  Social  Security  disability  scam  involving  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars,  authorities  said.  More  than  half  the  recipients  received  funds  for  fraudulent  claims  for  PTSD  in  the  wake  of  the  September  11,  2001,  terror  attacks  on  the  World  Trade  Center."We  will  chase  down  every  penny  that  these  dishonorable  thieves  fraudulently  pilfered  so  that  the  truly  heroic  firefighters,  police  officers,  medics,  and  civilians  who  actually  risked  their  lives  on  September  11,  2001,  and  are  now  suffering  because  of  it,  can  get  the  care  that  they  critically  need,"  said  James  T.  Hayes,  Jr.,  special  agent-in-charge  of  Homeland  Security  Investigations  New  York.The  alleged  scam  spanned  more  than  two  decades,  with  law  enforcement  officers  and  firefighters  coached  on  how  to  behave  during  doctor  visits  in  order  to  qualify  for  full  disability  benefits,  officials  said."As  a  New  Yorker,  as  a  U.S.  citizen,  I  can  only  express  disgust  at  the  actions  of  these  individuals  involved  in  this  scheme,  particularly  the  72  former  members  of  the  New  York  City  Police  Department  who  have  certainly  disgraced  themselves,  embarrassed  their  families,  with  their  abuse  of  this  system,"  Police  Commissioner  William  Bratton  said  at  a  news  conference.  "The  idea  that  many  of  them  chose  the  events  of  9/11  to  claim  as  the  basis  of  the  disability  brings  further  dishonor  to  themselves."The  defendants  received  up  to  $50,000  a  year  because,  they  claimed,  they  were  no  longer  able  to  work,  officials  said.  Many  of  the  claims  allegedly  involved  work-related  trauma  caused  by  the  9/11  terror  attacks.  The  9/11-related  claims  alone  totaled  hundreds  of  thousands  of  dollars.All  the  defendants  pleaded  not  guilty  Tuesday,  according  to  the  Manhattan  district  attorney's  office.The  main  defendants  were  identified  as  Raymond  Lavallee,  83,  a  lawyer  and  former  FBI  agent  and  Nassau  County  prosecutor;  Thomas  Hale,  89,  a  disability  consultant;  John  Minerva,  61,  a  union  official  for  the  Detectives'  Endowment  Association;  and  Joseph  Esposito,  64,  a  retired  police  officer.  Lavallee  also  was  chief  of  the  rackets  bureau  in  the  Nassau  County  District  Attorney's  office.Lawyers  for  Lavallee,  Hale  and  Esposito  said  the  three  men  deny  the  charges.  Minerva's  lawyer  could  not  be  reached."It  doesn't  appear  that  anyone  doubts  that  initially  every  single  one  of  these  104  defendants  was  in  fact  disabled,"  said  Esposito's  lawyer,  Brian  Griffin.  "It  appears  to  be  the  extent  of  their  disability  that's  in  question."Raymond  Perini  said  his  client,  Lavallee,  a  Korean  War  vet  who  went  to  law  school  on  the  G.I.  Bill,  will  regain  his  good  name.  "We're  going  to  get  that  reputation  back  in  court  when  he's  found  not  guilty,"  he  said.Prosecutors  said  the  men  allegedly  directed  and  coached  hundreds  of  Social  Security  Disability  Insurance  applicants,  including  many  retirees  of  the  NYPD  and  FDNY,  to  lie  about  psychiatric  conditions  in  order  to  obtain  benefits.The  charges  include  grand  larceny  in  the  first  and  second  degrees,  and  attempted  grand  larceny  in  the  second  degree.  The  remaining  102  defendants,  all  recipients  of  Social  Security  disability  benefits,  were  charged  with  grand  larceny  in  the  second  degree  and  attempted  grand  larceny  in  the  second  degree."It's  a  particularly  cynical  part  of  the  ...  scheme  that  approximately  half  of  the  defendants  falsely  claimed  that  their  psychiatric  disabilities  were  caused  by  their  association  with  the  terrorist  attacks  of  September  11th,"  said  District  Attorney  Cyrus  Vance,  Jr.  "This  fraud  not  only  forced  federal  taxpayers  to  finance  the  lifestyles  of  New  York  scammers,  it  also  took  away,  importantly,  the  already  limited  resources  we  have  for  people  who  actually  suffered  from  psychiatric  disabilities.  That  includes,  of  course,  the  brave  first  responders  who  ran  toward  the  fires  on  September  11th,  and  who  now  suffer  from  post-traumatic  stress  disorder,  depression,  anxiety  and  other  serious  but  very  real  psychiatric  disabilities."The  average  annual  payment  was  between  $30,000  to  $50,000  for  each  recipient,  prosecutors  said.  Of  the  defendants,  72  were  also  collecting  pensions  as  retirees  of  the  NYPD,  eight  from  the  New  York  City  Fire  Department,  five  from  the  New  York  Department  of  Correction  and  one  from  the  Nassau  County  Police  Department.Prosecutors  said  the  defendants  were  meticulously  instructed  on  how  to  fail  memory  tests  with  plausibility,  how  to  dress  and  how  to  behave.  Nearly  every  application  included  identical  descriptions  of  the  activities  of  daily  living:  "I  nap  on  and  off  during  the  day;"  "I  have  the  TV  on  to  keep  me  company;"  "I'm  up  and  down  all  night  long."The  leaders  of  the  scheme  allegedly  collected  one-time  cash  payments  based  on  the  monthly  disability  awards  --  ranging  from  approximately  $20,000  to  $50,000,  prosecutors  said.  In  addition,  Lavallee  also  received  $6,000  directly  from  the  government  for  attorney's  fees  for  each  applicant.The  applicants  were  instructed  to  withdraw  cash  from  the  bank  in  increments  under  $10,000  to  avoid  raising  suspicion  or  require  the  filing  of  government  currency  reports,  according  to  court  papers.Some  of  those  charged  went  on  to  hold  other  jobs,  including  teaching  martial  arts,  even  though  the  full  disability  they  received  involved  a  diagnosis  that  they  were  so  traumatized  they  were  incapable  of  performing  any  kind  of  work,  officials  added.In  some  instances,  prosecutor  said,  the  total  amount  fraudulently  obtained  was  nearly  $500,000  per  applicant.  The  average  Social  Security  Disability  Insurance  payment  to  date  for  the  defendants,  which  included  retroactive  lump  sum  payments,  was  about  $210,000."The  applicants  were  coached  to  tell  Social  Security  Administration  they  were  unable  to  perform  basic  life  skills,  like  cooking  for  themselves,  grooming  themselves,  paying  bills  and  socializing,"  Vance  said."Many  said  they  could  no  longer  drive  or  be  out  of  the  house  for  more  than  a  short  walk  around  the  house.

It's  been  a  bad  season  for  air  travelers."January  2014  saw  40,000  flight  cancellations  --  it  took  until  April  11  in  2013  to  add  up  that  many  flight  cancellations,"  said  FlightAware  CEO  Mark  Duell  in  an  e-mail.No  relief:  More  snow,  cold  for  Midwest,  NortheastAround  noon  ET  Wednesday,  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  was  reporting  delays  of  a  little  more  than  two  hours  for  flights  arriving  at  Chicago's  O'Hare  International  Airport.Drivers  have  no  doubt  had  it  worse,  with  successive  storms  repeatedly  snarling  road  conditions  in  many  states.Here  are  some  tips  to  ease  the  trip  home,  but  above  all  else,  patience  --  and  caution  --  will  be  key:Rebook  your  flight  for  free.  Airlines  rolled  out  their  customary  winter  weather  waivers  this  week,  so  most  passengers  traveling  to,  from  or  through  affected  areas  can  make  one  itinerary  change  without  paying  a  change  fee.  Delta,  American,  US  Airways,  United,  Southwest/AirTran  and  JetBlue  have  all  posted  weather  policies  on  their  websites.Act  quickly.  Rebook  your  itinerary  as  soon  as  possible.  Other  passengers  are  snapping  up  open  seats  as  you  mull  over  a  new  itinerary.  Be  sure  your  airline  has  your  e-mail  address  and  phone  number,  advises  Rick  Seaney,  CEO  of  airfare  tracker  FareCompare.com.  If  you  didn't  provide  this  information  when  you  purchased  the  ticket,  go  online  and  add  it.Follow  your  airline  and  airport  on  social  media.  Many  airlines  and  airports  post  the  speediest  updates  to  their  Twitter  feeds,  so  start  following  them.  Sign  up  for  airline  alerts  to  get  flight  updates  e-mailed  to  your  smartphone.If  you're  stranded,  multitask.  Get  online,  get  on  the  phone  and  get  in  the  ticketing  line  (if  you're  already  at  the  airport).  With  thousands  of  flights  delayed  or  canceled,  competition  will  be  fierce  for  seats  when  operations  start  humming  again.  Get  airline  apps  for  your  phone  and  try  to  contact  your  airline  on  Twitter,  Seaney  suggests.Elite  fliers  should  use  their  loyalty  program  hotlines  and  head  to  frequent  flier  lounges  for  better  access  to  airline  reps.  "This  might  be  the  time  to  spring  for  a  lounge  day-pass  just  to  gain  access  to  these  folks,"  Seaney  told  CNN  earlier  this  season.Use  the  NextFlight  app  and  type  in  your  arrival  and  departure  cities  to  get  the  next  flights  for  the  major  airlines,  suggests  Benet  J.  Wilson,  Aviation  Queen  travel  blogger.  Then  call  the  airline  on  your  cell  phone  and  give  them  your  preferred  options.Charge  your  devices.  Hopefully,  you're  not  among  those  travelers  stranded  at  the  airport,  where  jockeying  for  electrical  outlets  is  inevitable.  Charge  up  before  you  head  out  and  keep  a  charger  and  a  power  pack  or  a  few  battery  chargers  for  your  portable  electronic  devices  handy.Check  your  flight,  no  matter  where  you're  going.  Think  you  don't  have  to  worry  about  bad  weather  because  you're  flying  from  sunny  California  to  sunny  Florida?  Not  so  fast."Because  airlines  operate  networks,  a  storm  affects  not  only  flights  in  its  immediate  location  but  even  those  in  far-removed  locations  not  affected  by  the  storm,"  said  Cynthia  Barnhart,  an  MIT  engineering  professor  who  teaches  airline  schedule  planning.Check  your  aircraft's  journey  on  your  airline  website  or  with  an  app  such  as  Flightview.Don't  be  a  jerk.  "The  airline  representatives  did  not  make  it  snow,"  Seaney  reminds  travelers.  "We've  heard  many  anecdotal  stories  over  the  years  from  airline  representatives  who  tell  us  it's  a  lot  easier  to  find  a  good  flight  for  a  pleasant  passenger  than  for  one  who  is  screaming  at  you."Use  common  sense:  Don't  drive  into  a  storm.  It's  treacherous  out  there.  Monitor  your  local  and  regional  forecasts  and  don't  drive  if  you  don't  have  to  do  so.AAA  advises  motorists  to  check  tire  pressure  and  make  sure  car  batteries,  cooling  systems  and  antifeeze  levels  are  in  order.  Keep  gas  tanks  close  to  full,  the  automobile  association  advises,  so  that  you'll  be  able  to  run  the  engine  for  heat  in  case  you  get  stranded.AAA  suggests  keeping  the  following  items  in  your  car:  a  shovel  and  a  bag  of  sand,  a  snowbrush  and  ice  scraper,  jumper  cables,  a  spare  tire,  windshield  wiper  fluid,  a  cell  phone  and  car  charger  and  blankets,  gloves,  hats  and  food,  water  and  essential  medication.</TEXT></DOC>

Former  Sen.  Scott  Brown's  following  a  different  playbook.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Scott  Brown  knows  how  to  stay  in  the  spotlight.And  for  a  politician  who's  sitting  on  the  sidelines,  possibly  waiting  to  make  his  next  move,  staying  in  the  spotlight  is  smart  politics.Some  out-of-office  politicians  write  books,  some  host  cable  TV  or  radio  talk  shows  or  serve  as  pundits.  Brown's  following  a  different  playbook.The  former  U.S.  senator  from  Massachusetts,  who  recently  moved  to  New  Hampshire  and  is  considering  a  GOP  challenge  this  year  to  Democratic  Sen.  Jeanne  Shaheen,  is  once  again  in  the  headlines.Brown  jammed  on  stage  this  past  weekend  at  a  concert  in  Lynn,  Massachusetts,  with  longtime  rock  group  Cheap  Trick,  joining  the  band  in  playing  "Surrender,"  one  of  its  biggest  hits  from  the  1970s."Hope  you  all  enjoy  this  as  much  as  I  did,"  he  said  in  a  Facebook  post,  which  links  to  the  YouTube  video  of  Brown  singing  and  playing  guitar.The  story  played  across  New  Hampshire  and  Massachusetts,  and  grabbed  some  national  coverage  as  well.This  was  the  second  high-profile  jam  session  for  Brown,  who  started  to  play  guitar  about  year  ago.In  December,  he  rocked  with  his  daughter,  Ayla,  of  "American  Idol"  fame,  and  Mike  Huckabee  on  the  former  Arkansas  governor  and  2008  GOP  presidential  candidate's  Fox  News  Channel  program.A  few  weeks  ago,  Brown  made  the  front  page  of  the  "Union  Leader,"  New  Hampshire's  largest  newspaper,  as  he  stripped  down  to  his  bathing  suit  for  the  annual  Penguin  plunge  at  Hampton  Beach.  The  event  raises  money  for  the  Special  Olympics.Brown  famously  stripped  down  years  before,  as  a  Cosmopolitan  centerfold  during  his  years  as  a  law  school  student.From  the  State  House  to  Capitol  HillIn  January  2010,  the  little-known  Republican  state  senator  in  Massachusetts  pulled  an  upset  in  a  special  election  to  serve  the  final  three  years  of  the  late  Democratic  Sen.  Ted  Kennedy's  term.Brown  lost  his  2012  re-election  bid  to  Democratic  challenger  Elizabeth  Warren.Since  leaving  Capitol  Hill,  Brown  took  an  on-air  contributor  gig  at  Fox  News,  served  as  a  colonel  in  the  Army  National  Guard's  office  at  the  Pentagon,  and  is  an  attorney  at  the  global  law  firm  of  Nixon  Peabody,  which  has  offices  in  Boston.Last  year,  he  passed  on  running  in  a  special  election  in  Massachusetts  to  fill  the  term  of  John  Kerry,  who  left  the  Senate  to  become  secretary  of  state.And  at  the  time,  Brown  also  announced  that  he  wouldn't  make  a  2014  bid  for  an  open  governor's  seat  in  the  Bay  State.Brown  last  year  made  a  number  of  speaking  appearances  at  GOP  events  in  the  Granite  State.  And  last  fall,  in  another  hint  about  a  possible  run  for  the  Senate  in  New  Hampshire,  Brown  dropped  the  'MA'  from  his  Twitter  handle.A  few  months  later,  he  sold  his  home  in  the  Bay  State  and  moved  his  residency  north  to  New  Hampshire.A  brand  nameBrown's  well  known  in  New  England,  which  gives  him  many  advantages."He  can  be  an  undeclared  candidate  and  make  news.  He  doesn't  need  to  build  his  name  ID,"  a  Republican  strategist  who's  been  in  contact  with  Brown  told  CNN."That  gives  him  the  luxury  to  wait  longer  than  a  new  and  unknown  candidate.  He  already  has  a  brand  name  and  has  the  ability  to  raise  resources  to  launch  a  campaign,"  the  strategist  said.Brian  Walsh,  a  GOP  strategist  and  communications  director  for  the  National  Republican  Senatorial  Committee  the  past  two  election  cycles,  said  Brown's  cementing  his  image  as  a  regular  guy."The  main  reasons  candidates  announce  early  is  to  raise  money,  boost  name  ID  and  to  have  an  edge  in  their  party's  primary.  But  Scott  Brown  already  enjoys  the  unique  position  where  those  aren't  necessarily  major  factors  if  he  decides  to  run  in  a  state  with  a  late  September  primary  and  where  he's  already  well-known  and  well-liked  among  many  New  Hampshire  voters,"  Walsh  said.Brown's  strong  name  ID  is  definitely  a  plus,  but  it  also  may  be  a  minus.  After  a  couple  of  outside  conservative  groups  ran  TV  commercials  in  support  of  Brown,  Shaheen  started  fundraising  off  the  threat  of  a  Brown  entry  into  the  race.And  some  outside  pro-Democratic  groups  targeted  Brown,  including  the  Senate  Majority  PAC,  which  went  up  with  attack  ads,  charging  that  he's  a  favorite  of  the  Wall  Street  crowd.Will  Brown  run?The  strategist  in  contact  with  Brown,  who  asked  to  remain  anonymous  to  speak  freely,  says  Brown's  looking  to  make  a  decision  about  a  Senate  bid  in  the  next  few  weeks."I  think  he  understands  the  opportunity  in  2014  to  win,  but  he's  facing  a  number  of  family  concerns  that  are  weighing  on  this  decision.  I  think  he  is  genuinely  conflicted  and  he  first  needs  to  figure  out  if  he  has  the  ability  to  run  a  political  campaign  given  the  family  concerns.  Among  those  concerns  is  his  mother's  in  declining  health.  Plus,  he's  helping  to  plan  two  weddings  right  now,  as  both  of  his  daughters  are  getting  married  this  summer,"  the  source  said.Some  New  Hampshire  Republicans  who  at  first  didn't  take  Brown's  flirtations  seriously  have  changed  their  minds."I've  gone  from  a  skeptic  to  a  convert  on  the  possibility  of  a  Brown  candidacy.  He  appears  to  be  considering  this  race  very  seriously,  which  clearly  makes  Sen.  Shaheen  and  her  team  nervous.  His  favorable  poll  numbers  plus  the  activist  encouragement  he  is  receiving  only  helps,"  GOP  strategist  Jim  Merrill  told  CNN."Either  way,  voters  hope  he  decides  soon  as  they're  anxious  for  the  primary  field  to  be  set,  with  other  GOP  candidates  out  there  working  hard,"  added  Merrill,  who  was  a  senior  adviser  for  Mitt  Romney's  2012  presidential  campaign.As  Brown  continues  to  mull  his  options,  CNN  has  confirmed  he  will  speak  next  month  at  the  Northeast  Republican  Leadership  Conference,  a  high-profile  event  in  New  Hampshire.  This  latest  move  keeps  Brown  in  the  spotlight,  and  sparks  more  speculation  he'll  run  for  Senate.As  Brown  continues  to  mull  his  options,  CNN  confirmed  on  Tuesday  that  he  will  speak  next  month  at  the  Northeast  Republican  Leadership  Conference,  a  high  profile  event  in  New  Hampshire.

He  is  the  author  of  "Jimmy  Carter"  and  "Governing  America."(CNN)  --  A  fight  has  broken  out  between  two  of  the  most  prominent  members  of  the  Republican  Party:  Texas  Sen.  Ted  Cruz  and  Kentucky  Sen.  Rand  Paul.In  an  op-ed  for  Breitbart  News,  Paul  took  a  shot  at  Cruz,  without  actually  naming  him,  when  he  wrote,  "I  will  remind  anyone  who  thinks  we  will  win  elections  by  trashing  previous  Republican  nominees  or  holding  oneself  out  as  some  paragon  in  the  mold  of  Reagan,  that  splintering  the  party  is  not  the  route  to  victory."  This  was  just  one  more  flash  point  in  the  ongoing  tension  that  has  characterized  their  relationship.The  back-and-forth  has  captured  considerable  attention  since  both  men  have  been  discussed  as  possible  contenders  for  the  Republican  nomination  in  2016.Each  is  seen  as  representing  a  different  faction  of  the  Republican  right:  Cruz  the  take-no-prisoners,  slash-and-burn  conservatives  who  will  do  just  about  anything  to  obtain  their  objectives  and  Paul  the  libertarian  voice  pushing  back  against  all  forms  of  government.If  Cruz  and  Paul  turn  out  to  be  the  major  spokespersons  for  the  debate  about  where  the  Republican  Party  should  go,  then  the  party  is  going  to  be  in  some  big  trouble.Cruz  represents  an  extremist  wing  of  the  GOP  that  can't  seem  to  govern.  Since  the  emergence  of  the  tea  party  in  2009,  the  Republican  Party  has  been  shaped  by  a  group  of  politicians  who  have  been  willing  to  employ  extraordinarily  aggressive  tactics  in  the  pursuit  of  cuts  to  domestic  spending.  Nobody  has  symbolized  this  style  of  leadership  more  than  Cruz.  He  led  the  drumbeat  to  shut  down  the  federal  government  to  force  President  Obama's  hand  on  spending  and  has  favored  the  Republican  refusal  to  raise  the  debt  ceiling.  Cruz  has  also  been  a  master  of  the  filibuster,  employing  variations  of  the  tactic  to  bring  the  Senate  to  a  standstill.This  image  of  obstructionist  governance  might  excite  the  most  loyal  activists  in  the  party,  but  it  is  not  a  style  conducive  to  presidential  leadership  and  it  is  not  a  style  that  plays  well  at  a  national  level.Republicans  have  suffered  greatly  in  the  polls  as  a  result  of  these  kinds  of  extremist  tactics.  One  recent  poll  found  that  four  out  of  five  Americans  don't  trust  the  Republican  Party.  "That's  just  about  as  bad  as  it  gets,"  noted  MSNBC  host,  and  Republican,  Joe  Scarborough.  Many  Americans  question  whether  the  Republicans  can  govern.  A  Cruz  candidacy  would  perfectly  set  up  a  Hillary  Clinton  candidacy  by  allowing  Democrats  to  emphasize  her  ability  to  get  things  done  and  make  the  political  system  work.Rand  Paul  represents  a  different  problem:  He  is  a  politician  whose  rhetoric  is  totally  at  odds  with  the  history  of  the  GOP.  Since  the  1930s,  libertarians  have  had  trouble  gaining  traction  within  the  party.The  reality  has  been  that  most  Republicans  have  embraced  the  federal  government  as  a  permanent  part  of  national  politics.  In  the  area  of  national  security,  the  party  has  been  a  driving  force  behind  the  expansion  of  the  military  establishment  since  the  Cold  War.While  some  Republicans  like  Paul  might  now  rail  against  the  surveillance  tactics  of  the  National  Security  Agency,  the  recent  power  of  this  agency  was  built  on  the  foundation  that  Republicans  built  with  the  war  on  terrorism  under  President  George  W.  Bush.Neither  have  Republicans  been  a  true  small  government  party  in  domestic  policy.  Studies  have  shown  how  federal  spending  has  grown  more  dramatically  under  Republican  presidents,  including  Ronald  Reagan,  than  Democrats.Most  Republicans  have  avoided  cutting  most  of  the  big-ticket  programs,  such  as  Social  Security  or  farm  assistance,  while  pushing  for  an  expansion  of  government  in  other  areas,  such  as  Medicare  Prescription  Drugs.  Republican  legislators  have  been  as  skillful  at  pork-barrel  politics  as  anyone  from  the  other  side  of  the  aisle.Though  Paul  may  claim  he  will  do  things  differently,  Democrats  could  have  a  field  day  challenging  the  veracity  of  such  claims  given  the  weight  of  history  that  he  faces.The  weaknesses  of  both  men—Cruz  in  terms  of  his  style  and  Paul  in  terms  of  his  rhetoric—point  out  how  desperate  the  GOP  is  to  find  someone  who  can  build  a  broad  coalition,  something  that  is  essential  for  a  presidential  victory,  particularly  when  Republicans  will  likely  be  facing  a  formidable  candidate.The  problems  of  New  Jersey  Gov.  Chris  Christie  have  been  a  huge  blow  to  the  party,  and  there  are  not  many  alternatives  at  this  point  who  are  willing  to  run  to  replace  a  figure  who,  in  terms  of  style  of  governance  and  rhetoric,  would  have  a  better  chance  of  appealing  to  voters  beyond  the  base.  This  is  the  reason  former  Florida  Gov.  Jeb  Bush  is  getting  so  much  buzz,  as  potentially  the  only  other  person  who  can  fill  this  void.If  Republicans  can't  find  some  alternative  and  the  primaries  revolve  around  the  tension  between  Ted  Cruz  and  Rand  Paul,  Democrats  will  be  in  excellent  position  to  retain  the  White  House  in  2016.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Julian  Zelizer.</TEXT></DOC>

(Though,  to  be  fair,  French  microbreweries  are  starting  to  make  up  for  lost  time).No  such  concerns  in  the  northern  French  city  of  Lille.Here  traditional  local  restaurants  combine  the  intricacies  of  Gallic  dining  culture  --  making  extensive  use  of  the  region's  tasty  maroilles  cheese  --  with  the  bold  beer  selections  favored  further  to  the  north.At  Estaminet  Chez  la  Vieille  (60  rue  de  Gand;  +33  328  364006;  website  in  French  only)  the  beef  in  beer,  and  roast  chicken  in  cheese,  are  worth  the  trip.The  city  also  blends  Flemish  with  classical  Parisian  architecture  --  the  art  deco  Coilliot  House  (14  Rue  de  Fleurus)  is  a  prime  example.And  its  Palais  des  Beaux  Artes  de  Lille  (18  Rue  de  Valmy;  +33  3  20  06  78  00)  has  one  of  the  best  collections  of  classic  art  outside  the  capital.Bratislava,  SlovakiaBorders:  Austria,  HungaryClose  to  the  border  of  both  Austria  and  Hungary,  the  proud  capital  of  Slovakia  has  only  recently  emerged  from  a  centuries-long  identity  crisis  that  still  resonates  around  fairy  tale  streets  that  once  charmed  Hans  Christian  Andersen.Bratislava  --  or  as  it  has  variously  been  known,  Istropolis,  Bresburg,  Pressburg  and,  briefly,  Wilson  City  --  was  for  300  years  the  capital  of  the  Hungarian  Kingdom.Meanwhile,  its  close  ties  with  nearby  Vienna  once  saw  the  two  cities  share  a  tram  line.It  was  also,  until  the  "velvet  divorce"  of  1993,  part  of  the  old  Czechoslovakia.The  reconstructed  Bratislava  Castle  (+421  2  544  114  44)  has  been  witness  to  most  of  this  and  is  a  good  place  to  savor  a  city  that's  enjoyed  a  unique  place  at  the  crossroads  of  central  Europe,  as  well  as  the  imperious  views  it  commands  over  the  nearby  borders.Traditional  local  cuisine  is  a  hearty  melange  of  dishes  influenced  by  Austria  and  Hungary.Presburg  (Michalska  382/4;  +421  2  544  384  55)  or  Leberfinger  (Viedenska  cesta  257;  +421  2  623  175  90)  are  both  good  options  for  food.Malmo,  SwedenBorder:  DenmarkAnother  country-hopping  city  that  continues  to  bear  the  imprint  of  its  former  occupants,  Malmo  lies  on  the  southern  coast  of  what's  now  Sweden  but  was,  until  the  17th  century,  Danish.The  two  nations  are  now  umbilically  connected  by  the  majestic  eight-kilometer  Oresund  Bridge,  which  plugs  Malmo  almost  directly  into  the  Danish  capital  of  Copenhagen  and  serves  as  a  potent  symbol  of  their  close  ties  (not  least  in  the  gripping  Danish-Swedish  TV  drama  "The  Bridge").You  can  still  hunt  for  Danish  influence  in  the  buildings  of  Malmo's  Gamla  Stan  (Old  Town),  although  it's  more  fun  these  days  to  contemplate  modern  architecture,  including  the  twisty  Turning  Torso  skyscraper  (Lilla  Varvsgatan;

 +46  40  660  85  00).San  Sebastian,  SpainBorder:  FranceThe  sheer  size  of  France,  and  its  numerous  borders,  mean  an  inevitable  reappearance  in  this  list  --  this  time  pushing  its  influence  into  Spain.In  San  Sebastian,  just  20  kilometers  south  of  the  border,  France's  contribution  can  be  seen  in  the  city's  neat  urban  layout  and  the  Belle  Epoque  architecture  of  its  grand  casino-turned-city  hall  and  Victoria  Eugenia  theater  (Republica  Argentina  2,  +34  943  48  11  60).Also,  as  more  than  one  grumbling  tourist  has  pointed  out,  in  the  prices  that  are  typically  higher  than  the  rest  of  provincial  Spain.The  French  would  also  no  doubt  like  to  take  credit  for  San  Sebastian's  disproportionately  large  number  of  internationally  rated  restaurants.And  although  the  surrounding  Basque  region  does  have  its  own  strong  culinary  traditions,  French  fine  dining  has  clearly  made  its  mark  at  places  such  as  Arzak  (Av.  del  Alcalde  Jose  Elosegi;  273,  +34  943  27  84  65),  among  a  trio  of  restaurants  in  the  city  to  earn  three  Michelin  stars.Trieste,  ItalyBorder:  SloveniaWhile  this  Italian  port  lies  close  to  the  border  of  Slovenia  and  within  striking  distance  of  Croatia,  its  heritage  lies  firmly  within  the  same  middle  European  empires  that  once  laid  claim  to  Prague,  Vienna  and  Budapest.And  so  from  Italy  we  have  operetta,  piazzas  (the  monumental  Piazza  dell'Unità  d'Italia  is  one  of  Europe's  largest)  and  gelato,  the  latter  being  unsurpassed  at  Chocolat  (via  Cavana  15/b;  +39  040  30  05  24).From  Vienna  we  get  literary  salons  of  the  kind  that  drew  "Ulysses"  author  James  Joyce  to  Trieste.Most  have  now  fallen  by  the  wayside,  but  a  recent  campaign  appears  to  have  saved  Joyce's  mahogany-lined  favorite,  Caffe  San  Marco  (Via  Cesare  Battisti,  18).And  from  Hungary  we  get  places  like  Buffet  da  Pepi,  small  eateries  where  pretty  much  everything  on  the  menu  contains  pig,  beer  or  pickled  cabbage  (via  della  Cassa  di  Risparmio  3;  +39  040  366  858).Kirkenes,  NorwayBorders:  Finland,  RussiaA  chilly  400  kilometers  north  of  the  Arctic  Circle  lies  Kirkenes,  a  small  Norwegian  town  located  between  the  borders  of  Finland  and  Russia.Admittedly,  there  isn't  much  in  Kirkenes  to  influence  --  for  a  lot  of  the  year  it's  too  shrouded  in  gloom  and  snow  to  distinguish  from  other  settlements  in  region.But  as  a  visit  to  the  Sor-Varanger  museum  (Hvistendalsgate  31;  +47  789  428  90)  confirms,  Russian  revolutions,  czars  and  Finnish  migrants  have  all  left  their  mark.Kirkenes  isn't  without  its  attractions.During  the  literally  endless  days  of  summer,  the  fjords  and  forests  are  worth  exploring.Winter  brings  spectacular  displays  of  northern  lights  and  the  almost  obligatory  Snow  Hotel  (Sandnesdalen  14;  +47  789  705  40).There's  also  a  Russian  market  (Barents  Spektakel)  on  the  last  Thursday  of  every  month,  where  you  can  buy  matryoshka  nesting  dolls  as  well  as  porcelain  and,  because  apparently  nothing  says  Russia  like  a  pair  of  knitted  toe  warmers,  socks.</TEXT></DOC>

Authorities  believe  the  shooter  might  strike  again.The  victim,  Timothy  Davison,  a  28-year-old  resident  of  Maine,  was  driving  home  Saturday  on  Interstate  81  in  Antrim  Township  in  Pennsylvania  when  he  dialed  911  to  report  that  another  motorist  was  chasing  him  and  driving  aggressively,  police  said.  Moments  later,  Davison  was  shot  dead.Investigators  believe  that  the  same  motorist  may  have  been  behind  another  road-rage  shooting  eight  hours  earlier  in  the  same  area.  No  one  was  injured  in  that  incident,  when  shots  were  fired  at  a  car."The  acts  committed  against  Mr.  Davison  were  random  only  to  the  point  of  his  initial  encounter  with  his  assailant,"  the  Pennsylvania  state  police  said  in  a  statement.  "Beyond  that,  the  acts  against  him  were  very  deliberate,  calculated,  and  violent...  The  potential  for  additional  incidents  of  similar  nature  is  anticipated  due  to  the  violent  nature  of  this  incident."James  Allocca,  Davison's  uncle,  told  CNN  that  the  family  "wants  justice  before  someone  else  gets  hurt."The  victim's  father,  Timothy  Davison  Sr.,  told  CNN  that  he  learned  about  his  son's  death  when  police  arrived  at  his  door  on  Saturday."I  can't  begin  to  tell  you  what  it's  like  to  hear  that,"  he  said.  "It's  not  right."He  went  to  Pennsylvania  Tuesday  to  collect  his  son's  personal  belongings.His  son,  he  said,  was  a  "great  guy  and  a  very  easy  kid  to  raise.""He  cared  for  everyone  around  him,"  he  said.  "He  was  a  rugged  kid,  extremely  sensitive."Davison  worked  at  his  father's  construction  business.He  said  he  hoped  to  meet  his  son's  killer.  Asked  what  he  would  say,  Timothy  Davison  Sr.  said:  "That  is  for  me."A  task  force  that  includes  the  Pennsylvania  and  Maryland  state  police  as  well  as  the  FBI  was  investigating  the  two  shootings  over  the  weekend."While  there  are  many  similarities  between  the  two;  conclusive  evidence  definitively  connecting  the  two  has  yet  to  be  established,"  the  state  police  statement  said.  "Both  investigations  will  be  treated  as  being  related  until  conclusive  evidence  proves  otherwise."Police  said  the  shooter  was  driving  a  small  truck  similar  to  a  Ford  Ranger,  and  the  vehicle  would  have  panel  damage  from  ramming  Davison's  vehicle.Anyone  with  information  is  asked  to  call  Crime  Stoppers  at  800-472-8477."There  are  different  levels  of  loss,"  Allocca  said.

The  DUI  charge  was  dismissed  in  exchange  for  the  plea.The  DUI  charge  was  filed  in  June  2012  after  Bynes'  BMW  allegedly  sideswiped  a  police  cruiser  in  West  Hollywood  in  April  2012.  She  picked  up  two  hit-and-run  cases  in  the  next  several  months,  along  with  a  charge  of  driving  with  a  suspended  license.  All  of  those  charges  were  eventually  dropped.The  DUI  case  was  delayed  while  a  doctor  reported  to  the  court  on  Bynes'  mental  condition.  It  got  back  on  the  calendar  in  November  when  a  judge  found  her  to  be  mentally  competent  to  stand  trial.A  New  York  criminal  case  relating  to  an  incident  involving  a  bong  allegedly  tossed  from  her  Manhattan  apartment  window  was  dropped  last  month.The  troubled  27-year-old  actress  spent  four  months  in  residential  psychiatric  care  last  year  after  a  bizarre  incident  in  a  neighbor's  driveway  last  July.  A  judge  placed  her  under  an  involuntary  psychiatric  hold  which  was  extended  at  her  parents'  request.Bynes  was  released  from  a  Malibu  treatment  center  in  December  and  now  lives  in  the  custody  of  her  parents.  He  parents  issued  a  statement  at  the  time  saying  that  she  would  continue  outpatient  treatment  several  times  a  week.She  was  just  10  when  she  joined  the  cast  of  Nickelodeon  "All  That"  in  1996.

Also,  Dr.  Gupta  will  be  answering  your  questions  on  Reddit  at  noon  ET  Friday.(CNN)  --  It's  been  eight  months  since  I  last  wrote  about  medical  marijuana,  apologizing  for  having  not  dug  deeply  into  the  beneficial  effects  of  this  plant  and  for  writing  articles  dismissing  its  potential.  I  apologized  for  my  own  role  in  previously  misleading  people,  and  I  feel  very  badly  that  people  have  suffered  for  too  long,  unable  to  obtain  the  legitimate  medicine  that  may  have  helped  them.I  have  been  reminded  that  a  true  and  productive  scientific  journey  involves  a  willingness  to  let  go  of  established  notions  and  get  at  the  truth,  even  if  it  is  uncomfortable  and  even  it  means  having  to  say  "sorry."It  is  not  easy  to  apologize  and  take  your  lumps,  but  this  was  never  about  me.This  scientific  journey  is  about  a  growing  number  of  patients  who  want  the  cannabis  plant  as  a  genuine  medicine,  not  to  get  high.It  is  about  emerging  science  that  not  only  shows  and  proves  what  marijuana  can  do  for  the  body  but  provides  better  insights  into  the  mechanisms  of  marijuana  in  the  brain,  helping  us  better  understand  a  plant  whose  benefits  have  been  documented  for  thousands  of  years.  This  journey  is  also  about  a  Draconian  system  where  politics  override  science  and  patients  are  caught  in  the  middle.Since  our  documentary  "Weed"  aired  in  August,  I  have  continued  to  travel  the  world,  investigating  and  asking  tough  questions  about  marijuana.I  have  met  with  hundreds  of  patients,  dozens  of  scientists  and  the  curious  majority  who  simply  want  a  deeper  understanding  of  this  ancient  plant.  I  have  sat  in  labs  and  personally  analyzed  the  molecules  in  marijuana  that  have  such  potential  but  are  also  a  source  of  intense  controversy.  I  have  seen  those  molecules  turned  into  medicine  that  has  quelled  epilepsy  in  a  child  and  pain  in  a  grown  adult.  I've  seen  it  help  a  woman  at  the  peak  of  her  life  to  overcome  the  ravages  of  multiple  sclerosis.I  am  more  convinced  than  ever  that  it  is  irresponsible  to  not  provide  the  best  care  we  can,  care  that  often  may  involve  marijuana.I  am  not  backing  down  on  medical  marijuana;  I  am  doubling  down.I  should  add  that,  although  I've  taken  some  heat  for  my  reporting  on  marijuana,  it  hasn't  been  as  lonely  a  position  as  I  expected.  Legislators  from  several  states  have  reached  out  to  me,  eager  to  inform  their  own  positions  and  asking  to  show  the  documentary  to  their  fellow  lawmakers.I've  avoided  any  lobbying,  but  of  course  it  is  gratifying  to  know  that  people  with  influence  are  paying  attention  to  the  film.  One  place  where  lawmakers  saw  a  long  clip  was  Georgia,  where  the  state  House  just  passed  a  medical  marijuana  bill  by  a  vote  of  171-4.  Before  the  legislative  session  started,  most  people  didn't  think  this  bill  had  a  chance.More  remarkable,  many  doctors  and  scientists,  worried  about  being  ostracized  for  even  discussing  the  potential  of  marijuana,  called  me  confidentially  to  share  their  own  stories  of  the  drug  and  the  benefit  it  has  provided  to  their  patients.  I  will  honor  my  promise  not  to  name  them,  but  I  hope  this  next  documentary  will  enable  a  more  open  discussion  and  advance  science  in  the  process.Marijuana  is  classified  as  a  Schedule  I  substance,  defined  as  "the  most  dangerous"  drugs  "with  no  currently  accepted  medical  use."Neither  of  those  statements  has  ever  been  factual.  Even  many  of  the  most  ardent  critics  of  medical  marijuana  don't  agree  with  the  Schedule  I  classification,  knowing  how  it's  impeded  the  ability  to  conduct  needed  research  on  the  plant.Even  the  head  of  the  National  Institute  on  Drug  Abuse,  Dr.  Nora  Volkow,  seems  to  have  softened  her  stance;  she  told  me  she  believes  we  need  to  loosen  restrictions  for  researchers.Along  the  way,  the  public  has  become  intensely  engaged.  Our  collective  society  has  paid  closer  attention  to  this  issue  than  ever  before,  and  with  that  increased  education,  support  for  medical  marijuana  has  only  grown,  including  in  some  unexpected  places.Pete  Carroll,  the  coach  of  the  Super  Bowl-winning  Seattle  Seahawks,  said  the  National  Football  League  should  explore  medical  marijuana  if  it  helps  players.  NFL  Commissioner  Roger  Goodell  hasn't  dismissed  the  idea,  saying  that  if  marijuana  is  reconsidered  by  the  medical  establishment,  the  league  would  treat  it  the  same  as  any  other  medicine.  Goodell  also  says  the  NFL  is  following  the  science  that  suggests  marijuana  may  help  recovery  from  concussions.Recently,  I  had  the  chance  to  tell  him  that  the  United  States  already  holds  a  patent  on  medical  marijuana  for  that  very  purpose.  Patent  No.  6630507:  Cannabinoids  are  found  to  have  particular  application  as  neuroprotectants,  for  example  in  limiting  neurological  damage  following  ischemic  insults,  such  as  stroke  or  trauma.However,  this  particular  issue  still  bothers  me:  How  can  the  government  deny  the  benefits  of  medical  marijuana  even  as  it  holds  a  patent  for  those  very  same  benefits?  Members  of  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration  declined  my  repeated  requests  for  an  interview.This  past  year,  President  Barack  Obama  told  the  New  Yorker  magazine,  "I  don't  think  (marijuana)  is  more  dangerous  than  alcohol."  And  yet,  as  alcohol  remains  available  to  any  adult,  the  president  has  not  moved  to  remove  marijuana  from  the  list  of  the  most  tightly  controlled  substances  in  the  country.Since  I  started  my  reporting  on  this  topic,  I  have  mostly  resisted  temptation  to  inject  a  subjective  moral  equivalency  into  this  discussion,  such  as  pitting  alcohol  against  marijuana  or  reminding  you  that  cocaine  and  methamphetamine  are  actually  more  available  than  marijuana  to  patients,  physicians  and  medical  researchers:  They  are  Schedule  II  drugs,  with  recognized  medical  uses.  Or  telling  you  that  on  average,  a  person  dies  every  19  minutes  in  this  country  from  a  legal  prescription  drug  overdose,  while  it  is  virtually  unheard-of  to  die  from  a  marijuana  overdose.But,  with  a  discussion  like  this,  consistency  does  matter.  Terms  matter,  too.We  are  talking  about  a  medicine,  known  scientifically  as  cannabis.  In  order  for  people  to  start  thinking  of  this  substance  as  a  medicine,  perhaps  we  should  start  calling  it  by  its  medical  name,  something  that  was  suggested  to  me  by  medical  marijuana  advocates  pretty  much  everywhere  I  went  this  year.I've  tried  to  pull  together  these  latest  developments  in  our  new  documentary,  "Cannabis  Madness."  Although  the  1936  film  "Reefer  Madness"  was  propaganda  made  to  advance  an  agenda  with  dramatic  falsehoods  and  hyperbole,  I  hope  you  will  find  "Cannabis  Madness"  an  accurate  reflection  of  what  is  happening  today,  injected  with  the  best  current  science.You  will  meet  families  all  across  the  country  --  a  stay-at-home  mom  from  Ohio,  a  nurse  practitioner  from  Florida,  an  insurance  salesman  from  Alabama  --  more  than  100  families  who  have  all  left  jobs,  homes,  friends  and  family  behind  and  moved  to  Colorado  to  get  the  medicine  that  relieves  their  suffering.As  things  stand  now,  many  of  these  good  people  don't  ever  get  to  return  home.  Why?  Because  transporting  their  medicine,  even  if  it  is  a  non-psychoactive  cannabis  oil,  could  get  them  arrested  for  drug  trafficking.  And  so  they  are  stuck,  cannabis  refugees.You  will  meet  them,  and  if  you're  like  me,  you'll  be  heartbroken  to  hear  their  stories,  but  you'll  also  have  a  lump  in  your  throat  when  you  see  the  raw,  true  love  these  parents  have  for  their  sick  children.History  books  may  one  day  draw  a  parallel  between  this  chapter  of  medical  marijuana  and  the  story  of  David  and  Goliath.  Playing  the  role  of  David's  slingshot,  which  ultimately  brought  Goliath  to  his  knees,  would  be  a  2-year-old  girl  named  Vivian  Wilson.  She  inspired  her  father  to  challenge  the  system  in  a  spectacular  way  that  caused  a  nation  to  stop  for  a  moment  and  take  note.For  months,  we  have  filmed  and  followed  the  Wilson  family  with  all  of  their  trials  and  tribulations,  and  you  will  meet  the  whole  family  in  the  upcoming  documentary.I  am  a  father  myself,  first  and  foremost.  I  don't  want  my  children  taking  or  being  offered  a  psychoactive  substance.  As  a  neurosurgeon,  I  know  that  the  developing  brain  is  more  susceptible  to  the  most  harmful  effects  of  cannabis  and  that  brain  development  continues  well  into  our  mid-20s.I  also  worry  that  generations  from  now,  my  great-grandkids  will  find  Internet  headlines  referring  to  me  as  the  "pot  doc."  I  do  hope  they  will  also  read  the  rest  of  the  story  and  understand  the  lives  of  the  countless  people  who  have  suffered  needlessly  when  a  plant  could  have  helped.  I  hope  they  know  that  I  have  dedicated  my  time  to  researching  the  medical  literature,  speaking  to  the  scientists  in  person  and  piecing  together  a  fact-based  presentation  meant  to  educate,  not  frighten.I  hope  future  generations  won't  consider  me  naive.  Yes,  I  know  there  is  a  concern  that  many  people  out  there  will  feign  ailments  just  to  get  marijuana.  But  withholding  legitimate  treatment  for  the  needy  is  a  very  unjust  way  of  addressing  that  concern.As  a  physician  and  reporter,  I  feel  a  deeper  obligation  to  present  the  real  stories,  soundly  supported  with  the  science  from  all  over  the  world.When  I  first  apologized  for  my  previous  marijuana  reporting,  I  was  thinking  about  the  impact  that  reporting  may  have  had  on  Charlotte  Figi.  She  is  a  sweet  little  girl  whose  brain  was  locked  in  nearly  nonstop  seizure  activity.  Without  success,  she  tried  seven  different  medications,  stringent  diets  and  high-dose  supplements.  Modern  medicine  had  nothing  more  to  offer,  which  is  why  her  parents  turned  to  an  ancient  plant.  As  you  know,  it  worked.And,  as  you  will  see,  she  is  one  of  so  many  patients  out  there,  suffering  from  different  ailments,  who  believe  cannabis  rescued  them  when  nothing  else  did.For  conditions  like  Charlotte's,  the  American  Epilepsy  Society  says  that  there  are  a  million  people  for  whom  existing  therapies  do  not  control  their  seizures.  The  society  recently  said  anecdotes  about  medical  marijuana  "give  reason  for  hope"  and  said  it  supports  "well-controlled  studies  that  will  lead  to  a  better  understanding  of  the  disease  and  the  development  of  safe  and  effective  treatments."You  should  know  that  Charlotte  continues  to  do  well.  When  I  saw  her  around  the  holidays,  she  ran  over  and  gave  me  a  hug.  She  looked  me  in  the  eyes,  took  me  by  the  hand  and  led  me  all  around  to  meet  her  friends.  She  is  a  delightful,  happy  and  now  healthy  little  girl.I  know  the  discussion  around  this  topic  will  no  doubt  get  heated.  I  have  felt  that  heat.

Send  your  photos  and  video  of  ice,  storms  and  snow  to  iReport.(CNN)  --  The  Northeast  is  bracing  for  an  onslaught  of  fast-falling  snow,  whipping  winds  and  bitter  cold,  all  starting  with  a  full-blown  nor'easter  that  bore  down  on  the  region  Thursday  evening.The  nor'easter,  forming  off  the  East  Coast  of  the  United  States,  prompted  blizzard  warnings  from  Thursday  into  Friday  for  New  York's  Long  Island,  Cape  Cod,  Massachusetts'  South  and  North  Shores,  plus  some  communities  along  Maine's  coast.  Boston,  for  example,  was  already  getting  buried  by  snow  late  Thursday  afternoon."Mother  Nature  has  come  to  wish  us  happy  new  year,"  New  York  Gov.  Andrew  Cuomo  said.About  one-third  of  the  nation,  approximately  100  million  people  in  22  states,  is  in  the  path  of  the  storm,  which  is  expected  to  be  at  its  fiercest  between  8  p.m.  Thursday  and  10  a.m.  Friday,  according  to  CNN  meteorologist  Dave  Hennen.A  nor'easter,  according  to  the  National  Weather  Service,  is  "a  cyclonic  storm  that  moves  along  the  East  Coast  of  North  America.  It's  called  'nor'easter'  because  the  winds  over  coastal  areas  blow  from  a  northeasterly  direction."The  complicated  storm  system  "will  raise  havoc"  this  week,  dumping  a  foot  of  snow  and  spreading  subzero  wind  chills  across  parts  of  the  region,  the  National  Weather  Service  warned."Falling  and  blowing  snow  with  strong  winds  and  poor  visibilities  are  likely,"  the  Weather  Service  said.  "This  will  lead  to  whiteout  conditions  making  travel  extremely  dangerous.  Do  not  travel."Across  the  country,  the  nasty  weather  has  snarled  travel  plans  for  many.  More  than  2,000  U.S.  flights  had  been  canceled  as  of  6  p.m.  Thursday,  reported  FlightAware.com,  which  tracks  cancellations  due  to  weather  and  mechanical  problems.The  most  affected  airport  is  Chicago's  O'Hare,  with  more  than  650  cancellations  in  and  out  and  about  the  same  number  of  delays.  Newark's  Liberty  International  Airport,  New  York's  LaGuardia  and  Cleveland's  Hopkins  also  are  among  the  most  affected.Many  airlines  are  allowing  passengers  to  make  fee-free  itinerary  changes  for  destinations  expected  to  be  affected  by  winter  storms.  Delta,  American,  US  Airways,  United,  Southwest/AirTran  and  JetBlue  have  all  posted  weather  advisories  on  their  websites.Here's  a  breakdown  of  what  to  expect  where:New  York  and  Long  IslandAs  of  Thursday  afternoon,  New  York  City  was  under  a  winter  storm  warning,  as  were  many  other  densely  populated  areas  in  seven  other  states.The  city  of  8  million  people  could  get  9  inches  of  snow,  subzero  wind  chills  and  turbulent  winds,  forecasters  said.New  York  City  is  expecting  to  see  6  to  12  inches  of  snow  overnight,  with  more  possible  on  Long  Island,  where  Nassau  and  Suffolk  counties  will  be  under  a  blizzard  warning  from  6  p.m.  Thursday  until  1  p.m.  Friday,  with  predictions  of  8  to  10  inches  of  snow,  wind  chills  as  low  as  10  below  zero  and  sustained  winds  of  at  least  35  mph.Bitter  cold  will  follow,  with  temperatures  in  the  single  digits  by  Saturday  morning.Upstate,  the  capital  city  of  Albany  could  get  buried  under  14  inches  of  snow,  with  wind  chills  of  15  to  25  below  zero,  the  National  Weather  Service  said.Cuomo  declared  a  state  of  emergency  for  all  of  New  York  shortly  after  3:45  p.m.  Thursday,  one  of  several  steps  taken  to  try  to  minimize  the  wild  wintry  weather's  toll.Among  them  is  shutting  down  parts  of  Interstate  84,  an  east-west  highway  that  goes  from  Connecticut  to  Pennsylvania,  to  commercial  vehicles  late  Thursday  afternoon,  with  nearby  I-87  south  of  Albany  closing  at  midnight.That's  the  same  time  the  Long  Island  Expressway  --  in  a  different  part  of  the  state  --  will  close  to  traffic  at  the  border  between  Nassau  County  and  the  Queens  borough  of  New  York.  The  hope  is  to  reopen  all  these  roads  around  5  a.m.,  though  that  timing  is  very  much  subject  to  change."We'll  make  sure  no  one  is  in  a  state  of  danger  on  those  roads,"  said  Cuomo.MassachusettsBy  Friday  night,  Boston  is  expected  to  be  covered  by  10  to  18  inches  of  snow,  about  twice  the  amount  forecast  just  one  day  ago,  and  shivering  in  temperatures  as  low  as  6  degrees  below  zero.Citing  likely  "near  blizzard"  conditions  Thursday  night  into  late  Friday  morning,  the  state's  emergency  management  agency  warned  that  1  to  2  feet  of  fluffy,  drifting  snow  could  accumulate  in  places  and  that  there  could  be  moderate  coastal  flooding.The  forecast  was  so  bad  for  Boston  that  the  city  canceled  school  for  Friday  two  days  in  advance."I  guess  Mother  Nature  wanted  to  give  me  one  more  gift,"  Mayor  Thomas  Menino  told  reporters  Thursday  in  one  of  his  last  days  in  the  job  he  has  held  since  1993."Take  precautions  and  take  public  transportation  and  take  care  of  one  another,"  he  urged.  But,  he  added,  the  city  was  doing  its  part,  with  700  pieces  of  equipment  on  city  streets.  "Our  team  is  ready,"  he  said.The  combination  of  extreme  cold,  snow  and  strong  winds  had  officials  at  homeless  shelters  preparing."Our  main  emphasis  is  getting  people  inside,  where  it  is  safer  and  warmer,"  said  Jennifer  Harris,  a  spokeswoman  for  the  Pine  Street  Inn  shelter  system  in  Boston,  where  a  snow  emergency  has  been  declared.  "Pine  Street  Inn  is  making  sure  to  have  extra  staff  and  food  and  water.  We  are  geared  up  to  provide  to  a  greater  number  of  people."Blizzard  warnings  haven't  been  issued  for  Boston  itself,  but  are  in  effect  for  parts  of  nearby  Essex  and  Plymouth  counties  --  including  the  cities  of  Gloucester  and  Brockton  --  as  well  as  all  of  Cape  Cod.ConnecticutWind  chills  in  parts  of  Connecticut  are  expected  to  range  from  -5  to  -20  degrees  Thursday  night  and  Friday;  the  National  Weather  Service  issued  winter  storm  warnings  for  most  of  the  state  through  Friday  morning.Connecticut  Gov.  Dannel  P.  Malloy  urged  residents  to  take  it  slow  and  give  themselves  extra  time  for  their  commutes  Thursday  and  Friday.  He  said  he  expects  there  will  be  delays,  but  not  cancellations,  in  public  transit.Addressing  reporters,  Malloy  said  the  worst  time  for  the  state  would  be  overnight  --  between  10  p.m.  and  2  a.m.,  when  there  could  be  blizzard  conditions.  Still,  the  storm's  impact  could  linger  well  beyond  that  if  roads  are  blocked  or  the  electricity  goes  out.He  acknowledged  that  this  kind  of  weather  is  hardly  unprecedented  in  Connecticut  this  time  of  year.  It's  also  not  likely  there  will  be  a  repeat  of  the  nor'easter  last  February  that  dumped  40  inches  of  snow  on  parts  of  the  state.Still,  the  governor  added,  what  sets  this  system  apart  is  the  frigid  temperatures  forecast  for  the  coming  days."(This)  is  not  a  big  New  England  storm,  but  it  is  a  particularly  cold  New  England  storm,"  Malloy  said.Chicago  and  points  beyondSeven  to  11  inches  of  snow  were  possible  Thursday  in  Chicago,  according  to  the  National  Weather  Service.  Windy  City  residents  will  feel  frigid  temps  --  wind  chills  during  the  day  Friday  will  creep  down  to  minus  12  --  and  emergency  director  Gary  Schenkel  said  more  snow  is  possible  later  in  the  week.Though  snow  in  Chicago  in  the  winter  is  a  common  event,  it  "can  still  wreak  havoc  on  daily  routines,"  he  noted.Next  week  could  be  no  better  for  some  U.S.  residents.A  new  shot  of  colder  air  will  start  to  move  into  the  northern  Midwest  by  Saturday  and  will  dive  south  Monday  and  Tuesday,  carrying  zero-degree  cold  as  far  south  as  Nashville.  "That's  the  coldest  air  we've  seen  that  far  south  in  several  years,"  said  Hennen,  the  CNN  meteorologist.The  cold  air  will  kick  off  a  new  storm  Sunday  into  Monday  that  could  affect  a  number  of  high-profile  NFL  playoff  games  this  weekend.In  Wisconsin,  the  Green  Bay  Packers  will  give  a  cold  welcome  to  the  San  Francisco  49ers  on  Sunday,  when  temperatures  could  bottom  out  at  -17.But  it  will  be  relatively  balmy  Sunday  in  Cincinnati,  where  snow  and  rain  are  possible  when  the  city's  Bengals  host  the  San  Diego  Chargers  in  another  NFL  playoff  matchup.Of  course,  while  the  players  might  not  have  a  choice,  fans  don't  have  to  brave  the  cold  for  either  game.  The  big  worries  are  for  those  who  travel  in  the  coming  days.  Authorities  in  New  York,  for  example,  said  they  may  shut  the  Long  Island  Expressway  if  whiteout  conditions  make  driving  along  the  east-west  highway  too  perilous.Kevin  Willims  isn't  taking  any  chances,  nor  is  he  predicting  a  world-ending  storm.  The  New  Yorker  said  he  plans  to  sit  tight  and  let  Mother  Nature  do  her  thing."There's  not  much  you  can  do,"  Willims  said.  "When  it's  snowing  and  these  streets  lock  up,  there's  really  nowhere  you  can  go,  so  it's  best  to  just  stay  in."CNN's  Carma  Hassan,  Marnie  Hunter,  Joe  Sutton,  Holly  Yan,  Lorenzo  Ferrigno,  Chris  Boyette  and  Dave  Alsup  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

If  you  do  a  lot  of  extra  cleaning?  Is  this  a  deal-breaker  for  the  relationship?When  you  completely  adore  a  pet  and  the  person  who's  attached  to  it,  you  might  willingly  suffer  a  stuffed  nose.  Or  you  both  might  cycle  through  many  kinds  of  pets  until  you  find  one  that  lets  you  breathe.The  search  for  a  healthy  petBethany  and  Ronald  Johansen  of  Merchantville,  New  Jersey,  married  for  14  years,  know  this  well.Both  love  dogs  and  each  grew  up  with  a  canine  companion  --  but  Ronald's  landed  him  in  the  hospital.  His  childhood  asthmatic  reactions  were  so  bad  that  he  once  spent  two  months  in  an  oxygen  tent,  he  said.  The  family  didn't  realize  until  later  that  his  symptoms  stemmed  from  their  Irish  setter,  Kelly.Bethany  Johansen  gave  up  her  own  dog  of  13  years  for  the  sake  of  her  husband's  health  when  they  married  --  a  sacrifice  upsetting  to  both  of  them  (although  the  dog  stayed  with  her  parents  and  Bethany  visited  her  every  day  during  work  lunch  breaks).  The  couple  lived  without  pets  for  several  years,  but  both  wanted  to  expand  the  family  with  animals."It's  been  a  journey  with  pets  in  this  house,  trying  to  find  one  that  I  can  actually  live  with  without  it  closing  my  throat,"  Ronald  Johansen,  32,  said.There  were  bunnies,  hamsters  and  guinea  pigs  --  all  no-goes  for  Ronald.  A  hedgehog  left  sharp  2-inch  quills  around  the  house  that  would  stick  to  the  children's  feet.There  were  dogs  galore,  such  as  a  Shih  Tzu  and  a  poodle,  said  to  be  "hypoallergenic"  because  they  don't  shed  as  much  as  other  canines.  But  different  people  are  allergic  to  different  dog  proteins  and,  according  to  ACAAI,  it  doesn't  seem  that  any  particular  breed  is  generally  best  for  allergic  people.Ronald  Johansen  hasn't  done  well  with  any  of  them.  Sometimes  his  throat  itches  within  minutes  of  being  around  a  dog."It  has  been  frustrating,"  his  wife,  33,  said.  "He  sees  that  it's  something  that's  important  to  me.  It's  important  to  him."Read  her  iReport:  Pet  lover  marries  bubble  boyGiving  up  the  large  poodle  named  Javier  was  particularly  rough  on  the  couple's  son  Isaac,  who  would  sit  next  to  the  dog  in  the  backseat  of  the  car  and  go  to  baseball  games  with  him.  But  the  boy  also  suffers  asthma  and  had  allergy  symptoms  around  the  dog,  which  he  tried  to  hide  from  the  family."When  he  sneezes  it's  like  eight  times  in  a  row,  and  I'm  thinking,  'This  isn't  going  to  work  out,'  "  Bethany  Johansen  said.The  family  has  found  homes  for  other  pets  that  haven't  worked  out.What  allergists  recommendAllergists  such  as  Dr.  Clifford  Bassett,  director  of  Allergy  &  Asthma  Care  of  New  York  and  ACAAI  fellow,  understand  the  plight  of  the  allergic  pet-lover.There  are  several  lifestyle  modifications  that  can  provide  some  relief,  he  said.  Bassett  recommends  getting  a  HEPA  (high-efficiency  particulate  absorption)  air  filter,  which  can  suck  up  irritating  particles  from  dogs  and  cats,  as  well  as  a  HEPA-type  vacuum  cleaner.Carpeting  collects  pet  dander,  so  linoleum,  wood,  tile  are  preferred  on  floors.  Otherwise,  frequent  vacuuming,  dusting  and  other  cleaning  can  help  make  a  room  more  allergy-friendly.Designating  the  bedroom  as  pet-free  can  also  help,  Bassett  said.  Of  course,  that  can  be  difficult  for  those  of  us  who  like  to  cuddle  with  our  furry  friends.To  treat  symptoms,  a  doctor  may  prescribe  antihistamines,  prescription  nasal  sprays  and  eye  drops,  as  well  as  inhalers  for  asthma.  Depending  on  the  person  and  the  circumstances,  managing  oneself  this  way  may  be  enough.A  longer-term  solution  is  allergy  shots,  which  can  be  effective  in  building  up  a  tolerance  to  pets.  They  are  particularly  helpful  when  avoidance  and  medications  are  not  successful,  Bassett  said.  But  the  shots  are  an  investment  --  you  need  to  get  them  for  at  least  three  years,  although  improvement  shows  after  about  six  months  of  weekly  injections,  according  to  ACAAI.Ronald  Johansen  took  allergy  shots  just  to  be  able  to  have  cats  around,  but  said  his  dog  allergy  is  so  bad  that  he  couldn't  tolerate  that  therapy.How  well  people  respond  to  this  immunotherapy  depends  on  how  sensitive  the  person  was  initially,  and  how  well  they're  able  to  avoid  environmental  triggers,  ACAAI  said."I  like  to  tell  people,  we'll  do  the  shots  if  avoidance  is  not  appropriate  or  avoidance  is  not  possible,"  Bassett  said.Some  people  with  allergies  and  asthma  have  such  bad  reactions  that  they  should  really  avoid  the  offending  animal  altogether,  experts  say,  particularly  children  who  have  severe  asthma  attacks.The  Johansens  are  still  exploring  the  animal  kingdom,  but  for  now  they  have  a  combination  that's  healthy  for  everyone.  Their  current  cast  of  characters:  Two  cats,  a  chinchilla  and  a  parrot,  in  addition  to  four  human  children.Coping  with  catsJordon  Goulder,  24,  of  Oakland,  California,  can  also  relate.When  she  met  her  boyfriend  Etai  Rahmil,  he  had  a  cat,  Dilla.  She  thought  she  would  be  too  sick  if  she  spent  a  lot  of  time  at  his  house,  and  wasn't  sure  the  relationship  would  work  out  because  of  her  cat  allergy.Fast  forward  four-and-a-half  years:  The  couple  lives  in  a  small  apartment  in  northern  California  with  not  just  one,  but  two  short-haired  tabby  cats.Rahmil  helps  out  by  handling  the  litter  box  and  taking  care  of  a  lot  of  the  dusting  and  vacuuming  that  would  be  hard  on  Goulder.  She  feels  better  now  that  the  couple  lives  together  and  without  roommates.Goulder's  symptoms  --  including  wheezing,  itchy  skin,  runny  eyes  and  sneezing  --  depend  on  how  much  she  plays  with  the  cats  and  whether  she  lets  them  sleep  on  her  pillow  or  under  the  blankets  with  her,  which  she  often  does.Goulder  takes  two  different  allergy  medicines  in  addition  to  two  inhalers.  Doctors  usually  tell  her  to  give  up  the  cats,  but  some  are  sympathetic  to  her  love  of  animals."I  would  never  recommend  this  lifestyle  to  another  person,  but  I  love  my  cats  and  I  wouldn't  change  my  life  for  anything!"  she  wrote  in  her  iReport.Asthma,  allergies,  two  cats  and  a  small  apartmentGoulder  also  has  asthma,  which  can  be  aggravated  by  colds  and  other  environmental  factors,  but  cats  make  it  worse.  Twice  during  the  course  of  their  relationship  she  has  woken  up  in  the  middle  of  the  night  with  an  asthma  attack,  and  had  to  go  to  the  emergency  room.Rahmil  often  questions  the  situation  --  but  Goulder  has  been  firm."It's  kind  of  confusing  for  both  of  us.  He  approaches  me  in  a  worried  way,  like,  'Is  this  the  right  option  for  us?'  "  Goulder  said.  "I'm  pretty  stubborn.  I'm  always  going  to  say,  'Yes,  we're  keeping  them.'  "Holding  out  for  a  dogAs  for  the  Johansens,  they  are  considering  adding  a  pig  to  their  mix,  but  they  haven't  given  up  hope  of  owning  a  dog  again.  They  don't  want  to  make  any  promises  to  their  children  that  they  can't  keep,  but  they  are  planning  to  visit  another  breeder  so  Ronald  can  test  out  his  symptoms  around  another  dog."A  dog  is  part  of  the  family,"  he  said.  "It's  something  I'm  just  used  to  having  and  my  wife  is  used  to  having.  I  guess  that's  why  we  try  so  hard  to  get  a  dog.  It's  part  of  us."More  iReport  stories  about  pet  allergiesFollow  Elizabeth  Landau  on  Twitter  at  @lizlandauCNN's  Daphne  Sashin  and  Margaret  Blaha  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Elliot  himself  remained  missing,  however.Prison  authorities  discovered  Elliot  missing  about  9:30  p.m.  Sunday.  He  apparently  pulled  back  the  bottoms  of  two  fences  and  crawled  underneath  to  escape,  Michigan  Department  of  Corrections  spokesman  Russell  L.  Marlan  said  Monday.He  was  serving  five  life  sentences  on  a  1994  conviction  for  killing  four  people,  according  to  Michigan  Department  of  Corrections  records.  Authorities  warned  the  public  not  to  mess  with  him."We  would  advise  anyone  who  sees  the  vehicle  or  they  see  Mr.  Elliot  to  not  take  matters  into  their  own  hands,"  Michigan  State  Police  Lt.  Troy  Allen  said  Monday.The  woman,  whose  name  has  not  been  released  by  authorities,  told  a  911  dispatcher  from  her  bathroom  stronghold  that  Elliot  forced  his  way  into  her  red  Jeep  Liberty  as  she  sat  parked  on  West  Main  Street  in  Ionia.He  was  an  escaped  convict,  he  told  her.  Murder,  she  said.  And  he  had  a  box  cutter  and  a  hammer.But,  she  said,  he  hadn't  hurt  her."He  just  wants  to  get  someplace  far  from  Ionia,"  she  told  the  dispatcher.Unfortunately  for  police,  by  the  time  they  arrived  at  the  Marathon  gas  station,  Elliot  had  fled  in  the  woman's  Jeep.He  was  last  seen  getting  on  Interstate  80/90,  but  authorities  don't  know  which  direction  he  was  traveling  or  where  he  was  heading.The  interstate  connects  Elkhart  with  Chicago  to  the  west  and  Toledo,  Ohio,  to  the  east.Elliot  was  known  as  a  good  prisoner,  according  to  Corrections  Director  Daniel  Heyens."Nothing  in  this  man's  history  would  have  indicated  a  high  risk  of  escape,"  Heyens  said.  "He  was  serving  his  time."Prison  authorities  believe  he  acted  alone,  Heyens  said.According  to  court  documents,  Elliot  was  convicted  in  the  August  1993  murders  of  Vickie  Currie;  her  boyfriend,  Michael  Tufnell;  his  brother  Bruce  Tufnell;  and  Kathy  Lane,  CNN  affiliate  WXMI  reported.Elliot  and  three  others  hatched  a  plan  to  steal  drug  money,  WXMI  said,  and  after  they  didn't  find  the  money,  Elliot  and  another  man  killed  the  four  victims  and  set  Michael  Tufnell's  house  on  fire.CNN's  George  Howell,  Rick  Martin,  Holly  Yan  and  Chuck  Johnston  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

But  why?  Is  it  post-holiday  stress,  a  new  year's  resolution  or  as  practical  as  making  taxes  simpler?</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  There  was  that  distant-feeling  New  Year's  kiss  at  midnight.  Valentine's  Day,  a  holiday  based  on  setting  hearts  aflutter,  was  full  of  awkward  pauses  and  glances  over  soufflé  at  the  person  you  used  to  love.  Come  March,  it's  time  to  turn  over  a  new  leaf.In  recent  years,  January  has  earned  the  nickname  "Divorce  Month"  --  a  less  appealing  title  than  National  Pet  Month  (May)  or  National  Honey  Month  (September),  though  divorce  can  surely  be  both  hairy  and  sticky.While  marital  psychologists  and  divorce  lawyers  say  January's  more  accurate  description  would  be  "I'm  Starting  to  Research  My  Options  Month,"  they  agree  there  is  some  accuracy  in  the  nomenclature.FindLaw.com's  analysis  of  American  divorce  filings  between  2008  and  2011,  with  legal  research  service  Westlaw,  revealed  a  spike  in  divorces  in  January,  followed  by  a  rise  and  peak  in  late  March.The  site's  analysis  also  showed  searches  for  "divorce"  and  related  phrases  like  "family  law"  and  "child  custody"  jumped  50%  from  December  to  January,  and  continued  to  swell  through  March.So,  what  exactly  happens  in  those  first  three  months  of  the  year  that  makes  seemingly  happily  wed  couples  join  the  estimated  40%  of  first  marriages  that  end  in  divorce  in  the  United  States?"People  don't  want  to  be  accused  by  friends,  family  that  they  were  heartless  right  before  Christmas,"  says  Miles  Mason,  a  Memphis-based  family  and  divorce  lawyer."If  somebody  is  coming  to  us  in  January,  they  made  the  decision  to  come  see  me  or  a  lawyer  before  the  holidays."For  some,  it's  all  about  the  Benjamins.  The  end  of  the  year  means  bonus  season,  a  portion  of  which  can  be  claimed  as  an  asset  from  a  spouse.  Holding  off  until  January  will  also  not  interfere  with  tax  filings  for  the  previous  year,  which  most  couples  file  jointly.Mason  says  many  are  on  the  fence  when  they  begin  preliminary  conversations  with  a  lawyer.  They  want  to  know  the  basics:  what  it's  going  to  cost,  how  much  it  will  affect  daily  life  and  other  practical  concerns.He  says  people,  especially  heavy  planners,  want  to  have  a  holistic  strategy  in  order  to  make  smart  legal  and  personal  decisions.  That's  often  why  a  client  will  begin  the  conversation  in  January  and  wait  until  March  to  actually  file."Divorce  is  counterintuitive,"  he  says.Mark  Banschick,  psychiatrist  and  author  of  "The  Intelligent  Divorce"  series  of  books,  calls  the  start  of  a  new  year  an  "existential  moment"  in  that  people  look  at  their  lives,  realize  they  go  by  too  quickly  and  that  their  current  version  is  not  happy."They  call  attorneys  out  of  pain,"  he  says.Banschick  says  just  wanting  a  change  isn't  a  good  enough  reason;  it's  easy  to  displace  all  the  burden  of  your  unhappiness  on  the  spouse."There's  nobody  that  can  hurt  you  like  the  person  you  love,"  he  says.  "Because  love  is  an  opportunity  to  feel  validated.  But  that  vulnerability  that  allows  somebody  to  acknowledge  you  is  the  same  vulnerability  that  allows  you  to  feel  devastated."The  best  time  for  divorce,  according  to  him,  is  when  you're  feeling  centered  about  who  you  are  and  what  you  need.Susan  Pease  Gadoua  is  the  author  of  "Contemplating  Divorce,  A  Step-by-Step  Guide  to  Deciding  Whether  to  Stay  or  Go"  and  a  licensed  therapist.  She,  like  Banschick  and  Mason,  also  experiences  an  uptick  in  phone  calls  near  the  first  of  the  year  after  folks  white-knuckle  it  through  the  holidays."The  problem  with  divorce  is  that  there's  never  a  good  time,"  she  says.But  all  three  experts,  in  separate  phone  interviews,  referenced  another  unlikely  month  for  the  same  phenomenon:  September.Banschick  says  it's  because  summertime  is  wedding  and  vacation  season;  the  kids  are  home  from  school  and  "it's  not  a  time  to  make  troubles."The  shared  root  of  their  conclusion:  This  particular  season  of  togetherness  is  over,  now  it's  back  to  real  life.Have  you  been  through  a  divorce?  Did  the  time  of  year  factor  in?  Let  us  know  in  the  comments  below.</TEXT></DOC>

Here  are  a  few  things  we  learned:1.  Make  way  for  older  women.It's  not  for  nothing  that  one  of  best  jokes  from  Tina  Fey  and  Amy  Poehler  at  the  Golden  Globes  referred  to  the  lack  of  meaty  roles  for  actresses  of  a  certain  age:  "Meryl  Streep  (is)  so  brilliant  in  'August:  Osage  County,'  proving  that  there  are  still  great  parts  in  Hollywood  for  Meryl  Streeps  over  60,"  said  Fey.  And  yes,  Streep  was  nominated  for  an  Oscar  (for  best  actress)  as  well.But  also  nominated  were  Judi  Dench,  79,  and  perhaps  more  surprisingly,  June  Squibb,  84.  Squibb  is  a  longtime  character  actress  --  you  may  remember  her  as  Elderly  Woman  in  "Far  From  Heaven"  or  Mrs.  Cone  in  an  episode  of  "Curb  Your  Enthusiasm"  --  who  got  a  chance  to  shine  as  Bruce  Dern's  exasperated  yet  caring  wife  in  "Nebraska."  In  fact,  of  the  10  actresses  nominated  for  either  best  actress  or  best  supporting  actress,  six  are  over  40  and  two  others  --  Amy  Adams  and  Sally  Hawkins  --  are  in  their  late  30s.Think  you  can  pick  the  winners?  Check  out  the  Oscar  ballot2.  Diversity,  but  no  diversity.This  year  featured  a  number  of  notable  movies  starring  or  directed  by  people  of  color,  including  "Lee  Daniels'  The  Butler,"  "Fruitvale  Station,"  "42,"  "Mandela:  Long  Walk  to  Freedom"  and  "12  Years  a  Slave."  But  of  that  group,  only  "12  Years"  got  any  support  from  the  Oscars,  with  nine  nominations.  "Mandela"  picked  up  a  nod  for  a  U2  song;  "Fruitvale"  --  despite  showcasing  rising  talents  Michael  B.  Jordan  and  director  Ryan  Coogler  --  got  nothing.  And  despite  a  $100  million  box  office  --  and  raves  for  performers  Forest  Whitaker  and  Oprah  Winfrey  --  "The  Butler"  also  came  up  with  zero.  During  the  Globes  show,  there  was  a  Twitter  hashtag  protesting  the  lack  of  diversity:  #notbuyingit.  You'll  probably  see  it  again  on  Oscar  night.2014  awards  season:  Does  diversity  matter  more  than  wins?3.  Where's  Tom  Hanks?  What  about  Oprah?Tom  Hanks  is  one  of  the  most  beloved  film  stars  in  Hollywood.  He's  a  successful  producer  and  two-time  Oscar  winner.  After  a  sluggish  few  years,  marked  by  "Cloud  Atlas,"  "Extremely  Loud  and  Incredibly  Close"  and  "Larry  Crowne,"  he  was  back  in  the  good  graces  at  the  box  office  and  with  critics,  thanks  to  "Captain  Phillips"  and  "Saving  Mr.  Banks."  The  result?  No  Oscar  nominations.  Maybe  he  split  the  vote;  maybe  voters  just  weren't  that  impressed.  (They  certainly  weren't  by  "Mr.  Banks.")As  for  Winfrey  --  also  a  successful  producer  and  personality  --  the  theory  is  that  "The  Butler's"  summer  release  hurt  its  chances.  But  it  was  still  a  surprise  that  her  name  wasn't  listed  for  either  the  Oscars  or  the  Golden  Globes.  Better  luck  at  the  Screen  Actors  Guild  Awards,  Oprah.4.  There  are  no  sure  things.The  handicappers  were  wrong  about  a  lot.  Take  a  gander:•  Snubbed:  Robert  Redford,  "All  Is  Lost."  An  almost  wordless  solo  performance  goes  for  naught  at  the  Oscars.  "Lost,"  indeed.  •  Snubbed:  The  Coen  brothers,  "Inside  Llewyn  Davis."  Despite  their  offbeat  production,  Ethan  and  Joel  have  become  Oscar  favorites  --  even  if  it's  just  a  scriptwriting  nod.  Not  this  year.  Llewyn  Davis  will  have  to  keep  walking  the  streets  (probably  with  a  waterlogged  shoe).  •  Snubbed:  Emma  Thompson,  "Saving  Mr.  Banks."  So  much  for  "Banks"  despite  its  Disney  pedigree.  •  Snubbed:  James  Gandolfini,  "Enough  Said."  The  academy  thought  "Enough"  was  apparently  too  much,  since  neither  Julia  Louis-Dreyfus  nor  Nicole  Holofcener's  script  were  picked,  either.  •  Surprise!:  Sally  Hawkins,  "Blue  Jasmine."  The  academy  loves  Woody  Allen  screenplays  (he  got  nominated,  too),  and  Hawkins  wasn't  overlooked.  •  Surprise!:  "Philomena."  A  small,  character-driven  movie  about  a  woman  searching  for  her  son?  Best  picture,  best  actress  (Dench)  and  best  adapted  screenplay  nominations  are  the  prizes.Special  coverage:  All  things  awards  season5.  Love  for  "Dallas  Buyers  Club."Perhaps  "Hustle,"  "12  Years"  and  "Gravity"  will  duke  it  out  for  best  picture.  But  remember  "no  sure  things,"  because  when  it  came  to  audience  response  at  the  nominations,  "Dallas  Buyers  Club"  was  the  clear  winner,  greeted  with  cheers  for  every  nomination.  It  has  an  Oscar-friendly  subject  --  a  heroic  battle  against  AIDS  --  and  strong  performances  by  Matthew  McConaughey  and  Jared  Leto.  It  received  a  surprising  six  nominations.The  Academy  Awards  are  March  2.Confessions  of  an  Oscar  freak</TEXT></DOC>

They  carry  a  heavy  emotional  burden  --  one  of  grief,  and  of  guilt.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  For  stories  about  survivors  trying  to  overcome  the  trauma  of  large  plane  crashes,  watch  the  CNN  Film  "Sole  Survivor"  on  CNN  TV  Thursday,  January  9  at  9  p.m.  ET(CNN)  --  When  Galaxy  Airlines  Flight  203  with  71  passengers  and  crew  crashed  shortly  after  takeoff  from  Reno,  Nevada,  in  1985,  there  was  only  one  survivor:  George  Lamson  Jr.The  CNN  Films  documentary  "Sole  Survivor,"  features  Lamson  and  others  who've  struggled  after  being  the  only  survivors  of  large  plane  crashes.The  ordeal  often  includes  a  huge  emotional  burden.  In  the  film,  Lamson  reaches  out  to  fellow  sole  survivors,  who  open  up  about  their  complex  feelings  related  to  survivorship."Why  didn't  my  brother  survive?  Why  didn't  anybody,  you  know,  why  me?"  asks  Cecelia  Cichan,  the  sole  survivor  of  a  1987  plane  crash  in  Michigan.These  kinds  of  unanswerable  questions  reflect  our  natural  inclination  to  look  for  meaning  in  experiences,  and  to  have  our  life  stories  make  sense,  said  Dr.  Charles  Raison,  CNN's  mental  health  expert  and  associate  professor  of  psychiatry  at  the  University  of  Arizona.Disasters  that  take  the  lives  of  everyone  involved  except  for  one  may  leave  a  survivor  feeling  guilty  for  receiving  the  gift  of  continued  life  when  no  one  else  did.  They  might  not  believe  they  deserved  it,  Raison  said.The  pain  of  livingSurvivor  guilt  can  be  an  immediate  response  to  a  tragedy,  and  the  extent  of  the  feelings  depends  on  the  individual,  Russell  Jones,  a  psychologist  at  Virginia  Tech  who  helped  counsel  victims  at  the  school  after  a  shooting  rampage  in  2007,  has  said.Being  the  sole  survivor  of  a  tragedy  is  likely  even  more  difficult  than  being  one  of  several,  Raison  said.In  working  with  patients  who  fought  in  the  Vietnam  War,  Raison  observed  that  their  survivor  guilt  was  linked  to  their  perceptions  of  their  own  actions  at  the  time  when  others  died.  They  felt  worse  if  they  regretted  their  actions,  or  didn't  feel  they  had  done  enough  to  help  others."If  they  had  lost  their  nerve  at  a  key  moment,  or  if  they  had  done  something  they  felt  ashamed  of,  it  ate  them  alive  for  the  rest  of  their  lives,"  he  said.He  added,  "If  you  survive  something  while  heroically  trying  to  save  everybody  else,  you're  going  to  have  a  different  feeling  about  it  than  if  you  took  the  last  seat  on  the  lifeboat,  so  to  put  it."What  is  PTSD?Survivor  guilt  can  be  an  expression  of  grief  and  loss,  according  to  Melissa  Brymer,  director  of  terrorism  and  disaster  programs  at  the  UCLA  Neuropsychiatric  Institute  in  Los  Angeles.Sitting  back  and  taking  time  to  process  the  event  can  help  survivors  cope,  Jones  said.  Seeking  support  from  friends,  family  and  community  or  faith  leaders  can  help  an  individual  work  through  difficult  feelings.But  if  there's  lingering  guilt  and  anxiety,  Jones  recommended  consulting  a  mental  health  professional.  A  survivor  may  experience  symptoms  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  and  depression  that  requires  formal  treatment.Classic  PTSD  symptoms  include  intrusive  thoughts,  flashbacks  and  nightmares.  People  may  avoid  anything  that  reminds  them  of  the  event  and  have  difficulty  paying  attention.  It  may  be  paired  with  depression  and  suicidal  feelings.These  symptoms  can  lead  to  full-blown  PTSD  over  time,  especially  if  a  person  has  a  history  of  mental  illness.  Previous  trauma,  stress,  loss  of  financial  stability,  and  grieving  the  loss  of  family  and  friends  are  also  risk  factors,  Jones  said.About  8%  to  15%  of  people  who  experience  trauma  develop  severe  PTSD  symptoms  that  persist  and  require  professional  help,  Jones  said.A  2002  study  in  the  British  Journal  of  Psychiatry  interviewed  survivors  of  the  1988  Piper  Alpha  disaster,  in  which  an  oil  rig  in  the  North  Sea  exploded,  killing  167  people.  More  than  10  years  after  the  event,  seven  out  of  33  people  met  PTSD  criteria."Features  such  as  physical  injury,  personal  experience  and  survivor  guilt  were  associated  with  significantly  higher  levels  of  post-traumatic  symptoms,"  the  study  authors  wrote.With  support,  people  generally  do  well,  Jones  said.When  to  seek  helpFor  some  people,  survivor  guilt  is  just  part  of  working  through  complex  feelings  after  experiencing  a  traumatic  event  involving  deaths  and  a  way  of  mourning.  But  it  may  become  all-consuming  and  impede  functioning."If  they're  having  changes  within  their  behaviors  or  in  their  emotions  or  with  their  relationships  with  others,  then  we  want  to  make  sure  that  people  get  help,"  Brymer  said.Unfortunately,  people  who  need  help  often  don't  seek  it,  Jones  said."So  often,  there's  stigma  attached  to  getting  help  from  a  mental  health  professional,"  Jones  said.  "Therefore,  they  go  without  seeking  treatment,  oftentimes  until  they  reach  a  breaking  point."There  are  several  treatment  strategies  that  have  been  shown  to  help  people  with  survivor  guilt  and  PTSD  symptoms.  There's  no  one-size-fits-all  approach,  Raison  said.One  strategy  involves  exposure,  Jones  said.  Getting  people  to  talk  about  the  event  and  assimilating  the  event  into  everyday  living  are  key,  Jones  said.  Therapists  may  also  take  the  individual  back  to  the  setting  where  the  tragedy  occurred  and  allow  the  person  to  express  his  or  her  thoughts,  feelings  and  emotions.But  this  technique  may  make  some  individuals  with  PTSD  more  traumatized,  Raison  said.  Instead,  he  recommends  that  therapists  try  to  reframe  tragedy  as  an  event  that  can  be  empowering.Finding  meaningSome  people  may  benefit  from  viewing  their  survivorship  as  a  positive  gift,  one  that  has  a  meaning  in  the  context  of  a  life  story,  Raison  said.  This  may  especially  be  helpful  for  people  of  faith,  who  may  believe  there  is  a  divine  purpose  in  their  survival.But  others  may  reject  the  idea  that  they  survived  "for  a  reason,"  Raison  said.  A  cognitive-behavioral  approach  would  help  the  person  examine  his  or  her  own  beliefs  that  underlie  their  haunting  feelings  of  guilt,  and  challenge  irrational  thought  processes,  he  said."If  they're  still  really  suffering  survivor  guilt,  it's  sort  of  helping  them  reframe  it,  where  they  recognize  that  it's  not  their  fault  they  survived,  it's  not  their  blessing  they  survived,  it  just  happened,"  he  said.Secular  survivors  may  also  come  to  view  the  traumatic  experience  as  something  that  gives  them  a  deeper  reason  for  living.One  coping  strategy  is  to  do  something  meaningful  for  someone  else,  Brymer  said.  Organizations  that  help  people  who  have  survived  violence  or  natural  disasters,  or  advocacy  groups,  may  be  good  options  for  people  who  are  trying  to  move  on  from  a  tragedy."If  someone  has  died,  is  there  something  that  you  can  do  that's  meaningful  and  representative  of  that  person?"  she  asked.  "Is  there  something  you  can  do  so  you're  unstuck,  so  you  can  do  something  powerful  and  meaningful  (for)  someone  else?"Ky  Dickens,  director  of  "Sole  Survivor,"  told  CNN  affiliate  KARE  last  year  that  there  is  a  misperception  that  a  survivor  is  lucky,  and  that  he  or  she  is  a  "miracle"  with  a  life  purpose  --  an  attitude  that  puts  undue  pressure  on  them,  she  said.Survivors,  she  said,  are  victims  too.If  you  are  experiencing  suicidal  thoughts,  call  the  National  Suicide  Prevention  Lifeline  at  1-800-273-8255.</TEXT></DOC>

There's  a  photo  of  him  in  his  new  memoir,  "Little  Failure,"  high  on  mushrooms.  Another  photo  shows  him  drunk.  He  was  a  one-man  party.In  one  scene  in  the  book,  he  is  carried  out  of  his  Oberlin  dormitory  because  his  loud  merrymaking  disturbed  his  roommate.  (Or  maybe  he  was  carried  into  his  dormitory.  He  doesn't  remember.)  At  his  Manhattan  high  school,  he  spent  three  years  "drunk  and  stoned."  Or  so  he  claims.But  mostly  he  says  he  struggled  to  fit  in.  Throughout  his  life,  well  before  college  or  high  school,  he  confesses  to  feeling  lonely,  or  angry,  or  anxious.  Rarely  genuinely  happy.Could  this  really  be  Gary  Shteyngart?  The  laugh-out-loud  author  of  "Absurdistan"  and  "Super  Sad  True  Love  Story"?  The  Gary  Shteyngart  who  can  find  absurdist  comedy  in  overseas  revolutions,  economic  collapse  and  small  electric  appliances?  That  Gary  Shteyngart?One  and  the  same,  says  the  author  in  a  phone  interview  from  a  tour  stop  in  Los  Angeles."The  truth  of  the  matter  is  I  was  a  jerk  in  many,  many  ways,"  he  says.'Humor  is  the  armor'Let's  be  clear:  Shteyngart  didn't  rob  a  bank  or  maim  an  old  widow.  He  was  merely  a  bright  kid  who  was  sometimes  out  of  control.Still,  "Little  Failure"  is  an  attempt  to  revisit  his  life  --  that  of  the  Russian  Jewish  immigrant  who  made  his  way  in  the  United  States  --  and  get  at  the  root  of  his  woe.Much  of  it  originated  at  home  with  loving  but  wounding  parents.  Shteyngart  was  born  in  1972  and  spent  the  first  seven  years  of  his  life  in  Leningrad  (now  Saint  Petersburg),  in  an  apartment  with  a  Russian  TV  that  was  always  in  danger  of  exploding.  His  parents,  stifled  in  many  ways,  bickered.When  his  family  moved  to  the  United  States,  he  couldn't  help  but  be  impressed  by  the  riches  of  the  West."We  didn't  have  to  go  to  a  store  in  order  to  feel  like  we  were  someplace  completely  and  insanely  (different).  You  land  at  the  international  arrivals  building  --  the  Pan  Am  terminal  --  at  JFK  and  it's  shaped  like  a  flying  saucer.  It  looked  like  something  from  the  21st  century,"  he  recalls.  "You  saw  a  Chevrolet  Corvette  and  wondered  if  this  was  an  airplane  without  wings  on  the  ground."It  took  time  to  make  the  adjustment,  he  observes,  especially  since  finding  his  way  at  school  was  as  difficult  as  doing  so  at  home.It  helped  that  he  had  a  nimble  mind.  In  the  book,  he  talks  about  the  stories  he  wrote,  including  a  rewrite  of  the  Torah;  he  called  it  the  "Gnorah,"  after  his  adolescent  nickname,  "Gnu."  He  details  the  long  stretches  of  the  computer  game  Zork  he  played  with  his  friend  Jonathan.Shteyngart  being  Shteyngart,  he  can't  help  but  make  the  mundane  amusing.His  family  came  over  with  orange  suitcases  (and  dark  jackets)  of  "real  Polish  leather."  The  boy  popping  a  wheelie  on  the  box  of  Honeycomb  cereal  becomes  "an  important  role  model."  His  family  receives  a  letter  from  Publishers  Clearing  House,  addressed  to  "Mr.  S.  Sh*tgart,"  and  believes  it  has  just  won  $10  million  --  though,  to  be  sure  the  judges  approve,  he  and  his  parents  fill  out  everything  and  sign  up  for  several  magazines.Even  the  later  stories,  about  his  drunkenness  and  a  disturbed  girlfriend,  have  a  comic  spin.This  laughter  in  the  face  of  sadness  comes  naturally  given  his  Russian-Jewish  heritage,  says  Shteyngart."I'd  call  it  'laughter  from  the  edge  of  the  grave,'  "  he  says.  "Yes,  it's  quite  tragic,  but  at  the  same  time,  if  you  don't  laugh  at  it,  the  other  solution  is  to  wrap  yourself  in  a  shawl  and  die.  Humor  is  the  armor  and  the  sword  that  you  are  given."'I  tried  to  write  this  in  the  most  loving  way  I  could'He  says  he  had  lots  of  help  in  putting  together  "Little  Failure."  He  interviewed  family  and  friends,  including  an  old  girlfriend  who  had  saved  his  lengthy  letters."I  was  very  grateful  she'd  done  that,"  he  says.  "Because,  as  readers  will  know,  at  Oberlin  I  wasn't  sober  100%  of  the  time,  (so)  it  was  very  helpful  to  discover  these  letters  and  reconstruct  what  had  happened."Reviewers  have  approved.  "  'Little  Failure'  is  as  entertaining  as  it's  moving,"  wrote  Michiko  Kakutani  in  The  New  York  Times.  "  'Little  Failure'  ...  is  a  much  more  straightforwardly  soulful  account  than  many  of  his  readers  might  expect.,"  wrote  Lisa  Zeidner  in  the  Washington  Post.Shteyngart  still  hasn't  heard  from  his  most  important  reviewers,  however:  his  parents.  He  hopes  he  did  right  by  them."I  tried  to  write  this  in  the  most  loving  way  I  could,  because  I  do  love  them  very  much.  They  made  a  lot  of  sacrifices."But  there's  still  a  language  barrier."Their  English  may  not  have  all  the  nuances  needed  to  read  something  like  this.  I'm  usually  translated  into  Russian,  so  I  think  the  ultimate  test  is  to  see  what  they  think  of  a  version  published  in  Russian,"  he  says.However,  he  says  that  another  observer,  his  longtime  psychoanalyst,  hasn't  disapproved.  Of  course,  he  hasn't  approved,  either."I'm  such  a  bad  analysand.  In  traditional  Freudian  analysis  you're  supposed  to  lie  there,  and  instead  I  whip  out  my  phone  and  start  typing  in  the  stuff  that  just  came  up  so  I  won't  forget  exactly  how  it  happened,"  he  says.  "And  because  it's  traditional  analysis,  the  analyst  doesn't  rebuke  me  or  say  anything,  so  I  get  away  with  it."Maybe,  he  adds,  the  book  is  a  capstone  of  sorts,  and  it's  time  to  move  on,  anyway.  He's  already  progressed,  he  says."Unlike  most  New  Yorkers  I  only  see  mine  four  times  a  week  as  opposed  to  the  five  times  a  week  that's  traditional.  So  I'm  something  of  an  outlier,"  he  says.  "But  it's  only  been  12  years  and  we're  ready  to  stop  soon."</TEXT></DOC>

"Court  officials  are  in  the  process  of  reviewing  the  video  and  our  courtroom  screening  procedures."The  taping  as  well  as  an  interruption  by  a  spectator  who  witnesses  said  began  talking  loudly  about  campaign  finance  reform,  apparently  occurred  near  the  end  of  arguments  in  a  patent  case.The  video  confirms  what  witnesses  told  CNN--  that  the  well-dressed  man  spoke  about  the  need  to  keep  campaign  finance  reform  laws  in  place  to  regulate  election  spending  and  contributions."Money  is  not  speech,"  he  said.

A  similar  interruption  occurred  about  two  decades  ago.There  are  only  two  photographs  of  the  court  in  session  --  and  those  cameras  were  smuggled  in  --  in  the  1930s.CNN  and  other  media  outlets  have  been  allowed  to  shoot  video  and  still  pictures  of  the  empty  courtroom.Sketch  artists  are  allowed  to  portray  the  oral  arguments  and  other  public  sessions  of  the  court.There  have  been  calls  for  years  to  allow  cameras  in  the  court,  for  public  benefit.  A  new  television  ad  released  last  week  urged  the  justices  to  do  just  that  saying,  "It's  time  for  a  more  open  judiciary."The  sponsor  of  the  commercials  is  the  Coalition  for  Court  Transparency,  not  affiliated  with  the  group  that  secretly  recorded  the  oral  argument  Wednesday.The  biggest  concerns  raised  by  the  justices  are  that  cameras  would  upset  the  personal  dynamic  between  them  that  make  oral  arguments  so  unique  and  useful  to  their  later  deliberations  and  opinion-writing.The  courtroom  has  about  330  seats  available  to  the  public.

The  president  outlined  a  process  to  study  the  issue  further  and  appears  open  to  alternatives.

Philadelphia  International  Airport  tweeted,  and  photos  indicate,  that  the  plane's  nose  gear  collapsed.Philadelphia  Fire  Commissioner  Lloyd  Ayers  said  two  women  from  the  plane  were  transported  to  the  city's  Methodist  Hospital,  one  with  a  minor  injury  and  the  other  with  a  minor  illness."This  is  a  good  time,"  Ayers  said,  referring  to  the  response  and  the  fact  things  turned  out  as  well  as  they  did.  "It  worked  out  alright."Flight  1702  was  scheduled  to  take  off  at  5:50  p.m.  and  arrive  in  Fort  Lauderdale  about  three  hours  later,  according  to  US  Airways'  website,  though  Federal  Aviation  Administration  spokesman  Jim  Peters  said  the  incident  took  place  around  6:25  p.m.Watching  from  a  nearby  plane,  Dave  Olinger  said,  "I  saw  the  plane  come  down  with  its  landing  gear  (hitting)  the  ground  abnormally  hard  and  it  bounced  back  into  the  air.  Then  it  continued  to  try  to  land  and  it  went  out  of  my  view  as  I  saw  a  massive  cloud  of  dust  come  up  from  behind  it."A  witness  in  an  airport  terminal,  posting  to  the  online  travel  community  FlyerTalk.com,  reported  seeing  the  plane  "bounce  twice  on  takeoff."Firefighters  spotted  smoke  coming  from  one  engine,  but  no  fire.  Philadelphia  Fire  Department  Deputy  Chief  Gary  Loesch  said  crews  sprayed  "a  protective  foam  blanket"  around  where  "hydraulic  fluid  ...  was  leaking  from  the  front  landing  gear,"  saying  this  was  only  done  as  a  precaution.Images  from  the  airport  afterward  showed  the  plane  pitched  forward,  but  otherwise  upright,  and  surrounded  by  flashing  emergency  vehicles.  One  showed  the  plane  at  a  standstill  as  some  people  left  from  an  emergency  slide  and  others  got  out  on  the  wing."So  my  plane  just  crashed,"  tweeted  one  apparent  passenger.  A  short  time  later  and  minutes  before  taking  a  selfie  at  the  scene,  she  added,  "I  almost  just  died."The  149  passengers  and  five  crew  members  who  had  been  aboard  the  Airbus  A320  quickly  got  off,  then  were  moved  about  400  yards  away  into  a  field,  according  to  Loesch.  They  were  surrounded  by  police  and  fire  vehicles  to  block  the  wind,  with  women  and  children  getting  into  these  vehicles  to  stay  warm  in  temperatures  hovering  around  the  freezing  mark."Most  people  were  complaining  about  being  cold,"  Loesch  said.Departing  and  incoming  flights  at  the  Pennsylvania  airport  were  temporarily  halted.  Some  of  them  resumed  around  6:55  p.m.,  Peters  said,  though  one  runway  remained  closed  for  some  time  after  that.The  incident  caused  significant  travel  headaches,  and  not  just  for  those  on  Flight  1702.  The  airport  noted  there  were  departure  delays  of  about  one  hour,  with  airport  spokeswoman  Victoria  Lupica  saying  arrival  delays  stretched  up  to  two  hours.According  to  Joe  Taney,  the  vice  president  of  operations  in  Philadelphia  for  American/US  Airways,  Flight  1702  passengers  were  bused  to  the  terminal  and  taken  to  one  of  the  airline's  Admirals  Clubs,  which  is  typically  for  "preferred  members."They  remained  there  for  some  time,  before  they  could  collect  items  they  had  left  on  the  plane.  Another  aircraft  was  arranged  to  take  them  to  Fort  Lauderdale.  That  plane  hadn't  left  by  10:30  p.m.,  though  it  was  supposed  to  head  out  soon."There's  maybe  a  couple  that  chose  not  to  go,  which  is  fine  ...,"  Taney  said.  "But  overall  the  majority  of  people  are  choosing  to  go  on  that  extra  (flight)."CNN's  Aaron  Cooper  and  Kevin  Conlon  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

"As  with  all  of  our  patients,  we  were  truly  blessed  to  be  able  to  be  there  for  The  Boyle  Family  and  for  Finley  at  the  end  of  her  journey."Finley's  parents  are  suing  a  Kailua,  Hawaii,  dentist,  alleging  negligence  and  dangerous  conduct.The  lawsuit,  filed  against  Lilly  Geyer  and  her  practice,  Island  Dentistry  for  Children,  alleges  improper  medications  with  incorrect  dosages  were  administered  to  the  girl  on  December  3,  according  to  court  documents  filed  this  week.When  routine  surgeries  go  wrong"As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  the  medications  administered  to  (Finley)  by  defendants,  (Finley)  suffered  cardiac  arrest  during  her  dental  procedure,"  the  lawsuit  says.It  alleges  that,  as  a  further  result  of  improper  medications,  Finley  "suffered  severe  and  permanent  brain  damage."Neither  Geyer  nor  her  attorney,  John  Nishimoto,  responded  to  CNN's  requests  for  comment.  The  Island  Dentistry  website  states  it  has  been  permanently  closed  and  directs  patients  to  an  e-mail  address.The  lawsuit,  filed  Monday  in  Hawaii's  First  Circuit  Court,  alleges  that  Geyer  had  no  plan  in  place  to  respond  to  medical  emergencies,  such  as  the  one  Finley  suffered.  It  seeks  unspecified  damages.Girl  declared  brain  dead  after  tonsil  surgeryFinley's  mother,  Ashley  Boyle,  said  she  first  took  her  daughter  to  the  dentist  in  November,  when  she  was  told  her  daughter  needed  six  fillings  and  four  root  canals,  she  said.They  returned  in  December  to  undergo  the  root  canals,  Boyle  said.The  parents  allege  that  Finley  was  sedated  and  left  unmonitored  for  26  minutes.Finley  was  moved  from  a  hospital  to  the  hospice  in  late  December.Finley's  pediatric  neurologist,  Dr.  Gregory  Yen,  said  MRIs  showed  the  girl  suffered  severe  brain  damage  and  that  she  was  in  a  "persistent  vegetative  state."10  shocking  medical  mistakes</TEXT></DOC>

He  made  a  point  of  saying  the  Ukrainian  military  should  stay  out  of  it,  as  it  has  so  far.Visa  banLater,  the  United  States  issued  a  visa  ban  for  20  senior  members  of  the  Ukrainian  government  and  others  responsible  for  the  violent  crackdown  in  Kiev,  a  senior  State  Department  official  told  reporters  on  a  conference  call.However,  Council  on  Foreign  Relations  President  Richard  Haass  told  CNN  that  the  United  States  and  its  European  allies  have  limited  options  for  impacting  the  situation  on  the  ground  in  Ukraine."My  own  hunch  is  this  is  going  to  continue  to  escalate,"  Haass  said,  adding  that  the  main  question  was  whether  the  military  would  side  with  the  government  by  getting  involved  or  back  the  protesters  by  remaining  in  barracks.In  what  the  senior  State  Department  official  called  "a  glimmer  of  hope,"  the  Ukrainian  government  and  the  opposition  announced  a  truce  Wednesday  night  to  allow  for  negotiations  to  restart  with  the  aim  at  stabilizing  the  situation.Earlier,  Obama  said  while  attending  talks  in  Mexico  with  the  leaders  of  Canada  and  the  host  country  that  "we're  going  to  be  watching  closely  and  we  expect  the  Ukrainian  government  to  show  restraint,  to  not  resort  to  violence  in  dealing  with  peaceful  protestors."Obama  condemns  violence"We've  also  said  we  expect  peaceful  protestors  to  remain  peaceful  and  we'll  be  monitoring  very  closely  the  situation,  recognizing  that  with  our  European  partners  and  the  international  community  there  will  be  consequences  if  people  step  over  the  line,"  said  the  President,  who  condemned  the  violence  "in  the  strongest  terms."Thousands  of  demonstrators  have  packed  Independence  Square  in  Kiev  since  November,  when  President  Viktor  Yanukovych  reversed  a  decision  to  sign  a  trade  deal  with  the  European  Union  and  instead  turned  toward  Russia.The  unrest  intensified  after  an  anti-protest  law  went  into  effect.  On  Tuesday,  the  street  clashes  escalated  dramatically,  leaving  26  people  dead  and  buildings  on  fire.Vice  President  Joe  Biden  spoke  to  Yanukovych  on  Tuesday  night  to  express  "grave  concern"  over  the  crisis.A  readout  of  the  conversation  released  by  the  White  House  said  Biden  told  the  Ukrainian  leader  that  "the  United  States  condemns  violence  by  any  side,  but  that  the  government  bears  special  responsibility  to  de-escalate  the  situation."Secretary  of  State  John  Kerry  reiterated  Biden's  message  on  Wednesday,  saying  Yanukovych  can  choose  either  dialogue  and  compromise  or  violence  and  mayhem."It  is  in  his  hands  to  decide  what  the  future  of  the  Ukraine  and  the  future  hopes  of  his  people  will  be,  and  we  hope  very  much  that  violence  will  be  avoided  and  compromise  will  be  found,"  Kerry  said.On  Wednesday  night,  Ukraine  military  forces  moved  into  defensive  positions  around  military  bases  and  weapons  depots  across  the  country,  according  to  a  U.S.  defense  official  familiar  with  the  latest  intelligence.The  move  was  considered  as  defensive  to  secure  facilities  and  weapons,  and  so  far  only  involved  military  personnel  rather  than  any  widespread  movement  of  armored  vehicles,  according  to  the  defense  official  who  spoke  on  condition  of  not  being  identified."We  are  encouraged  the  Ukraine  military  has  not  been  brought  into  this  crisis  and  we  urge  them  to  remain  on  the  sidelines,"  said  Pentagon  spokesman  Col.  Steve  Warren.If  the  Ukraine  military  got  involved  in  the  fighting,  "that  would  have  consequences  for  our  defense  relationship,"  Warren  added.Ukraine  cites  terrorists  for  troubleWhile  Yanukovych's  government  has  received  most  of  the  blame,  Ukrainian  officials  blamed  protesters  for  the  escalating  unrest.Security  chief  Oleksander  Yakimenko  accused  protesters  of  looting  weapons  and  ammunition  from  government  offices  and  announced  a  nationwide  "anti-terrorist  operation."According  to  senior  U.S.  administration  officials,  such  language  by  Ukraine  signals  a  hardening  government  position  against  the  protesters.In  a  later  conference  call  with  reporters,  the  senior  State  Department  official  --  who  spoke  on  condition  of  not  being  identified  --  expressed  concern  over  the  replacement  of  Ukraine's  military  armed  forces  chief.  No  reason  was  given  for  the  dismissal  of  Col.  Gen.  Volodymyr  Zamana.Russia,  which  has  major  historical  and  economic  ties  to  the  former  Soviet  territory,  accuses  the  United  States  of  playing  a  role  in  the  widespread  protests.  The  senior  State  Department  official  denied  that  on  Wednesday,  saying  "we  completely  reject  their  notion  that  we  have  been  interfering."The  visa  bans  announced  Wednesday  followed  an  earlier  move  in  January  when  existing  visas  of  some  Ukrainians  were  revoked  over  previous  unrest,  the  State  Department  official  said.This  time,  the  20  Ukrainians  --  none  of  them  from  the  military  --  now  banned  from  getting  new  U.S.  visas  "represent  the  full  chain  of  command  that  we  consider  responsible  for  ordering  security  forces  to  move  against"  protesters  on  Tuesday,  the  official  added.Sanctions  talkOther  sanctions  in  coordination  with  the  European  Union  also  could  occur,  according  to  the  official,  who  declined  to  provide  further  details.France  also  has  threatened  sanctions  against  Ukraine  over  the  government's  crackdown,  with  President  Francois  Hollande  calling  the  protest  violence  "unspeakable,  unacceptable,  intolerable  acts."The  Obama  administration  has  come  under  increasing  criticism  for  its  foreign  policy  as  talks  have  faltered  on  halting  Syria's  civil  war,  which  left  nearly  5,000  people  dead  in  the  last  three  weeks  in  a  particularly  violent  stretch  of  the  almost  three-year  conflict.On  Sunday,  veteran  GOP  Sen.  John  McCain  of  Arizona  called  the  U.S.  policy  in  Syria  an  "abysmal  failure  and  a  disgraceful  one."READ:  Ukraine  protesters  stand  ground  as  European,  U.S.  leaders  discuss  sanctionsREAD:  Explainer:  What  and  who  are  behind  Ukraine's  political  crisis?READ:  John  Kerry:  United  States,  EU  stand  with  Ukraine's  peopleCNN's  Jake  Tapper,  Barbara  Starr,  Dana  Davidsen  and  Adam  Aigner-Treworgy  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Harris  Jr.  talks  about  his  efforts  to  get  kids  off  the  streets.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Lonza  "Batman"  C.  Harris  Jr.  joined  the  Gangster  Disciples  at  age  17,  and  later  became  its  legal  and  political  coordinator.  Today,  Harris  is  immobilized  as  a  result  of  ALS.  His  story  is  featured  in  "The  Greens,"  a  documentary  he  co-produced.  The  following  is  an  edited  transcript  of  Harris'  story,  as  told  to  CNN  over  the  phone.  CNN  cannot  confirm  all  of  his  accounts.  For  more  on  Chicago's  gang  problem,  watch  "Chicagoland"  Thursday  nights  at  10  ET/9  CT  on  CNN.(CNN)  --  I  think  it  was  the  fall,  the  year  my  mother  told  us  she'd  decided  to  go  to  Chicago.  We  were  on  the  porch  back  in  Arkansas  --  me,  my  nine  brothers  and  sisters  --  and  she  said,  "I'll  be  back  to  get  y'all."It  was  the  first  time  that  we  had  ever  been  separated  from  each  other.  I  was  6  years  old.When  she  came  back,  we  all  packed  up  the  car  and  headed  to  Chicago.  I  recall  the  fields  disappearing  as  we  drove  further  north.  I  stopped  seeing  a  lot  of  trees,  I  stopped  seeing  a  lot  of  open  space.  The  closer  we  got  to  Chicago,  there  were  a  lot  of  buildings  and  I  had  to  adjust  because  I  was  from  rural  Arkansas.We  settled  into  a  four-  or  five-bedroom  house  on  the  West  Side  of  Chicago.  When  I  was  14  years  old,  our  house  caught  fire.  It  was  the  year  of  the  blizzard,  1979.By  the  grace  of  the  good  lord,  we  all  got  out  safely.We  stood  across  the  street  and  we  watched  the  house  burn  down  with  everything  we  had,  with  the  exception  of  the  clothes  on  our  backs.  But  the  most  important  thing  out  of  that  fire  we  didn't  lose,  because  we  had  each  other.You  couldn't  begin  to  imagine  what  life  was  like  after  that  happened.  I  was  a  freshman  in  high  school  and  we  had  to  move  to  the  Cabrini  Green  housing  project.Values  out  the  windowIt  was  unimaginable.  Cabrini  Green  was  a  tall  high-rise,  I  think  15  stories  high,  and  you  got  people  standing  everywhere.  You  can't  even  get  in  your  apartment.We  moved  into  an  apartment  on  the  first  floor  with  boarded-up  windows.  Sometimes  we'd  all  be  out  there  in  the  kitchen  or  reading  in  the  front  room  and  all  of  a  sudden,  someone  would  come  by  at  night  and  start  beating  on  the  boards  --  scaring  my  younger  brothers  and  sisters.I  had  a  brother,  11  months  younger  than  me,  I  think  it  affected  him  the  most.  He  kept  getting  in  trouble  because  everyone  was  trying  to  adapt.  We  weren't  used  to  gangs.We  were  raised  in  the  church,  we  were  raised  with  morals  and  values,  to  respect  people.  But  when  we  got  to  Cabrini,  those  values  went  out  the  window.Photos:  Shedding  light  on  Chicago's  gun  violenceAnd  the  older  we  got,  the  worse  it  became.  Being  a  young  black  man  in  Cabrini,  a  child,  you're  on  unfamiliar  ground.  Things  happen  you  never  thought  would  happen.  As  time  goes  by,  you  have  to  try  to  make  the  adjustment.At  17  years  old,  I  loved  basketball  and  I  was  a  very  good  basketball  player.  When  I'd  go  to  play  ball,  these  Gangster  Disciples  would  always  find  a  way  to  pick  a  fight  with  me.  I  don't  know  if  they  were  jealous  or  what.  I  can  fight  this  one  person,  or  I  can  fight  these  two  guys,  but  all  of  a  sudden  I  find  myself  up  against  10  or  15  guys,  all  Gangster  Disciples.I  got  tired  of  that.  So  you  know  the  saying,  if  you  can't  beat  'em  you've  got  to  join  'em.  And  that's  what  I  did.I  was  a  senior  in  high  school,  about  to  graduate,  when  I  joined  the  GDs.  From  that  age,  from  that  year,  I  started  making  a  whole  bunch  of  bad  choices.  I  got  caught  up  in  that  life  even  though  I  was  raised  to  do  right.  I  got  a  taste  of  that  life,  that  excitement.A  new  eraBeing  in  a  gang  in  the  1980s  was  very  different  than  it  is  today.  We  had  made  a  transition  in  1978-79,  from  the  old  to  the  new.  Gangster  Disciples  had  a  new  concept:  We  had  laws  and  policies  and  we  had  principles.  Making  the  transition  from  the  old  into  the  new,  there's  going  to  be  complications.And  that's  where  all  the  problems  occurred,  trying  to  make  the  transition  from  Gangster  Disciples  into  Brothers  of  the  Struggle.That's  the  era  I  came  up  in.  I  believed  in  the  guidelines,  I  didn't  believe  in  what  gang  members  told  me  because  I  was  strictly  about  the  blueprint.In  the  beginning  of  Gangster  Disciples,  we  were  scattered  branches,  tribes  as  some  would  say.  We  didn't  have  any  type  of  structure.  That  way  we  allowed  the  wind  to  blow  us  in  different  directions.  What  the  new  concept  did  was  to  bring  all  the  members  under  one  leadership.By  doing  that,  you're  gonna  have  those  that  would  sell  drugs,  those  that  would  kill  people,  you're  gonna  have  your  thinkers,  you're  gonna  have  your  doctors,  you're  gonna  have  your  lawyers:  but  they're  all  in  the  same  gang.  But  they  all  have  different  views  and  different  perspectives.So  what  you  have  to  do  to  follow  Brothers  of  the  Struggle,  you  have  to  be  the  one  with  the  attitude  to  learn.  You  have  to  have  dedication,  determination,  discipline,  and  you  got  to  stand  on  that  against  drug  dealers,  against  murderers,  because  we're  all  under  one  leadership.That's  the  trouble  with  making  a  transition:  It's  going  to  be  complicated.  Some  people  are  gonna  continue  doing  what  they  want  to  do  instead  of  doing  what  the  paperwork  says.Education,  economic,  political,  and  social  development:  That  was  the  goal.So  what  happened  was,  you  had  greedy  people  --  and  probably  poor  people,  of  course  --  if  they  make  $5,000  to  $10,000  a  day  selling  drugs,  what  makes  you  think  that  they're  gonna  stop  that  just  because  of  education  or  to  save  a  life?We  had  to  stop  them  the  best  way  we  could.In  about  1989-90,  that's  when  rock  cocaine  hit  Cabrini  real  hard.  So  there  was  a  less  unified  effort  in  the  '90s  than  there  was  in  the  '80s.  Even  I  sold  drugs  from  1991-92,  and  I  served  some  time  in  prison  for  drug  possession.But  I  never  lost  sight  of  the  blueprint.Hidden  agendaI  first  joined  the  Gangster  Disciples  in  1983  because  I  wanted  to  fight  man  to  man  --  just  so  I  didn't  have  everybody  jumping  on  me  at  the  same  time.But  all  the  time  I  was  a  member  of  the  Gangster  Disciples,  I  had  a  hidden  agenda:  to  secretly  detour  kids  from  gangs  and  drugs  even  though  I  was  involved  with  the  gang.I  was  going  to  change  this  one  way  or  the  other.  I  wasn't  going  to  allow  one  child  to  be  bullied  by  10.  And  sometimes  I  would  lurk  in  shadows,  and  I  would  watch  how  certain  people  conducted  certain  things.  And  I  moved  in.In  1987,  I  became  the  youth  director  and  a  project  lead  director  for  Cabrini  Green.  I  had  an  apartment  on  the  first  floor  of  a  church  across  the  street  where  I  got  kids  off  the  street  --  even  though  I  was  still  involved  with  the  Gangster  Disciples.My  objective  and  my  goals  were  the  same:  to  keep  kids  off  the  street.That  worked  out  pretty  good,  until  I  got  into  a  real  confrontation  with  members  of  the  Gangster  Disciples  about  the  way  things  were  going.At  that  time,  in  1990,  I  was  ready  for  whatever  Cabrini  threw  at  me.  They  already  changed  stuff  around  in  the  Green,  they  were  killing  each  other.So  there  was  a  confrontation  with  guns  because  my  hidden  agenda  wasn't  hidden  any  more.There  was  no  secret  to  Cabrini  Green  what  I  was  about.  It  was  out  in  the  open.You  got  all  these  gangbangers,  but  they  ain't  following  the  concept.  They're  doing  what  they  want  to  do.  They  call  Vice  Lords  and  Stones,  they  call  them  "opposition"  under  the  old  law.But  we  ain't  got  no  opposition  no  more.  We  were  all  Brothers  of  the  Struggle  armed  with  the  new  law.  So  when  they  tried  to  make  moves  to  hurt  my  family  members  who  were  part  of  the  "opposition,"  I  made  moves  to  hurt  them.There  were  a  lot  of  lives  being  torn,  a  lot  of  propaganda.After  certain  members  were  killed  or  disposed  of,  a  younger  generation  came  forward  in  the  1990s.  They  didn't  have  no  type  of  structure.  They  only  live  by  their  own  laws.  Like  right  now  in  Chicago,  there's  no  type  of  guidance  or  leadership.  It's  all  about  self.  And  this  has  been  going  on  for  a  while.There's  no  structure.  There's  no  unity.Everything's  gone.  Cabrini  Green,  the  high-rises,  are  gone.  Over  a  period  of  time,  the  organization  has  dwindled  down  to  almost  nothing  because  there's  nobody  --  I  don't  want  to  say  there's  nobody  like  me  left  --  but  there's  no  one  to  step  up  and  take  the  initiative  to  at  least  talk  to  young  black  men.So  it's  like  we're  fighting  a  losing  cause.  But  ain't  nobody  willing  to  fight  for  what's  right.  Everybody's  got  their  own  cliques,  and  the  murder  rate,  and  people  being  scattered  around  the  city  because  they  tore  down  the  majority  of  the  towers.A  dying  hopeI'm  no  longer  a  member  but  I  still  feel  that  love  for  the  struggle.  That's  going  to  go  to  the  grave  with  me.In  a  gang  or  organization  or  whatever,  you're  gonna  have  people  with  talent.  I  was  a  very  good  basketball  player  so  that  piqued  the  interest  of  gang  leaders.  Plus  I  was  a  very  good  writer;  I'm  a  poet  too.I  would  bring  those  two  talents  that  I  had,  I  would  bring  them  together  --  that  way,  I  became  untouchable.  I  don't  know  a  GD  alive  that  doesn't  love  basketball,  so  that  way  I  was  behind  that  shield.  Whenever  our  top  leaders  come  around,  they  knew  my  name,  they  knew  who  I  was.I  took  time  to  teach  the  kids  how  to  play.  That's  something  the  gang  can't  take  from  me.  Now  these  kids  are  grown,  with  kids,  and  they  still  talk  about  me.  I  would  take  time  with  them  behind  the  school,  teach  them  to  play  basketball.I  helped  to  register  close  to  1,000  people  to  vote  through  the  21st  Century  V.O.T.E.  program.  (They  said  it  was  a  prop  for  drugs  so  it  fell  apart  at  the  end  of  1996.)Chicago  Reader:  Interview  with  Gangster  Disciple  leader  Larry  HooverThat  was  the  way  I  made  it  --  because  of  the  poetry  and  the  basketball.  There's  not  many  49-year-old  Gangster  Disciples  left  from  the  era  I  came  up  in.  All  my  friends  are  dead  or  incarcerated.The  people  that  come  around  now  are  younger  Gangster  Disciples  and  they  say  to  me,  "You  still  preaching  the  same  old  sermon?"  and  I  say,  "Yep,  that's  how  it  is."I  know  they  listen  to  me  because  the  majority  of  the  ones  I  talk  to  are  in  school,  or  they're  working.  I  have  a  24-year-old  son  and  I  have  a  22-year-old  son,  they're  not  involved  in  the  gangs.You  either  have  to  love  or  hate.  Light  disappears  in  the  darkness.  Those  things  cannot  coincide  together.As  long  as  you're  alive  --  and  trust  me  when  I  say  this,  I'm  fighting  something  I  never  thought  I'd  fight,  I  can't  even  move  --  there's  hope  that  things  will  change.I  know  people  can  change.  It's  up  to  the  person  to  accept  change  and  want  to  change  and  try  to  help  each  other  and  try  to  do  something  better.Our  purpose  for  living  is  not  to  benefit  ourselves,  but  to  help  somebody  along  the  way.  And  that's  my  goal.  My  health  is  gone  but  I  cling  to  hope.  I  can  hardly  breathe  at  times,  but  yet  I  have  that  dying  hope  that  things  will  get  better,  not  just  with  the  Gangster  Disciples  here  in  Chicago,  but  everywhere.</TEXT></DOC>

That's  happened.  Should  the  Malaysian  military  have  acted  more  quickly  after  the  airliner  went  missing  nearly  four  weeks  ago?  They've  launched  an  investigation.  Are  there  better  ways  to  track  commercial  aircraft  --  especially  when,  as  in  this  case,  its  transponder  is  turned  off?  An  international  aviation  organization  says  it  will  consider  "all  of  the  options."But  as  much  as  things  might  change  because  of  this  mystery,  it  doesn't  change  the  fact  that  --  for  yet  another  day  --  there  are  239  families  still  grieving,  still  waiting,  still  venting  over  authorities'  inability  to  answer  what  happened  to  the  Boeing  777."We  owe  it  to  the  world,  we  owe  it  to  those  families,  to  do  whatever  we  reasonably  can  to  get  to  the  bottom  of  this,"  Australian  Prime  Minister  Tony  Abbott  said  Wednesday.Yes,  authorities  have  said  communications  mysteriously,  and  seemingly  purposefully,  cut  off  shortly  into  the  Beijing-bound  flight.  Yes,  satellite  data  suggests  the  aircraft  turned  back  over  Malaysia  before  terminating  somewhere  in  the  vast  southern  Indian  Ocean.Yet  there  have  been  no  solid  leads  about  why  any  of  this  happened  or  where  the  plane  ended  up.  In  fact,  officials  don't  seem  to  know  all  that  much  more  on  Day  27  after  it  disappeared  sometime  after  leaving  Kuala  Lumpur  than  they  did  on  Day  1.All  227  passengers  have  been  cleared  of  any  role  in  hijacking  or  sabotage  or  having  psychological  or  personal  issues  that  might  have  played  a  role  in  the  plane's  disappearance,  the  inspector  general  of  Malaysian  police,  Khalid  Abu  Bakar,  told  reporters  Wednesday.Police  said  Wednesday  a  review  of  a  flight  simulator  found  in  a  pilot's  house  proved  inconclusive.  And  senior  Malaysian  government  officials  told  CNN  last  week  that  authorities  have  found  nothing  about  either  of  the  pilots  to  suggest  a  motive.  There  have  been  no  such  public  comments  about  the  other  10  crew  members,  however.6  missteps  in  the  investigation"We  don't  have  enough  evidence  to  take  (hijacking,  sabotage  or  many  other  possibilities)  off  the  table,"  Michael  Kay,  a  former  British  pilot  and  military  officer,  told  CNN.  "What  we  need  to  do  is  keep  an  open  mind,  look  at  the  facts,  and  keep  building  the  jigsaw  puzzle.  Because  that's  all  we  have  at  the  moment."Later  Thursday,  up  to  eight  aircraft  will  set  out  looking  for  telltale  debris  across  an  86,000  square-mile  (223,000  square-kilometer)  zone,  the  Australian  Maritime  Safety  Authority  says.  Up  to  nine  ships  will  search,  including  one  British  submarine  racing  against  time  to  hear  the  signature  pinging  from  Flight  370's  flight  data  recorder.There  could  be  a  breakthrough  imminently;  a  seat  cushion,  a  soda  can,  a  life  jacket  could  be  spotted  and  scooped  up,  leading  to  the  rest  of  the  plane  and,  ultimately,  to  explain  what  happened.So  far,  though,  nothing  has  been  found.  In  fact,  it  might  be  someone  dipping  her  toes  off  a  beach  in  Australia  or  Thailand  or  Malaysia  who  first  notices  something."We'll  keep  going  til  hell  freezes  over,"  Kim  Beazley,  Australia's  former  defense  minister  and  current  ambassador  to  the  United  States,  told  CNN's  Wolf  Blitzer.  "It  could  take  months,  it  could  take  years."Official  pleads  for  patienceLast  Friday,  officials  announced  that  --  based  on  new  analysis  of  satellite  data  --  they'd  shifted  the  search  area  significantly  closer  to  Australia's  northwest  coast.  It  moved  again  from  Tuesday  to  Wednesday,  albeit  not  as  extensively.Why?  Beazley  explained  it's  because  "we're  eliminating  areas  from  our  inquiry"  and  moving  to  adjacent  areas.Yet  David  Soucie,  a  CNN  safety  analyst  and  author  of  "Why  Planes  Crash,"  said  "from  the  outside  looking  in,  it  just  doesn't  seem  to  make  a  lot  of  sense.""It  just  looks  like  they're  following  information  and  data  that  they're  not  confident  in,"  Soucie  said.Ocean  Shield:  A  mission  of  hope  in  search  for  Flight  370Authorities  have  been  upfront  about  many  things  they  don't  know  about  Flight  370  --  things  like  altitude,  speed  and  direction  that  are  key  to  pinpointing  its  final  resting  place.Then  there  are  questions  about  who  and  what  was  aboard.While  the  passengers  were  cleared,  investigators  are  still  questioning  relatives  of  all  of  those  on  the  plane  --  having  already  interviewed  about  170  people  --  as  well  as  those  who  may  have  had  access  to  it.That  includes  scrutinizing  those  who  prepared  food  for  the  flight,  those  who  packed  the  cargo,  and  those  who  were  to  receive  the  cargo  in  China."Everything  from  beginning  to  end,"  said  Khalid,  the  Malaysian  police  official.Police  are  considering  four  criminal  possibilities:  hijacking,  sabotage,  personal  problems  and  psychological  issues,  though  mechanical  failure  hasn't  been  ruled  out.  Khalid  stressed  getting  answers  won't  be  easy,  nor  will  it  be  quick."We  have  to  clear  every  little  thing,"  said  Khalid.  "You  cannot  hurry  us  in  whatever  we  are  doing."Flight  370:  High-tech  search  tools'We  cannot  let  another  aircraft  simply  disappear'Even  without  anything  definitive,  Malaysia  Airlines  has  taken  proactive  steps  to  beef  up  cockpit  security,  two  sources  familiar  with  the  airline's  operations  told  CNN  on  Wednesday.A  new  directive  says  no  pilot  or  first  officer  is  allowed  to  sit  alone  in  the  cockpit.  Whenever  one  of  them  is  outside  the  cockpit,  a  senior  cabin  steward  must  remain  inside."These  changes  are  positive  in  nature  and  directly  relate  to  the  MH370  incident,"  one  of  the  sources  told  CNN.This  policy  isn't  new  everywhere:  It's  long  been  in  place  for  the  United  States,  experts  note."What  they  put  in  place  is  pretty  common  sense,"  said  Mary  Schiavo,  a  CNN  aviation  analyst  and  former  inspector  general  for  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation.Other  reforms  could  be  coming  as  well,  and  not  just  affecting  Malaysia  Airlines.Mystery  of  Malaysia  Airlines  Flight  370  surfaces  pain  of  1977  tragedyTony  Tyler,  director  general  and  CEO  of  the  International  Air  Transport  Association,  in  a  recent  speech  pointed  to  "disbelief  both  that  an  aircraft  could  simply  disappear  and  that  the  'black  box'  is  so  difficult  to  recover."He  added,  "We  cannot  let  another  aircraft  simply  disappear."Toward  that  end,  the  association  will  form  a  task  force  that  will  include  participation  by  the  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  to  "examine  all  of  the  options  available  for  tracking  commercial  aircraft"  and  then  to  report  its  conclusions  by  December.A  second  lesson  concerns  security,  Tyler  said,  citing  the  fact  two  passengers  with  phony  passports  were  able  to  board  the  missing  jetliner  unchallenged.Though  these  two  men  have  since  been  cleared,  the  incident  underscores  a  need  for  governments  to  do  better  checking  passenger  lists,  he  said.  "Airlines  are  neither  border  guards  nor  policemen;  that  is  the  well-established  responsibility  of  governments."Family  members  still  have  questionsSuch  changes  are  all  well  and  good.  But  they  won't  bring  back  the  scores  thought  to  have  perished  on  Flight  370.On  Wednesday,  families  of  18  Chinese  passengers  --  out  of  154  Chinese  aboard  --  met  privately  in  Kuala  Lumpur  for  three  hours  with  Malaysian  government  officials  and  investigators.  The  meeting  had  been  called  after  they  accused  Malaysia  of  not  being  upfront  about  the  investigation.Families  of  newlyweds  still  waitingAzharuddin  Abdul  Rahman,  head  of  Malaysia's  civil  aviation  department,  said  it  was  "a  very  good  meeting."  "We  answered  all  their  questions."The  families'  representative  saw  it  differently.  "I  personally  believe  today's  meeting  had  some  progress,  but  the  time  was  short  and  family  members  didn't  have  an  opportunity  to  raise  questions,"  said  Jiang  Hui.Questions,  questions,  questions.  There's  no  shortage  of  them.Chief  among  them  is  will  the  flight  data  recorder  be  found  before  batteries  on  its  locator  beacon  die  --  which,  according  to  its  design  standards,  would  happen  April  7.  Experts  agree  that  it  won't  be  easy,  given  all  the  unknowns."They  are  looking  in  a  vast  area  in  very  deep  waters  ...  and  we  really  have  no  idea  where  it  went  in,"  said  Bill  Schofield,  an  Australian  scientist  who  helped  create  the  flight  data  recorders  that,  if  found,  could  prove  key  to  the  investigation."A  needle  in  a  haystack  would  be  much  easier  to  find."Inside  the  flight  simulatorRead  the  cockpit  transcriptCNN's  Greg  Botelho  and  Tom  Watkins  reported  and  wrote  from  Atlanta;  Judy  Kwon  and  Jim  Clancy  reported  from  Kuala  Lumpur;  CNN's  Holly  Yan,  Sara  Sidner,  Shimon  Prokupecz,  David  Fitzpatrick,  Barbara  Starr,  Will  Ripley,  Richard  Quest,  Nic  Robertson,  Mitra  Mobasherat,  Kyung  Lah  and  Yuli  Yang  also  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Others  members  of  the  GOP  have  signaled  they  might  back  one  if  the  cost  is  offset  elsewhere  in  the  budget.Big  moments  on  Capitol  Hill  from  here  on  out  should  be  viewed  through  the  lens  of  next  November's  midterm  elections,  especially  in  the  Senate  where  Republicans  are  aiming  to  retake  control  of  the  chamber.All  55  members  of  the  Democratic  caucus  are  expected  to  support  the  unemployment  extension  measure,  but  it  was  unclear  if  enough  Republicans  would  join  them  to  get  the  60  votes  required  to  move  the  measure  forward  and  begin  debate.Democratic  aides  doubted  there  would  be  at  least  five  Republicans  who  would  vote  with  them,  though  they  acknowledged  Republicans  could  vote  to  advance  the  bill  even  if  down  the  line  they  decided  to  block  it.However,  Republican  aides  said  they  thought  there  was  a  real  possibility  there  would  be  enough  GOP  votes  to  take  up  the  bill.While  the  aides  couldn't  say  exactly  which  Senators  might  vote  "yes,"  they  thought  there  could  be  moderate  Republicans  or  Senators  from  high  unemployment  states  to  give  it  the  necessary  votes.Sen.  Dean  Heller  of  Nevada,  a  co-sponsor  of  the  bill,  is  the  only  Republican  publicly  supporting  it.Democrats  see  themselves  in  a  win-win  position  with  Monday's  vote.  They  could  build  momentum  for  the  bill  if  Republicans  back  it.  They  get  a  political  weapon  if  Republicans  don't.In  his  weekly  address  over  the  weekend,  Obama  blasted  Republicans  who  "went  home  for  the  holidays  and  let  that  lifeline  expire."Benefits  for  the  long-term  unemployed  expired  last  month  after  Congress  opted  not  to  continue  a  2008  recession-era  law  providing  nearly  a  year  of  benefits,  paid  for  by  U.S.  taxpayers,  that  kicked  in  when  state  jobless  benefits  ran  out.Democrats  insist  the  program  is  critical  to  help  shore  up  struggling  families  and  maintain  the  economic  recovery.Republicans  argue  that  the  program  --  which  the  Congressional  Budget  Office  estimates  would  cost  about  $26  billion  to  continue  for  another  year  --  is  costly  and  is  a  disincentive  to  looking  for  work.The  U.S.  unemployment  rate  stood  at  7  percent  in  November,  the  most  recent  Labor  Department  statistics  show.  That  means  more  than  10  million  people  were  out  of  work,  a  third  of  them  without  a  job  for  at  least  27  weeks.Obama:  Extend  unemployment  insuranceRepublicans  also  upped  the  ante  over  the  weekend.  Key  members,  including  potential  2016  presidential  candidate  Sen.  Rand  Paul  of  Kentucky,  insisted  that  an  extension  must  include  cuts  elsewhere  to  offset  the  cost."I'm  opposed  to  having  it  without  paying  for  it,"  Paul  said  on  ABC's  "This  Week."  "I  think  it's  wrong  to  borrow  money  from  China  or  simply  print  up  money  for  it."House  Speaker  John  Boehner  will  insist  on  such  offsets  before  agreeing  to  an  extension,  a  spokesman  for  the  Republican  leader  told  CNN.Obama  plans  to  meet  in  the  East  Room  this  week  with  people  who  have  lost  their  jobless  benefits.Gene  Sperling,  director  of  the  White  House's  National  Economic  Council,  echoed  the  President's  sentiments  on  Sunday  and  took  Republicans  to  task  for  what  he  called  the  unprecedented  step  of  nixing  emergency  benefits  for  the  first  time  in  the  past  50  years."We  have  never  cut  off  emergency  unemployment  benefits  when  the  unemployment  rate  is  this  high,"  Sperling  told  CNN's  Candy  Crowley  on  "State  of  the  Union."  "(Monday)  is  actually  the  day  that  1.3  million  Americans  will  go  to  the  mailbox  and  find  that  check  missing,  the  check  that  they  rely  on  to  put  food  on  their  table."During  his  weekly  address,  Obama  also  underscored  that  failing  to  pass  an  unemployment  benefits  extension  could  result  in  a  drag  on  the  economy.New  year,  same  old  fight  over  jobless  benefits"It  actually  slows  down  the  economy  for  all  of  us.  If  folks  can't  pay  their  bills  or  buy  the  basics,  like  food  and  clothes,  local  businesses  take  a  hit  and  hire  fewer  workers,"  he  said.Senate  Majority  Leader  Harry  Reid  railed  against  Republican  insistence  for  cuts  in  other  areas  to  pay  for  a  jobless  benefit  extension."We  have  never  offset  emergency  spending.  That's  foolishness,"  Reid  told  CNN's  Alison  Harding.Reid  is  optimistic  about  reaching  the  60  votes  on  the  procedural  motion,  but  conservative  interests  are  applying  heavy  pressure  and  keeping  score.The  Club  for  Growth  urged  all  Senators  to  vote  "no"  on  the  proposal  and  cited  the  lack  of  spending  offsets."Congress  should  end  the  federal  unemployment  insurance  program  and  return  the  authority  back  to  the  states,  which  already  have  programs  in  place,"  the  group  said  in  a  statement."Absent  this,  Congress  should  pay  for  this  extension  by  cutting  spending  elsewhere  in  the  budget.  After  six  years,  an  extension  can  no  longer  be  called  an  'emergency'  with  any  credibility.  There  is  plenty  of  waste  in  the  federal  budget  from  which  to  find  an  offset,"  it  said.</TEXT></DOC>

It  is  legal  counsel  for  John  Peter  Smith  Hospital  "in  a  number  of  civil  areas."At  this  time,  no  hearing  has  been  scheduled  in  the  case.Hospital  spokesman  J.R.  Labbe  said  last  month  that  doctors  were  simply  trying  to  obey  a  Texas  law  that  says  "you  cannot  withhold  or  withdraw  life-sustaining  treatment  for  a  pregnant  patient."Munoz's  husband  responded  by  saying  that  "Marlise  cannot  possibly  be  a  pregnant  patient  --  Marlise  is  dead."  Furthermore,  he  argued  that  her  wishes  --  relayed,  he  said,  in  conversations  but  not  in  writing  that  she  not  be  on  "life-sustaining"  measures  when  she  is  brain  dead  --  shouldn't  be  treated  differently  from  a  man  or  other  woman  simply  because  of  her  pregnancy.Mother  of  pregnant  woman  on  life  support:  Change  the  lawLast  month,  Erick  Munoz  discussed  with  CNN  affiliate  WFAA  his  wife's  wishes  and  how  their  shared  occupation  had  helped  shape  her  views."We'd  seen  things  out  in  the  field.  We  both  knew  that  we  didn't  want  to  be  on  life  support,"  he  said.  "We  reached  a  point  where  you  wish  your  wife's  body  would  just  stop."Lynne  Machado,  Marlise  Munoz's  mother,  said  Tuesday  the  family  is  not  talking  about  the  case  but  said  she  and  her  husband,  Ernest,  agree  with  Erick  Munoz  that  their  daughter  would  want  to  be  removed  from  the  machines.'Against  the  expressed  will'  of  familyAs  the  lawsuit  details,  the  story  began  at  2  a.m.  on  November  26,  when  Erick  found  his  wife  unconscious  on  the  kitchen  floor.  At  the  time,  she  was  14  weeks'  pregnant  with  the  couple's  second  child.Soon  after  that,  she  was  taken  to  John  Peter  Smith  Hospital,  where  Erick  Munoz  says  he  was  told  that  his  wife  "was  for  all  purposes  brain  dead."  The  family  also  says  the  fetus  may  have  been  deprived  of  oxygen.In  the  lawsuit,  he  says  subsequent  measures  taken  at  the  hospital  --  and,  in  turn,  the  state  law  used  to  justify  them  --  amount  "to  nothing  more  than  the  cruel  and  obscene  mutilation  of  a  deceased  body  against  the  expressed  will  of  the  deceased  and  her  family.""Marlise  Munoz's  death  is  a  horrible  and  tragic  circumstance,  but  by  no  means  should  (the  hospital)  be  entitled  to  continue  cutting  into  her  deceased  body  in  front  of  her  husband  and  family  under  the  guise  of  'life-sustaining'  treatment,"  the  lawsuit  says.Dr.  Jeffrey  Ecker,  director  of  obstetrical  clinical  research  and  quality  assurance  at  Massachusetts  General  Hospital,  works  on  complicated  pregnancies  and  prenatal  diagnosis.  He  says  nothing  scientifically  in  Marlise  Munoz's  pregnancy  is  black  and  white."A  lot  depends,  first  of  all,  on  how  long  the  patient  here  was  deprived  of  oxygen,  or  otherwise  compromised.  We  can  certainly  use  tools  like  ultrasound  and  MRI  to  sometimes  see  where  there  has  been  injury  as  a  result  of  low  blood  pressure  or  low  oxygen.  But  just  seeing  that  things  look  well  isn't  the  same  as  saying  that  things  will  be  well,"  he  told  CNN."Those  things  can't  perfectly  predict  health  and  outcome.  And  there  are  certainly  occasions  where  as  we  look  as  best  as  we  can  tell,  a  fetus  seems  to  be  developing  appropriately  and  meeting  all  its  milestones,  and  yet  after  birth,  after  delivery,  there  is  evidence  of  profound  compromise,"  Ecker  said.Tom  Mayo,  a  Southern  Methodist  University  law  professor  who  helped  write  the  applicable  Texas  law,  said  he  believes  the  hospital  is  misinterpreting  it."She's  not  a  patient  anymore,"  he  said.  "And  so  I  don't  see  how  we  can  use  a  provision  of  the  law  that  talks  about  treating  or  not  treating  a  patient  in  a  case  where  we  really  don't  have  a  patient."The  Texas  law  states  that  a  "person  may  not  withdraw  or  withhold  life-sustaining  treatment  under  this  subchapter  from  a  pregnant  patient."Mayo  said,  "The  provision  they  seem  to  be  relying  on  is  called  the  pregnancy  exclusion.  More  than  30  states  have  this  pregnancy  exclusion  in  their  law.  ...  If  they're  relying  on  that  provision,  I  think  Texas  law  in  that  respect  does  not  compel  the  provision  of  life-sustaining  treatment."When  'life  support'  is  really  'death  support'CNN's  Vivian  Kuo,  Elizabeth  Landau  and  Ed  Lavandera  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Nearly  700  men  newly  diagnosed  with  prostate  cancer  were  split  into  two  groups:  half  had  their  prostate  gland  fully  removed  --  a  radical  prostatectomy  --  and  half  were  followed  through  a  protocol  of  "watchful  waiting,"  where  doctors  only  treated  them  if  symptoms  progressed.On  average,  men  who  underwent  immediate  surgery  lived  longer,  were  less  likely  to  see  the  cancer  spread  and  had  fewer  complications  from  the  disease.  The  longevity  benefit  was  greatest  for  men  in  their  50s  and  early  60s,  where  over  an  18-year  period,  surgery  cut  the  death  rate  by  more  than  a  third.That  result  might  seem  obvious,  but  watchful  waiting  is  frequently  recommended  because  of  surgery's  side  effects  and  because  most  prostate  cancers  grow  so  slowly  that  men  will  die  of  other  causes  before  the  cancer  can  kill  them.Hold  the  salmon:  Omega-3  fatty  acids  linked  to  higher  risk  of  cancerThe  new  study  is  likely  to  give  pause  to  some  of  those  patients."Our  research  suggests  that  we  overtreat  many  men,"  says  Dr.  Peter  Carroll,  chairman  of  urology  at  the  University  of  California,  San  Francisco.  "But  at  the  same  time,  we  may  undertreat  those  with  high-risk  cancers."The  authors  of  the  new  paper  say  they  aren't  looking  to  overturn  current  guidelines  that  recommend  active  surveillance  --  waiting,  with  regular  testing  to  see  if  the  cancer  has  progressed  --  in  men  with  low-risk  disease.  "The  numbers  in  each  subgroup  are  low,  and  the  risk  categorization  is  less  sophisticated  than  current  standards,"  they  wrote,  urging  caution  in  interpreting  the  results.Dr.  Otis  Brawley,  medical  director  of  the  American  Cancer  Society,  says  the  paper  generally  supports  current  practice.  He  notes  that  patients  in  the  Swedish  study  likely  had  more  aggressive  disease  to  start  with  because  they  were  diagnosed  after  complaining  of  symptoms.According  to  Brawley,  just  12  percent  of  U.S.  prostate  cancer  patients  are  found  because  they  show  symptoms;  the  rest  are  identified  through  PSA  tests  and  other  screening."Those  guys  with  high-grade  tumors,  those  are  the  guys  we  ought  to  be  treating,"  Brawley  says.  He  notes  that  other  studies,  including  the  highly  regarded  PIVOT  trial,  have  found  even  fewer  benefits  from  surgery.  "They  all  say  the  same  thing,  that  radical  prostatectomy  for  men  65  and  above  seems  not  to  save  lives."But  others  are  struck  by  the  finding  that  all  groups  in  the  study,  even  men  over  65,  suffered  fewer  side  effects  when  they  initially  opted  for  surgery.  "This  drills  down  that  it's  not  all  about  mortality,"  says  Dr.  John  Davis,  director  of  the  prostate  surgery  program  at  MD  Anderson  Cancer  Center  in  Houston.More  lives  being  saved:  Cancer  death  rates  drop  20%Davis  explains  that  many  patients  who  choose  a  regimen  of  watchful  waiting  or  its  close  cousin,  "active  surveillance,"  eventually  undergo  repeated  biopsies,  radiation  therapy  or  other  measures."I  would  argue  that  the  side  effects  of  surgery  are  much  less  than  those  of  long-term  hormone  therapy,"  which  reduces  the  level  of  hormones  like  testosterone  that  promote  the  growth  of  prostate  cancer.While  surgery  often  leads  to  sexual  dysfunction  and/or  urinary  incontinence,  hormone  therapy  has  its  own  dangers,  including  low  sex  drive,  hot  flashes,  loss  of  energy,  weight  gain  and  an  increased  risk  of  heart  disease.Carroll  agrees  that  mortality  is  only  part  of  the  picture  and  says  the  new  study  underscores  a  need  to  better  differentiate  between  high-  and  low-risk  cancers."Although  it  is  often  said  that  there  is  little  benefit  (from  surgery)  to  those  over  65,  this  appears  not  to  be  the  case.  It's  more  a  function  of  the  aggressiveness  of  the  tumor  and  the  health  of  the  patient."</TEXT></DOC>

Why  don't  we  do  it  for  girls?  Anna  Maria  Chávez  writes.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Anna  Maria  Chávez  is  the  CEO  of  Girl  Scouts  of  the  USA.(CNN)  --  Assertive  and  bold,  strong  and  courageous.These  are  the  words  we  use  when  we  think  of  our  leaders  --  the  characteristics  we  look  for  when  we  elect  politicians,  vet  CEOs  or  select  captains  of  sports  teams.Yet  throughout  history,  these  terms  have  been  primarily  applied  when  men  have  occupied  leadership  roles.  We  expect  men  to  lead  and  assert  themselves,  and  we  encourage  and  reward  these  behaviors  when  young  boys  exhibit  them.So  why  is  it  when  a  young  girl  exhibits  these  exact  same  characteristics,  we  often  resort  to  a  different  word  to  describe  her  behavior?  A  word  that  says  to  young  girls:  These  are  not  the  behaviors  we  expect  from  you.Why  do  we  call  her  "bossy"?It  seems  like  a  little  thing  --  it's  just  a  word  after  all.  Plus,  shouldn't  we  be  teaching  our  children  that  words  matter  less  than  actions  or  deeds?But  words  have  power  and  meaning,  especially  during  the  critical  early  grade-school  years,  when  boys  and  girls  alike  are  developing  their  sense  of  self  and  finding  their  place  in  the  world.  According  to  the  Girl  Scouts  Research  Institute  Ban  Bossy  National  Youth  Poll  2014,  more  than  a  third  of  girls  who  are  called  "bossy"  lose  interest  in  leading  and  stop  making  decisions  or  suggestions.Children  begin  to  establish  gender  role  stereotypes  as  early  as  2  years  old  and  generate  an  emerging  career  identity  by  middle  school.  As  early  as  the  third  grade,  girls  report  anxiety  about  taking  leadership  roles,  become  overly  concerned  about  pleasing  others  and  aspire  to  be  perfect.By  the  time  they  reach  middle  school,  the  damage  is  done.A  2003  study  by  Simmons  College  notes  that  by  the  early  teen  years,  more  boys  than  girls  report  that  they  aspire  to  leadership  roles  in  future  careers,  and  millennial  women  are  less  likely  to  say  they  "aspire  to  a  leadership  role  in  whatever  field  I  ultimately  work."Whether  intentional  or  not,  the  message  is  clear:  Society  is  both  actively  and  passively  discouraging  girls  from  exhibiting  leadership  qualities,  and  that  is  translating  to  a  generation  of  girls  afraid  to  take  the  reins  of  leadership  for  fear  of  being  disliked.And  that  is  a  loss  for  all  of  us.We  can  no  longer  afford  to  have  half  the  population  sidelined,  their  skills  and  their  insight  ignored,  because  of  the  messages  they  received  as  girls.That  is  why  at  Girl  Scouts,  we  have  teamed  up  with  Facebook's  Sheryl  Sandberg  and  former  U.S.  Secretary  of  State  Condoleezza  Rice  to  launch  our  "Ban  Bossy"  campaign:  a  call  for  society  to  stop  calling  girls  who  exhibit  leadership  "bossy"  and  instead  encourage  and  reward  those  behaviors  the  same  way  we  would  for  boys.Opinion:  Sheryl  Sandberg  wrong  on  bossy  banAs  the  premier  leadership  organization  for  girls  in  the  country,  the  Girl  Scouts  have  been  doing  this  for  102  years.  We've  found  that  women's  leadership  journeys  begin  as  girls,  and  their  future  depends  on  receiving  the  same  kind  of  encouragement  and  support  boys  receive  when  they  demonstrate  leadership  capacities  in  life.I  know  how  limiting  words  can  be.As  a  young  Latina  growing  up  in  small-town  Arizona,  I  watched  as  my  mother  tried  to  break  the  conventions  of  her  time  and  place,  running  for  the  local  school  board  when  it  was  unheard  of  for  a  female,  let  alone  a  Hispanic  female,  to  do  so.I  watched  and  listened  as  people,  including  family  and  friends,  tried  to  discourage  her  from  running.But  I  was  fortunate,  because  I  also  saw  my  father  support  my  mom  and  her  ambitions.  When  he  was  told  he  had  to  make  sure  his  wife  knew  her  place,  he  responded  that  her  place  was  to  lead.Words  can  hurt  or  heal;  they  can  shape  our  perceptions  and  either  encourage  our  ambitions  or  limit  our  understanding  of  what  we  can  become.When  we  refer  to  a  girl  who  demonstrates  leadership  qualities  as  "bossy,"  she  receives  a  message  she  is  doing  something  wrong,  that  somehow,  the  same  behaviors  we  praise  and  reward  in  boys  are  inappropriate  for  her,  and  we  are  limiting  the  scope  of  her  potential  as  a  result.So  the  next  time  you  have  the  urge  to  call  a  little  girl  "bossy,"  stop,  take  a  breath  and  say,  "She's  a  leader."It's  time  to  redirect  the  power  of  words  to  girls  themselves,  so  that  "girl"  and  "leader"  mean  one  and  the  same.It's  time  to  "Ban  Bossy."The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Anna  Maria  Chávez.</TEXT></DOC>

NASA  on  Wednesday  announced  the  discovery  of  715  new  planets,  by  far  the  biggest  batch  of  planets  ever  unveiled  at  once.By  way  of  comparison,  about  1,000  planets  total  had  been  identified  in  our  galaxy  before  Wednesday.Four  of  those  planets  are  in  what  NASA  calls  the  "habitable  zone,"  meaning  they  have  the  makeup  to  potentially  support  life.The  planets,  which  orbit  305  different  stars,  were  discovered  by  the  Kepler  space  telescope  and  were  verified  using  a  new  technique  that  scientists  expect  to  make  new  planetary  discoveries  more  frequent  and  more  detailed."We've  been  able  to  open  the  bottleneck  to  access  the  mother  lode  and  deliver  to  you  more  than  20  times  as  many  planets  as  has  ever  been  found  and  announced  at  once,"  said  Jack  Lissauer,  a  planetary  scientist  at  NASA's  Ames  Research  Center  in  California.Launched  in  March  2009,  the  Kepler  space  observatory  was  the  first  NASA  mission  to  find  planets  similar  to  Earth  that  are  in,  or  near,  habitable  zones  --  defined  as  planets  that  are  the  right  distance  from  a  star  for  a  moderate  temperature  that  might  sustain  liquid  water.Tuesday's  planets  all  were  verified  using  data  from  the  first  two  years  of  Kepler's  voyage,  meaning  there  may  be  many  more  to  come."Kepler  has  really  been  a  game-changer  for  our  understanding  of  the  incredible  diversity  of  planets  and  planetary  systems  in  our  galaxy,"  said  Douglas  Hudgins,  a  scientist  with  NASA's  astrophysics  division.The  new  technique  is  called  "verification  by  multiplicity,"  and  relies  in  part  on  the  logic  of  probability.  Instead  of  searching  blindly,  the  team  focused  on  stars  that  the  technique  suggests  are  likely  to  have  more  than  one  planet  in  their  orbit.NASA  says  95%  of  the  planets  discovered  by  Kepler  are  smaller  than  Neptune,  which  is  four  times  as  big  as  Earth.One  of  them  is  about  twice  the  size  of  Earth  and  orbits  a  star  half  the  size  of  Earth's  sun  in  a  30-day  cycle.The  other  three  planets  in  habitable  zones  also  are  all  roughly  twice  the  size  of  Earth.  Scientists  said  the  multiplicity  technique  is  biased  toward  first  discovering  planets  close  to  their  star  and  that,  when  further  data  comes  in,  they  expect  to  find  a  higher  percentage  of  new  planets  that  could  potentially  have  a  life-supporting  climate  like  Earth's."The  more  we  explore  the  more  we  find  familiar  traces  of  ourselves  amongst  the  stars  that  remind  us  of  home,"  said  Jason  Rowe,  a  research  scientist  at  the  SETI  Institute  in  Mountain  View,  California,  and  co-leader  of  the  research  team.</TEXT></DOC>

Midazolam  was  one  of  two  drugs  used  in  the  January  execution  of  Ohio  convict  Dennis  McGuire,  who  was  put  to  death  for  the  rape  and  murder  of  a  22-year-old  woman  in  1994.Like  many  U.S.  states,  Virginia  has  been  forced  to  find  new  drugs  to  use  on  condemned  prisoners  after  European-based  manufacturers  banned  American  prisons  from  using  their  drugs  in  capital  punishment.  McGuire's  lawyers  argued  that  the  drug  would  bring  on  an  agonizing,  suffocating  death,  and  witnesses  said  the  condemned  convict  appeared  to  be  gasping  for  air  for  more  than  10  minutes  after  receiving  his  injection.The  Illinois-based  pharmaceutical  company  Hospira,  which  manufactures  midazolam,  says  it  opposes  the  use  of  its  products  in  lethal  injections  and  no  longer  sells  it  to  prison  hospitals."However,  due  to  the  complex  supply  chain  and  the  gray  market  in  the  United  States,  despite  our  efforts,  Hospira  cannot  guarantee  that  a  U.S.  prison  could  not  secure  restricted  products  through  other  channels  not  under  Hospira's  control,"  the  company  says  in  a  statement  on  its  website.According  to  the  website  for  the  Death  Penalty  Information  Center,  Virginia  uses  a  three-drug  protocol,  which  involves  drugs  that  have  different  effects  on  the  body.</TEXT></DOC>

Chris  Christie  fights  back  against  the  biggest  political  controversy  of  his  career,  he's  under  fire,  as  expected,  from  opportunistic  attacks  from  the  left.Begala:  Three  reasons  bridge  scandal  will  stickCupp:  Christie  apology  hits  all  the  right  notesBut  there  are  plenty  within  his  own  party  who  may  also  be  pleased  to  see  the  tough-talking  Republican  governor  get  a  bit  of  a  comeuppance.The  party's  conservative  base  has  never  warmed  to  Christie.  And  he  angered  other  Republicans  with  his  2012  Republican  National  Convention  speech  that  was  more  about  him  than  the  party's  nominee  Mitt  Romney.And  some  will  never  forgive  him  for  his  public  embrace  of  President  Barack  Obama  who  was  surveying  damage  in  New  Jersey  from  Superstorm  Sandy  just  days  before  the  presidential  election.Archives:  Christie,  Obama  set  to  meet  again  on  Jersey  ShoreChristie  took  the  first  steps  Thursday  toward  rehabilitation  --  apologizing  profusely  and  announcing  that  he  had  fired  two  close  aides  connected  the  closing  of  access  lanes  to  the  George  Washington  Bridge  --  the  nation's  busiest  --  to  punish  the  mayor  of  Fort  Lee,  New  Jersey,  for  not  endorsing  him  in  his  re-election  bid  last  year.  The  lane  closings  caused  massive  traffic  jams  in  Fort  Lee.Christie  drops  swagger  amid  heat  of  scandalWith  scandal,  Christie  loses  his  top  enforcerFollowing  Thursday's  news  conference,  a  top  national  tea  party  leader  questioned  whether  Christie  had  put  the  controversy  behind  him."Governor  Christie  held  some  subordinates  accountable.  Time  will  tell  whether  this  is  enough,"  wrote  Jenny  Beth  Martin,  co-founder  and  national  coordinator  for  the  Tea  Party  Patriots.Judson  Phillips,  who  heads  the  Tea  Party  Nation,  went  a  step  further."This  incident  is  proof  that  once  again  the  most  dangerous  place  on  the  earth  is  the  spot  between  Chris  Christie  and  his  presidential  ambitions,"  Phillips  told  CNN."I  strongly  suspect  there  will  be  litigation  as  a  result  of  this  and  the  beauty  of  litigation  is  the  truth  will  come  out.  I  strongly  suspect  there  is  much  more  to  this  than  what  Chris  Christie  let  on  in  his  news  conference."Grassroots  conservatives  are  skeptical  of  Christie  because  of  his  praise  for  Obama  over  the  federal  government's  assistance  to  New  Jersey  for  Sandy  damage,  and  because  of  his  criticism  of  some  congressional  Republicans  over  their  initial  reluctance  to  support  federal  relief  aid  to  Garden  State  following  Sandy.Christie  has  also  angered  conservatives  with  his  willingness  to  work  with  Democrats  on  such  issues  as  immigration  reform,  and  his  criticism  of  some  on  the  right,  including  Sen.  Rand  Paul  of  Kentucky,  a  tea  party  favorite  who's  a  possible  rival  for  the  2016  GOP  nomination.Christie  heralds  NJ  DREAM  Act  as  message  to  WashingtonWill  Christie's  immigration  bill  haunt  him  in  2016?Thursday,  following  the  Christie  news  conference,  Paul  seemed  to  take  a  dig  at  Christie,  saying,  "I  don't  know  who  e-mailed  whom,  who  works  for  whom.  I  have  been  in  traffic  before  and  I  know  how  angry  I  am,  and  I'm  always  wondering,  who  did  this."Erick  Erickson,  co-founder  of  RedState.com  and  leading  voice  on  the  right,  wrote  Wednesday  in  an  article  titled  "The  Politics  of  A-Holes"  that  "There's  more  here  and  it  is  going  to  be  the  problem  that  haunts  Chris  Christie."And  Breitbart's  Matthew  Boyle,  who's  also  influential  among  conservatives,  tweeted  Wednesday  that  "Chris  Christie  is  not  a  conservative.  Don't  delude  yourself  into  thinking  he  is."But  the  conservatives  couldn't  resist  an  opportunity  to  get  in  a  dig  at  their  real  nemesis."The  contrast  between  Barack  Obama  and  Chris  Christie  in  terms  of  owning  a  mess  and  fixing  it  is  now  pretty  stark,"  tweeted  Erickson."This  could  end  being  a  positive  for  Christie  though.  People  like  accountability.  They're  not  getting  that  with  Obama,"  wrote  Boyle  on  Twitter.Jenny  Beth  Martin  made  the  same  point  in  her  statement,  writing,  "We're  still  waiting  for  President  Obama  to  hold  anyone  accountable."Christie's  re-election  team  actively  sought  out  the  endorsements  of  Democratic  officials,  such  as  Fort  Lee's  mayor,  in  its  push  to  win  a  major  gubernatorial  victory  as  a  prelude  or  launching  pad  to  any  2016  White  House  bid.  They  succeeded,  as  Christie  won  in  a  landslide  over  little  known  state  Sen.  Barbara  Buono.But  the  current  controversy,  born  during  that  re-election  drive,  gives  opponents  an  opportunity  to  spin  Christie  persona  of  a  tough-talking  politician  into  one  of  a  political  bully  who's  not  above  petty  politics."This  is  the  other  side  of  the  double-edged  sword  that  is  Chris  Christie's  heavy-handed  persona  and  governing  style.  At  one  level  there's  an  appeal  about  it,  but  underneath  it  you  sense  it  could  blow  up,"  Republican  communications  strategist  Keith  Appell  told  CNN."The  boss  sets  the  tone  for  those  around  him  and  beneath  him.  I  don't  think  this  is  the  last  story  we're  going  to  see  about  problems  with  Christie's  governing  style,  and  even  GOP  establishment  power  brokers  and  money  people  will  be  concerned  about  how  this  plays  in  the  2016  primaries  and  caucuses  --  where  the  GOP  field  will  be  more  substantive  than  it  was  in  2012,"  added  Appell,  a  senior  vice  president  at  CRC  Public  Relations,  a  Washington  public  relations  firm  that  has  had  many  conservative  and  Republican  clients.While  there's  concern,  there  doesn't  seem  to  be  a  groundswell  of  conservative  criticism  right  now."I  do  not  believe  there's  going  to  be  any  retribution  from  conservatives  over  this,"  Jon  Brabender,  a  Republican  strategist  and  a  longtime  senior  political  adviser  to  former  GOP  Sen.  Rick  Santorum,  a  2012  presidential  candidate,  told  CNN.  "I  haven't  heard  a  single  person  tell  me  that  the  news  is  great  because  it's  going  to  hurt  Christie.  I  don't  think  there  will  be  a  piling  on  by  conservatives."Christie,  who's  now  criss-crossing  the  country,  campaigning  for  fellow  GOP  governors  as  chairman  of  the  Republican  Governors  Association,  is  seen  as  prime  target  of  Democrats,  especially  since  three  national  polls,  starting  with  a  CNN/ORC  International  survey  in  November,  showed  Christie  as  the  early  frontrunner  among  possible  2016  Republican  contenders.  And  national  and  state  Democrats  have  been  relentless  the  past  two  months  in  highlighting  the  George  Washington  Bridge  controversy.But  the  bigger  concern  for  Christie  going  forward  is  not  Democrats,  but  opponents  in  his  own  party.</TEXT></DOC>

The  five-member  Privacy  and  Civil  Liberties  Oversight  Board  concluded  the  NSA's  collection  of  data  on  nearly  every  U.S.  phone  call  isn't  legal  and  has  proven  largely  useless  in  thwarting  terrorism.Board:  NSA  phone  data  program  illegal"When  even  the  federal  government  says  the  NSA  violated  the  constitution  at  least  120  million  times  under  a  single  program,  but  failed  to  discover  even  a  single  plot,  it's  time  to  end  bulk  collection,  which  is  a  euphemism  for  mass  surveillance,"  Snowden  said,  pointing  to  the  review's  report.  "There  is  simply  no  justification  for  continuing  an  unconstitutional  policy  with  a  0%  success  rate."The  30-year-old  also  addressed  some  criticism  of  him  in  the  chat,  batting  down  a  report  that  he  violated  his  colleagues'  privacy  while  working  as  a  contractor  by  stealing  their  logins  and  passwords.He  wrote:  "The  Reuters  report  that  put  this  out  there  was  simply  wrong.  I  never  stole  any  passwords,  nor  did  I  trick  an  army  of  co-workers."The  U.S.  government  has  charged  Snowden  with  espionage  and  theft  of  government  property  for  collecting  information  on  spy  programs  and  exposing  them  to  the  world  via  the  mediaBut  he  has  yet  to  face  those  charges,  having  received  one-year  asylum  from  Russia.From  there,  he's  continued  to  speak  out  to  journalists  and  online.  Thursday's  chat  --  coordinated  by  The  Courage  Foundation,  an  organization  set  up  to  support  him  and  his  cause  --  was  one  such  example  of  outreach.Speaking  at  an  event  at  the  University  of  Virginia's  Miller  Center,  U.S.  Attorney  General  Eric  Holder  said  "if  Mr.  Snowden  wanted  to  come  back  to  the  United  States  and  enter  a  plea,  we  would  engage  with  his  lawyers."  The  government  would  take  the  same  tack  with  anyone  willing  to  plead  guilty.  But  Holder  insisted  that,  for  Snowden's  case,  "clemency  isn't  something  that  we  (are)  willing  to  consider."Asked  by  CNN's  Jake  Tapper  in  Thursday's  chat  about  under  what  conditions  he'd  agree  to  return  home,  Snowden  said  --  while  his  coming  back  "is  the  best  resolution"  for  all  parties  --  "it's  unfortunately  not  possible  in  the  face  of  current  whistleblower  protection  laws."He  pointed  out  the  government's  Whistleblower  Protection  Act  don't  protect  someone  like  him  as  a  former  government  contractor."There  are  so  many  holes  in  the  laws,  the  protections  they  afford  are  so  weak,  and  the  processes  for  reporting  they  provide  are  so  ineffective  that  they  appear  to  be  intended  to  discourage  reporting  of  even  the  clearest  wrongdoing,"  he  wrote.  "...  My  case  clearly  demonstrates  the  need  for  comprehensive  whistle-blower  protection  act  reform."In  Thursday's  chat,  Snowden  insisted  "not  all  spying  is  bad."  He  said  his  issue  is  more  with  "the  new  technique  of  indiscriminate  mass  surveillance,  where  governments  are  seizing  billions  and  billions  and  billions  of  innocents'  communication  every  single  day."Such  programs  exist  in  part  "because  new  technologies  make  it  easy  and  cheap,"  not  because  they  are  particularly  effective  in  targeting  threats  and  wrongdoers,  he  claimed.  Snowden  said  he  acted  because  he  felt  compelled  "to  push  back.""It's  not  good  for  our  country,  it's  not  good  for  the  world,  and  I  wasn't  going  to  stand  by  and  watch  it  happen,  no  matter  how  much  it  cost  me,"  he  wrote."The  NSA  and  the  rest  of  the  US  Intelligence  Community  is  exceptionally  well  positioned  to  meet  our  intelligence  requirements  through  targeted  surveillance  --  the  same  way  we've  always  done  it  --  without  resorting  to  the  mass  surveillance  of  entire  populations."CNN's  Evan  Perez  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

(Officer,  there's  no  sign  saying  I  can't  park  here!).  But  most  people  don't  want  to  invest  the  time  and  energy  to  would  take  to  dispute  them.Now  there's  a  new  iPhone  app,  Fixed,  that  will  fight  parking  tickets  for  you.  The  app,  expected  to  launch  next  week,  will  do  the  heavy  lifting  of  contesting  a  ticket:  suggesting  reasons  it  might  be  invalid,  gathering  supporting  evidence  and  submitting  the  proper  appeals  paperwork.If  the  driver  beats  the  ticket,  they  pay  Fixed  25%  of  what  the  citation  would  have  cost.  If  they  can't  get  out  of  the  ticket,  Fixed  doesn't  charge  them  anything.In  this  way,  Fixed  hopes  to  add  navigating  bureaucracy  to  the  list  of  urban  tasks  and  nuisances  --  catching  a  cab,  ordering  food,  finding  a  place  to  crash  --  made  easier  by  popular  tech  startups."When  you  mention  parking  tickets  to  people  it  engenders  such  an  emotional  reaction  ...  because  so  many  people  think  they've  received  an  unfair  parking  ticket,"  said  Fixed  co-founder  David  Hegarty,  who  came  up  with  the  idea  after  getting  six  parking  tickets  in  one  day.  Much  of  this  anger  is  directed  at  local  governments,  which  many  people  see  as  using  parking  tickets  to  fill  budget  gaps.That  emotional  response,  as  well  as  a  desire  to  not  shell  out  $100  for  blocking  a  couple  inches  of  someone's  driveway,  could  make  Fixed  a  hit.  But  its  success  will  depend  on  how  good  the  service  is  at  navigating  parking  laws,  which  are  often  a  confusing  hodgepodge  of  local  and  state  ordinances.Here's  how  Fixed  works:  When  someone  gets  a  ticket,  they  snap  a  photo  of  it  on  their  iPhone  and  enter  the  violation  code.  The  Fixed  app  will  tell  them  what  percentage  of  those  types  of  tickets  are  usually  overturned  and  then  show  a  list  of  possible  reasons  it  could  be  found  invalid.  For  example,  a  street  cleaning  sign  might  be  obscured  by  a  leafy  tree,  or  a  parking  meter  could  be  broken.If  the  motorist  thinks  they  have  a  case,  the  app  will  prompt  them  to  capture  any  additional  photographic  evidence  with  their  phone  and  then  digitally  sign  a  letter.Fixed  has  contracted  with  a  team  of  legal  researchers  fluent  in  local  traffic  laws  who  will  review  each  case  before  printing  out  the  letter  and  submitting  it  via  snail  mail  to  the  city.  Over  time,  Fixed  hopes  to  learn  more  about  what  methods  and  which  errors  have  the  highest  success  rates  when  contesting  tickets.  That  information  will  be  used  to  make  the  system  more  automated."It  will  always  be  reviewed  by  human  eyes  before  it's  sent,  but  I'm  pretty  confident  that  we  can  get  to  the  point  where  80%  of  tickets  are  95%  automated,"  said  Hegarty.Fixed  is  expected  to  launch  in  the  Apple  App  store  next  week,  although  its  service  will  only  be  available  in  San  Francisco  at  first.  The  startup  has  been  testing  its  service  with  a  small  group  of  1,000  people,  mostly  friends  and  friends  of  friends,  and  there's  already  a  waiting  list  of  25,000  people  wanting  to  sign  up.Hegarty  and  with  Fixed's  other  two  co-founders,  David  Sanghera  and  DJ  Burdick,  hope  to  expand  into  the  top  100  U.S.  cities  over  the  next  18  months.San  Francisco  is  fertile  ground  for  motorists  who  can  effortlessly  rack  up  hundreds  of  dollars  in  parking  tickets.  As  in  many  cities,  parking  in  San  Francisco  is  an  exercise  in  frustration,  with  a  limited  number  of  spaces  on  the  street  and  parking  garages  charging  top  dollar.The  company  hasn't  had  any  official  talks  with  the  city.  But  Hegarty  hopes  his  service  is  not  seen  as  adversarial.  Rather,  he  thinks  Fixed  could  help  people  pay  their  legitimate  parking  tickets  in  a  more  timely  manner."We  do  not  have  concerns  if  people  want  to  use  a  third-party  service,  but  there  is  no  secret  to  overturning  a  citation  if  it  has  been  issued  erroneously.  If  someone  feels  that  their  citation  was  written  in  error,  they  might  want  to  consider  protesting  themselves,  for  free,"  said  Paul  Rose,  a  spokesperson  for  San  Francisco's  transportation  agency.San  Francisco  issues  about  1.5  million  parking  tickets  every  year,  typically  for  $45  to  $115  each  (there  are  also  some  significantly  pricier  violations,  such  as  having  an  expired  plate  or  abandoning  a  car  on  a  highway).  The  fines  add  up  to  about  $95  million  a  year,  according  to  Hegarty.Of  those  1.5  million  citations,  only  five  percent  are  actually  contested.  And  of  that  small  amount,  only  30%  are  actually  overturned,  according  to  Rose.  There  are  three  rounds  of  appeals  --  two  by  mail  and  a  court  hearing.Fixed  will  only  handle  the  first  two  appeals  for  the  time  being.The  number  of  overall  citations  in  San  Francisco  has  fallen  in  recent  years  as  the  city  has  rolled  out  its  own  technological  tools,  such  as  pay-by-phone  and  meters  that  take  credit  cards,  in  an  effort  to  make  payment  easier."We'd  much  rather  have  people  pay  the  meter  than  pay  a  fine,"  said  Rose.Fixed's  business  model  isn't  completely  new.  There  are  companies  that  handle  driving  and  parking  violations  for  large  corporations  such  as  FedEx  and  UPS.  In  New  York  City,  commercial  delivery  companies  account  for  20%  to  30%  of  the  city's  10  million  parking  tickets  every  year,  according  to  Crain's  New  York  Business.The  difference  is  that  Fixed  is  making  this  service  available  to  individuals.  Hegarty  can  see  eventually  expanding  into  speeding  tickets  and  other  small  financial  annoyances,  such  as  cable  company  fees.  He  thinks  Fixed  could  help  in  any  area  where  the  fee  amount  is  small  enough  not  to  protest  in  person,  but  still  big  enough  to  make  someone  angry."That's  our  sweet  spot,"  he  said.</TEXT></DOC>

A  complicated,  fragmented  hodgepodge  of  laws  in  each  state  that  dictate  the  lives  of  gays,  lesbians  and  transgender.Living  in  New  Mexico  and  are  one-half  of  a  same-sex  marriage?  You  can  visit  your  partner  in  the  hospital.  But  if  your  partner  got  sick  across  the  border  in  Texas,  sorry  --  unless  you  are  a  recipient  of  Medicare  or  Medicaid,  then  you  have  visitation  rights  because  of  a  federal  government  law  passed  in  2011.A  lesbian  living  in  South  Dakota  has  no  protection  against  discrimination  in  the  workplace  based  on  her  sexual  orientation.  But  if  she  gets  a  job  in  neighboring  Iowa,  she  does.A  Maryland  same-sex  couple  has  the  ability  to  adopt  a  child,  but  if  that  couple  moves  to  Virginia,  the  law  is  not  clear  and  adoption  becomes  a  lot  less  guaranteed."We  are  living  in  this  era  of  two  Americas  where  LGBT  people  living  in  certain  states  and  certain  areas  have  much  greater  access  to  basic  rights  and  marriage,"  Sarah  Warbelow,  the  state  legislative  director  at  the  Human  Rights  Campaign,  said.Chess  gameFor  the  LGBT  community,  it's  a  game  of  chess  with  51  players  on  the  move  (50  states  plus  the  District  of  Columbia).My  same-sex  parents,  a  proud  secretAs  for  now,  the  state  of  play  is  looking  up  for  LGBT  advocates.In  the  last  week  alone,  federal  judges  in  Kentucky  and  Virginia  ruled  that  their  states'  bans  on  same-  sex  marriage  are  unconstitutional.  The  rulings  come  on  the  heels  of  judges  in  conservative  states  of  Oklahoma  and  Utah  who  ruled  that  marriage  bans  are  unconstitutional.Nevada  announced  that  it  will  no  longer  defend  its  ban  on  same-sex  marriage.And  LGBT  rights  groups  are  pleased  that  the  Indiana  Senate  amended  its  proposal  for  a  ban  on  same-sex  marriage  because  it  buys  them  more  time.  The  earliest  it  can  be  on  the  ballot  for  public  approval  is  2016.Last  week  in  Kansas,  in  what  would  have  been  one  of  the  most  draconian  measures  facing  same-sex  couples  in  recent  years,  the  state  Senate  decided  to  forego  voting  on  a  measure  that  would  permit  businesses  to  discriminate  against  same-sex  couples.  After  the  Kansas  state  House  passed  the  bill  that  is  said  to  protect  religious  freedom,  the  Senate  realized  it  is  too  toxic  to  touch.It  doesn't  mean  that  advocates  are  only  moving  forward.  Warbelow  said  they  are  watching  a  series  of  bills  in  state  legislatures  that  limit  LGBT  rights  in  terms  of  relationships  and  the  workplace.One  step  forward,  two  steps  backBut  for  LGBT  advocates,  it's  more  like  two  steps  forward,  one  step  back.Washington  has  also  added  to  the  onslaught.  Attorney  General  Eric  Holder  earlier  this  month  announced  that  the  federal  government  will  expand  the  recognition  of  same-sex  marriages  in  federal  legal  matters,  including  bankruptcies,  prison  visits  and  survivor  benefits.Actress  Ellen  Page:  "I  am  gay"Analysts  expect  the  Supreme  Court  to  rule  on  the  issue  soon,  especially  as  the  four  previously  mentioned  states'  decisions  are  now  in  the  pipeline,  adding  to  the  pile  of  same-sex  marriage  related  case  load.While  the  federal  government  has  made  a  lot  of  changes  in  recent  years,  including  repealing  the  military's  "don't  ask,  don't  tell"  policy  and  President  Barack  Obama's  publicized  support  of  same-sex  marriage,  advocates  aren't  only  seeing  victory.'Unsustainable'The  House  of  Representatives  is  sitting  on  a  federal  version  of  the  Employment  Nondiscrimination  Act,  known  as  ENDA,  which  would  issue  federal  employee  protections  for  sexual  orientation  and  gender  identity.And  Obama  hasn't  addressed  the  "low-hanging  fruit,"  including  signing  an  executive  order  banning  workplace  discrimination  of  gay,  lesbian  and  transgender  federal  contractors.Public  opinion  is  moving  more  quickly  than  judges  and  elected  officials.According  to  a  national  Quinnipiac  University  poll  from  September,  56%  of  Americans  support  marriage  for  same-sex  couples,  compared  with  only  25%  who  supported  it  in  1996.  A  CNN  poll  in  2010  was  the  first  one  that  suggested  that  a  majority  of  respondents  backed  it.Same-sex  marriage  a  dying  political  issueRepublican  strategist  Ana  Navarro  said  recently  on  CNN's  "State  of  the  Union"  that  opinions  on  same-sex  marriage  represent  the  "most  rapid  social  change  that  we've  seen  in  our  lifetime."As  for  the  patchwork  of  state  laws,  Human  Rights  Campaign's  Warbelow  said  it's  "unsustainable  in  the  long  run."Chelsea  Clinton  agreed.

Casado  never  wanted  to  be  on  camera.  In  fact,  he  was  horrified  when  we  at  CNN  suggested  it.  At  6-foot-2  and  "gargantuan,"  as  he  puts  it,  he  hates  to  see  himself  on  camera.Yet  in  the  cockpit  he  transforms,  and  it's  clear  he  has  a  gift  that  exceeds  controlling  a  jumbo  jet.  His  eyes  light  up,  and  his  soft-spoken  voice  rises  in  level  and  confidence.  You  not  only  know  he  can  fly,  but  he  makes  you  want  to  fly,  too.On  TV,  he's  a  natural  and  can  take  the  most  complex  pieces  of  aircraft  equipment  or  flight  scenario  and  explain  it  in  a  way  that's  clear  and  simple.  He  shuns  jargon  and  acronyms  and,  unlike  other  aviation  experts,  uses  words  we  already  know.He's  a  pilot  for  the  people.But  in  a  profession  known  for  precision,  he  suffers  for  his  everyman  speak  and  appearance.  His  hipster  facial  hair  and  casual  cockpit  attire  have  earned  him  critiques  from  anonymous  "pilots"  sniping  from  online.  The  negative  comments  can  cut  him  to  the  bone.The  reality  is  he  dresses  not  for  corporate  aviation  but  comfort,  and  his  journey  to  becoming  a  pilot  and  aviation  analyst  is  far  from  typical.Casado,  33,  grew  up  in  a  tough,  blue-collar  suburb  of  Toronto.  His  father  came  from  Central  America,  his  mother  from  Europe.At  age  7,  a  gift  of  a  toy  plane  set  him  on  the  route  where  we  find  him  today.Fascination  about  flying  turned  into  obsession  --  his  word  --  for  all  things  aviation.  At  school  he'd  get  in  trouble  for  reading  flying  magazines  tucked  inside  his  textbooks.  He  wasn't  good  at  math,  but  his  sights  set  firmly  on  the  goal  of  flying  one  day,  he  studied  hard  to  master  calculus  and  geometry.Because  of  a  birth  defect,  he  suffered  almost  constant,  even  violent  bullying,  and  long  before  he  started  navigating  jets  through  the  air,  he  was  plotting  alternate  courses  home  from  school  to  avoid  heckling  classmates.After  high  school,  he  joined  the  Army  to  serve  his  country,  and  only  after  that  did  he  turn  his  focus  to  flying.His  parents  helped  him  get  his  private  pilot's  license,  but  a  commercial  license  proved  much  more  expensive  because  it  required  flight  school  and  significant  flying  time.He  took  any  job  he  could  to  earn  money,  working  in  kitchens  and  fast  food  restaurants.  His  apartment,  for  a  time,  went  without  furniture.When  he  eventually  had  $14,000,  he  headed  to  a  flight  school  in  western  Canada,  thrilled  to  finally  be  on  his  way.  But  the  dream  turned  to  disaster  when  the  flight  school  went  bust,  taking  his  money  with  it.Ocean  Shield:  A  mission  of  hope  and  uncertainty  in  search  for  Flight  370That's  when  the  darkest  days  of  his  life  began.Homeless,  he  slept  on  park  benches  and  in  stairways  until  finally  ending  up  at  the  place  he  knew  best,  the  airport.By  day,  he'd  sit  in  the  terminals  and  at  night,  he'd  sleep  in  the  bathrooms.  In  the  oversized  handicapped  stalls  he  would  use  a  roll  of  masking  tape  to  mark  out  runways  and  walk  around  them  practicing  approaches.He  used  a  toilet  seat  for  chair  flying,  imagining  the  controls  and  switches  in  his  mind.Eventually  he  made  it  back  home  and  began  working  once  more  to  earn  money  to  fly.  It  would  take  him  years  before  that  final  check  flight.When  the  pilot  turned  and  told  him  he  had  passed,  Mitchell  couldn't  help  it:  he  cried.  His  dream  had  come  true.By  2007  he  was  ranked  in  the  top  10  of  Canada's  amateur  pilots.  Today,  in  addition  to  his  multi-engine  license,  he  has  earned  his  seaplane  rating,  flown  cargo  routes  and  flown  as  a  "bush  pilot"  in  Canada  and  elsewhere.  When  he's  not  in  the  air,  he  works  as  a  simulator  instructor  on  Boeing  737s  and  777s.And,  of  course,  there's  his  new-found  television  talent.  For  his  on  air  role,  I  have  pushed  him  to  do  in  the  simulator  what  he  would  never  attempt  as  a  professional  pilot.  Hence,  he  has  probably  virtually  crashed  a  777  more  than  anyone.  That's  my  fault.On  TV  we  have  had  him  fly  a  777  at  5,000  feet  in  the  Himalayas.  I  nearly  lost  my  dinner  on  that  one  with  all  the  banking  and  yanking.Then  there  was  the  time  I  made  him  attempt  to  land  the  plane  on  a  ridiculously  small  runway  on  a  remote  island.  Just  to  make  it  harder,  I  told  him  to  make  the  weather  stormy.  He  had  one  shot  live  on  TV  with  countless  people  watching.To  his  credit,  he  landed  with  room  to  spare  but  was  so  exhausted  from  the  attempt  he  couldn't  answer  our  anchor's  questions  afterward.  A  few  days  later  he  got  a  message  from  someone  at  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  congratulating  him  on  the  landing.The  other  day  we  made  him  simulate  a  scenario  where  the  fuel  runs  out  on  a  777.  It  was  awful.  It  was  real.  We  both  sat  in  silence  for  a  minute  when  it  was  over.  He  apologized  and  left  the  cockpit.I  had  become  caught  up  in  the  "gee-whiz-what-if"  angle  of  the  simulator.  Casado  had  not.  We  may  have  flown  in  the  virtual  world,  but  as  a  pilot,  Casado  knew  the  heartbreaking  loss  for  239  passengers'  families  is  real.Casado  also  has  a  life  outside  the  cockpit.  He's  married  to  his  childhood  sweetheart,  Deborah,  whom  he  married  three  years  ago.When  the  hours  go  long  --  and  they  do  --  he  worries  about  Buddy  and  Snowflake,  his  two  Netherlands  dwarf  rabbits  waiting  at  home.  Buddy's  a  rescue.He  speaks  to  young  people,  often  cautioning  those  who  might  be  considering  flying  as  a  career  that  the  airline  industry  isn't  what  it  once  was.  The  high-octane,  high-paying  days  of  commercial  aviation  are  now  a  business.There's  more  he  wants  to  do  in  life,  but  for  now  Casado  spends  most  days  flying  and  instructing  in  the  777  simulator  where  I  met  him.What's  unique  about  the  place  is  it's  open  to  the  public,  so  if  you've  ever  fantasized  about  taking  off  from  Los  Angeles  International  or  landing  at  Toronto  Pearson,  or  even  just  doing  touch-and-gos  at  Paris'  Charles  de  Gaulle,  Casado  is  the  guy  you  want  in  the  left  seat.He  knows  a  thing  or  two  about  dreams,  what  it  takes  to  make  them  come  true  and  how  sometimes  there  can  be  a  turbulence  along  the  way.'I  want  to  give  them  answers'</TEXT></DOC>

So-called  self-certification  would  permit  third-party  administrators  to  provide  the  coverage.  Churches  and  houses  of  worships  are  exempt  from  the  requirement  outright.Religious-based  groups  sought  delays,  saying  that  signing  the  form  would  force  them  "to  choose  between  onerous  penalties  or  becoming  complicit  in  a  grave  moral  wrong."But  the  justices  in  their  unsigned  order  concluded  that  to  "meet  the  condition  for  injunction  pending  appeal,  applicants  need  not  use  the  form  prescribed  by  the  government  and  need  not  send  copies  to  third-party  administrators."Varied  reactionA  Justice  Department  spokesman  said  in  a  statement  that  the  ruling  was  narrowly  applied  to  the  plaintiffs  and  "is  not  a  ruling  on  the  merits"  of  the  charity's  larger  legal  appeal.The  statement  also  said  the  Little  Sisters  of  the  Poor  and  Christian  Brothers  have  "always  been  eligible  for  an  accommodation  from  the  contraceptive  coverage  requirement."The  White  House  had  said  previously  the  birth  control  requirement  was  lawful  and  "essential  to  a  woman's  health"  and  that  its  rules  struck  the  right  balance.Others  talked  past  each  other  in  reacting  to  the  decision."We  are  delighted  that  the  Supreme  Court  has  issued  this  order  protecting  the  Little  Sisters,"  said  Mark  Rienzi,  senior  counsel  for  the  Becket  Fund,  the  group  representing  the  nuns  in  court.  "The  government  has  lots  of  ways  to  deliver  contraceptives  to  people.  It  doesn't  need  to  force  nuns  to  participate."But  Cecile  Richards,  president,  Planned  Parenthood  Federation  of  America,  agreed  with  the  Justice  Department  in  that  the  decision  was  "narrow  and  specific"  and  centered  around  an  administrative  mechanism  for  claiming  exemption."This  is  a  case  about  paperwork,  not  religious  liberty,"  Richards  said  in  a  statement.Back  to  the  appeals  courtThe  issue  now  goes  back  to  the  10th  Circuit  U.S.  Court  of  Appeals  in  Denver,  which  will  hold  oral  arguments  in  coming  weeks.A  ruling  by  mid-year  could  then  prompt  a  final,  eventual  high  court  review.Recognizing  that,  the  Supreme  Court  made  clear  it  has  not  decided  the  larger  legal  and  constitutional  issues  at  stake,  merely  acted  on  the  enforcement  question."The  court  issues  this  order  based  on  all  of  the  circumstances  of  the  case,  and  this  order  should  not  be  construed  as  an  expression  of  the  court's  views  on  the  merits,"  the  justices  said.In  March,  they  will  take  up  a  related  challenge  to  the  birth  control  mandate  when  the  court  hears  arguments  over  whether  some  for-profit  corporations  should  be  exempt,  again  on  religious  liberty  grounds.Key  requirements  of  the  Affordable  Care  Act  are  just  now  kicking  into  gear  following  years  of  fierce  political  and  other  turmoil  that  included  a  Supreme  Court  ruling  that  found  it  constitutional,  and  a  flawed  rollout  of  its  online  enrollment  process  this  past  fall.The  case  is  Little  Sisters  of  the  Poor  v.

He  is  the  author  of  eight  books,  including  a  new  novel,  "Patriots,"  and  a  post-election  e-book,  "Why  Romney  Lost."  Frum  was  a  special  assistant  to  President  George  W.  Bush  from  2001  to  2002.(CNN)  --  Nobody  looks  to  Olympic  opening  ceremonies  for  historical  exactitude.  Yet  the  brutal  denialism  of  the  opening  spectacle  at  the  2014  Sochi  Games  should  anger  and  sadden  every  viewer  --  and  Russian  viewers  most  of  all."The  struggle  of  freedom  against  tyranny  is  the  struggle  of  memory  against  forgetting."  So  wrote  the  great  Czech  novelist  Milan  Kundera.  In  Russia,  forgetting  has  won.  These  Olympics  opened  with  a  pageant  of  Russian  history  that  excised  the  crimes  of  Soviet  Communism.  No  Red  Terror.  No  Gulag.  No  Ukrainian  famine.  No  Katyn.The  Russian  state  refuses  to  reckon  with  the  past.  After  a  brief  and  partial  opening  in  the  early  1990s,  it  has  closed  its  archives  to  historians.  The  few  memorials  erected  in  the  Yeltsin  years  are  already  crumbling,  untended  and  disregarded.  Surviving  victims  have  received  no  compensation  or  recognition.  The  sorry  story  of  this  failure  of  conscience  is  well  told  by  David  Satter  in  his  aptly  titled  study,  "It  Was  a  Long  Time  Ago  and  It  Never  Happened  Anyway."Nor  does  Russian  society  press  its  leadership  to  emulate  the  example  of  modern  Germany,  where  Nazi  crimes  are  acknowledged,  memorialized  and  repented.  The  victims  of  Soviet  communist  crimes  numbered  in  the  millions,  but  so  too  did  the  perpetrators  and  accomplices.  They  and  their  children  do  not  wish  to  be  confronted  with  the  truth  --  and  they  certainly  do  not  wish  to  be  held  to  account  for  it.An  apologist  for  the  Russian  state  might  reply:  "What  about  slavery?"  OK,  fair  question.  American  presidents  from  Abraham  Lincoln  through  George  W.  Bush  to  Barack  Obama  have  eloquently  denounced  and  apologized  for  the  crime  of  slavery.  Americans  fought  a  horrific  war  to  arrest  and  overthrow  slavery,  and  it  was  the  foes  of  slavery  --  including  180,000  former  slaves  and  free  black  men  --  who  won  the  war,  and  whose  institutions  continue  to  this  day.  The  Sochi  opening  ceremony  did  not  have  to  address  Russian  history.  The  opening  ceremonies  at  Salt  Lake  City  in  2002  and  Atlanta  in  1996  did  not  offer  an  equivalent  pageant.  But  had  they  done  so  and  omitted  slavery,  yes,  that  would  have  been  a  scandal.Sochi  did  worse  than  omit.  It  actively  glorified  the  era  of  Stalinism.  What  was  presented  at  Sochi  was  the  equivalent  of  a  German  historical  pageant  that  suggested  the  major  events  of  the  1930s  and  1940s  were  the  building  of  the  autobahn  and  the  invention  of  the  jet  engine.  It's  shocking,  and  we  should  not  lose  our  ability  to  be  shocked  by  the  shocking.Oblivion  of  the  past  betrays  the  future.  Because  Russia  failed  to  do  justice  to  the  old  communist  apparatus  in  the  1990s,  it  opened  itself  to  the  recapture  of  the  state  by  that  same  apparatus  in  the  2000s.  Gulag  officials  and  secret  policemen  were  not  brought  to  book,  and  today,  former  Gulag  officials  and  former  secret  policemen  again  control  the  Russian  government  --  and  now  also  own  much  of  Russia's  wealth.Vladimir  Putin  has  held  continuous  power  since  2000,  without  ever  once  facing  a  fair  and  open  election.  The  Russian  media  are  less  free  today  than  they  were  20  years  ago.  More  than  300  journalists  have  been  murdered  since  1991,  including  an  American,  Paul  Klebnikov,  the  former  editor  of  the  Russian  edition  of  Forbes.Regional  governments  are  controlled  from  the  center  by  presidential  appointment.  Citizens  have  little  voice  in  their  own  affairs.  Prosecutions  and  imprisonment  for  political  dissent  have  resumed  and  are  accelerating.Those  who  gained  wealth  in  the  Yeltsin  years  either  come  to  terms  with  the  Putin  circle  or  are  expropriated  or  imprisoned.Standards  of  living  for  ordinary  Russians  remain  miserably  low.  No  beginning  has  been  made  on  cleaning  the  environmental  disasters  bequeathed  by  communism.  Old-age  pensions  are  scanty,  and  health  care  provision  miserable  outside  the  capital.Yet  even  as  the  state  fails  to  meet  these  basic  domestic  responsibilities,  it  has  resumed  the  old  practice  of  bullying  its  smaller  neighbors  and  subverting  its  bigger  ones.  The  violence  in  Ukraine  divides  a  public  that  wants  to  align  with  Europe  from  an  authoritarian  leadership  backed  by  Moscow.  Wherever  you  find  an  international  bad  actor,  from  Venezuela  to  Iran,  there  you  find  a  Russian  ally.  As  authoritarian  regimes  so  often  do,  Russia  has  even  taken  to  stigmatizing  and  persecuting  a  scapegoat  minority:  gays  and  lesbians,  whose  basic  free  speech  rights  have  now  been  defined  as  a  crime  against  the  state.Truth-telling  about  Russia's  history  won't  suffice  to  redress  these  wrongs.  But  so  long  as  the  truth  is  denied  and  suppressed,  the  work  of  correction  cannot  begin  --  and  Russia's  future  will  be  polluted,  as  Russia's  present  is,  by  the  corpses  of  Russia's  unenumerated,  unmourned  and  unatoned  past.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  David  Frum.</TEXT></DOC>

In  the  story  about  his  70  years  in  public  health,  the  sometimes  controversial  thoracic  surgeon  recounts  his  early  experiments  testing  the  Heimlich  Maneuver  on  dogs,  his  life  as  a  surgeon  and  researcher,  and  his  time  in  the  U.S.  Navy  stationed  in  China  during  World  War  II."Many  people  think  I  came  up  with  the  maneuver  by  accident,"  Heimlich  says.  "You  know,  I  happened  to  fall  against  someone  who  was  choking,  that  kind  of  thing.  I  first  seriously  considered  the  problem  of  choking  when  I  read  about  the  thousands  of  people  who  die  each  year.  So  I  set  about  researching  a  better  way,  thinking,  perhaps  I  could  make  use  of  air  trapped  in  the  chest  to  propel  the  object  out  of  the  trachea."Heimlich  began  experimenting  on  anesthetized  dogs  and  tried  to  push  the  air  out  using  different  methods.  He  found  when  he  pushed  just  below  the  rib  cage,  the  object  he  had  placed  in  the  dog's  throat  shot  out  of  its  mouth  every  time.A  maneuver  was  born.And  that  is  mostly  what  the  world  knows  about  Heimlich.  But  in  his  autobiography,  the  doctor  details  other  inventions  and  medical  theories  he  is  proud  to  have  been  a  part  of.In  the  early  1950s,  Heimlich  started  looking  at  how  to  help  patients  who  had  lost  their  ability  to  swallow  due  to  a  damaged  esophagus.  He  began  replacing  the  damaged  esophagus  with  a  part  of  the  patient's  stomach."People  who  hadn't  swallowed  for  decades  --  who  would  feed  themselves  through  a  tube  in  the  stomach  --  were  able  to,  for  the  first  time,  sit  down  with  their  family  or  go  to  a  restaurant  and  eat  normally,"  Heimlich  said.During  the  Vietnam  War,  Heimlich  invented  a  chest  drain  valve  that  allowed  air  and  fluid  to  escape  from  the  chest  so  that  the  patient's  lung  filled  with  air,  helping  many  wounded  soldiers  on  the  battlefield  waiting  for  care.Then  in  the  1980s,  Heimlich  invented  the  micro-trach  transtracheal  catheter,  which  allows  people  with  serious  lung  conditions  to  receive  oxygen  more  easily."I  would  like  people  to  appreciate  that  ever  since  I  decided  to  be  a  doctor  I've  wanted  to  help  people,"  Heimlich  says.  "I  have  seen  people  dying  needlessly  when  in  most  cases,  a  simple  technique  was  the  solution."But  some  of  Heimlich's  ideas  have  caused  controversy  in  medical  circles.Heimlich  has  argued  his  maneuver  can  be  used  for  resuscitating  drowning  victims  and  for  both  acute  and  preventive  treatment  of  asthma.The  American  Red  Cross  does  not  support  using  the  maneuver  for  drowning.  (Even  for  someone  who's  choking,  the  agency's  first-aid  procedure  recommends  first  doing  five  back  slaps  and  then  five  Heimlich  abdominal  thrusts.)  Other  experts  have  noted  cases  where  performing  the  Heimlich  Maneuver  on  a  drowning  victim  did  additional  damage.As  for  asthma,  medical  experts  have  long  questioned  the  maneuver's  effectiveness  as  a  treatment.  In  an  article  published  in  Modern  Medicine  in  1997,  doctors  noted  that  asthma  is  a  disease  of  chronic  inflammation;  while  the  Heimlich  Maneuver  may  help  clear  mucous  plugs  that  form  in  the  lungs,  it  won't  treat  the  inflammation  that  causes  an  attack.  Only  medication  can  do  that.In  China,  Heimlich  teamed  up  with  local  doctors  to  test  another  one  of  his  theories:  that  malaria  can  be  used  to  treat  chronic  Lyme  disease,  cancer  and  HIV.  Put  simply,  Heimlich  believes  purposefully  injecting  patients  with  the  deadly  disease  and  letting  it  go  untreated  for  a  few  weeks  will  strengthen  patients'  immune  systems.The  U.S.  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  opposes  malarial  therapy,  and  many  medical  experts  have  criticized  Heimlich's  testing  methods,  including  his  testing  on  human  patients.Heimlich's  son,  Peter  Heimlich,  writes  a  blog,  on  which  he  has  spent  years  trying  to  draw  attention  to  his  father's  "wide-ranging,  unseen  history  of  fraud."Calling  it  a  "family  issue,"  Heimlich  doesn't  talk  about  his  son,  but  says  there  is  evidence  to  back  up  all  his  ideas.Heimlich  says  there  have  been  cases  where  individuals  used  the  Heimlich  Maneuver  to  save  a  drowning  victim  or  stop  an  asthma  attacks,  and  stands  by  his  own  studies  that  he  says  show  malaria  therapy  has  promise  in  improving  the  lives  of  HIV/AIDS  patients."All  I  am  saying  is  that,  before  dismissing  my  ideas,  let's  at  least  study  them  to  evaluate  their  efficacy."What  isn't  up  for  debate  is  that  choking  can  be  deadly,  and  the  Heimlich  Maneuver  has  saved  many  lives.  Heimlich  estimates  it  has  saved  the  lives  of  more  than  50,000  people."There's  been  a  lot  of  attention  paid  to  the  Heimlich  Maneuver  because  it's  so  effective,  but  what  I  think  makes  it  truly  innovative  is  the  fact  that  it's  accessible  to  everyone.  Anyone  can  save  the  life  of  a  choking  person  --  even  a  child  can  perform  the  Heimlich  Maneuver.""Heimlich's  Maneuvers''  was  published  by  Prometheus  Books.</TEXT></DOC>

We  anticipate  filing  charges  very  shortly  and  we  are  still  waiting  on  a  couple  of  results  from  the  crime  lab,"  Sgt.  Mike  Pooley  said  Thursday.Las  Vegas  police  said  Friday  that  "an  active  and  ongoing  investigation  surrounding  Darren  Sharper"  was  being  conducted  by  the  department's  sexual  assault  unit.  Police  provided  no  other  details.In  addition,  a  Florida  woman  last  month  filed  a  sexual  battery  complaint  in  Miami  Beach  against  Sharper  relating  to  a  2012  incident,  a  police  report  said.According  to  the  report,  the  woman  was  with  two  friends  at  a  Miami  Beach  club  in  September  or  October  2012  when  she  met  Sharper.  The  woman,  her  friends  and  another  person  went  to  Sharper's  condo,  where  the  woman  claims  the  battery  took  place.Miami  Beach  police  are  investigating  the  case,  Miami  Beach  Detective  Vivian  Hernandez  said  last  week.One  of  Sharper's  lawyers  disputed  all  the  rape  allegations  last  week  at  his  hearing."It  was  all  consensual  contact  with  women  who  wanted  to  be  in  his  company,"  Leonard  Levine  said.Sharper  played  for  the  Green  Bay  Packers,  Minnesota  Vikings  and  New  Orleans  Saints  from  1997  through  the  2010  season.CNN's  Paul  Vercammen  reported  from  Los  Angeles,  and  Saeed  Ahmed  wrote  from  Atlanta.

Emergency  crews  are  on  the  scene.  No  further  details  are  know  at  this  time,"  the  Army  fort  said  in  a  statement.Fort  Hood's  official  Twitter  feed  asked  that  all  personnel  on  post  shelter  in  place.Sirens  were  going  off.  A  source  described  the  situation  as  serious.President  Barack  Obama  has  been  briefed  on  the  incident  and  will  continue  to  receive  updates.A  local  sheriff's  office  said  that  it  had  heard  there  was  a  shooting."They  got  some  kind  of  shooting  incident  going  on.

Doing  so  made  him  turn  blue  instantly."I  will  never  forget  seeing  him  for  the  first  time  like  that,"  his  mom,  Natalie  Peterson,  said  in  a  YouTube  video  posted  by  University  of  Michigan's  C.S.  Mott  Children's  Hospital.  "That  was  hard."Garrett  was  born  with  tetralogy  of  Fallot  with  absent  pulmonary  valve  --  a  fancy  way  of  saying  he  had  a  hole  between  the  lower  chambers  of  his  heart,  which  put  extreme  pressure  on  his  lungs.The  pressure  caused  his  airways  to  collapse;  in  essence,  he  was  trying  to  breathe  through  tiny  slits.  This  condition  is  called  severe  tracheobronchomalacia."In  some  ways  the  heart  defect  is  relatively  straightforward  to  fix,"  Dr.  Richard  Ohye,  head  of  pediatric  cardiovascular  surgery  at  C.S.  Mott  Children's  Hospital,  said  in  the  video.  "It's  the  lung  issues  and  the  airway  issues  that  are  the  bigger  problem."The  Petersons  spent  months  watching  their  son  turn  blue  four  or  five  times  a  day  as  hospital  staff  struggled  to  revive  him,  according  to  a  university  press  release.  Garrett  was  put  on  a  ventilator  and  heavy  medication  to  prevent  him  from  fighting  the  breathing  tube.Then  in  May  2013,  Garrett's  father,  Jake  Peterson,  read  an  article  about  another  baby  with  a  similar  breathing  problem.Kaiba  Gionfriddo  had  a  rare  obstruction  in  his  lungs  called  bronchial  malacia.  Using  an  experimental  technique  never  before  tried  on  a  human,  Peterson  read,  doctors  created  a  splint  made  out  of  biological  material  that  effectively  carved  a  path  through  Kaiba's  blocked  airway.  The  splint  was  created  on  a  three-dimensional  printer."It's  magical  to  me,"  Dr.  Glenn  Green,  an  associate  professor  of  pediatric  otolaryngology  at  the  University  of  Michigan,  told  CNN  at  the  time.  Green  implanted  the  splint  in  Kaiba.  "We're  talking  about  taking  dust  and  using  it  to  build  body  parts."Kaiba  is  now  2  years  old  and  free  of  symptoms  related  to  his  bronchial  malacia.Read  more  about  Kaiba's  storyThe  Petersons  decided  to  reach  out  to  see  if  Green  would  be  interested  in  helping  Garrett.Devices  created  with  3-D  printers  have  not  yet  been  approved  by  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration  for  use  in  humans.  Green  and  his  colleague,  biomedical  engineer  Scott  Hollister,  had  gotten  emergency  clearance  from  the  FDA  to  try  the  treatment  on  Kaiba.But  by  December,  Garrett  was  in  critical  condition.  His  parents  took  him  to  the  Michigan  hospital,  and  Green  obtained  another  emergency  clearance  from  the  FDA.After  doing  a  CT  scan  of  Garrett's  trachea  and  bronchi,  Hollister  used  a  3-D  printer  to  create  a  splint  out  of  a  biopolymer  called  polycaprolactone.On  January  31,  Ohye  sewed  the  splint  around  Garrett's  right  and  left  bronchi  to  expand  his  airway.  The  doctors  say  the  splint  will  be  absorbed  by  Garrett's  body  during  the  next  three  years  as  his  airways  grow  stronger.  In  the  meantime,  Garrett  is  breathing  easier  and  needs  less  help  from  the  ventilator."It  is  a  tremendous  feeling  to  know  that  this  device  has  saved  another  child,"  Hollister  said  in  the  press  release.  "We  believe  there  are  many  other  applications  for  these  techniques,  but  to  see  the  impact  living  and  breathing  in  front  of  you  is  overwhelming.""Severe  tracheobronchomalacia  has  been  a  condition  that  has  frustrated  me  for  years,"  added  Green.  "I've  seen  children  die  from  it.  To  see  this  device  work,  for  a  second  time,  it's  a  major  accomplishment  and  offers  hope  for  these  children."Green  and  Hollister  will  be  participating  in  a  Reddit  "Ask  Me  Anything"  Tuesday  at  noon  ET.Three  weeks  after  the  surgery,  Garrett  was  smiling  at  his  parents"We  haven't  seen  smiles  for  awhile,  so  getting  smiles  is  very  exciting,"  Natalie  Peterson  said  in  the  video.Doctors  believe  Garrett  will  be  able  to  come  off  the  ventilator  fully  within  a  matter  of  months.

Ava  Thompson  Greenwell  explores  why.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Ava  Thompson  Greenwell  is  an  associate  professor  at  Northwestern  University,  where  she's  a  Ph.D.  candidate  in  African-American  studies.  Her  dissertation  research  examines  the  dual  visibility  of  black  women  managers  in  television  news.  This  is  the  first  piece  in  a  Women's  History  Month  series  that  explores  evolving  female  identity.(CNN)  --  Recently,  University  of  Illinois  Chancellor  Phyllis  Wise,  who  is  Asian-American,  was  bombarded  with  harassing  tweets  when  she  decided  not  to  cancel  classes  at  the  Urbana-Champaign  campus  during  January's  severe  weather.Upset  over  the  decision,  some  students  attacked  her  with  racial  and  gender  slurs.  The  harsh  hashtag--  #f---phyllis  --  reinforced  notions  that  the  sexual  domination  and  objectification  of  women  are  still  major  problems  in  our  society  and  on  our  campuses.Would  the  students  have  engaged  in  attacks  on  gender  and  race  had  the  chancellor  been  a  white  man?  Somehow,  I  don't  think  so.There  was  no  respect  for  Wise's  position,  nor  her  credentials  --  but  her  high-visibility  job  made  her  stand  out.The  duality  of  being  hypervisible  and  simultaneously  invisible  is  the  latest  identity  quagmire  that  some  highly  accomplished  women  must  navigate.  They  are  hypervisible  because  they  are  often  the  only  one  of  a  few  in  their  position  --  thus,  they  stand  out.Yet  because  of  their  gender,  and  sometimes  their  race,  their  presence  is  not  the  norm,  and  others  are  not  used  to  seeing  them  in  these  roles.  Those  same  women  who  worked  hard  to  climb  the  ladder  to  success  sometimes  find  that  they  are  out  of  place  and  unwelcome,  rendering  them  invisible  in  certain  situations.It's  almost  as  if  they're  saying,  "I  see  you,  but  I  don't  respect  you  and  therefore  I'm  not  going  to  acknowledge  you  as  a  human  being."While  women  have  moved  into  positions  of  power,  they  have  not  moved  with  ease.It's  perplexing,  given  women's  accomplishments  over  the  decades,  that  it  continues  to  happen  50  years  after  the  1964  Civil  Rights  Act,  which  banned  employment  discrimination.But  it  is  also  not  new.  Pioneering  journalist  Ida  B.  Wells  was  threatened  with  murder  after  speaking  out  publicly  in  the  1890s.  She  became  hypervisible  after  she  criticized  the  lynching  of  black  men.  When  whites  ransacked  her  newspaper  office  with  the  intent  to  kill  her,  she  only  escaped  the  attempt  on  her  life  because  she  was  out  of  town.Today,  powerful,  public  women  are  not  usually  threatened  with  murder.  But  their  opinions  are  often  discounted,  disregarded  and  dismissed  --  or  they  are  personally  attacked.In  my  research  on  the  experiences  of  black  women  television  news  managers,  I  discovered  this  same  dichotomy.  On  the  one  hand,  these  executives  are  highly  recruited  for  their  production  and  management  skills.On  the  other  hand,  a  little  more  than  one-third  of  the  40  women  interviewed  described  feeling  invisible  in  editorial  meetings  where  their  ideas  were  not  always  given  full  credit  until  they  came  from  someone  else,  usually  a  white  man.This  rendering  of  women's  ideas  and  personhood  as  invisible  has  consequences.Psychologist  Derald  Wing  Sue  calls  these  subtle  and  not-so-subtle  snubs  "microaggressions"  and  says  they  can  lead  to  higher  stress  levels  and  more  illness.As  highly  accomplished  women  move  into  spaces  previously  reserved  for  men,  they  might  face  more  of  these  microagressions,  which  are  often  magnified  in  a  social  media,  Internet  age.As  college  classrooms  become  increasingly  female  with  more  students  of  color,  how  can  we  teach  that  hard  work  and  persistence  will  get  them  noticed,  when  the  truth  is,  it  might  simultaneously  render  them  invisible?How  do  we  stop  the  disrespect?First,  we  must  acknowledge  it  and  say  it's  wrong.  Silence  is  not  an  option.  This  is  what  Phyllis  Wise  did  when  she  wrote  an  essay  addressing  the  hateful  tweets.  "What  was  most  disturbing  was  witnessing  social  media  drive  a  discussion  quickly  into  the  abyss  of  hateful  comments  and  even  threats  of  violence,"  Wise  wrote  in  Inside  Higher  Ed.Secondly,  we  must  continuously  teach  that  the  disrespect  of  women  online  or  in  person  will  not  be  tolerated.  The  University  of  Illinois  example  reminds  us  that  if  cyberharassment  can  happen  to  a  woman  as  highly  accomplished  as  Wise,  all  women  are  vulnerable.  There  is  an  urgent  need  to  educate.Lastly,  we  must  continue  to  see  ourselves  as  leaders,  regardless  of  whether  others  are  used  to  seeing  us  in  that  role.Only  when  women  in  positions  of  power  become  the  norm  will  they  be  able  to  fully  exercise  that  power.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Ava  Thompson  Greenwell.</TEXT></DOC>

She  is  a  nationally  syndicated  columnist,  an  adjunct  professor  at  Georgetown  University  and  author  of  "Cooking  With  Grease:  Stirring  the  Pots  in  America."  She  was  manager  for  the  Gore-Lieberman  presidential  campaign  in  2000.(CNN)  --  Time  has  changed.  In  fact,  most  of  the  country  just  moved  an  hour  forward.The  time  change  coincides  with  the  conclusion  of  the  2014  Conservative  Political  Action  Conference,  known  as  CPAC.  The  activists  attending  the  conference  are  the  Republican  Party's  shock  troops,  but  some  Republican  strategists  don't  want  them  to  shock  mainstream  voters  this  fall.Still,  the  gathering  proved  somewhat  of  a  litmus  test  for  a  schizophrenic  conservative  base  trying  to  figure  out  where  it  stands  as  the  2014  midterms  approach,  all  the  while  struggling  with  change  in  a  country  that  is  changing  quite  rapidly.It  tells  you  something  that  one  of  the  biggest  applause  lines  of  CPAC  wasn't  even  an  applause  line.  It  occurred  when  Republican  Senate  Leader  Mitch  McConnell  held  a  rifle  on  stage.  (The  rifle  was  presented  to  Sen.  Tom  Coburn.)It  also  tells  you  something  that  New  Jersey  Gov.  Chris  Christie  was  invited  to  CPAC  this  year,  now  that  he  is  embroiled  in  the  Bridgegate  scandal,  but  he  was  not  invited  last  year,  when  he  was  on  his  way  to  re-election  in  a  Democratic  state.It  seems  like  CPAC's  test  is  whether  you're  making  the  right  enemies.  If  the  mainstream  media  is  going  after  you,  then  CPAC  will  invite  you.Christie's  CPAC  speech  was  directed  to  the  conservative  Republican  base;  he  didn't  talk  beyond  them,  to  a  wider  audience,  as  he  did  last  year  when  he  was  running  for  re-election.  He  referred  repeatedly  to  his  anti-abortion  positions.  He  attacked  the  news  media  and  defended  the  Koch  brothers.But  in  between  the  back-slapping  and  pontificating  in  the  ballrooms  and  back  rooms  at  CPAC,  a  new  rift  emerged  inside  the  GOP.There  appears  to  be  a  real  division  and  a  real  debate  in  the  Republican  Party  between  the  isolationists  and  the  interventionists.  In  1952,  it  was  between  Sen.  Robert  Taft  and  Gen.  Dwight  Eisenhower.  That  debate  still  isn't  settled.In  order  for  President  Obama,  Hillary  Clinton  and  Joe  Biden  to  be  moderates,  they  just  have  to  present  themselves  between  the  extremes  of  Kentucky  Sen.  Rand  Paul's  isolationism  and  Florida  Sen.  Marco  Rubio's  hawkishness—the  difference  between  living  in  a  cave  or  conducting  ourselves  so  that  we're  in  need  of  one.And,  so  far,  the  conservatives  at  the  conference  seemed  to  be  picking  up  what  Paul  was  laying  down.  In  the  annual  CPAC  straw  poll,  Paul  appeared  to  be  as  popular  as  his  father,  former  Rep.  Ron  Paul,  was  in  2010.  Rand  Paul  won  31%  of  the  votes  this  year  (but  history  shows  CPAC  straw  polls  aren't  always  the  best  predictors  of  who  will  be  nominated).  Sen.  Ted  Cruz  of  Texas,  who  used  his  time  before  CPAC  to  imply  that  former  Republican  presidential  nominee  Bob  Dole  was  unprincipled,  got  11%.  Rubio,  who  came  in  second  in  2013,  took  a  nosedive  after  recommending  mild  reform  of  immigration  laws,  and  placed  seventh  with  6%.Cruz  clearly  displayed  a  tin  ear  and  a  lack  of  basic  humanity  by  attacking  "President  Bob  Dole"  as  a  failed  moderate  nominee,  now  that  Bob  Dole,  an  American  hero,  is  in  his  90s  and  out  of  politics.Cruz  is  clearly  running  against  the  Washington  Republican  establishment.  This  strategy  may  serve  him  well  until  the  point  in  the  primaries  when  establishment  figures  like  Karl  Rove  will  unleash  millions  in  negative  commercials,  the  likes  of  which  sank  Newt  Gingrich.Meanwhile,  Texas  Gov.  Rick  Perry  gave  a  pulse-quickening  speech  that  brought  the  crowd  to  its  feet.  Perry  praised  Republican  governors  and  hit  Washington,  saying,  "It  is  time  for  Washington  to  focus  on  the  few  things  the  Constitution  establishes  as  the  federal  government's  role.  ...  Defend  our  country,  provide  a  cogent  foreign  policy,  and  what  the  heck,  deliver  the  mail,  preferably  on  time  and  on  Saturdays."Perry  may  have  forgotten  that  the  Post  Office  has  been  independent  of  Congress  since  1971  and  is  run,  by  law,  as  a  "revenue  neutral"  (nonprofit)  agency.  He  also  apparently  forgot  the  clauses  "insure  domestic  tranquility"  and  "promote  for  the  general  welfare."  Perry  also  ignored  the  duties  of  Congress,  which  is  just  as  well.  The  third  branch  of  government  is,  by  political  strategy,  so  gridlocked  that  it  has  all  but  ceased  to  function.Perry's  emphasis  on  the  role  of  governors  underscores  the  political  reality  that  mayors,  governors  and  the  President  must  engage  in  executive  workarounds  for  this  nonfunctioning  Congress.The  Republican  Party  has  been  struggling  to  attract  minorities  for  decades.  The  party  was  trounced  by  the  Democrats,  who  in  2012  got  93%  of  the  African-American  vote,  73%  of  the  Asian  vote  and  71%  of  the  Hispanic  vote.  CPAC  held  a  panel  discussion  on  minority  outreach;  a  photo  10  minutes  into  the  event  embarrassingly  showed  row  upon  row  upon  row  of  empty  chairs.The  Republican  Party  did  poorly  in  its  outreach  to  female  voters  in  2012,  who  voted  55%  for  Obama  and  only  44%  for  Republican  Mitt  Romney.  In  2014,  at  CPAC,  attention  to  the  ladies  was  also  wanting.  Los  Angeles  Times  writer  Robin  Abcarian  took  a  challenge  from  CPAC's  chairman,  Al  Cardenas,  to  count  the  number  of  male  and  female  speakers  at  CPAC.  It  came  out  lopsidedly  for  the  men—by  78%.By  definition,  conservatives  struggle  with  change.  CPAC  was  proof  of  the  old  saying  that  "the  more  things  change,  the  more  they  stay  the  same."Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Donna  Brazile.</TEXT></DOC>

Authorities  seized  more  than  $2  million  worth  of  products  and  were  looking  at  bank  accounts  to  determine  the  size  of  the  enterprise.Law  enforcement  authorities  seized  four  tractor-trailers  filled  with  knockoff  health  products  from  five  locations  on  Long  Island  on  Thursday.A  manufacturer  described  the  operation  as  the  biggest  known  counterfeit  enterprise  in  the  United  States,  while  another  company  called  it  the  only  known  such  manufacturing  operation  in  the  country  for  its  products,  prosecutors  said.Malik  and  Mullick,  both  charged  with  felony  trademark  counterfeiting,  were  being  held  on  bond  of  $100,000  each,  the  district  attorney's  office  said.The  allegation  that  Malik  was  involved  with  his  brother's  business  are  "outlandish,"  said  Malik's  attorney,  Steve  Christiansen.Mullick's  attorney,  Michael  Brown,  did  not  return  calls  seeking  comment."Health  and  beauty  products  like  lip  balms,  oils,  shampoos  and  inhalers  are  highly  regulated  in  order  to  protect  consumers,  but  these  defendants  are  charged  with  going  around  those  protections  and  stealing  the  brands  of  major  corporations  that  comply  with  the  law,"  District  Attorney  Kathleen  Rice  said  in  the  statement.  "These  actions  can  endanger  the  public."The  fake  products  included  ChapStick,  Johnson's  Baby  Oil,  Vicks  VapoRub,  Vicks  Inhaler,  Vaseline  and  Always  sanitary  pads;  the  producers  of  the  real  products  include  major  international  brands  such  as  Johnson  &  Johnson,  Pfizer,  Procter  &  Gamble  and  Unilever,  prosecutors  said.Other  products,  including  over-the-counter  cold  medicines  and  painkillers,  also  were  recovered,  officials  said."We  encourage  consumers  to  be  cautious  about  buying  branded  goods  that  look  suspicious,  or  from  outlets  that  are  unfamiliar,"  Chris  Vuturo,  a  spokesman  for  Procter  &  Gamble,  said  in  a  statement.The  case  came  to  light  when  Valley  Stream  Fire  Department  officials  in  January  conducted  a  building  inspection  at  the  site  of  a  fire  a  year  earlier.  Nassau  County  Fire  Marshall  officials  took  samples  of  products  they  found  and  sent  them  to  the  manufacturers,  who  verified  the  counterfeits.Fire  department  officials  said  they  found  manufacturing  supplies  but  no  material  safety  data  sheets,  which  normally  accompany  these  supplies.The  brothers  are  accused  of  selling  the  products  to  distributors  who,  in  turn,  delivered  them  to  retailers  in  New  York,  Pennsylvania  and  Florida.  An  investigation  is  underway  to  determine  if  there  are  more  locations.The  prosecutor's  office  is  trying  to  determine  the  chemical  makeup  of  the  products  and  the  health  risks,  if  any,  associated  with  them.Authorities  gave  the  following  tips  to  identify  fakes:  Look  for  signs  such  as  strange  pictures  on  the  package  or  strange  colors  or  typeface.  Some  sophisticated  knockoffs  may  be  hard  to  detect,  but  the  price  may  be  atypically  low.  Counterfeits  will  not  have  the  same  quality  or  consistency  of  real  products.  Shop  at  established  and  trusted  stores,  which  are  likely  to  be  connected  to  legitimate  supply  chains.</TEXT></DOC>

Drawing  a  clearer  picture  of  doomed  Hunley  crew</TITLE><TIME>Fri,  14  Feb  2014  18:19:41  EST</TIME><ABSTRACT>One  investigative  tip  can  lead  to  another  --  and  another.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  One  investigative  tip  can  lead  to  another  --  and  another.Linda  Abrams,  a  genealogy  gumshoe,  went  to  Texas  to  match  handwriting  samples.  She  spent  a  couple  weeks  in  Kentucky  following  a  tip,  only  to  find  it  was  just  hearsay.  Over  the  years,  Germany  has  beckoned,  too.Such  are  the  destinations  of  the  forensic  genealogist  who  has  used  streetwise  skills  and  her  curiosity  to  dig  a  little  deeper  into  the  lives  of  the  eight-man  crew  of  the  legendary  H.L.  Hunley,  the  first  submarine  to  bring  down  an  enemy  ship.The  crew  didn't  live  to  tell  the  story.  The  Hunley  went  to  its  watery  tomb  within  an  hour  of  its  triumph  --  if  not  much  sooner.How  was  historic  Civil  War  submarine  lost?For  Abrams,  it's  a  world  of  win  some,  lose  some  and  tangling  with  seeming  dead  ends."I  don't  think  my  part  will  ever  be  done.  This  was  a  tough  case,"  says  Abrams,  who  lives  in  western  Massachusetts  and  has  worked  with  the  Hunley  Project  for  more  than  a  dozen  years.Just  how  tough?  Consider  this:--  Only  one  crew  member  on  the  Confederate  submarine  was  believed  to  have  had  children,  and  a  descendant  living  in  Georgia  has  little  source  material  about  him.--  Four  were  European-born.  (How  researchers  found  that  out  is  a  fascinating  tidbit).--  Only  one,  Joseph  Ridgaway,  has  been  positively  identified  through  DNA.--  There  are  no  known  photos  of  any  of  the  eight.Abrams  and  other  such  researchers  can't  afford  to  be  happy  with  what  is  "known"  about  an  individual.  In  the  Hunley's  case,  that  was  precious  little  when  they  began.  The  hunt  is  about  following  a  trail,  following  another  --  and  not  being  afraid  to  venture  into  a  rabbit  hole.The  genealogist  was  to  discuss  her  latest  findings  Saturday  evening  during  a  program  at  the  Warren  Lasch  Conservation  Center  in  North  Charleston,  South  Carolina.  Monday  marks  the  150th  anniversary  of  the  Hunley's  attack  during  the  Civil  War.The  lab  houses  the  Hunley,  which  has  been  undergoing  conservation  treatment  since  it  was  raised  a  few  miles  off  Charleston  in  2000.  It  also  has  facial  reconstructions  of  the  crew  and  summaries  of  what  is  known  about  each.Monday  evening,  a  memorial  service  on  the  tip  of  Sullivan's  Island  will  remember  the  13  men  who  died  that  night:  the  eight  on  the  Hunley  and  five  on  its  prey,  the  USS  Housatonic.True  romance,  or  just  a  fun  legend?Lt.  George  Dixon,  captain  of  the  Hunley,  typifies  ongoing  challenges  for  scientists  and  historians.A  gold  coin  and  a  diamond  ring  and  brooch  were  found  with  his  remains."Dixon  is  still  a  mystery.  Here  is  a  guy  making  a  mark  for  himself  in  the  world,  with  some  personal  wealth,"  says  Robert  Neyland,  head  of  underwater  archeology  for  the  Naval  History  and  Heritage  Command  and  former  director  of  the  Hunley  Project.  "Where  he  came  from,  and  his  family,  is  a  bit  of  mystery."Abrams  says  the  lieutenant  was  a  riverman  possibly  from  Pennsylvania  or  Ohio.She  spent  time  doing  research  in  Kentucky,  but  never  was  able  to  make  a  connection  to  a  tip  regarding  Dixon.  Today,  he  has  no  verified  descendants.What  he  does  have  is  a  story  that  has  become  a  legend  of  sorts.The  gold  coin  he  carried  to  his  doom  reportedly  was  given  as  a  charm  by  his  sweetheart,  Queenie  Bennett.  The  $20  piece  deflected  a  Union  bullet  during  the  Battle  of  Shiloh  and  saved  Dixon's  life.  He  had  the  reverse  side  of  the  talisman  engraved  with  the  words,  "My  life  Preserver."The  Bennett  story  has  never  been  proven;  a  supposed  photo  of  the  blond,  blue-eyed  Dixon  did  not  match  his  skull.  And  the  photo,  along  with  letters  about  the  supposed  relationship,  have  disappeared."Officially,  I  cannot  prove  or  disprove"  the  romantic  tale,  says  Kellen  Correia,  executive  director  of  the  Friends  of  the  Hunley.  "It  makes  for  a  really  good  story.  The  Hunley  is  one  of  those  (in  which)  you  cannot  pin  it  down."'That  leads  to  more  leads'Tests  on  the  well-preserved  skeletal  remains  showed  the  men  to  range  in  age  from  their  late  teens  to  mid-40s.  Some  had  teeth  that  bore  hallmarks  of  prolific  pipe  smoking."The  (Hunley)  Commission  was  sure  these  were  ...  Southern  boys  from  South  Carolina  and  Georgia,"  says  Abrams.Instead,  carbon  isotope  analysis  revealed  that  four  crew  members  were  from  Europe.  The  tests  showed  a  diet  rich  in  corn  for  the  Americans  and  a  wheat-based  diet  for  the  Europeans.Abrams,  who  also  does  contract  genealogical  research  for  the  U.S.  Army,  says  work  on  the  Hunley  provides  inspiration  and  motivation  to  fill  in  gaps  about  the  crew.  For  example,  two  members  --  Lumpkin  and  Miller  --  are  known  only  by  their  last  names.Experts  were  able  to  verify  the  identity,  and  correct  spelling  of  Joseph  Ridgaway's  uncommon  last  name,  through  careful  research  of  enlistment  papers  and  DNA  analysis.Abrams  learned  that  the  eastern  Maryland  sailor  had  two  sisters  buried  in  Pennsylvania.  After  permission  was  granted,  a  grave  was  exhumed  and  a  DNA  sample  was  taken  from  one  sister's  jawbone.  The  match  was  made.She  also  researched  two  men  from  a  German  artillery  unit  based  in  Charleston.  They  were  late  substitutes  on  the  Hunley  crew.The  genealogist  says  she  is  impressed  by  Dixon's  charisma  and  his  ability  to  recruit  crew  members  for  the  Hunley,  which  lost  13  men  in  previous  operations."He  was  really  gung-ho  and  believed  that  he  would  make  a  difference,  that  he  would  finally  have  success.  It  is  like  listening  to  a  new  boss  at  your  company  and  how  it  makes  you  feel."Her  research,  meanwhile,  goes  on."You  find  these  things  that  begin  to  create  a  picture,  a  story  of  these  guys,"  Abrams  says.  "And  then  that  leads  to  more  leads."North  Carolina-born  seaman  James  Wicks  is  the  only  Hunley  crew  member  known  to  marry  and  have  children.  Wicks  served  on  a  Union  vessel  before  jumping  ship  to  fight  for  the  South.Mary  Elizabeth  McMahon,  a  great-great  granddaughter  who  lives  in  suburban  Atlanta,  says  her  family,  unfortunately,  has  few  records  and  no  "personal  stories"  that  were  passed  down.Still,  she  takes  pride  in  the  dangerous  mission  Wicks  undertook  on  the  Hunley.  "This  was  very  risky  and  he  knew  it."McMahon  and  about  25  relatives  attended  the  April  2004  funeral  in  Charleston  for  the  eight,  who  are  buried  near  the  remains  of  the  two  Hunley  crews  that  died  in  previous  mishaps.Recognizing  sacrifice  of  those  who  wore  blue,  graySunrise  Presbyterian  Church,  on  Sullivan's  Island,  is  the  location  for  Monday  night's  memorial  service  for  those  who  died  on  the  Hunley  and  Housatonic.Breathtaking  views  from  the  sanctuary's  windows  include  Breach  Inlet,  where  the  Hunley  began  its  mission  on  February  17,  1864."What  is  really  unique  is  that  it  is  a  recognition  of  a  sacrifice  that  took  place  on  both  sides  of  the  conflict,"  says  the  Rev.  Vance  Polley.As  a  bell  is  tolled  for  each  victim,  a  carnation  will  be  handed  to  a  woman  dressed  in  black,  13  in  all,  representing  family  members  of  the  lost.Sitting  near  them  are  re-enactors  dressed  in  either  blue  or  gray.  A  group  of  submariners  from  recent  decades  participate  in  the  service,  linking  the  past  to  the  present."This  was  an  American  conflict  and  everyone  gathered  here  are  Americans.  One  of  the  great  themes  ...  is  that  we  are  making  sense  out  of  a  very  divisive  conflict,"  says  the  Rev.  Polley.Members  of  the  Confederate  Heritage  Trust  will  conduct  a  procession  --  led  by  bagpipers  --  from  the  church  to  the  inlet,  where  flowers  and  memorial  wreaths  are  placed  in  the  water."It  is  done  with  a  lot  of  dignity  and  with  honor,  for  both  crews,"  says  Gene  Patrick,  the  organization's  president.Piece  of  Civil  War  ironclad  brought  to  surfaceWhat  caused  the  HMS  Bounty  to  go  down?Booty  from  Blackbeard's  sunken  ship:  Five  huge  cannonsGhostly  underwater  art  gallery  breathes  new  life  to  sunken  ship</TEXT></DOC>

Just  after  the  attack  on  the  U.S.  compound,  Obama  administration  officials  said  the  violence  was  a  result  of  a  protest  over  a  controversial  film  about  Islam  made  by  an  American  --  a  claim  that  has  proved  to  be  untrue.While  this  investigation  focused  on  the  role  of  the  Defense  Department,  it  blames  the  Obama  administration  and  Secretary  of  State  Hillary  Clinton's  State  Department  for  failing  to  protect  the  compound  that  housed  U.S.  personnel.The  report  found:•  White  House  officials  failed  to  comprehend  or  ignored  the  dramatically  deteriorating  security  situation  in  Libya  and  the  growing  threat  to  U.S.  interests  in  the  region.•  U.S.  personnel  in  Benghazi  were  woefully  vulnerable  in  September  2012  because  there  was  no  intelligence  of  a  specific  "imminent"  threat  in  Libya,  and  the  State  Department,  which  has  primary  responsibility  for  diplomatic  security,  favored  a  reduction  of  Department  of  Defense  security  personnel  in  Libya  before  the  attack.•  Defense  Department  officials  believed  nearly  from  the  outset  of  violence  in  Benghazi  that  it  was  a  terrorist  attack  rather  than  a  protest  gone  awry.•  The  U.S.  military's  response  to  the  Benghazi  attack  was  severely  degraded  because  of  the  location  and  readiness  posture  of  U.S.  forces,  and  because  of  a  lack  of  clarity  about  how  the  terrorist  action  was  unfolding.•  Given  the  uncertainty  about  the  prospective  length  and  scope  of  the  attack,  military  commanders  did  not  take  all  possible  steps  to  prepare  for  a  more  extended  operation.•  There  was  no  "stand  down"  order  issued  to  U.S.  military  personnel  in  Tripoli  who  sought  to  join  the  fight  in  Benghazi.  However,  there  was  confusion  about  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  personnel.•  The  Department  of  Defense  is  working  to  correct  many  weaknesses  revealed  by  the  Benghazi  attack,  but  the  global  security  situation  is  still  deteriorating  and  military  resources  continue  to  decline.GOP  turns  new  fire  on  Clinton  after  Benghazi  report</TEXT></DOC>

Sam  Catlin  ("Breaking  Bad")  will  serve  as  executive  producer  and  showrunner,  while  Seth  Rogen  and  Evan  Goldberg  ("This  is  the  End")  will  executive  produce  and  write  the  pilot  draft.'Walking  Dead'  pranks  NYC  with  zombie  attacksSeth  Rogen  and  Evan  Goldberg  said  in  a  statement:  "This  is  amazing!  We've  tried  for  seven  years  to  work  on  'Preacher'  and  we're  so  psyched  AMC  is  finally  letting  us.  It  is  our  favorite  comic  of  all  time,  and  we're  going  to  do  everything  we  can  to  do  it  right.  Humperdoo!"AMC's  official  description:  "'Preacher'  follows  Reverend  Jesse  Custer,  a  tough  Texas  preacher  who  has  lost  his  faith,  has  learned  that  God  has  left  Heaven  and  abandoned  His  responsibilities.  He  finds  himself  the  only  person  capable  of  tracking  God  down,  demanding  answers,  and  making  Him  answer  for  His  dereliction  of  duty.  Accompanying  Jesse  on  his  journey  is  his  former  girlfriend  and  a  friendly  vampire  who  seems  to  prefer  a  pint  in  the  pub  to  the  blood  of  the  innocent.  On  his  tail  is  one  of  the  most  iconic  bad  guys  in  print  --  an  immortal,  unstoppable  killing  machine  named  the  Saint  of  Killers  --  a  western  lone  gunman  archetype  whose  sole  purpose  is  to  hunt  and  kill  Jesse."About  that  'Biggest  Loser'  winner's  weight  loss....Plus,  Ennis  gave  fans  a  lengthy  statement:  "Steve  Dillon  and  I  are  very  happy  to  see  'Preacher'  being  developed  for  TV,  which  seems  a  much  more  natural  home  for  the  story  than  a  two-hour  movie.  Between  them,  Sony  TV  and  AMC  have  brought  viewers  two  of  my  favorite  shows  with  'Breaking  Bad'  and  'Mad  Men,'  and  it's  exactly  that  kind  of  creative  commitment  and  courage  that  'Preacher'  needs.Obviously  it's  taken  a  while,  but  Ken  Levin  along  with  Neal  Moritz  and  his  team  refused  to  give  up,  long  after  the  point  when  I  myself  grew  skeptical,  and  their  unrelenting  enthusiasm  for  the  project  has  gotten  us  where  we  need  to  be.  I'm  particularly  impressed  that  Seth  Rogen,  Evan  Goldberg  and  Sam  Catlin  understand  'Preacher'  fully  —  meaning  they  get  it  for  what  it  is,  not  some  vague  approximation.  All  in  all,  it  looks  like  'Preacher'  can  now  be  brought  to  TV  in  a  way  that  I'd  previously  not  have  thought  possible,  and  I  very  much  appreciate  that  Steve  and  I  have  been  included  in  the  conversation  in  the  way  that  we  have."See  the  original  story  at  EW.com.CLICK  HERE  to  Try  2  RISK  FREE  issues  of  Entertainment  Weekly©  2011  Entertainment  Weekly  and  Time  Inc.

Stacey  Abrams  is  the  House  minority  leader  for  the  Georgia  General  Assembly.  James  Richardson  is  a  conservative  communications  strategist  in  Atlanta  and  a  former  spokesman  and  adviser  to  the  Republican  National  Committee  and  former  Govs.  Haley  Barbour  of  Mississippi  and  Jon  Huntsman  of  Utah.(CNN)  --  Georgia  --  with  its  tumultuous  past  of  discrimination  --  is  following  Arizona's  recently  failed  attempt  to  pass  what  amounts  to  anti-gay  legislation  with  the  Preservation  of  Religious  Freedom  Act.The  state  may  shift  from  the  cradle  of  the  civil  rights  movement  to  the  vanguard  of  legalized  21st-century  bigotry  with  the  consideration  of  this  legislation,  modeled  on  Arizona's,  that  would  allow  businesses  to  refuse  service  to  gay  and  lesbian  customers  on  the  basis  of  alleged  religious  conviction.The  measure,  whose  fringe  supporters  contend  is  couched  in  the  First  Amendment,  would  provide  a  legal  avenue  for  business  operators  to  ignore  existing  local  nondiscrimination  protections  that  even  "indirectly  inhibit"  the  "free  exercise"  of  their  faith.Like  the  controversial  Arizona  bill,  this  broadly  written  proposal  has  profound  implications  --  not  only  for  the  aggrieved  minority  it  would  directly  affect  but  also  for  the  social  reputation  of  the  state  at  large.  Those  implications  will  permanently  stain  us,  cementing  the  lasting  ignominy  of  Jim  Crow.One  of  us  is  the  Democratic  leader  of  the  Georgia  House  of  Representatives  and  the  other  an  adviser  to  two  conservative  Republican  governors  and  national  party  committees.  Despite  our  policy  disagreements,  we're  both  Georgians,  and  we  stand  together  in  opposition  to  these  bills.The  fact  that  we  can  overcome  our  severe  political  differences  and  agree  that  this  legislation  would  be  wrong  and  bad  for  the  state  demonstrates  the  growing  bipartisan  opposition  to  legislation  of  this  sort.Two  bills  exist,  one  in  each  chamber:  Boosters  of  the  House  measure,  House  Bill  1023,  have  soft-pedaled  the  issue,  but  the  sponsor  of  the  Senate  proposal,  Senate  Bill  377,  griped  this  week  that  the  only  opponents  to  his  legislation  are  those  advocating  "militant  atheism,"  whatever  that  is.As  written,  the  Senate  bill  doesn't  carve  out  narrow  exemptions  for  wedding  vendors  but  instead  extends  the  blanket  conscience  provision  to  all  commercial  quarters.Not  only  could  restaurateurs  and  hoteliers  turn  away  same-sex  couples,  but  pharmacists  could  deny  life-saving  therapy  to  HIV-positive  patients.  The  legislation  is  so  vague  that  it's  not  merely  limited  to  individuals  who  are  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual  and  transgender:  It  could  even  be  used  as  a  means  to  discriminate  against  unmarried  women  and  people  of  different  faiths.Those  possibilities  are  frightening,  but  the  economic  consequences  are  no  less  serious.Georgia,  like  much  of  the  Southeast,  is  still  struggling  to  reinvent  its  modest  economy  after  it  collapsed  from  an  overdependence  on  housing  and  real  estate.  Every  job,  every  dollar  of  out-of-state  investment  matters.  We  have  no  such  luxury  of  chasing  Yankee  business  from  our  borders.And  yet  that's  precisely  what  this  legislation  would  accomplish.In  Arizona,  respected  companies  such  as  Apple  and  American  Airlines  warned  they  would  withdraw  investments  from  the  state  should  the  law  take  effect.  Gov.  Jan  Brewer  must  have  taken  this  into  consideration  in  her  veto.Anti-gay  legislation  of  this  order  is  a  significant  social  barometer  for  the  young  professionals  and  innovators  on  whom  businesses  rely.  If  they  deem  the  state  hostile  to  mainstream  sensibilities,  neither  will  come.Georgia's  proposal  would  repel  the  creative  class  in  a  way  few  other  factors  could  --  except  maybe  our  recent  experiences  with  snowstorms  and  20  hours  in  a  frigid  car.  In  the  same  way,  the  law  would  spook  out-of-state  firms  weighing  a  move  to  Georgia.But  even  worse  than  new  business  avoiding  the  state  is  the  real  prospect  of  existing  major  companies  bailing.  Delta  Air  Lines,  one  of  Georgia's  largest  employers,  on  Tuesday  strongly  denounced  the  measure  and  warned  it  would  "result  in  job  losses."That's  a  proposition  Georgia  can  ill  afford.Central  to  the  American  ethos  is  the  promise  of  freedom,  the  protection  of  which  is  an  appropriate  function  of  the  legislature.  But  freedom  is  a  universal  shelter,  swaddling  each  American  the  same  as  the  next  no  matter  his  or  her  color,  creed  or  sexual  orientation.No  weary  driver  nor  hungry  belly  would  want  to  be  denied  a  hotel  room  or  hot  meal  on  the  basis  of  immutable  characteristics  or  faith,  but  that's  what  the  Georgia  bill  would  allow.  The  notion  is  distinctly  un-American  and  we,  Republican  and  Democrat  together,  don't  want  that  in  our  state.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  the  writers.</TEXT></DOC>

Share  your  images  and  stories  with  CNN  iReport,  but  only  if  it  is  safe  to  do  so.Atlanta  (CNN)  --  The  message  in  portions  of  Alabama,  Georgia  and  the  Carolinas  as  an  ice  storm  swept  through  Wednesday  was  simple:  Get  off  the  roads,  and  stay  off.The  warnings  came  as  freezing  rain  brought  heavy  ice  accumulations  from  Atlanta  to  Charlotte,  where  some  of  the  Southeast's  most  populous  cities  were  at  a  standstill.  Hundreds  of  thousands  were  without  power,  and  thousands  of  flights  were  canceled.Calling  ice  the  biggest  enemy  of  the  South,  Georgia  Gov.  Nathan  Deal  ordered  schools  canceled  and  government  offices  shuttered  in  an  attempt  to  avoid  a  repeat  of  a  storm  last  month  that  paralyzed  the  city.Up  to  three-quarters  of  an  inch  of  ice  was  expected  to  accumulate  in  Atlanta  and  up  to  10  inches  of  snow  and  sleet  in  Charlotte,  making  travel  treacherous.While  most  of  the  major  thoroughfares  in  and  out  of  the  city  of  Atlanta  were  reportedly  devoid  of  traffic,  a  different  scene  was  playing  out  to  the  northeast  where  the  storm  moved  in  faster  than  expected."Stay  home,  if  you  can,"  North  Carolina's  Department  of  Public  Safety  said  in  posts  on  Twitter.  "Quickly  deteriorating  road  conditions,  numerous  car  accidents  in  Durham/Franklin/Johnston/Wake  counties."For  some,  there  just  wasn't  enough  time.Michael  Crosswhite,  44,  planned  on  leaving  work  in  Raleigh,  in  Wake  County,  by  midafternoon,  well  ahead  of  when  forecasters  initially  predicted  a  snow  and  ice  storm  to  hit  the  area.But  by  noon,  the  snow  and  icy  rain  was  coming  down.'Nothing  you  can  do  but  hope  you  don't  get  stuck'"We  just  passed  an  18-wheeler  that  spun  out  into  a  ditch,"  he  said  by  telephone  more  than  two  hours  into  his  journey  home  to  Durham,  a  trip  that  typically  takes  less  than  30  minutes.Moments  later,  a  car  ahead  of  him  spun  out  in  front  of  him."It's  kind  of  slushy,  and  there  are  just  icy  spots  that  there  is  nothing  you  can  do  but  hope  you  don't  get  stuck,"  Crosswhite  said.With  the  impression  the  storm  would  hit  Raleigh  later  in  the  day,  Deanna  Hunt  ran  out  to  an  appointment.  By  the  time  she  left,  it  was  "snow  chaos."Four  hours  later,  she  was  still  trying  to  get  home.  "It  just  came  down  so  fast  and  so  furious,"  she  said  on  CNN's  "The  Situation  Room."Track  the  stormIn  Atlanta,  a  city  shut  down  by  2.6  inches  of  snow  two  weeks  ago,  it  appeared  the  thousands  of  commuters,  some  of  whom  had  spent  up  to  20  hours  stuck  on  highways  then,  had  learned  their  lessons.Deal  applauded  Atlantans  who  kept  the  roads  clear,  saying  during  a  midday  news  conference,  "That's  a  good  starting  point."Even  so,  there  were  thousands  without  power  across  the  state  after  ice  caused  tree  limbs  to  snap,  knocking  out  power  lines.With  temperatures  below  freezing,  the  National  Guard  opened  up  35  armories  across  the  state  to  be  used  as  shelters  and  warming  centers,  CNN  affiliate  WSB-TV  reported.The  Red  Cross,  meanwhile,  reported  more  than  hundreds  sought  shelter  overnight  at  its  facilities  stretching  from  Louisiana  to  North  Carolina.In  North  Carolina,  Kim  Martin  Rehberg's  typical  25-minute  commute  was  turning  into  an  hours  long  ordeal  Wednesday  as  she  tried  to  make  it  from  her  office  in  Durham  to  her  home  in  Raleigh.Three  hours  later,  she  still  had  miles  to  go.  So,  too,  did  the  rest  of  her  family  who  were  stuck  in  traffic  across  the  region."My  daughter  was  stranded  trying  to  get  from  her  gymnastics  class  in  Apex.  My  ex-husband  is  trying  to  her  and  he  got  trapped,"  she  said  by  telephone,  referring  to  a  Raleigh  suburb."My  husband  is  in  Charlotte  and  says  things  are  bad.  All  the  gas  stations  are  shutting  down,  and  I  had  trouble  trying  to  gas  up."'Our  own  trucks  are  stuck'There  are  snowplows  on  the  roads  but  "unfortunately  some  of  our  own  trucks  are  stuck  in  the  same  traffic  jams  that  a  lot  of  other  people  are  and  they're  having  a  hard  time  getting  to  the  roads  that  need  to  be  cleared,"  said  Dan  Howe,  Raleigh's  assistant  city  manager.Stephanie  Mouzon,  who  was  one  of  the  lucky  ones.  She  made  it  to  her  home  in  Garner,  North  Carolina,  after  more  than  two  hours.Now  the  48-year-old  plans  to  hunker  down  at  her  home  and  ride  out  the  storm."When  I  got  here,  I  was  like  'Thank  you,  Jesus,'"  she  said.  "I'm  not  going  anywhere  now."The  low-pressure  weather  system  bringing  the  snow  and  ice  to  the  Southeast  is  expected  to  move  up  the  East  Coast,  dropping  snow  on  the  Northeast.  Six  to  8  inches  are  predicted  for  Washington,  with  especially  heavy  snowfall  Thursday  morning,  and  6  to  10  inches  on  New  York  from  midnight  Wednesday  into  Thursday,  with  a  combination  of  snow,  sleet  and  rain  continuing  until  Friday  morning.New  York  Gov.  Andrew  M.  Cuomo  told  state  agencies  to  prepare  "for  an  impending  nor'easter"  and  asked  residents  to  avoid  unnecessary  travel.National  Weather  Service  forecasters  say  the  storm  --  packed  with  sleet,  snow,  rain  and  ice  --  is  a  potentially  "catastrophic  event."In  Georgia,  more  than  400  members  of  the  National  Guard  were  deployed  for  weather  duty,  and  about  100  each  for  the  Carolinas  and  Alabama.The  storm  has  led  the  Red  Cross  to  cancel  more  than  1,000  blood  drives,  resulting  in  a  shortage.  Anyone  able  to  give  blood  can  contact  the  Red  Cross  at  redcrossblood.org  or  by  calling  1-800-RED  CROSS.Power  outagesMore  than  480,000  customers  were  without  power  in  the  Southeast,  roughly  136,000  of  which  were  Georgia  Power  Co.  customers,  the  utility  said.South  Carolina  was  the  hardest  hit,  with  about  220,000  customers  without  electricity,  while  Wilmington,  North  Carolina,  accounted  for  more  than  58,000  outages.The  utilities  said  Wednesday  morning  they  expect  those  numbers  to  rise  over  the  next  24  hours.Georgia  Power,  the  state's  largest  utility,  warned  that  hundreds  of  thousands  could  be  without  electricity  for  days."This  has  the  opportunity  to  be  a  huge  event  when  you're  talking  about  the  amount  of  ice  you're  looking  at,"  Aaron  Strickland,  Georgia  Power's  emergency  operations  chief,  told  reporters.The  utility  staged  fleets  of  trucks  across  the  area.  Teams  from  Florida,  Texas  and  Ohio  bolstered  local  line  crews.It's  not  the  snow,  it's  the  iceClosings  and  cancellationsThroughout  the  Southeast,  hundreds  of  businesses,  churches,  government  offices  and  school  systems  were  closed  because  of  the  weather.Among  the  cities  with  lengthy  lists  of  closings  were  Atlanta;  Nashville;  Birmingham,  Alabama;  Baton  Rouge,  Louisiana;  Charleston  and  Columbia,  South  Carolina;  Memphis,  Tennessee;  Little  Rock,  Arkansas;  and  Charlotte.All  Georgia  government  offices  will  be  closed  Thursday  as  well,  the  governor  said.In  Atlanta,  the  U.S.  Women's  National  Team  postponed  a  soccer  match  with  Russia  set  for  Wednesday.  The  game  was  moved  to  7:30  p.m.  Thursday.Transportation  woesThe  storm  system  also  was  taking  its  toll  on  travel.Stir-crazy?  How  to  stay  saneAmtrak  suspended  some  rail  service  in  the  Northeast,  South  and  Mid-Atlantic  regions  for  Wednesday.Nationwide,  more  than  3,100  flights  were  canceled,  according  to  FlightAware.com;  more  than  1,600  of  the  2,500  scheduled  departures  and  arrivals  at  Atlanta's  Hartsfield-Jackson  International  Airport  were  among  the  cancellations.Charlotte  Douglas  International  and  Raleigh-Durham  International  airports  accounted  for  the  majority  of  other  flights  canceled.Road  conditionsGeorgia's  Department  of  Transportation  put  crews  on  12-hours  shifts  to  salt,  sand  and  scrape  the  roadways.Deal  said  the  state  has  brought  in  an  additional  180  tons  of  salt  and  sand,  and  he  urged  Georgian  not  to  put  themselves  "in  jeopardy  or  danger."Why  not  put  power  lines  underground?South  Carolina  Gov.  Nikki  Haley  dispatched  additional  Highway  Patrol  officers  to  help  with  the  expected  accidents  and  stranded  motorists  on  state  highways,  her  office  announced.Deadly  tollAt  least  nine  deaths  have  been  blamed  on  the  weather,  including  two  people  who  were  killed  in  Georgia  and  two  who  died  in  North  Carolina,  authorities  said.In  Texas,  three  people  died  when  an  ambulance  driver  lost  control  on  an  icy  patch  of  road  outside  of  Carlsbad.The  ambulance  slid  off  the  roadway  into  a  ditch,  where  it  rolled  over,  caught  fire  and  burned,  the  Texas  Department  of  Public  Safety  said.  A  patient,  a  paramedic  and  another  passenger  were  pronounced  dead  at  the  scene."If  you  get  even  a  10th  of  inch  of  ice  on  a  road,  it's  like  a  skating  rink,"  said  Kurt  Van  Speybroeck,  a  National  Weather  Service  meteorologist  in  Dallas.In  Mississippi,  authorities  blamed  the  storm  for  two  traffic  deaths.Travelers  get  another  winter  wallopCNN's  Ed  Payne,  Tom  Watkins,  Steve  Almasy,  Stephanie  Gallman,  Carma  Hassan,  Dave  Alsup  and  Sean  Morris  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

But  discussions  are  under  way  on  making  it  easier  to  export  U.S.  natural  gas  to  Europe,  as  well  as  on  other  trade  issues,  he  said.Russia's  intervention  in  Ukraine's  Crimea  region  has  sparked  the  biggest  East-West  confrontation  since  the  end  of  the  Cold  War.And  at  a  later  speech  in  Brussels,  Obama  said  Russia's  annexation  of  Crimea  must  be  met  with  condemnation  --  "not  because  we're  trying  to  keep  Russia  down,  but  because  the  principles  that  have  meant  so  much  to  Europe  and  the  world  must  be  upheld."Meanwhile,  Moscow's  massing  of  troops  near  Ukraine's  eastern  borders  has  worried  the  interim  government  in  Kiev  and  caused  ripples  of  concern  in  other  former  Soviet  republics  that  now  belong  to  the  EU  and  NATO.NATO's  top  commander  has  voiced  worries  that  Russian  troops  could  roll  into  Moldova's  separatist  region  Transnistria,  on  the  opposite  side  of  Ukraine,  and  Russia  fought  a  brief  war  with  the  former  Soviet  republic  of  Georgia  about  five  years  ago.Russia  gearing  up  for  next  move,  U.S.  saysA  new  U.S.  intelligence  assessment  concludes  that  a  Russian  incursion  into  eastern  Ukraine  is  more  likely  than  previously  thought,  CNN  has  learned.  U.S.  officials  believe  the  Russian  buildup  gives  Moscow  the  ability  to  move  rapidly  into  Ukraine  without  the  United  States  being  able  to  predict  it  when  it  happens.Two  Obama  administration  officials  described  the  classified  assessment  to  CNN  but  declined  to  be  identified  due  to  the  sensitive  nature  of  the  information.  The  officials  emphasize  that  nothing  is  certain,  but  in  the  last  three  to  four  days,  there  have  been  several  worrying  signs."This  has  shifted  our  thinking  that  the  likelihood  of  a  further  Russian  incursion  is  more  probable  than  it  was  previously  thought  to  be,"  one  official  said.  The  Russian  buildup  is  reminiscent  of  Moscow's  military  moves  before  it  went  into  Chechnya  and  Georgia  in  both  the  number  of  units  and  their  capabilities,  the  official  said.Crimea  is  currently  separated  from  the  rest  of  Russia  by  a  strait  that  links  the  Black  Sea  and  the  Sea  of  Azov.  U.S.  officials  believe  Russia  might  decide  to  go  into  eastern  Ukraine  to  establish  a  land  bridge  into  the  territory  by  moving  toward  the  Ukrainian  cities  of  Kharkiv,  Luhansk  and  Donetska.Russian  forces  are  currently  positioned  in  and  around  Rostov,  Kursk  and  Belgorod,  according  to  U.S.  intelligence  information.  The  estimated  30,000  troops  are  "significantly  more"  than  what  is  needed  for  the  military  exercises  Russia  says  it  has  been  conducting,  and  there  is  no  sign  the  troops  are  making  any  move  to  return  to  their  home  bases.They  include  large  numbers  of  motorized  units  that  are  capable  of  moving  quickly,  and  additional  contingents  --  special  forces,  airborne  troops,  air  transport  --  appear  to  be  at  a  higher  state  of  mobilization  in  other  locations  in  Russia,  according  to  the  intelligence  assessment.Additional  intelligence  suggests  that  more  Russian  forces  are  "reinforcing"  the  border  region,  according  to  both  Obama  administration  officials.  Russian  troops  already  in  the  border  region  include  air  defense  artillery  and  wheeled  vehicles,  and  all  the  troops  are  positioned  for  potential  military  action.U.S.  military  and  intelligence  officials  have  been  briefing  Congress  on  the  new  assessment.  As  a  result,  Republican  members  of  the  House  Armed  Services  Committee  late  Wednesday  sent  a  classified  letter  to  the  White  House  expressing  concern  about  unfolding  developments.An  unclassified  version  obtained  by  CNN  says  committee  members  feel  "urgency  and  alarm,  based  on  new  information  in  the  committee's  possession."  The  committee  says  there  is  "deep  apprehension  that  Moscow  may  invade  eastern  and  southern  Ukraine,  pressing  west  to  (Transnistria)  and  also  seek  land  grabs  in  the  Baltics."Gen.  Philip  Breedlove,  head  of  the  U.S.  European  Command  and  military  chief  of  NATO,  noted  the  Russians  had  sufficient  forces  to  move  into  Moldova.  But  Obama  warned  Russia  on  Wednesday  that  it  faces  a  united  front  in  the  West.'Serious  consequences'Speaking  alongside  Obama,  European  Council  President  Herman  Van  Rompuy  also  struck  a  note  of  unity,  saying  Europe  and  the  United  States  "have  a  strong  and  coordinated  position"  on  Ukraine.Russia's  annexation  of  Crimea  is  "a  disgrace  in  the  21st  century,  and  we  will  not  recognize  it,"  he  said.Europe  also  stands  by  Georgia  and  Moldova,  Van  Rompuy  said,  and  has  brought  forward  the  signing  of  association  documents  with  them  to  June,  bringing  the  prospect  of  closer  ties  to  Europe.Jose  Manuel  Barroso,  president  of  the  European  Commission,  said  the  United  States  and  EU  "are  working  together  to  make  sure  that  actions  that  are  unacceptable  will  bear  serious  consequences."Russia  insists  its  actions  are  legitimate  and  denies  having  used  its  armed  forces  in  Crimea,  saying  the  troops  that  took  control  of  key  installations  there  were  local  "self-defense"  forces.Russia  also  insists  the  government  in  Kiev  is  illegitimate  because  ousted  President  Viktor  Yanukovych,  a  close  ally  of  Moscow's,  was  forced  out  in  an  armed  coup.  Yanukovych's  ouster  followed  months  of  street  protests  sparked  by  his  decision  to  ditch  an  EU  trade  deal  in  favor  of  closer  ties  to  Russia.In  an  interview  Tuesday  with  PBS,  acting  Prime  Minister  Arseniy  Yatsenyuk  said  Ukraine  is  struggling  to  maintain  a  fighting  capability  after  it  was  "deliberately  dismantled"  under  Yanukovych.  He  said  his  government  ceded  Crimea  without  a  shot  to  demonstrate  to  the  world  that  Russia  was  the  aggressor,  he  said.  But  if  Moscow  moves  against  another  portion  of  Ukraine,  "We  will  fight."Moscow  tightens  gripThe  United  States  and  EU  are  seeking  to  exert  pressure  on  Russia  through  a  combination  of  sanctions  and  diplomatic  isolation.An  EU-Russia  summit  has  been  canceled,  and  the  G7  group  of  leading  industrialized  countries  has  excluded  Russia  from  what  was  the  G8.  The  G7  will  meet  in  June  in  Brussels,  instead  of  attending  a  planned  G8  summit  in  the  Russian  city  of  Sochi.But  Moscow  has  so  far  doggedly  pursued  its  own  course,  even  as  Western  leaders  have  denounced  its  actions  as  violations  of  Ukraine's  sovereignty  and  a  breach  of  international  law.Russia  has  cited  the  need  to  protect  ethnic  Russians  within  Ukraine  from  ultra-nationalists  and  "fascists"  as  a  justification  for  intervention  on  Ukrainian  soil.Hundreds  of  supporters  and  paramilitary  militia  members  came  out  into  the  streets  of  Ukraine's  western  city  of  Rivne  on  Wednesday  as  a  funeral  was  held  for  a  prominent  far-right  activist,  Oleksandr  Muzychko,  better  known  as  Sashko  Biliy.He  was  killed  late  Monday  in  what  the  Ukrainian  Interior  Ministry  said  was  a  shootout  with  police  in  Rivne.  Ukrainian  lawmaker  Oleksandr  Doniy,  whose  constituency  is  in  Rivne,  gave  a  different  version  of  events,  saying  the  activist  was  dragged  into  a  car  and  then  shot.Muzychko,  a  leader  of  Right  Sector,  a  far-right  group  prominent  in  the  recent  anti-government  protests,  was  wanted  "for  his  criminal  background  and  illegal  carrying  of  weapons,"  the  ministry  said.Amid  the  heightened  tensions,  the  Russian  Foreign  Ministry  on  Wednesday  accused  the  Ukrainian  border  service  of  refusing  to  let  air  crew  off  Aeroflot  jets  for  rest  periods  after  landing  in  Ukraine.  Aeroflot  is  the  Russian  national  carrier.This  "breaks  the  international  acts  in  compliance  with  flight  safety  requirements,"  the  ministry  said  in  an  online  statement.Crimea,  Russia  tiesCrimea  belonged  to  Russia  until  1954,  when  it  was  given  to  Ukraine,  which  was  then  part  of  the  Soviet  Union.  The  region  has  a  majority  ethnic  Russian  population  and  other  historic  ties  to  Russia.A  large  majority  of  its  population  voted  in  favor  of  joining  Russia  in  a  controversial  referendum  10  days  ago.  Russian  lawmakers  in  turn  swiftly  voted  to  absorb  the  Black  Sea  peninsula,  where  Russia  has  a  major  naval  base,  into  the  Russian  Federation,  and  President  Vladimir  Putin  signed  the  treaty  into  law.Is  Russia  done  after  Crimea?Opinion:  How  Obama  can  save  the  dayCNN  Money:  Recession  warning  for  RussiaCNN's  Barbara  Starr,  Marie-Louise  Gumuchian,  Victoria  Butenko,  Alexander  Felton,  Radina  Gigova  and  Boriana  Milanova  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

That  question  will  be  weighed  at  a  court  hearing  Friday.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Fort  Worth,  Texas  (CNN)  --  A  Texas  judge  ordered  a  Fort  Worth  hospital  on  Friday  to  remove  a  pregnant,  brain-dead  woman  from  respirators  and  ventilators.Judge  R.H.  Wallace  ordered  John  Peter  Smith  Hospital  to  act  on  his  order  by  5  p.m.  Monday.  The  hospital  could  appeal  or  decide  to  remove  Marlise  Munoz  from  a  ventilator  and  respirator  before  that  deadline.Erick  Munoz,  her  husband,  broke  down  in  tears  after  Wallace  ruled.  He  and  other  family  members  had  been  fighting  the  hospital  so  the  body  could  be  released  to  them  for  burial.The  judge  did  not  rule  on  the  constitutionality  of  a  law  regarding  the  treatment  of  a  pregnant  patient.A  breakthrough  came  when  the  hospital  and  the  Munoz  family  agreed  on  crucial  facts  listed  in  a  court  document:  that  Marlise  Munoz  has  "met  the  clinical  criteria  for  brain  death  since  November  28"  and  that  "the  fetus  gestating  inside  Mrs.  Munoz  is  not  viable."The  woman's  husband  repeatedly  made  these  claims  in  his  efforts  to  have  her  removed  from  the  machines.The  wrenching  story  started  with  a  pregnant  woman  found  unconscious  on  her  kitchen  floor.  In  the  more  than  eight  weeks  since  then,  lying  supine  in  a  hospital  bed,  the  33-year-old  became  the  focus  of  an  intense,  emotional  debate  about  who  is  alive,  who  is  dead,  and  how  the  presence  of  a  fetus  possibly  changes  the  equation.Hospital  spokesman  J.R.  Labbe  said  last  month  that  doctors  were  simply  trying  to  obey  a  Texas  law  that  says  "you  cannot  withhold  or  withdraw  life-sustaining  treatment  for  a  pregnant  patient."But  to  Erik  Munoz,  she  was  not  a  patient  because  she  was  not  alive.He  and  other  family  members  said  the  hospital  should  abide  by  her  wishes  --  which  weren't  written  down  but,  they  said,  relayed  verbally  to  them  --  and  not  have  machines  keep  her  organs  and  blood  running.Erick  Munoz  contended  doctors  told  him  his  wife  "had  lost  all  activity  in  her  brain  stem"  and  an  accompanying  chart  stated  that  she  was  "brain  dead."  He  has  further  called  her  "nothing  more  than  an  empty  shell"  who  should  be  left  to  rest  in  peace.Mom  of  pregnant  woman:  Change  the  lawIn  an  affidavit  filed  Thursday  in  court,  Erick  Munoz  said  little  to  him  now  is  recognizable  about  Marlise.  Her  bones  crack  when  her  stiff  limbs  move.  Her  usual  scent  has  been  replaced  by  the  "smell  of  death."  And  her  once  lively  eyes  have  become  "soulless.""Over  these  past  two  months,  nothing  about  my  wife  indicates  she  is  alive,"  Erick  Munoz  said.  "...  What  sits  in  front  of  me  is  a  deteriorating  body."Husband:  'Obscene  mutilation  of  a  deceased  body'The  couple,  two  trained  paramedics,  had  been  awaiting  the  arrival  of  their  second  child.Everything  came  crashing  down  around  2  a.m.  November  26,  when  she  was  rushed  to  the  north-central  Texas  hospital.Once  there,  Erick  Munoz  said,  he  was  told  his  wife  "was  for  all  purposes  brain  dead."  The  family  also  says  the  fetus  may  have  been  deprived  of  oxygen.Lawyers:  Records  back  claim  that  woman  is  brain  deadIn  his  lawsuit,  Munoz  claims  subsequent  measures  taken  at  the  hospital  --  and,  in  turn,  the  state  law  used  to  justify  them  --  amounted  "to  nothing  more  than  the  cruel  and  obscene  mutilation  of  a  deceased  body  against  the  expressed  will  of  the  deceased  and  her  family."The  family's  attorneys  more  recently  said  that  Marlise's  fetus  "is  distinctly  abnormal,"  suffering  from  hydrocephalus  and  "deformed  to  the  extent  that  the  gender  cannot  be  determined.""Quite  sadly,  this  information  is  not  surprising  due  to  the  fact  that  the  fetus,  after  being  deprived  of  oxygen  for  an  indeterminate  length  of  time,  is  gestating  within  a  dead  and  deteriorating  body,  as  a  horrified  family  looks  on  in  absolute  anguish,  distress  and  sadness,"  attorneys  Jessica  Janicek  and  Heather  King  said  in  a  statement.The  hospital  and  the  Tarrant  County  District  Attorney's  Office,  which  said  it  will  defend  the  medical  facility,  did  not  offer  the  same  level  of  detail  as  members  of  the  Munoz  family.But  earlier  this  month,  Labbe  told  CNN  that  his  hospital  believed  "the  courts  are  the  appropriate  venue  to  provide  clarity,  direction  and  resolution  in  this  matter."Late  Friday,  the  hospital  issued  this  statement:  "JPS  Health  Network  appreciates  the  potential  impact  of  the  consequences  of  the  order  on  all  parties  involved  and  will  be  consulting  with  the  Tarrant  County  District  Attorney's  office."When  life  support  is  really  'death  support'CNN's  Ed  Lavandera  and  Josh  Rubin  reported  from  Fort  Worth.  Greg  Botelho  reported  and  wrote  from  Atlanta.  CNN's  Ralph  Ellis,  Dana  Ford  and  Jason  Morris  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

"My  mother  was  Schell's  agent  for  over  50  years,  and  when  she  died  four  years  ago,  he  remained  with  the  agency.

Princeton  was  given  special  permission  to  use  a  new  vaccine.  Four  meningococcal  disease  cases  were  reported  at  UCSB,  but  the  vaccine  is  not  being  used  there.Some  of  the  UCSB  cases  were  caused  by  type  B  bacteria,  the  same  strain  as  at  Princeton,  although  officials  found  no  link  between  the  two  outbreaks.European,  Canadian  and  Australian  students  have  access  to  a  meningitis  B  vaccine  called  Bexsero,  but  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration  still  hasn't  approved  it  for  routine  use  in  the  United  States.Loy's  parents  hope  that  will  change."It's  absolutely  devastating  to  have  Aaron,  in  the  prime  of  his  life,  be  stricken"  with  the  disease,  Mike  Loy  said  previously.  "We  hope  that  Aaron's  horrific  illness  brings  increased  awareness  and  rapid  approval  by  the  FDA  of  the  vaccine"  for  the  type  B  strain.The  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  sent  a  team  of  scientists  to  study  the  outbreak  in  California  in  December.  It  recently  amended  a  letter  it  wrote  to  the  FDA  to  get  special  permission  to  use  the  unlicensed  vaccine  to  include  UCSB  students,  but  permission  has  not  yet  been  granted."You  don't  go  online  and  order  10,000  doses  and  get  next-day  delivery  of  this  vaccine,"  said  Dr.  Tom  Clark,  chief  of  the  CDC's  meningitis  branch.  "It  takes  time."Fortunately,  he  said,  a  meningitis  B  outbreak  moves  more  slowly  than  others.  "It  smolders.  You  have  a  bit  more  time  to  get  everything  in  place."8th  case  of  meningitis  confirmed  at  PrincetonIn  December,  the  FDA  agreed  to  the  CDC's  request  to  give  Princeton  special  permission  to  bring  the  vaccine  over  from  Europe  to  protect  its  students.  The  CDC  had  been  carefully  monitoring  the  Princeton  cases  since  the  first  couple  of  students  had  been  diagnosed  about  nine  months  before.Meningitis  B  outbreaks  are  rare  but  can  be  deadly,  according  to  the  CDC.  In  2012,  there  were  480  cases  of  bacterial  meningitis;  some  160  of  those  were  group  B,  the  agency  said.There's  an  approved  vaccine  for  other  types  of  meningitis.  There  is  none  for  group  B,  which  is  the  one  the  CDC  describes  as  "pack(ing)  the  most  powerful  punch."  College  dorms  are  perfect  breeding  grounds  for  an  outbreak.This  infection  of  the  protective  tissue  around  the  spinal  cord  and  brain  called  the  meninges  can  spread  when  someone  coughs  or  sneezes.  It  can  spread  if  people  forget  to  wash  their  hands  or  belongings,  or  through  sharing  a  glass  or  a  kiss.  Excessive  alcohol  use  leaves  people  susceptible  to  it.And  it's  tricky,  because  students  who  get  sick  with  it  may  think  they  merely  have  flu.  Patients  experience  flu-like  symptoms:  fever,  headache,  stiff  necks,  vomiting  and  delirium.  But  if  the  bacteria  spreads  to  the  meninges,  patients  can  suffer  hearing  loss,  permanent  neurological  damage,  and  even  death.Novartis,  the  Swiss  company  that  makes  the  group  B  vaccine,  declined  CNN's  interview  request,  but  confirmed  it  is  working  with  the  FDA  for  approval.A  press  release  on  its  website  from  December  said:  "Over  the  last  few  weeks,  we  have  been  working  closely  with  officials  at  Princeton  and  the  CDC  to  put  in  place  a  timely  and  decisive  response  to  the  outbreak.  This  situation  serves  as  a  reminder  that  MenB  can  strike  anyone  at  any  time."Novartis  successfully  tested  the  vaccine  on  almost  8,000  infants,  children,  adolescents  and  adults.  That  qualified  the  vaccine  for  a  license  in  European  Union  last  January.  Australia  approved  it  in  August,  and  Canada  in  December.In  an  e-mail  to  CNN,  the  FDA  explained  it  is  kept  from  legally  "discussing  investigational  drug  applications."However,  the  fact  that  the  vaccine  hasn't  been  approved  yet  has  been  criticized  by  at  least  one  former  FDA  scientist."The  FDA's  demands  are  excessive,"  said  Dr.  Henry  Miller,  the  Robert  Wesson  Fellow  in  Scientific  Philosophy  and  Public  Policy  at  the  conservative  Hoover  Institution  at  Stanford  University.  Miller  spent  15  years  at  the  FDA  and  founded  its  office  of  biotechnology.  He  has  written  extensively  about  his  belief  that  the  FDA  has  gotten  "fanatically  risk-averse."In  the  past  five  years,  the  FDA  has  approved  only  a  couple  of  new  vaccines  on  average  every  year.  But  a  2012  study  in  the  New  England  Journal  of  Medicine  found  that  the  FDA  review  time  is  comparatively  faster  than  Europe's  or  Canada's.Miller  believes  the  California  students  could  have  been  vaccinated  by  now  if  the  FDA  had  granted  accelerated  approval.  Accelerated  approval  means  the  FDA  would  temporarily  allow  U.S.  use  of  the  vaccine  without  this  extra  step  involving  the  CDC  letter  requesting  special  permission.  Accelerated  approval,  he  said,  still  leaves  the  FDA  a  legal  mechanism  to  withdraw  the  vaccine.Meningitis  outbreak:  California  students  wait  for  vaccine"The  FDA  should  have  negotiated  in  good  faith  for  reciprocity  with  their  foreign  counterparts,"  Miller  said.Dr.  David  Gortler,  a  former  FDA  senior  medical  officer  and  FDA  regulatory  expert,  said  vaccine  approvals  generally  require  special  caution."When  our  FDA  gives  its  approval  to  a  drug,  this  is  the  gold  standard  for  drug  approval  in  the  world,"  said  Gortler,  who  is  now  an  associate  professor  of  pharmacology  and  medicine  at  Georgetown  University.If  a  drug  is  going  to  be  approved  in  the  United  States,  he  said,  there  should  be  "no  room  for  doubt  of  its  clear  safety  and  efficacy."Gortler  points  to  the  1960's  Thalidomide  scandal  as  the  primary  example  of  why  the  FDA's  strict  standards  are  essential.The  morning  sickness  drug  had  been  approved  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  in  Europe,  but  pregnant  women  who  took  Thalidomide  had  babies  with  severe  birth  defects.In  the  FDA's  careful  review  of  the  drug,  medical  officer  Dr.  Frances  Kelsey  discovered  Thalidomide  had  never  been  tested  on  pregnant  animals.  Her  discovery  and  her  agency's  refusal  to  approve  it  averted  a  major  public  health  catastrophe  in  America.The  FDA's  drug  and  vaccine  approval  process  is  exhaustive.  Pharmaceutical  companies  spend  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  on  testing  that  can  take  several  years.  Scientists  must  prove  vaccines  are  safe  and  effective  in  the  lab,  in  animal  tests,  and  then  in  larger  and  larger  groups  of  humans.The  companies  send  the  FDA  test  results  throughout  the  testing  phase.  Before  digital  records,  Gortler  said  it  took  more  than  one  loaded  18-wheeler  of  paperwork  for  the  FDA  review."It's  not  an  easy  process  to  review  such  voluminous  amounts  of  data,  while  simultaneously  being  mindful  to  enforce  the  heavy  federal  regulations  concerning  new  drug  approval  in  the  USA,"  Gortler  said.The  FDA  is  still  reviewing  the  results  for  the  meningitis  B  vaccine.Novartis,  meanwhile,  said  on  its  website  it  is  "committed  to  continuing  the  dialogue  with  the  FDA  to  find  a  licensure  pathway  to  bring  a  MenB  vaccine  to  the  U.S.  to  fulfill  this  unmet  public  health  need  for  the  future."</TEXT></DOC>

He  is  the  author  of  "Jimmy  Carter"  and  "Governing  America."(CNN)  --  After  a  very  long  week,  there  has  been  a  little  light  at  the  end  of  the  bridge  for  New  Jersey  Gov.  Chris  Christie.  Some  polls  recently  suggested  that  the  scandal  surrounding  the  three  lanes  to  the  George  Washington  Bridge  might  not  have  as  much  traction  with  the  public  as  it  does  with  reporters.Although  his  job  approval  ratings  have  fallen  dramatically,  his  numbers  are  still  pretty  decent  with  55%  of  those  polled  by  Quinnipiac  University  saying  that  he  is  doing  a  good  job  (a  fall  from  74%  in  February  2013,  which  was  still  relatively  soon  after  his  high-profile,  and  praised,  performance  in  Superstorm  Sandy).According  to  the  Pew  Research  Center,  only  18%  of  people  nationally  reported  that  they  had  paid  attention  to  Christie's  news  conference  about  the  bridge  incident;  60%  said  that  their  opinions  of  the  governor  had  not  changed.The  polls  are  certainly  not  enough  to  give  Christie  reason  to  breathe  easily.  They  can  change  very  quickly  depending  on  how  news  unfolds.  This  is  also  a  very  dynamic  story  with  more  revelations  about  other  kinds  of  activities  by  the  governor's  staff  and  the  governor  himself  that  could  prove  to  be  more  damaging.  In  fact,  this  past  weekend,  news  reports  told  of  allegations  that  Gov.  Christie's  office  had  prevented  Hoboken  Mayor  Dawn  Zimmer  from  receiving  hurricane  relief  money  until  she  helped  move  forward  a  major  redevelopment  project.But  it  is  also  possible  to  see  how  Christie  can  survive  this  scandal,  and  even  rebound,  ending  up  in  a  stronger  position  than  where  he  started.The  path  to  recovery  might  involve  the  governor  turning  attention  on  the  investigators  rather  than  the  subject  of  the  investigation.  This  is  a  strategy  that  many  politicians  have  used  quite  successfully.  In  an  age  where  there  is  intense  partisanship,  public  distrust  in  government  and  a  news  media  perceived  as  scandal-obsessed  and  politically  biased,  this  strategy  can  work  well.During  the  late  1990s,  President  Bill  Clinton  turned  the  impeachment  proceedings  on  their  head  by  charging  that  the  entire  investigation  was  driven  by  the  partisan  interests  of  Republicans  such  as  Newt  Gingrich  and  Tom  DeLay  rather  than  the  interests  of  the  nation.  During  the  Republican  primaries  in  2012,  candidate  Gingrich  successfully  attacked  reporters  as  a  way  to  deflect  questions  about  his  past.Christie  might  be  able  to  do  the  same.  That  he  is  a  "red  governor"  in  a  blue  state  can  actually  turn  to  his  advantage.At  a  certain  point,  if  the  initial  revelations  don't  lead  to  more,  Christie  can  try  to  persuade  the  public  that  state  Democrats  are  driving  this  process  to  bring  down  a  governor  who  has  proved  to  be  enormously  popular.Given  the  reputation  of  New  Jersey  as  a  notoriously  corrupt  state  filled  with  tales  of  wrongdoing  by  members  of  both  parties  --  for  example,  Democratic  Mayor  Tony  Mack  of  Trenton  was  arrested  after  an  FBI  investigation  into  allegations  of  bribery,  extortion  and  more  --  many  Americans  inside  and  the  state  and  out  might  end  up  wondering  what's  so  different  about  this  story  than  all  the  others  they  hear  daily.The  governor  can  also  spin  this  as  a  story  about  national  Democrats  who  are  trying  to  bring  down  a  potential  Republican  rival  in  2016.  Politico  recently  reported  how  the  Democratic  National  Committee  has  been  unleashing  an  aggressive  attack  on  the  governor  since  December  in  an  attempt  to  define  this  politician  for  Americans  as  less  a  maverick  than  a  bully.If  Democrats  are  not  careful,  Christie  can  also  show  himself  to  be  the  person  more  interested  in  governance  than  politics,  flipping  the  story  against  his  opponents.  In  his  State  of  the  State  Address,  Christie  tried  to  lay  out  a  number  of  policy  issues  that  he  wants  to  tackle  in  the  coming  year,  many  revolving  around  the  length  of  the  school  day  and  school  year.  But  making  a  speech  is  one  thing,  moving  forward  with  a  policy  agenda  is  another.If  Christie  can  keep  himself  in  New  Jersey  long  enough  and  avoid  the  temptation  of  going  out  on  the  campaign  trail,  he  could  push  forward  with  these  and  other  ideas  that  are  of  great  interest  to  New  Jersey  residents.  The  more  that  he  can  show  himself  to  be  concerned  with  the  health  of  residents  in  the  state  and  turn  the  debate  toward  policy,  the  better  he  can  bolster  the  image  he  has  built  of  being  a  chief  executive  whose  primary  concern  is  getting  things  done  regardless  of  the  politics  involved.This  is  the  image  that  came  out  of  Superstorm  Sandy  and  is  one  that  might  be  repeated  in  this  highly  charged  environment.  If  the  ongoing  investigations  don't  turn  up  anything  new  to  implicate  the  governor,  Christie  will  say  that  he  is  the  one  who  held  people  accountable  and  moved  forward  with  leadership  while  his  opponents  whipped  up  scandal  politics.Timing  is  everything  in  politics.  And  the  timing  of  this  scandal  might  work  in  Christie's  favor.The  scandal  broke  after  his  re-election  and  a  long  time  before  the  Republican  primaries  for  the  2016  election.  The  good  thing  for  politicians  in  the  U.S.  is  that  the  attention  span  of  Americans  is  extremely  short.We  have  seen  repeatedly  how  there  can  be  intense,  almost  obsessive,  fascination  with  a  scandal  (remember  the  IRS?)  that  can  seem  like  the  end  of  the  world  for  the  person  involved,  but  soon  it  is  forgotten.  Americans  are  so  saturated  with  stories  about  wrongdoing  that  there  is  a  kind  of  numbness  that  develops.  After  some  time,  the  nation  moves  on  unless  some  devastating  smoking  gun  brings  a  person  down.Within  a  few  months,  it  is  very  possible  that  the  public  is  not  talking  about  this  anymore.  While  Christie's  reputation  might  be  damaged  and  the  image  he  crafted  after  Superstorm  Sandy  will  not  be  as  pristine,  the  news  won't  be  about  these  lanes  any  more.  Christie  will  always  have  to  contend  with  questions  about  this,  but  the  intensity  will  greatly  diminish  by  the  time  that  the  governor  really  takes  the  nation  stage.Should  he  survive,  this  entire  episode  will  also  give  Christie  much  tougher  skin  and  more  seasoned  approach  to  handling  these  types  of  situations  closer  to  the  presidential  election.  He  might  also  win  back  the  media  to  this  side  since  the  only  thing  that  reporters  love  better  than  the  story  of  a  political  collapse  is  the  story  of  a  political  comeback.None  of  this  is  to  say  that  the  scandal  is  not  serious  or  that  this  can't  potentially  cause  immense  damage  to  the  governor.  One  e-mail  revealing  the  governor  actually  knew  about  all  of  this  would  be  devastating.  Yet  anyone  who  follows  politics  understands  that  this  story  could  end  up  being  a  bridge  to  nowhere,  and  Christie  can  still  emerge  as  the  top  Republican  contender  in  2016.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Julian  Zelizer.</TEXT></DOC>

Your  friend  just  found  out  she's  lactose-intolerant  (which  isn't  a  food  allergy  --  but  more  on  that  in  a  bit),  and  she's  been  shedding  pounds  after  kicking  dairy  out  of  her  diet.And  wasn't  that  rail-thin  guy  you  dated  in  high  school  allergic  to  (and  always  avoiding)  peanuts?So:  Is  there  a  connection  between  food  allergies/intolerances  and  weight  gain?  Can  being  unknowingly  allergic  to  a  certain  kind  of  food  cause  you  to  pack  on  the  pounds?  Dee  Sandquist,  former  spokesperson  for  the  Academy  of  Nutrition  and  Dietetics,  gave  us  the  skinny.upwave:  Are  you  prone  to  weight  gain?The  verdict:  Food  allergies  don't  cause  weight  gain"I'm  not  aware  (of)  specific  foods  (that)  cause  weight  gain  if  you're  allergic  to  them,"  says  Sandquist.  "However,  if  you're  eating  food  that  you're  sensitive  to,  it  could  lead  to  bloating  and  stomach  discomfort  --  and  you're  less  likely  to  exercise  if  you're  not  feeling  well."According  to  Sandquist,  a  true  food  allergy  is  an  adverse  immune  response  to  food,  and  tends  to  happen  fairly  quickly  after  you  eat  something  (from  a  few  minutes  to  an  hour).Typical  signs  include  a  runny  nose,  itchy  skin,  a  rash  or  hives,  tingling  or  swelling  of  the  tongue  or  lips,  a  tightness  in  the  throat,  a  hoarse  voice,  wheezing,  coughing,  nausea,  vomiting,  stomach  pain,  diarrhea  or  even  anaphylaxis  (a  whole-body  allergic  reaction  that  may  cause  death).upwave:  3  ways  to  boost  your  immunityThe  most  common  food  allergies  are  to  proteins  in  cow's  milk,  eggs,  peanuts,  wheat,  soy,  fish,  shellfish  and  tree  nuts.  For  people  with  food  allergies,  even  a  tiny  amount  of  the  food  can  trigger  an  immune  response.Food  sensitivities  and  intolerances  are  not  allergies.  They  occur  when  the  digestive  system  can't  properly  break  down  food.  They're  much  more  common  and  difficult  to  diagnose  than  food  allergies.  People  have  trouble  attributing  what  they're  eating  to  a  certain  symptom  because  the  symptom  might  not  occur  for  a  few  days.Intolerances  are  often  confused  with  allergies  because  of  the  similarities  in  symptoms,  but  they're  not  the  same.  Symptoms  of  intolerance  may  include  diarrhea,  stomach  pain  and  vomiting,  but  not  hives,  airway  swelling  or  anaphylaxis.Sandquist  says  that  intolerances  can  also  cause  cravings,  tiredness,  bloating  and  even  headaches  a  few  days  later.  "I  recommend  logging  what  you  eat  and  tracking  your  symptoms  over  time,"  she  says.  "That  way,  the  next  time  you  experience  some  of  these  symptoms,  you  can  look  back  and  see  what  you  had  to  eat."upwave:  How  to  prevent  bloatingIf  you're  sensitive  to  a  certain  food,  you  may  be  able  to  eat  a  little  bit  of  it.  If  you  consume  too  much,  it'll  trigger  a  physical  response  --  but  not  weight  gain.And  as  for  the  food  sensitivity/intolerance  weight-loss  connection?  Not  necessarily  true  either  --  and,  yes,  that  includes  gluten.In  fact,  Sandquist  warns  that  many  gluten-free  products  have  more  calories  and  fat  than  their  gluten-containing  counterparts.  So  if  you're  just  trading  your  snacks  and  sweets  for  gluten-free  processed  versions  of  those  foods,  don't  expect  to  be  slipping  into  a  smaller  size  anytime  soon.This  article  was  originally  published  on  upwave.com.©  2013  upwave,  All  Rights  Reserved.</TEXT></DOC>

Neither  is  his  wife.  But  they've  been  married  for  22  years  and  still  make  each  other  laugh.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Daniel  Jones  is  the  editor  of  the  Modern  Love  column  in  The  New  York  Times  and  the  author  of  "Love  Illuminated:  Exploring  Life's  Most  Mystifying  Subject  (with  the  Help  of  50,000  Strangers)."  Follow  him  on  Twitter  @danjonesnyt.(CNN)  --  Not  even  on  Valentine's  Day  am  I  much  of  a  romantic.  I  hardly  ever  think  to  buy  flowers  for  my  wife  or  plan  fun  getaways,  and  I  rarely  remember  our  anniversary.  To  be  fair,  neither  does  she.  We're  usually  reminded  of  our  anniversary  only  when  her  mother's  congratulatory  card  arrives  with  a  little  check  tucked  inside.Oh  yeah,  we  think.  It's  that  time  of  year  again.  How  many  years  has  it  been?  Which  anniversary  is  this?  Paper?  Copper?  Sometimes  I  have  to  take  off  my  wedding  ring  and  look  at  the  date,  which  is  etched  inside.In  the  card  my  mother-in-law  will  have  written:  "Spend  this  on  a  nice  dinner  out  for  the  two  of  you!""How  sweet  of  her,"  Cathi  will  say."She's  so  nice  to  do  this  every  year,"  I'll  say.And  then  we'll  deposit  the  check  in  our  mutual  checking  account  and  promise  ourselves  a  nice  dinner  out,  which  usually  fails  to  materialize.  Maybe  a  portion  of  that  check  will  go  toward  the  electric  bill,  which  powers  our  air  conditioner,  which  keeps  us  cool  and  comfortable  in  the  hot  summer  months.  That's  kind  of  romantic,  right?  Not  really.  What  can  I  say?  Romance  just  isn't  in  our  DNA.And  yet  I  spend  my  days  reading  other  people's  love  stories.  For  the  past  10  years  I've  edited  a  column  in  The  New  York  Times  called  "Modern  Love,"  in  which  strangers  write  personal  essays  spilling  the  details  of  their  love  lives  for  a  mass  audience.  A  lot  of  their  stories  aren't  very  romantic,  either,  but  many  of  them  are:  tales  of  swooning  singletons  traveling  great  distances  for  love,  or  planning  elaborate  proposals,  or  pouring  their  hearts  out  in  ways  that  expose  them  to  crushing  rejection.Stories  like  that  make  me  think  I  should  be  more  romantic.But  at  this  point,  Cathi  and  I  have  been  married  almost  22  years.  Our  patterns  are  kind  of  established.  We  love  each  other  and  support  each  other's  work  and  aspirations.  We're  good  parents  together.  We're  really  good  at  making  each  other  laugh.  At  dinner  parties,  we'd  still  rather  sit  next  to  each  other  than  be  broken  up  and  forced  to  talk  to  other  people.  Isn't  that  enough?  I  know  what  you're  thinking.  This  guy  is  hopeless!  And  not  in  the  sense  of  being  a  hopeless  romantic!Some  say  romance  is  dying  in  this  age  of  commercialized  and  computerized  matchmaking.  They  say  romance  is  being  killed  by  a  world  of  constant  communication.  How  can  you  miss  someone  when  you  can  FaceTime  with  him  or  her  24/7?  Where  is  the  mystery  when  you  can  follow  each  other's  Twitter  feed  and  Facebook  posts  at  work  during  the  day  or  when  away  on  a  business  trip?I've  even  heard  of  husbands  and  wives  using  "Find  My  iPhone"  to  locate  their  spouses  if  they're  not  answering  calls  or  texts,  as  if  the  thing  was  invented  to  serve  as  a  GPS  tracking  device.  And  after  our  laptop  locates  the  signal,  we  think:  Oh,  she's  just  at  CVS.  Oh,  he's  just  walking  the  dog  down  by  the  river.  Not  a  lot  of  mystery  there.Nothing  to  wonder  about.  If  absence  makes  the  heart  grow  fonder,  what  does  continual  presence  do?  Make  the  heart  grow  bored?With  Cathi  and  me,  technology  has  nothing  to  do  with  our  unromantic  affliction.  Our  love  has  sidestepped  romantic  traditions  from  the  beginning.  We  got  engaged  on  a  ferry  boat  in  San  Francisco  Bay.  That's  romantic,  right?  Well,  not  for  us.  We  had  departed  from  Fisherman's  Wharf,  bound  for  Sausalito,  when  Cathi  said,  "So  are  we  getting  married,  or  what?""Yeah,  we  should,"  I  said.And  that  was  it.  We  had  become  engaged.  Even  though  I  hadn't  proposed.  Hadn't  knelt.  Hadn't  pulled  a  hidden  ring  box  from  my  pocket  or  sock  and  presented  it  to  her  with  a  big,  goofy  smile.  Hadn't  memorized  or  delivered  any  heartfelt  lines.  I  don't  even  think  we  kissed.By  then  we  had  been  together  for  almost  two  years.  We  were  both  29,  nearing  the  end  of  our  graduate  school  days,  and  obviously  had  to  figure  out  what  was  next  for  us.  Our  marriage  and  family  clock  was  ticking,  and  our  parents'  expectations  were  mounting.  I  wanted  to  marry  Cathi  and  assumed  we  would  get  married,  and  yet  I  hadn't  taken  a  single  step  in  that  direction.Why  hadn't  I?  I  wish  I  could  claim  some  standard  excuse  like  cold  feet  or  commitment  issues  or  a  laundry  list  of  doubts,  but  it  wouldn't  be  true.  I  wasn't  worried  about  Cathi  specifically  or  about  marriage  generally.  I  expected  it  would  all  work  out  fine.  I  wasn't  concerned  about  joining  her  family  or  her  joining  mine.  I  was  simply  procrastinating  because  I  didn't  want  to  face  the  work  and  stress  that  proposing  and  then  planning  a  wedding  would  require.As  we  steamed  past  Alcatraz  Island  (no  prison  symbolism  intended),  Cathi  asked  if  I  had  any  thoughts  about  a  ring."No,"  I  said.  "But  I'll  ask  my  mother."Oof.In  the  end,  though,  my  mother  delivered.  She  had  a  family  heirloom  kind  of  ring  with  a  little  diamond  chip  that  we  got  sized  for  Cathi's  finger,  and  that  made  it  official.  Some  months  later,  during  our  pre-wedding  planning,  we  went  to  a  strip  mall  in  West  Orange,  New  Jersey,  and  ordered  matching  gold  bands.  As  we  walked  out,  I  felt  a  little  misty  eyed,  and  I  don't  think  it  was  just  because  of  the  pollution.Some  months  later  we  walked  down  the  aisle.  We  said  our  vows.  We  kissed.  We  danced.  We  celebrated.  And  later  that  night  we  strode  into  our  fancy  hotel  room,  where  I  pulled  from  my  pockets  the  cash  and  checks  people  had  given  us,  and  I  scattered  the  loot  all  over  the  bed.  No  one  had  told  me  that  people  tend  to  stuff  money  into  the  groom's  pockets  at  weddings,  and  I  have  to  say  it  felt  really  romantic  to  lie  in  all  that  cash  together  on  a  king-size  hotel  bed.We'd  done  it.  We  had  turned  our  love  into  marriage.  It  was  the  start  of  everything.  It's  a  date  that  will  be  etched  forever  in  --  my  ring.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Daniel  Jones.</TEXT></DOC>

"I  burnt  a  lot  of  bridges."</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(EW.com)  --  Why  did  Sienna  Miller  fall  off  Hollywood's  radar  shortly  after  the  2009  release  of  G.I.  Joe:  The  Rise  of  Cobra?  The  answer's  simple,  according  to  Miller  herself:  "I  sabotaged  things,"  she  says.  "I  burnt  a  lot  of  bridges."There's  more  blunt  honesty  where  that  came  from  in  Miller's  big  Esquire  UK  interview,  the  magazine's  latest  cover  story.  (And  yes,  the  article  also  includes  a  very  tasteful,  black-and-white  topless  photoshoot.)In  between  a  fair  amount  of  purple  prose  ("[we]  talked  to  each  other,  and  at  each  other,  and  occasionally  over  each  other  about  feminism  and  social  media  and  the  press  and  public  morality  and  twerking,  obviously...Some  of  this  into  my  voice  recorder,  some  of  it  into  the  wind"),  Miller  gives  a  lot  of  insight  into  her  rocky  career,  which  started  to  slump  when  her  private  life  became  more  interesting  than  her  professional  life  —  and  Miller  freely  admits  that  she's  got  nobody  to  blame  for  that  but  herself.  (Although  according  to  interviewer  Alex  Bilmes,  Miller  does  concede  "that  she  certainly  wouldn't  have  been  treated  in  this  way  were  she  a  man."  Maybe  there's  a  Katherine  Heigl  comparison  to  be  made  here?)The  trouble  began  when  2004′s  Alfie  remake  was  released  —  and  22-year-old  Miller  suddenly  skyrocketed  to  fame,  due  to  her  roles  as  both  the  film's  costar  and  Jude  Law's  girlfriend.  "I  was  really  naive,"  she  recalls  to  Bilmes.  "Not  green  as  grass  —  I  was  by  no  means  an  innocent  —  but  I  had  faith  in  the  goodness  of  everyone.  I  was  very  open.  And  that  led  me  into  all  sorts  of  situations  that  backfired."Namely,  Miller  never  really  learned  how  to  play  the  PR  game:  "I  was  English.  I  was,  'Let's  be  who  we  are!  I'm  not  going  to  have  my  hair  done  every  morning  and  yes:  I  smell  of  fags!'  And  so  I  would  walk  into  studio  heads'  offices  and  we'd  crack  up  laughing."  And  while  she  claims  that  she  was  always  "totally  professional"  on  movie  sets,  offset,  the  actress  "had  no  business  sense  whatsoever":  "I  never  read  a  review  or  paid  any  mind  to  what  anyone  said,"  Miller  admits.  She  also  ruffled  feathers  with  her  off-the-cuff  remarks,  as  when  she  memorably  called  Pennsylvania's  second-largest  city  "Sh--sburgh."And  of  course,  she  got  caught  in  one  tabloid  scandal  after  another,  first  due  to  her  tumultuous  relationship  with  Law  and  later  when  she  had  an  affair  with  the  married  actor  Balthazar  Getty.  As  a  result,  Miller  says  roles  dried  up  —  because  "people  don't  want  to  see  films  with  people  they  don't  approve  of  in  them."  (You  know,  unless  they're  men.)  So  Miller  "deliberately  disappeared"  from  the  spotlight,  and  from  the  nasty  reputation  she'd  developed.  "I  was  sick  of  myself,  to  be  honest,  or  sick  of  that  perception  of  me,"  she  says.  "It  all  felt  so  f—ing  dirty."Since  Miller's  now  doing  a  huge  confessional  interview  in  a  big  glossy  magazine,  it's  safe  to  say  that  things  are  looking  up  for  her.  After  the  disaster  that  was  G.I.  Joe,  she  found  refuge  on  the  stage  and  with  a  well-received  turn  as  Tippi  Hedren  in  the  2012  TV  movie  The  Girl.  Two  years  later,  Miller  is  staging  something  of  a  film  comeback  with  roles  in  three  movies,  including  the  Vince  Vaughn  comedy  Business  Trip  (which...  maybe  she  shouldn't  get  too  excited  about)  and  the  true  crime  drama  Foxcatcher  (which  was  originally  set  to  open  Dec.  20  but  has  been  pushed  to  an  unspecified  date  this  year).  Her  personal  life,  too,  is  finally  stable:  Miller  and  fiance  Tom  Sturridge  welcomed  their  first  daughter  in  July  2012.And  maybe  most  importantly,  the  tumult  of  the  past  10  years  has  helped  Miller  understand  what  really  matters  —  or,  more  specifically,  what  doesn't.  (Hint:  Everything.)  Take  it  away,  Sienna:"When  you're  in  some  massive  crisis  and  you  look  at  yourself  in  a  close-up  and  then  if  you  visualize  pulling  back  and  seeing  England  and  then  pulling  back  and  seeing  the  world,  you  realize  how  f—ing  insignificant  you  are.  I  think  that's  really  the  greatest  thing  I've  learned  recently:  that  I  don't  matter.  Nothing  matters.  It's  such  a  relief  to  know  that.  I  didn't  get  that  job  --  it  doesn't  f—ing  matter.  Whatever  I  achieve,  or  don't,  will  be  forgotten,  it's  not  important."Read  the  full  interview  at  Esquire  UK.See  the  original  article  at  EW.com.CLICK  HERE  to  Try  2  RISK  FREE  issues  of  Entertainment  Weekly©  2011  Entertainment  Weekly  and  Time  Inc.

For  the  most  part,  it  appears  the  critics  appreciate  the  efforts  of  both  Crowe  and  Aronofsky  --  who  is  best  known  for  controversial  films  such  as  "Requiem  for  a  Dream"  and  "Black  Swan"  --  even  if  they  don't  think  the  pair  quite  pull  it  off.Jordan  Hoffman  of  Screen  Crush  says,  "This  film's  inscrutable  oddness  --  and  the  willingness  to  take  chances  --  brought  me  to  a  place  that  could  not  have  predicted.  During  the  film's  third  act  I  had  no  idea  how  this  movie  was  going  to  end.  Seriously.  Even  more  exciting,  once  the  credits  rolled,  I  had  to  spend  some  time  to  work  out  how  I  felt.  In  fact,  I'm  still  thinking  about  it.""Dark"  is  how  Nathan  Adams  of  Film  School  Rejects  describes  the  big-budget  flick.  "There's  a  tension  that  runs  through  the  whole  film  about  who  you  should  be  rooting  for,  or  if  it's  even  possible  to  root  for  anyone  in  this  situation,"  he  writes.  "Noah  goes  to  such  dark  places  over  the  course  of  the  movie  that  it's  impossible  to  keep  relating  to  him  as  a  protagonist  (sometimes  to  the  point  of  comedy,  intentional  or  otherwise),  and  it  becomes  necessary  for  the  narrative  to  switch  its  viewpoint  from  character  to  character."The  headline  for  Alonso  Duralde's  review  for  The  Wrap  reads,  "Darren  Aronofsky's  biblical  'Waterworld'  mostly  runs  aground."  Duralde  says  that  "Unlike  the  thousands  of  CGI  beasts  of  the  land  and  air  who  hitch  a  ride  on  'Noah,'  Darren  Aronofsky's  highly-anticipated  epic  is  neither  fish  nor  fowl;  in  no  way  is  it  a  straightforward  Bible  tale  (and  given  the  brevity  of  Genesis'  account  of  the  flood,  such  a  thing  would  be  next  to  impossible)  nor  is  it  the  sort  of  unfettered  freak-out  that  fans  of  'Black  Swan,'  'Pi'  or  'The  Fountain'  would  expect  from  its  director  and  co-writer  (with  Ari  Handel)."HitFix's  Drew  McWeeny  writes  that  "Noah"  "is  not  just  one  of  the  most  ambitious  films  I've  seen  this  year,  it's  one  of  the  most  ambitious  films  I've  ever  seen.  It's  a  movie  that  is  spilling  over  with  ideas  and  images  and  emotional  explorations  of  the  metaphysical."Opinion:  Is  'Noah'  sacred  enough?Ty  Burr  of  the  Boston  Globe  says  the  film  is  "equal  parts  ridiculous  and  magnificent."  And  while  noting  that  Crowe  "turns  out  to  be  perfectly  cast  in  the  title  role,"  Burr  writes  that  "The  parts  of  'Noah'  that  don't  work  really,  truly  don't.  But  the  parts  that  do  almost  sweep  you  away  in  the  flood."As  the  Washington  Post  notes,  the  film  has  had  its  fair  share  of  controversy,  including  complaints  that  there  is  a  lack  of  mention  of  God  in  the  film.Post  film  critic  Ann  Hornaday  calls  it  a  slightly  different  take  on  the  biblical  story  and  writes,  "The  result  is  a  movie  that  is  clearly  deeply  respectful  of  its  source  material  but  also  at  times  startlingly  revisionist,  a  go-for-broke  throwback  to  Hollywood  biblical  epics  of  yore  that  combines  grandeur  and  grace,  as  well  as  a  generous  dollop  of  goofy  overstatement."Viewers  may  not  agree  about  what  they've  seen  when  they  come  out  of  'Noah,'  "  she  said.  "But  there's  no  doubt  that  Aronofsky  has  made  an  ambitious,  serious,  even  visionary  motion  picture,  whose  super-sized  popcorn-movie  vernacular  may  occasionally  submerge  the  story's  more  reflective  implications,  but  never  drowns  them  entirely."Likewise,  Peter  Travers  of  Rolling  Stone  cautions,  "My  advice:  Hold  off  on  burning  Aronofsky  at  the  stake  till  you  see  Noah,  a  film  of  grit,  grace  and  visual  wonders  that  for  all  its  tech-head  modernity  is  built  on  a  spiritual  core.  The  Brooklyn-born  Aronofsky  and  his  Harvard  roomie  and  writing  partner,  Ari  Handel  --  'two  not  very  religious  Jewish  guys,'  says  the  director  --  are  hellbent  on  making  their  Noah  relevant  for  believers  and  skeptics  alike."</TEXT></DOC>

But  you  may  not  know  about  some  of  their  findings  over  the  years.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Tune  in  to  CNN's  "Piers  Morgan  Live"  at  9  p.m.  ET  Wednesday  to  hear  Dr.  Sanjay  Gupta  discuss  the  #justsayhello  initiative  aimed  at  combating  loneliness.(CNN)  --  Nearly  everyone  feels  lonely  at  some  point.  The  good  news  is,  for  many  of  us,  it's  a  temporary  condition,  perhaps  one  caused  by  a  life  change:  moving  to  a  new  location,  for  instance,  or  starting  a  new  job.But  for  other  people,  loneliness  is  a  way  of  life,  one  that  may  stem  not  from  the  number  of  people  around  them  but  from  a  lack  of  connection  with  others.  And,  research  has  showed,  chronic  loneliness  can  have  adverse  consequences  for  your  health.Scientists  are  still  examining  the  link  between  mental  and  physical  health  and  how  loneliness  affects  our  bodies.  But  you  may  not  know  about  some  of  their  findings  over  the  years.It  may  affect  your  brain  in  a  way  similar  to  physical  painAs  Dr.  Sanjay  Gupta  writes  in  a  column  for  O  Magazine  regarding  a  2003  study:"A  remarkable  study  led  by  Naomi  Eisenberger,  PhD,  an  associate  professor  of  social  psychology  at  UCLA,  found  that  being  excluded  --  which  can  push  you  to  the  social  perimeter  and,  as  a  result,  cause  feelings  of  loneliness  --  triggered  activity  in  some  of  the  same  regions  of  the  brain  that  register  physical  pain."From  an  evolutionary  perspective,  this  makes  sense;  our  prehistoric  ancestors  relied  on  social  groups  not  just  for  companionship,  but  for  survival.  Staying  close  to  the  tribe  brought  access  to  shelter,  food,  and  protection.  Separation  from  the  group,  on  the  other  hand,  meant  danger."Today  when  we  feel  left  out,  our  bodies  may  sense  a  threat  to  survival,  and  some  of  the  same  pain  signals  that  would  engage  if  we  were  in  real  physical  danger  are  flipped  on.  In  the  chronically  lonely,  levels  of  the  stress  hormone  cortisol  shoot  up  higher  in  the  morning  than  in  more  socially  connected  people  and  never  fully  subside  at  night."The  importance  of  belongingIt  can  keep  you  from  getting  a  good  night's  sleepPeople  who  feel  lonely  tend  to  experience  more  nighttime  sleep  disruptions  than  those  who  don't,  a  small  2011  study  found.Researchers  found  that  the  link  between  sleep  disruptions  and  loneliness  persisted  even  after  marital  status  and  family  size  were  taken  into  account,  suggesting  that  loneliness  depends  on  how  people  perceive  their  social  situation  rather  than  the  situation  itself.The  95  participants  in  the  study  all  had  strong  social  connections  and  were  part  of  a  close-knit,  rural  South  Dakota  community.  Yet,  researchers  found,  even  small  differences  in  their  degrees  of  loneliness  were  reflected  in  their  sleep.It  can  increase  your  risk  for  dementiaIn  a  2012  study  of  nearly  2,200  older  adults  living  in  Amsterdam,  researchers  found  that  participants  who  reported  feeling  lonely  --  regardless  of  the  number  of  friends  and  family  surrounding  them  --  were  more  likely  to  experience  dementia  than  those  who  lived  alone.Study  participants  were  ages  65  to  86  did  not  show  signs  of  dementia  and  did  not  live  in  institutions  such  as  nursing  homes.  About  half  lived  alone,  and  20%  reported  feeling  lonely.  Nearly  two-thirds  were  women.After  adjusting  for  factors  like  age,  the  researchers  found  that  feeling  lonely  raised  the  risk  of  dementia  by  64%.  But,  they  cautioned,  that  does  not  prove  that  loneliness  causes  dementia  and  noted  that  the  opposite  could  be  true  as  well,  because  dementia  and  its  accompanying  mood  changes  could  contribute  to  some  of  the  social  withdrawal  of  loneliness.It  may  contribute  to  premature  deathTwo  other  2012  studies  found  that  living  alone  --  or  just  feeling  lonely  --  may  increase  a  person's  risk  of  early  death.One  study  followed  nearly  45,000  people  ages  45  and  up  who  either  had  heart  disease  or  were  at  high  risk  for  it.  Those  living  alone,  the  study  found,  were  more  likely  to  die  from  heart  attacks,  strokes  or  other  complications  over  a  four-year  period  than  those  living  with  family  or  friends  or  in  some  other  communal  arrangement.A  second  study  focused  on  those  60  and  older  and  found  that  men  and  women  were  45%  more  likely  to  die  during  the  study  period  (six  years)  if  they  reported  feeling  lonely,  isolated  or  left  out.  But  those  who  reported  loneliness  --  43%  of  the  study  population  --  weren't  necessarily  living  alone.  Researchers  said  the  link  between  lonely  feelings  and  health  problems  held  even  after  living  situation,  depression  and  other  factors  were  taken  into  account.Fighting  loneliness  and  disease  with  meditationIt  may  break  your  heart  (literally)People  who  report  being  chronically  lonely  may  have  an  overexpression  of  genes  connected  to  cells  that  produce  an  inflammatory  response  to  tissue  damage,  according  to  a  2011  study  of  93  adults.Although  that  inflammatory  response  may  be  good  in  the  short  term,  long-term  inflammation  can  lead  to  heart  disease  and  cancer.The  study  found  only  a  correlation  between  gene  expression  and  loneliness,  so  it's  not  certain  that  one  can  cause  the  other.  However,  study  co-author  Steven  Cole  suggested  that  anti-inflammatory  drugs  may  be  helpful  for  people  who  can't  shake  lonely  feelings.Watch  Piers  Morgan  Live  weeknights  9  p.m.  ET.

If  the  situation  is  like  it  is  now,  we  will  probably  have  to  give  up  external  borrowings  and  cut  domestic  ones,"  Siluanov  said.Yatsenyuk:  EU  speaking  in  one  voiceMoscow  has  doggedly  pursued  its  own  course  even  as  Western  leaders  have  denounced  its  actions  as  violations  of  Ukraine's  sovereignty  and  a  breach  of  international  law.Though  Russia  insists  that  its  actions  are  legitimate,  Ukraine's  interim  government  has  said  Kiev  will  never  stop  fighting  for  Crimea.Human  Rights  Watch  said  in  a  statement  Friday  that  it  has  concluded  that  the  international  law  of  occupation  applies  to  Russian  forces  in  Crimea.  "The  occupying  party  is  ultimately  responsible  for  violations  of  international  law  committed  by  local  authorities  or  proxy  forces,"  it  said.While  in  Brussels,  Yatsenyuk  held  talks  with  European  Council  President  Herman  Van  Rompuy  and  European  Commission  chief  Jose  Manuel  Barroso.He  said  Russia's  ratification  of  the  treaty  annexing  Crimea  is  less  important  than  the  EU  trade  pact  he  has  signed  with  EU  leaders."Frankly  speaking,  I  don't  care  about  Russia  signing  this  deal;  I  care  about  Ukraine,  Ukrainians  and  our  European  future,"  he  said.  "This  deal  covers  more  existential  and  most  important  issues,  mainly  security  and  defense  cooperation."Yatsenyuk  said  the  European  Union  would  "speak  in  one  single  and  strong  voice"  to  protect  its  values  and  defend  Ukraine's  territorial  integrity.Van  Rompuy  said  the  deal  "shows  our  steadfast  support  for  the  course  the  people  of  Ukraine  have  courageously  pursued."EU  travel  bans,  asset  freezesThe  European  Union  confirmed  details  of  the  sanctions  against  12  Russian  officials  agreed  to  late  Thursday  at  the  EU  Heads  of  State  or  Government  summit.Those  targeted  with  travel  bans  and  asset  freezes  include  Russian  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Dmitry  Rogozin,  as  well  as  the  chairwoman  of  the  Russian  upper  house,  Valentina  Matvienko,  and  two  Putin  advisers."Sanctions  are  not  a  question  of  retaliation;  they  are  a  foreign  policy  tool,"  Van  Rompuy  said.  "Our  goal  is  to  stop  Russian  action  against  Ukraine,  to  restore  Ukraine's  sovereignty,  and  to  achieve  this,  we  need  a  negotiated  solution."He  said  the  European  Union  expected  soon  to  finalize  approval  of  the  remaining  parts  of  the  deal,  particularly  its  economic  provisions.British  Prime  Minister  David  Cameron  said  the  European  Commission  will  draw  up  further  sanctions  --  in  finance,  military  and  energy  --  for  use  if  the  situation  escalates."Europe  is,  I  think,  25%  or  so  reliant  on  Russian  gas,"  he  said.  "But  if  you  look  at  Gazprom's  revenues,  something  like  50%  of  them  come  from  Europe.  So,  you  know,  Russia  needs  Europe  more  than  Europe  needs  Russia."Cameron  said  the  measures  agreed  to  in  Brussels  will  carry  a  cost  for  Crimea,  whose  goods  would  face  heavy  penalties  and  tariffs  in  Europe  if  they  are  shipped  through  Russia,  not  Ukraine.EU  leaders  want  to  see  an  international  observer  mission  in  Crimea,  preferably  under  the  aegis  of  the  Organization  for  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe  but,  if  not,  sent  by  the  European  Union,  Cameron  said.Ban:  'Deeply  concerned'A  day  after  speaking  with  Putin  in  Moscow,  U.N.  Secretary-General  Ban  Ki-moon  met  Friday  in  Kiev  with  acting  President  Oleksandr  Turchynov,  then  told  reporters  he  was  "very  deeply  concerned"  by  the  tensions  in  parts  of  Ukraine  and  between  Kiev  and  Moscow.  "These  are  some  of  the  most  traumatic  and  difficult  times  in  the  history  of  Ukraine,"  he  said.Ban  urged  a  peaceful,  diplomatic  resolution  to  the  crisis  and  said  all  parties  should  refrain  from  inflammatory  actions  and  rhetoric.U.N.  Assistant  Secretary-General  for  Human  Rights  Ivan  Simonovic  arrived  Friday  in  Crimea  for  a  two-day  visit  aimed  at  laying  the  groundwork  for  a  U.N.  human  rights  monitoring  mission,  the  United  Nations  said.He  and  a  team  were  to  meet  with  Crimean  leaders,  the  head  of  the  Crimean  Tatar  minority  and  others,  including  the  families  of  Ukrainian  servicemen,  the  United  Nations  said.The  United  Nations  and  other  organizations  stand  ready  to  assist  with  the  country's  elections,  slated  to  be  held  May  25,  Ban  said.  While  in  Kiev,  he  was  also  planning  to  meet  with  Yatsenyuk  and  other  ministers  and  lawmakers.In  another  sign  of  solidarity  with  Ukraine,  France  is  offering  to  strengthen  a  NATO  air-policing  mission  in  the  Baltic  area  by  sending  four  jets,  a  Defense  Ministry  spokesman  said  Friday.The  offer,  accepted  by  the  Baltic  states,  was  extended  Friday  as  French  Defense  Minister  Jean-Yves  Le  Drian  traveled  to  Lithuania,  Estonia  and  Poland,  said  Sacha  Mandel,  the  minister's  communication  adviser.His  trip  followed  a  visit  to  the  Baltics  this  week  by  Vice  President  Joe  Biden.Putin's  inner  circleThe  U.S.  sanctions  announced  Thursday  target  20  people  seen  as  close  to  Putin,  as  well  as  a  bank,  Rossiya,  believed  to  serve  the  President  and  senior  Russian  officials.Putin  rejected  the  putative  link.  "I  personally  didn't  have  an  account  there,  but  I'll  definitely  open  it  on  Monday,"  he  said  Friday,  according  to  the  Kremlin.The  individuals  named  by  the  U.S.  Treasury  include  Putin  allies  in  the  Kremlin  and  in  business.  Among  the  16  government  officials  are  Putin's  chief  of  staff,  Sergei  Ivanov;  the  speaker  of  the  State  Duma,  Sergey  Naryshkin;  and  Viktor  Ozerov,  chairman  of  the  Security  and  Defense  Committee  of  the  Russian  Parliament's  upper  house.Four  others  were  named  as  members  of  the  government's  inner  circle.  They  are  financier  Yuri  Kovalchuk,  labeled  Putin's  personal  banker  by  a  senior  U.S.  administration  official;  magnate  Gennady  Timchenko,  whose  activities  in  the  energy  sector  have  been  directly  linked  to  Putin,  according  to  the  Treasury;  and  businessmen  Arkady  and  Boris  Rotenberg.Washington  aidIn  Washington,  the  House  Foreign  Affairs  Committee  introduced  a  bill  Friday  that  provides  aid  to  Ukraine."The  United  States  must  stand  with  the  people  of  Ukraine  in  the  wake  of  Russia's  attack  on  and  occupation  of  Crimea,"  said  ranking  member  Eliot  Engel,  D-New  York,  in  a  statement.  "It  sends  a  clear  message  to  President  Putin  and  his  corrupt  cronies  that  we  will  not  tolerate  Russian  aggression."The  House  had  passed  a  loan-guarantee  bill  and  a  non-binding  resolution  calling  for  sanctions,  but  Friday's  legislation  proposes  statutory  language  to  put  those  sanctions  into  law.President  Barack  Obama  is  to  meet  next  week  with  other  leaders  of  the  so-called  G7  group  of  industrialized  nations,  on  the  sidelines  of  a  nuclear  summit  in  the  Netherlands.  Russia  has  been  excluded  from  the  talks.Obama  signed  an  executive  order  that  authorizes  further  sanctions  on  key  sectors  of  the  Russian  economy  if  Moscow  does  not  act  to  deescalate  the  situation.Sanctions  affect  Russian  marketsWashington  had  already  announced  sanctions  Monday  on  11  individuals;  the  European  Union  had  imposed  travel  bans  and  asset  freezes  on  21  people.Swedish  Foreign  Minister  Carl  Bildt  told  CNN's  Christiane  Amanpour  that  the  new  round  of  U.S.  sanctions  would  be  "significantly  more  powerful  than  the  first  one."The  latest  round  "hits  significant  economic  interests  that  are  fairly  close  to  the  ruling  circles  in  Moscow,"  he  said.  "It  will  be  noticed."Markets  were  down  Friday  in  Moscow,  amid  uncertainty  in  the  business  community.The  Moscow  Interbank  Curency  Exchange,  or  MICEX  index,  fell  more  than  2%  --  bringing  its  2014  losses  to  14%.  The  ruble  rebounded  after  falling  early  in  the  day;  it  has  lost  about  10%  since  the  start  of  the  year.In  contrast,  the  markets  and  ruble  had  risen  Monday,  when  the  first  round  of  sanctions  was  announced  and  did  not  appear  to  target  those  in  Putin's  inner  circle.The  business  community  now  appears  to  fear  that  Putin  is  on  a  collision  course  with  the  West,  and  that  that  could  undermine  its  interests.Russia's  Foreign  Ministry  said  Friday  that  it  had  asked  Putin  to  draft  countermeasures  in  response  to  the  expanded  Western  sanctions.On  Thursday,  Moscow  imposed  measures  against  nine  U.S.  officials  and  lawmakers,  including  House  Speaker  John  Boehner,  Senate  Majority  Leader  Harry  Reid  and  Sens.  John  McCain,  Robert  Menendez,  Daniel  Coats  and  Mary  Landrieu,  according  to  the  Russian  Foreign  Ministry.Russia  sanctions:  EU  should  leave  trade  aloneSanctions  on  Russia:  Would  World  Cup  boycott  hit  harder?Opinion:  Putin's  breathtaking  lies  about  RussiaCrimea  remarries  --  but  that  divorce  will  be  messyCNN  Money:  U.S.  targets  Putin's  banker,  threatens  tradeCNN's  Frederik  Pleitgen  reported  from  Moscow  and  Nina  Dos  Santos  from  Brussels,  while  Laura  Smith-Spark  wrote  and  reported  from  London.

This  is  the  future  of  cycling.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Imagine  a  bicycle  that  was  more  than  a  means  to  get  you  to  work  in  the  morning,  but  a  personal  assistant  to  boot.  It  could  shield  you  from  oncoming  traffic,  look  up  weather  conditions  in  advance,  anticipate  the  road  ahead  and  make  adjustments  to  your  journey.  Imagine  it  could  also  double  as  smog  filter,  fit  compactly  on  your  bookshelf,  and  even  fly.Okay,  so  your  bicycle  won't  be  able  to  do  all  those  things  at  once,  but  hey,  any  one  of  those  features  makes  for  a  pretty  cool  ride.  Want  to  know  what  the  future  will  bring?  Read  on  to  see  how  tomorrow's  bicycles  might  look.The  smog  muncherAs  a  mode  of  transportation,  bikes  are  about  as  environmentally  friendly  as  it  gets.  The  Bangkok  based  Lightfog  Creative  and  Design  Company,  however,  has  upped  cycling's  already  soaring  ecological  ante  with  its  concept  for  an  air-purifying  bike.It  has  has  a  carbon  monoxide  and  dust  filter  mounted  at  the  front  and  the  theory  is  that  with  the  help  of  a  lithium-ion  battery,  the  aluminum  frame  would  use  electricity  to  generate  oxygen  from  an  onboard  water  tank.  At  the  moment,  the  idea  exists  solely  as  artistic  renderings  (the  company  has  yet  to  make  a  prototype,  though  one  is  supposedly  in  the  works).  Still,  the  idea  shows  potential,  as  evidenced  by  the  fact  that  it  recently  won  a  Red  Dot  design  award."Star  Wars"  speederAccording  to  Hollywood's  many  depictions  of  the  future,  we  should  all  be  making  our  travels  via  flying  car  or  hover  board.  While  the  present-day  is  irksomely  Earth-bound,  there  was  recently  a  modest  nod  to  the  world  we've  been  promised  for  decades  by  the  entertainment  industry.  California-based  engineering  company  Aerofex  has  created  a  flying  "hover  bike"  that  looks  like  it  was  plucked  from  the  set  of  Star  Wars.  The  "Jedi  bike"  floats  with  the  help  of  ducted  fans,  and  is  fairly  low-altitude  (soaring  up  to  a  maximum  15  feet  --  4.6  meters).Read  more:  The  18  propeller  helicopterThe  current  version  is  only  a  proof-of-concept  used  for  development,  but  Aerofex  says  it  is  now  working  now  on  a  production  version.  Alas,  it  is  unlikely  the  bike  will  ever  be  available  for  popular  consumption,  but  will  likely  be  limited  to  agricultural  and  humanitarian  uses.The  smartest  bike  in  the  roomFirst  conceived  at  MIT's  SENSEable  City  Lab,  the  Copenhagen  Wheel  is  a  wireless  device  that  turns  any  ordinary  bike  into  an  electronic  hybrid.  The  wheel  captures  energy  when  the  rider  is  going  over  easy  terrain  (i.e.  downhill)  and  stores  it  in  a  battery  pack.  Conversely,  the  saved  energy  is  used  to  give  riders  an  electronic  push  when  traversing  difficult  landscapes.Read:  MIT  drone  is  a  personal  tour  guideThe  device  has  a  sensor  which  learns  the  rider's  individual  style,  and  also  anticipates  aspects  of  the  ride  ahead,  including  road  conditions  and  carbon  monoxide  levels.  Riders  are  also  able  to  control  the  wheel  with  their  smartphones;  they  can  lock  and  unlock  it,  track  usage  statistics  (including  calories  burned  and  elevation  climbed)  and  select  a  level  of  motor  assistance.  Startup  Superpedestrian  brought  the  wheel  to  the  market  last  month,  and  has  started  taking  pre-orders  for  $799.Laser  footprintIn  the  last  few  years,  the  number  of  cyclists  on  the  road  has  skyrocketed,  which  is  great  for  many  reasons.  Unfortunately,  the  amount  of  cyclist  casualties  has  risen  dramatically  as  well.To  combat  the  problem,  a  physics  student  from  Brighton  University,  in  England,  invented  Blaze,  a  front-mounted  lamp  that  projects  a  green  laser  image  five  meters  in  front  of  a  bicycle  to  let  other  road  users  know  it  is  coming.  The  aim  is  to  help  prevent  vehicles  from  turning  across  a  cyclist's  path  by  increasing  his  or  her  "footprint"  on  the  road.Watch  this:  Pinarello's  road  racersBike  in  a  boxForget  what  engineering  experts  say,  according  to  Dutch  manufacturer  firm  PedalFactory,  putting  together  a  bike  is  about  as  complicated  as  making  lunch.  This  month,  the  company  has  just  started  international  shipments  of  the  world's  first  flat-pack,  self-assembly  bicycles."If  you  can  make  a  sandwich,  you  can  make  a  Sandwichbike,"  or  so  goes  the  company  motto.  At  €799.00  ($1,086),  the  price  may  seem  a  bit  steep  for  a  bike  you  build  yourself,  but  then  again,  all  the  materials  are  locally  and  responsibly  sourced,  and  each  bike  is  tested  for  weatherproofing  for  six  weeks  in  a  climate  control  room  at  an  independent  wood  research  institute.The  bike  comes  delivered  in  a  compact  box  bearing  19  parts  made  from  a  combination  of  beech  plywood  and  aluminum.  Supposedly,  it  can  be  constructed  in  as  little  as  45  minutes.</TEXT></DOC>

But  what  are  you  supposed  to  tell  them  when  it's  clear  that  "just  say  no,"  isn't  going  to  cut  it?</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(TIME.com)  --  With  each  passing  day,  it  seems,  smoking  pot  becomes  less  and  less  stigmatized  in  our  society.In  a  much-buzzed-about  piece  in  The  New  Yorker,  President  Obama  suggested  making  pot  legal  in  large  part  to  correct  the  vast  inequities  that  minorities  face  in  terms  of  cannabis-related  arrests  and  imprisonment.Besides,  said  the  president,  who  was  known  to  smoke  his  fair  share  of  weed  back  in  the  day,  "I  don't  think  it  is  more  dangerous  than  alcohol"  for  the  individual  user.Is  marijuana  as  safe  as  --  or  safer  than  --  alcohol?Even  the  straight-laced  Bill  Gates  recently  announced  his  support  of  legalization.  And  this  year's  Super  Bowl  has  been  dubbed  the  "Super  Doobie  Bowl,"  a  reference  to  the  fact  that  the  teams  vying  for  the  NFL  championship,  the  Denver  Broncos  and  Seattle  Seahawks,  hail  from  the  two  states  that  have  legalized  marijuana  for  recreational  use.Mainstream  websites  are  circulating  marijuana-laced  game-day  snack  recipes.  It  won't  be  long  before  Martha  Stewart  comes  up  with  her  own  pot-brownie  concoction.With  all  of  this  hanging  in  the  air,  it's  obvious  we  parents  should  be  talking  to  our  kids  about  smoking  dope.  But  what  are  we  supposed  to  tell  them  when  it's  clear  that  "just  say  no,"  isn't  going  to  cut  it?After  consulting  with  two  researchers  from  Northwestern  University's  Feinberg  School  of  Medicine,  I  now  know  what  I'm  going  to  tell  my  own  16-year-old:  Not  so  fast,  buddy.  Your  brain  simply  isn't  ready  for  you  to  start  using  pot."Adolescence  is  a  sensitive  time  for  brain  development,"  says  Matthew  J.  Smith,  a  research  assistant  professor  of  psychiatry  and  behavioral  sciences.  "If  a  teen  introduces  the  abuse  of  marijuana  at  that  point  in  their  life,  it  could  have  consequences  for  their  ability  to  problem  solve,  for  their  memory  and  for  critical  thinking  in  general."Unfortunately,  this  crucial  message  is  getting  lost  in  the  pro-legalization  fervor.  Use  of  pot  among  adolescents,  which  had  declined  from  the  late  1990s  through  the  mid-to-late  2000s,  is  again  on  the  rise,  according  to  the  National  Institute  on  Drug  Abuse.One  likely  reason:  "The  percentage  of  high-schoolers  who  see  great  risk  from  being  regular  marijuana  users  has  dropped,"  over  time,  the  agency  points  out.That  perception,  however,  is  all  wrong.  In  a  study  published  last  month,  Smith  and  his  colleagues  found  that  teens  who  smoked  a  lot  of  pot  had  abnormal  changes  in  their  brain  structures  related  to  working  memory  --  a  predictor  of  weak  academic  performance  and  impaired  everyday  functioning  --  and  that  they  did  poorly  on  memory-related  tasks.While  the  study  focused  on  heavy  marijuana  users  --  specifically,  those  who  indulged  daily  for  about  three  years  --  one  of  its  most  crucial  findings  related  not  to  the  amount  of  pot  an  adolescent  smoked,  but  when  he  or  she  started:  The  earlier  the  drug  was  taken  up,  the  worse  the  effects  on  the  brain."Marijuana  is  the  ideal  compound  to  screw  up  everything  for  a  kid,"  says  Hans  Breiter,  a  professor  of  psychiatry  and  behavioral  sciences  at  Northwestern  University's  Feinberg  School  of  Medicine  and  a  senior  author  of  the  study.  "If  you're  an  athlete,  a  chess  player,  a  debater  or  an  artist,  you  need  working  memory,  and  marijuana  hurts  the  brain  circuitry."Breiter,  who  himself  has  four  children  11  to  21,  adds:  "The  more  I  study  marijuana,  the  more  I  wonder  if  we  should  have  legislation  banning  the  use  of  it  for  everyone  under  30."The  study,  which  appeared  in  the  journal  Schizophrenia  Bulletin,  sought  to  distinguish  the  effects  of  daily  marijuana  use  on  the  adolescent  brain  from  the  effects  of  schizophrenia  on  the  deep  regions  of  the  brain  that  are  necessary  for  working  memory.Although  the  researchers  were  not  equating  pot  smokers  with  those  suffering  from  schizophrenia  --  a  chronic,  disabling  brain  disorder  --  they  did  find  parallels  in  one  respect.  "Schizophrenia  is  a  very  disruptive  illness  on  working  memory,  and  using  marijuana  produced  many  similar  effects  to  schizophrenia,"  Breiter  says.Pot  smokers,  schizophrenics  may  share  similar  brain  changesThe  scientists  noted  that  these  effects  were  still  apparent  two  years  after  their  subjects  had  stopped  using  marijuana,  but  more  research  will  be  needed  to  determine  whether  the  neurological  abnormalities  in  heavy  teen  pot  smokers  are  permanent.In  the  end,  you  can't  blame  kids  if  they've  come  to  believe  that  smoking  pot  is  not  that  big  a  deal.  The  cultural  cues  are  very  strong.  President  Obama  said  he  tries  to  fight  against  this  by  telling  his  own  two  teenage  daughters:  "It's  a  bad  idea,  a  waste  of  time,  not  very  healthy."But  I  think  that  parents  have  an  opportunity  --  and  an  obligation  --  to  be  even  more  pointed  with  our  children  by  saying  to  them:  "If  you're  tempted  to  smoke  pot,  please  hold  off  as  long  as  you  possibly  can.  Your  beautiful  brain  is  still  developing."This  story  was  initially  published  on  TIME.com.Why  it's  still  a  big  deal  if  your  teen  smokes  pot©  2012  TIME,  Inc.

I  love  you."Evans  told  the  court  he  looked  up  the  number  and  found  that  it  was  Miller's.  He  then  said  he  played  it  for  Coulson  and  several  other  senior  figures  at  the  paper."Later  in  the  day,  Andy  came  over,  he  wanted  to  hear  the  tape,"  Evans  said."Andy  told  me  to  make  a  copy  of  the  tape,  put  it  in  a  jiffy  bag;  take  it  down  the  the  front  gate  and  say  it's  been  dropped  anonymously,"  Evans  said.He  added  that  another  senior  figure  at  the  paper,  upon  hearing  the  message,  told  Evans:  "You're  a  company  man  now."Phone  hacking  furorWhen  asked  by  the  prosecution  if  he  had  ever  had  any  other  direct  communication  with  Coulson  concerning  phone  hacking,  Evans  said:  "Not  that  I  can  think  of,  no."He  then  listed  Coulson  among  figures  at  the  newspaper  who  he  said  definitely  knew  he  was  hacking  into  phones.Evans  also  admitted  to  recreational  drug  use,  and  to  being  arrested.  He  said  he  was  now  clean.On  Monday,  Miller's  former  partner,  actor  Jude  Law,  attended  the  trial.The  court  also  then  heard  that  Evans  had  already  admitted  to  conspiring  to  hack  phones  at  the  Sunday  Mirror  paper  between  February  2003  and  January  2005,  and  the  same  offense  at  the  News  of  the  World  up  to  2010,  according  to  Britain's  Press  Association  news  agency.He  also  pleaded  guilty  to  conspiracy  to  commit  misconduct  in  public  office,  it  said.Coulson  became  Cameron's  top  communications  adviser  after  leaving  News  of  the  World  in  an  earlier  round  of  the  hacking  scandal.  He  has  denied  knowledge  of  phone  hacking.At  the  height  of  the  phone  hacking  furor  in  July  2011,  which  resulted  in  the  closure  of  the  News  of  The  World,  Cameron  said  he  would  make  a  profound  apology  if  it  turned  out  that  Coulson  had  lied  about  his  knowledge  of  phone  hacking.The  hacking  allegations  prompted  Cameron  to  set  up  an  independent  inquiry,  led  by  Lord  Justice  Leveson,  to  make  recommendations  on  journalistic  ethics  and  examine  the  relationship  of  the  media  with  the  public,  police  and  politicians.READ:  Report:  Kate  Middleton's  phone  hacked,  court  toldREAD:  'Hundreds  of  attempts'  made  to  hack  UK  princes'  aides  phones</TEXT></DOC>

Gulli,  managing  editor  of  The  Strand,  recently  uncovered  the  14-page  manuscript  at  the  University  of  Texas  at  Austin's  Harry  Ransom  Center.  Gulli  says  he  was  researching  the  Mississippi-born  writer  when  he  came  across  what  he  describes  as  a  "treasure  trove"  of  Williams'  personal  papers  and  documents.Williams  is  one  of  America's  best-known  and  most  revered  playwrights.  During  the  peak  of  his  career  in  the  1940s  and  '50s,  he  was  praised  by  critics  and  scorned  by  social  conservatives  for  tackling  taboo  subjects  of  the  time,  including  rape,  incest  and  homosexuality.Many  of  his  plays  were  turned  into  hit  movies  featuring  Hollywood  stars  such  as  Marlon  Brando  and  Elizabeth  Taylor.  Williams  twice  won  the  Pulitzer  Prize  and  was  awarded  the  Presidential  Medal  of  Freedom.  Williams  died  in  1983.Gulli  was  initially  skeptical  that  the  story  had  never  before  been  published,  but  several  experts,  including  an  agent  for  Williams'  literary  estate,  said  they'd  never  heard  of  it."I  thought  it  was  captivating,"  Gulli  says.  "It's  raw  but  has  a  fresh  voice  and  shows  a  great  deal  of  maturity  for  his  age."Williams,  who  was  born  in  1911,  wrote  "Crazy  Night"  in  his  early  20s,  years  before  his  Broadway  success  with  plays  such  as  "A  Streetcar  Named  Desire"  and  "Cat  on  a  Hot  Tin  Roof."In  the  semi-autobiographical  story,  a  troubled  college  freshman  faces  flunking  out  of  school  on  the  last  night  of  spring  term.  It  explores  themes  of  love  and  deceit  and  includes  a  thinly  veiled  reference  to  Williams'  romance  with  one  of  his  college  classmates."To  me,  it's  a  great  highlight  to  find  something  new  from  somebody  I  grew  up  revering,"  Gulli  says.Gulli  has  a  knack  for  finding  long-lost  works.  In  the  last  five  years,  he's  discovered  previously  unpublished  stories  and  essays  from  authors  including  Agatha  Christie,  Graham  Greene,  H.G.  Wells  and  Mark  Twain.  But  Gulli  says  he  has  a  soft  spot  for  Williams."To  me  he's  as  relevant  today  as  he  was  when  his  works  were  first  published,"  Gulli  said.Indeed,  many  of  Williams  plays  are  still  performed  today.  "The  Glass  Menagerie"  first  premiered  in  New  York  on  March  31,  1945,  and  a  revival  recently  wrapped  a  successful  run  on  Broadway.What's  your  favorite  Tennessee  Williams  play?

Other  notable  Americans  expected  to  appear  on  forthcoming  stamps  include  pop  icon  Michael  Jackson,  singer  James  Brown,  rocker  Jimi  Hendrix,  talk-show  host  Johnny  Carson,  hoops  star  Wilt  Chamberlain,  actor  Charlton  Heston  and  gay-rights  leader  Harvey  Milk.The  document  from  the  U.S.  Postal  Service's  Citizens'  Stamp  Advisory  Committee  names  "approved  subjects"  and  says  that  design  work  on  most  of  them  has  already  begun.  But  a  USPS  spokesman  told  CNN  that  the  list,  dated  January  7,  is  still  subject  to  change.The  new  subjects  are  part  of  an  effort  by  the  cash-strapped  postal  agency  to  raise  revenues  by  issuing  more  stamps  of  pop-culture  figures,  which  are  popular  with  collectors.  In  November,  the  USPS  released  20  postage  stamps  honoring  Harry  Potter,  the  fictional  boy  wizard."The  postal  service  is  looking  to  bring  more  timely,  relevant,  contemporary  subjects  to  stamps  ...  pop-culture  subjects  appealing  to  younger  audiences,"  USPS  spokesman  Roy  Betts  said.  "It  creates  excitement."Next  year,  the  agency  also  is  expected  to  reissue  a  stamp  of  singer  Elvis  Presley,  which  became  its  all-time  top  seller  --  at  29  cents  --  when  it  debuted  in  1993.  (A  first-class  stamp  now  costs  49  cents.)The  Postal  Service  says  it  issues  some  stamps  to  "honor  men  and  women  who  have  made  extraordinary  contributions  to  American  society  and  culture."  It  used  to  be  that  someone  had  to  be  dead  for  at  least  five  years  before  they  could  appear  on  a  stamp,  but  the  USPS  ended  that  rule  in  2011  and  announced  that  even  living  people  could  be  featured.Jobs,  who  died  in  2011,  would  be  the  first  person  from  America's  computer  industry  to  be  honored  on  a  stamp."Steve  Jobs  made  major  contributions  and  is  worthy  of  this  recognition,"  Betts  said.On  social  media,  many  Friday  were  noting  the  irony  of  the  postal  service  honoring  someone  whose  products  helped  marginalize  snail  mail.Other  subjects  approved  for  stamps  in  the  coming  years,  according  to  the  committee's  list:  actress  Elizabeth  Taylor,  characters  from  TV's  "Sesame  Street"  and  the  "Peanuts"  comic  strip,  and  slain  Beatle  John  Lennon.U.S.  stamps  typically  honor  only  Americans,  but  the  USPS  has  begun  making  exceptions,  such  as  its  2010  stamp  celebrating  humanitarian  Mother  Teresa.But  Betts  cautioned  that  the  list  of  subjects,  which  was  published  Thursday  by  the  Post  and  widely  replicated  online,  is  not  final.The  names  on  the  list  "still  may  not  appear  on  a  postage  stamp,"  he  said.  "There  are  no  guarantees."The  12-member  Citizens'  Stamp  Advisory  Committee  considers  about  50,000  ideas  a  year,  mostly  from  the  public.  It  recommends  about  35  new  subjects  for  commemorative  stamps  each  year  to  the  postmaster  general,  who  makes  the  final  decision.</TEXT></DOC>

"Therefore,  we  will  leave  open  the  possibility  of  concluding  a  BSA  with  Afghanistan  later  this  year."In  his  separate  statement,  Hagel  said  he  strongly  supported  the  order  by  Obama  to  "ensure  adequate  plans  are  in  place  to  accomplish  an  orderly  withdrawal  by  the  end  of  the  year  should  the  United  States  not  keep  any  troops  in  Afghanistan  after  2014."Speaking  at  Joint  Base  Langley-Eustis  in  Virginia  Tuesday  afternoon,  Hagel  said  the  situation  in  Afghanistan  will  likely  be  a  top  item  on  the  agenda  at  a  NATO  ministerial  conference  in  Brussels  this  week.Obama,  he  said,  has  been  very  clear  that  the  possibility  of  U.S.  troops  staying  in  Afghanistan  depends  "on  whether  we  have  a  bilateral  security  agreement  signed  by  the  Afghani  government,  to  assure  our  rights  of  our  troops  and  other  important  elements  that  are  required  any  time  America  has  troops  in  another  country."Pakistani  official:  Don't  do  itA  senior  Pakistani  government  official  told  CNN  that  a  full  withdrawal  of  U.S.  troops  should  not  be  considered,  declaring  that  "the  zero  option  means  civil  war  in  Afghanistan."Speaking  on  condition  of  not  being  identified,  the  Pakistani  official  predicted  that  30%  of  Afghan  forces  would  desert  if  U.S.  forces  leave  the  country.For  the  Pentagon,  Obama's  order  means  preparing  for  all  contingencies."For  the  first  time,  the  commander  in  chief  has  told  us  to  begin  planning  for  a  complete  withdrawal"  from  Afghanistan,  a  senior  U.S.  official  told  CNN.While  the  option  to  keep  troops  there  remains,  the  situation  has  reached  a  point  where  the  Pentagon  has  to  begin  planning  for  all  possibilities,  the  official  added.More  than  33,000  U.S.  troops  remain  in  Afghanistan  as  the  Obama  administration  winds  down  the  almost  13-year  war  that  began  shortly  after  the  September  11,  2001,  terrorist  attacks.The  security  agreement  negotiated  between  Afghanistan  and  the  United  States  would  cover  a  continuing  mission  after  2014  focused  on  training  Afghan  forces  and  counterterrorism.Pentagon:  If  freed  Afghan  prisoners  return  to  fight,  they're  'legitimate  targets'Afghan  presidential  contender  says  he'll  sign  if  electedWhile  Karzai  has  balked  at  signing,  a  leading  contender  to  succeed  him  told  CNN's  Christiane  Amanpour  this  month  that  the  agreement  should  proceed.Presidential  candidate  Abdullah  Abdullah  said  he  would  sign  the  deal  to  keep  international  forces  in  Afghanistan,  and  aid  dollars  flowing,  if  elected  in  April.Abdullah  said  Afghanistan  will  need  the  financial  and  military  support  of  the  international  community  "for  years  to  come."White  House  spokesman  Jay  Carney  told  reporters  Tuesday  that  that  longer  it  takes  for  security  agreement  to  get  signed,  the  more  difficult  it  will  be  to  properly  plan  and  carry  out  a  U.S.  mission  after  2014.Continued  delay  would  result  in  a  smaller  and  less  ambitious  mission,  Carney  said.  Asked  what  happens  if  no  agreement  gets  signed,  he  said:  "We  cannot  and  will  not  have  U.S.  troops  on  the  ground"  without  a  signed  deal.Karzai's  not-so-crazy  end  gameLeading  contender  for  Afghanistan  president  vows  to  sign  troop  agreement  if  electedCNN's  Jim  Sciutto  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

But  he  almost  didn't  make  it  after  traveling  to  Atlanta  for  a  conference  last  week.8  tips  to  ease  winter  travel  woesOn  Wednesday,  more  than  3,300  flights  out  of  27,000  scheduled  U.S.  flights  had  been  canceled  by  about  5  p.m.  ET,  according  to  flight  tracking  service  FlightAware.com.  Those  cancellations  follow  more  than  1,300  flight  cancellations  Tuesday.A  normal  February  day  would  see  fewer  than  100  cancellations,  according  to  FlightAware's  Daniel  Baker.Dimai  had  planned  to  take  a  United  Airlines  flight  from  Atlanta  to  Newark,  New  Jersey,  on  Wednesday  evening,  where  he  would  connect  to  a  Frankfurt,  Germany,  flight  to  get  him  home  by  Thursday  morning.  That  would  give  him  a  day  to  get  to  his  civil  ceremony  appointment  at  the  government  office  in  Dornbirn,  Austria.  A  church  wedding  with  family  attending  is  scheduled  for  Monday."Without  this  appointment  there  will  be  no  wedding,"  he  told  CNN  earlier  Wednesday  via  e-mail.Seeing  the  weather  reports,  Dimai  went  to  the  airport  two  days  ago  to  rebook  his  first  flight  for  Wednesday  morning.  When  he  checked  with  the  airline  again,  that  flight  had  been  canceled.  United  rebooked  him  on  one  of  the  few  Delta  Air  Lines  flights  leaving  Atlanta  on  Wednesday,  which  arrived  in  sunny  and  clear  Detroit  around  1:30  p.m.  ET."I  finally  think  I've  found  the  right  woman  and  I  thought  it's  possible  the  wedding  will  not  happen,"  said  Dimai,  laughing  as  he  called  CNN  just  after  landing  in  Detroit.  "I've  been  scared  and  sad  and  slightly  hopeful  to  get  it  done."Dimai  reported  snow  on  the  ground  in  Detroit,  but  otherwise  a  nice  and  clear  sunny  day  for  flying  as  he  waited  for  his  flight  to  Frankfurt."Only  due  to  the  help  and  incredible  support  of  the  employees  of  United  and  Delta,  I  will  make  it  home  and  I  am  looking  forward  to  marry(ing)  my  wife,"  he  added.Dimai  was  one  of  the  lucky  ones.Most  of  the  cancellations  Wednesday  are  at  Hartsfield-Jackson  Atlanta  International  Airport,  where  more  than  1,600,  or  nearly  70%  of  flights,  have  been  canceled,  according  to  FlightAware.  Charlotte  Douglas  International  Airport  in  North  Carolina  is  the  second  most-affected  airport,  with  more  than  50%  of  its  schedule  canceled.Atlanta-based  Delta  Air  Lines  canceled  more  than  half  of  its  Wednesday  flights  systemwide,  and  had  already  canceled  about  1,200  Thursday  flights  by  late  Wednesday  afternoon."We  anticipate  a  moderate  resumption  of  arrivals  beginning  mid-morning  (Thursday)  followed  by  a  set  of  departures  in  the  2:00  hour  ET,"  Delta  spokesman  Morgan  Durrant  said  in  a  statement.  "Our  plan  is  to  then  gradually  ramp  up  Atlanta  operations  to  our  usual  levels  through  the  day  Thursday  and  into  Friday."Southwest,  which  also  operates  AirTran  Airways,  wasn't  as  severely  affected  by  the  storm.  By  Wednesday  morning,  about  350  of  about  3,500  total  Wednesday  flights  had  been  canceled  for  both  airlines  due  to  the  weather,  said  Southwest  spokesman  Dan  Landson.  The  airlines  have  suspended  operations  in  Atlanta  through  11  a.m.  Thursday.Airlines  don't  like  ice.Delta  and  Southwest  Airlines  didn't  wait  for  Wednesday's  ice  storm  to  move  many  of  their  aircraft  out  of  Atlanta.  They  flew  airplanes  to  other  airports  to  keep  them  out  of  the  path  of  the  storm.Winter  storms  do  most  of  their  damage  to  air  travel  on  the  ground,  requiring  that  aircraft  be  de-iced  while  runways  and  taxiways  are  cleared  and  treated,  all  while  passengers,  luggage  and  cargo  get  loaded  into  an  airplane."Everything  slows  to  a  crawl  as  personnel  and  ground  equipment  get  bogged  down  in  the  slush,"  wrote  commercial  pilot  Patrick  Smith,  who  blogs  about  flight  at  Askthepilot.com,  in  his  latest  book."Planes,  meanwhile,  cannot  take  off  with  ice  or  snow  adhering  to  the  wings,  and  need  to  sprayed  down,"  wrote  Smith.  It's  not  the  weight  of  the  ice  "but  the  way  it  disrupts  airflow  over  and  around  a  wing's  carefully  sculpted  contours."This  can  take  a  half-hour  or  more  per  plane,  and  to  preclude  further  buildup  it  needs  to  be  done  as  close  to  departure  as  possible.  And  with  fluid  costing  upwards  of  $5  per  gallon,  airlines  dread  snowstorms  almost  as  much  as  strikes,  wars  and  recessions.  When  you  add  in  handling  and  storage  costs,  spraying  a  single  jet  can  cost  tens  of  thousands  of  dollars."It's  going  to  get  worse  before  it  gets  better  across  the  Eastern  United  States.The  Atlanta  and  Charlotte  airports  expect  frozen  precipitation  to  continue  through  Thursday  morning,  according  to  FlightAware.At  least  most  air  travelers  heading  through  Atlanta  got  the  message  about  cancellations  and  delays  before  heading  to  the  airport.  About  175  passengers  spent  Tuesday  night  at  the  airport,  said  airport  spokesman  Reese  McCranie.  "Those  numbers  are  far  less  than  the  storm  we  had  two  weeks  ago."The  stranded  passengers  were  outnumbered  by  the  280  airport  employees  who  worked  overnight.The  storm's  impact  will  be  felt  most  heavily  in  Atlanta  and  airports  in  North  and  South  Carolina,  but  the  weather  system  is  on  the  move."As  the  storm  moves  East  and  Northeast,  airport  forecasts  are  calling  for  frozen  precipitation  at  airports  including  D.C.,  Philadelphia,  New  York  and  Boston,"  FlightAware's  Baker  said  in  a  statement.Once  the  storm  lets  up,  it  could  take  days  before  the  airlines  can  get  all  crew  and  aircraft  back  into  position.Airline  customers  should  check  their  flight  status  with  airlines  before  departing  for  the  airport.  Many  airlines  are  offering  flexible,  no-fee  changes  to  travel  dates.</TEXT></DOC>

John  Henson  is  also  survived  by  his  wife,  Gyongyi,  and  his  siblings  Lisa,  Cheryl,  Brian  and  Heather.Two  other  members  of  his  family  had  top  jobs  in  their  father's  namesake  company,  with  Brian  Henson  as  chairman  and  Lisa  Henson  as  CEO.  John  Henson  is  listed  prominently  as  one  of  five  members  of  "the  Henson  family"  on  the  company's  website.John  Henson  served  as  a  shareholder  and  board  member  of  The  Jim  Henson  Company.According  to  imdb.com,  John  Henson  was  active  in  the  family  business  in  the  1980s,  1990s  and  2000s,  perhaps  most  notably  for  his  portrayal  of  Sweetums,  a  large,  gruff-looking,  lovable  character  on  "The  Muppets."His  father,  Jim,  died  suddenly  in  1990,  after  a  celebrated  career  in  which  he  launched  shows  like  "The  Muppets,"  "Fraggle  Rock"  and  created  beloved  characters  from  "Sesame  Street"  such  as  Big  Bird,  Elmo,  the  Cookie  Monster  and  Oscar  the  Grouch.Last  April,  John's  mother,  Jane  Nabel  Henson  --  who  met  Jim  in  a  puppetry  class  at  the  University  of  Maryland  in  1954  and  married  him  five  yeas  later  --  died  at  the  age  of  79  after  a  "long  battle  with  cancer."Jane  Henson  dies  of  cancerThe  Jim  Henson  Company  itself  remains  busy  with  fantasy  and  sci-fi  productions  as  well  as  children's  animated  series  such  as  "Sid  the  Science  Kid"  and  "Dinosaur  Train."People  we've  lost  in  2014</TEXT></DOC>

Along  the  way,  he  crafted  a  character  that  stands  apart  as  one  of  the  greatest  fictional  dads  on  TV.His  costar  Joseph  Marcell,  who  portrayed  the  family  butler  Geoffrey,  had  it  right  when  he  said  that  Avery  "strove  to  present  an  Uncle  Phil  that  everybody  wishes  was  their  uncle."  As  a  result,  his  death  this  week  has  left  a  lot  of  fans  feeling  as  though  they've  lost  a  family  member.Every  "Fresh  Prince"  fan  probably  has  his  or  her  own  reasons  why  Uncle  Phil  was  at  the  heart  of  the  memorable  comedy.  Here  are  our  top  five:1.  He  was  there  for  you  in  a  jam.In  case  you  missed  "Fresh  Prince"  during  its  run  from  1990  to  1996,  or  somehow  have  escaped  the  endless  repeats  on  basic  cable  in  the  years  since,  here's  a  recap  of  the  premise:  Now-famous  blockbuster  actor  Will  Smith  portrayed  a  mischievous  Philadelphia  teen  who  was  sent  to  live  with  his  rich  relatives  in  Bel-Air.  Cue  the  culture  clash  as  free-spirited  Will  had  to  adjust  to  his  Uncle  Phil's  rigorous  rules.Most  of  the  humor  came  from  that  dynamic,  but  when  Will  --  and,  often,  Phil's  son  Carlton  (Alfonso  Ribeiro)  --  really  needed  him,  he  didn't  hesitate  to  help  them  out.  That  was  established  clearly  with  an  episode  in  season  one,  when  Phil  came  to  Will's  rescue  at  a  pool  hall  after  the  kid  lost  money  and  a  car  to  a  hustler.2.  Underneath  his  grizzly  exterior  was  a  sensitive  role  model.Although  Uncle  Phil  and  Will  had  their  fights,  the  lawyer  and  eventual  judge  became  a  father  figure  for  Smith's  character.This  was  shown  in  one  heartbreaking  season  four  episode,  when  Will's  biological  father  re-enters  the  picture  only  to  leave  his  son  once  again.  A  distraught  Will  turned  to  his  uncle,  who  readily  embraced  him.  No  matter  how  many  times  we  watch  this,  we  always  get  misty.3.  He  was  not  a  man  to  be  trifled  with.Every  so  often  we  saw  glimpses  of  Uncle  Phil's  soft  side,  but  it  was  his  stern  parenting  style  that  always  left  us  in  stitches.  Take,  for  example,  the  way  he  handled  one  of  Carlton  and  Will's  failed  schemes  in  season  two:Or  how  he  completely  shut  down  this  guy's  attempt  to  smoke  in  an  elevator  ...  and  then  took  his  phone:And  how  could  we  forget  his  confrontation  at  a  police  station  in  season  one?4.  He  had  a  go-to  move  for  kicking  people  out  of  his  house.Whenever  you  saw  Will  Smith's  real-life  friend  and  recording  partner  DJ  Jazzy  Jeff  on-screen  in  "The  Fresh  Prince  of  Bel-Air,"  you  knew  he  wasn't  going  to  be  around  for  long.  The  running  gag  on  the  sitcom  was  that  Jazzy  Jeff's  character,  Jazz,  was  always  getting  thrown  out  of  Uncle  Phil's  mansion.  It  happened  so  often  it  became  a  patented  move.5.  He  could  bust  a  move  when  he  wanted  to.Uncle  Phil  was  constantly  getting  ribbed  by  his  family  --  and  especially  Will  --  about  his  weight,  but  the  regal  patriarch  wasn't  without  a  sense  of  humor.Will  brought  it  out  of  him  with  this  classic  dance  scene  from  season  five.</TEXT></DOC>

If  you  haven't  seen  the  series  finale  of  "How  I  Met  Your  Mother,"  read  no  further(CNN)  --  In  the  end,  it  was  always  Robin.That  was  the  big  bombshell  from  Monday  night's  final  episode  of  "How  I  Met  Your  Mother,"  which  piled  on  one  surprise  after  another.When  Ted  finally  finished  the  story  for  his  kids,  they  called  him  on  it:  His  story  wasn't  all  about  how  he  met  their  mother  (she  was  barely  in  the  story),  it  was  about  how  much  he  loved  Robin.As  many  had  theorized,  the  mother  of  Ted's  children  (whose  name  was  Tracy  McConnell,  by  the  way),  had  been  dead  for  years  by  the  time  he  told  his  story.So,  in  the  last  of  many  flash-forwards  in  this  finale,  Ted  went  to  the  street  in  front  of  Robin's  apartment  and  showed  up  with  that  blue  French  horn,  the  same  one  he  stole  for  her  in  the  first  episode.Robin,  of  course,  had  long  ago  divorced  Barney  --  the  first  big  shocker  of  the  night.Barney,  however,  we  would  learn,  became  a  father,  and  in  one  of  several  touching  scenes  from  the  episode,  finally  found  the  love  of  his  life  in  baby  Ellie.Marshall  and  Lily,  pregnant  with  their  second  child  in  the  present  day,  went  on  to  have  a  third,  but  Lily  was  heartbroken  when  Robin  decided  she  couldn't  be  as  much  a  part  of  their  gang  anymore,  due  in  part  to  Barney  continuing  to  be,  well,  Barney  around  her.And  what  about  the  mother,  aka  Tracy?  We  finally  did  see  that  moment  of  the  two  meeting  at  that  train  station,  and  it  was  played  perfectly  by  Josh  Radnor  and  the  Emmy-worthy  Cristin  Milioti.They  wouldn't  get  married  for  several  years,  having  postponed  their  wedding  when  Tracy  got  pregnant  with  their  first  child.Ted  shared  with  his  kids  that  he  learned  he  had  to  love  their  mother  with  everything  he  had  in  him,  through  good  times  and  bad,  especially  during  her  illness.Needless  to  say,  the  show  stayed  true  to  form,  as  it  had  in  all  its  nine  years,  wearing  its  heart  on  its  sleeve.  And  if  your  eyes  stayed  dry  through  the  entire  episode,  you're  probably  a  stronger  person  than  most  viewers.Of  course,  the  big  Robin  twist  didn't  exactly  sit  well  with  everyone  online  (people  such  as  Rocco  Horvath  @RoccoRacingAMA,  who  tweeted,  "It  took  me  so  long  to  get  over  the  fact  Ted  and  Robin  weren't  going  to  end  up  together  and  now  this?!  Mixed  Emotions"),  and  the  finale  seems  to  have  split  viewers  more  than  any  since  "Lost."Other  viewers  were  more  forgiving.  "#HIMYM  creators  stayed  true  to  the  story,"  tweeted  fan  John  Eisele.  "Finale  fit  the  show,  even  if  it  is  not  what  I  wanted.  Can't  stop  thinking  about  it.  #HIMYMFinale."What  do  you  think?  Do  you  wish  Tracy  had  stayed  alive  and  Ted  didn't  ultimately  end  up  with  Robin?  Or  do  you  think  it  was  a  fitting  ending?  For  that  matter,  what  do  you  think  about  Barney  and  Robin  splitting  up?  Let  us  know  in  the  comments  and  give  yourself  a  self-five  for  making  it  all  the  way  through  nine  seasons.</TEXT></DOC>

It  was  100  meters  wide  and  600  meters  long,  but  only  the  lower  sections  of  the  structure  remain.The  Colossi  of  Memnon,  which  mark  the  entrance  of  the  temple  of  Amenhotep  III,  are  the  most  visible  remains  of  what  was  once  the  most  richly  ornamented  of  all  Theban  monuments,  says  the  WMF."The  temple  structure  was  originally  destroyed  by  earthquakes,  and,  since  it  was  never  fully  excavated,  the  site  was  overgrown  with  vegetation  and  threatened  by  seasonal  floods  and  agricultural  development,"  says  the  organization."These  problems  were  compounded  by  an  increase  in  surface  salts  from  rising  groundwater,  a  by-product  of  the  construction  of  the  Aswan  High  Dam  in  the  1960s."Luxor,  635  kilometers  from  Cairo,  is  divided  by  the  Nile  into  two  areas  commonly  referred  to  as  the  East  and  West  Bank  --  the  latter  home  to  some  of  Egypt's  most  prized  ancient  temples  and  monuments.The  unveiling  comes  at  a  time  when  Egypt's  tourism  sector  is  fighting  to  pull  itself  out  of  a  slump  due  to  political  instability  that's  lingered  since  the  ousting  of  Hosni  Mubarak  in  2011.According  to  the  Daily  News  Egypt,  Tourism  Minister  Hisham  Zaazou  said  on  Saturday  that  the  tourism  sector  is  completely  collapsed,  adding  that  great  changes  are  needed  to  improve  conditions.Egypt  dig  unearths  3,600-year-old  mummyPharaoh's  tomb  sheds  light  on  shadowy  Egyptian  dynastyTomb  of  ancient  Egypt's  beer  maker  to  the  gods  of  the  dead  disocveredMystery  surrounds  Egyptian  sphinx  unearthed  in  Israel</TEXT></DOC>

Check  out  these  snapshots  and  start  planning  your  own  Ireland  escape.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Kevin  Kane's  love  affair  with  Ireland  began  in  2000,  when  he  and  his  then-fiancee  piggybacked  on  a  trip  with  his  brothers  and  their  wives.The  39-year-old  financial  adviser  from  Havertown,  Pennsylvania,  has  been  back  six  times  since,  taking  his  now  wife,  brothers  and  mother  on  various  trips  that  spanned  nearly  every  county  in  Ireland  and  Northern  Ireland.Ahead  of  St.  Patrick's  Day,  Kane  and  other  CNN  readers  shared  their  best  memories  and  photos  from  mesmerizing  visits  to  the  Emerald  Isle.The  green  and  rugged  Dingle  Peninsula,  in  the  southwest  of  Ireland,  is  Kane's  favorite  destination,  he  wrote,  though  "the  Glens  of  Antrim  are  spectacular  in  November,  the  Ring  of  Kerry  cannot  be  described  adequately  by  James  Joyce  himself  on  a  clear  day  in  June,  and  the  vibrancy  of  Galway  and  Westport  are  enough  to  recharge  the  soul  as  you  wander  joyfully  from  Tobercurry  to  Ennis."Kane  offered  a  few  tips  for  the  first-time  visitor:Don't  be  overly  ambitious  on  your  first  trip.  "Pick  a  few  towns  to  stay  in  and  do  several  days  in  each.  One-hundred  miles  between  towns  is  not  a  two-hour  drive  as  you  might  expect.  If  there  are  no  major  motorways,  it  could  easily  become  a  harrowing  four-hour  trip  for  the  novice  European  driver."Talk  to  the  locals  in  pubs.  "Ask  questions,  don't  fake  a  brogue,  and  listen  to  the  suggestions  they  are  sure  to  make  about  what  to  see  in  that  immediate  area.  The  Irish  are  fiercely  parochial  and  love  to  show  off  their  town's  hidden  secrets  to  tourists."Do  something  off  the  beaten  path.  "Take  a  ferry  out  to  an  island  to  walk  around  a  bit,  find  an  Abbey  ruin  in  a  field  to  explore,  take  a  flask  of  Jameson  and  hike  up  a  mountain.

He  is  the  author  of  "In  Stitches,"  a  humorous  memoir  about  growing  up  Asian-American  and  becoming  a  doctor.(CNN)  --  Last  year  was  the  Year  of  the  Butt.According  to  the  American  Society  for  Aesthetic  Plastic  Surgery,  there  was  a  58%  increase  in  buttock  enhancement  surgery  in  2013  compared  to  the  year  before.  This  operation  had  the  largest  gains  of  all  cosmetic  procedures  for  the  year.So  why  are  so  many  Americans  undergoing  surgery  to  enhance  their  derrieres?I  believe  the  answer  lies  with  the  media,  both  broadcast  and  social.  Plastic  surgeons  are  seeing  more  and  more  women  who  want  the  backsides  of  various  stars.  While  I  don't  hear  Jennifer  Lopez's  name  much  anymore,  other  stars  with  ample  behinds  have  taken  her  place.Ratings  for  her  reality  show  may  be  declining,  but  Kim  Kardashian  is  still  the  poster  child  for  a  large  and  shapely  backside.  In  fact,  a  recent  butt  selfie  (also  known  as  a  "belfie")  on  Instagram  went  viral  with  over  1  million  admirers  "liking"  it.  Beyonce's  skimpy  outfit  at  the  Grammy  Awards  this  year  displayed  her  well-rounded  tush  for  all  to  see  and  admire.  And  Internet  sensation  Jen  Selter's  nearly  impossibly  round  and  smooth  bottom  is  quickly  becoming  the  most  requested  rear  end  of  all.  In  fact,  one  of  my  patients  even  dubbed  it  the  "Eighth  Wonder  Of  The  World."Getting  back  at  your  ex  --  by  getting  surgeryIt's  not  easy  to  get  curves  like  theirs.  The  most  common  type  of  buttock  enhancement,  called  the  "Brazilian  Butt  Lift,"  involves  liposuctioning  fat  from  the  thighs  or  hips,  purifying  it,  and  then  re-injecting  it  into  the  buttocks.The  surgery  typically  takes  a  minimum  of  two  to  three  hours  to  complete  and  costs  more  than  $5,000.  In  addition,  I  instruct  my  patients  to  avoid  sitting  on  their  bottom  for  a  month  in  order  to  prevent  the  fat  and  derriere  from  flattening  out.  Not  an  easy  thing  to  do.The  other  technique  of  buttock  enhancement  involves  insertion  of  solid  silicone  implants,  one  in  each  cheek.  This  surgery  can  be  quite  painful,  and  in  the  wrong  hands  has  a  high  risk  of  infection  and  implant  displacement.  Because  of  this,  it's  not  an  operation  that  I  perform.Interestingly,  according  to  the  American  Society  for  Aesthetic  Plastic  Surgery,  the  other  procedure  that  underwent  a  huge  increase  in  2013  was  labiaplasty.  Last  year  the  number  of  women  undergoing  labiaplasty  increased  by  a  whopping  44%.Asia's  ideal  beauty:  Looking  CaucasianSo  what  exactly  is  labiaplasty?This  surgery  involves  removal  of  excess  skin  from  a  woman's  labia  minora.  Yes,  the  skin  is  cut  off  in  order  to  treat  problems  such  as  chafing,  pain  during  intercourse,  and  even  cosmetic  concerns.This  field  of  cosmetic  surgery  has  been  dubbed  "cosmetic  gynecology"  and  is  being  increasingly  performed  by  both  plastic  surgeons  and  gynecologists.  In  fact,  between  2012  and  2013  the  number  of  plastic  surgeons  performing  labiaplasty  increased  from  21%-29%.So  why  are  more  and  more  women  having  this  done?  According  to  my  esteemed  colleague  Dr.  Christine  Hamouri,  "The  reality  is  that  women  have  been  grooming  themselves  differently  for  about  the  past  10  years,  with  many  eliminating  pubic  hair  altogether,  and  consequently,  they  are  noticing  what  things  look  like  in  that  region  as  a  result.  Many  of  my  patients  want  to  achieve  a  clean,  smooth  look  as  they  would  with  their  face  and  underarms."So  what  do  you  think?  Would  you  consider  having  one  of  these  increasingly  popular  "below-the-belt"  procedures?The  opinions  expressed  in  this  article  are  solely  those  of  Dr.  Anthony  Youn.</TEXT></DOC>

No  charges  have  been  filed  and  authorities  have  not  commented  publicly  on  the  investigation.That  2012  shooting  is  separate  from  a  2013  killing  in  which  Hernandez  is  charged  and  awaiting  trial.Hernandez,  23,  was  indicted  for  first-degree  murder  and  weapons  charges  by  a  different  grand  jury  in  August  ,  2013,  in  the  shooting  death  of  his  friend  Odin  Lloyd.  Hernandez  has  pleaded  not  guilty.The  former  New  England  Patriots'  tight  end  was  arrested  in  late  June,  10  days  after  authorities  say  Lloyd,  a  27-year-old  semi-pro  football  player,  was  killed  in  North  Attleborough,  Massachusetts.The  search  warrant  and  affidavit  reveal  that  an  anonymous  tipster  contacted  police  days  after  Lloyd's  execution-style  shooting  to  talk  about  the  separate  drive-by  shooting  the  previous  year.A  man  who  was  identified  as  a  security  supervisor  at  a  nightclub  in  Boston  tipped  off  authorities  that  he  "had  knowledge  the  two  incidents  were  related,"  according  to  the  newly  released  search  warrant,  which  was  executed  in  December.When  a  dispatcher  asked  how  the  tipster  knew  about  two  incidents  that  occurred  nearly  a  year  apart,  the  caller  said,  "Someone  accidentally  spilled  the  beans  on  me,"  according  to  the  warrant's  affidavit,  which  didn't  elaborate  on  that  point.In  the  affidavit,  a  detective  wrote  that  the  man  had  "very  specific  details"  about  a  suspicious  vehicle  with  Rhode  Island  license  plates,  and  information  about  the  date,  time,  and  place  of  the  2012  double  homicide.  The  man  told  detectives  his  source  for  the  information  was  a  patron  of  the  nightclub  who  he  knew  as  "B"  or  "G."The  affidavit  said  that,  before  the  tipster's  call,  Boston  detectives  involved  in  the  2012  drive-by  investigation  were  watching  TV  news  reports  when  they  heard  that  Hernandez  was  a  possible  suspect  in  Odin  Lloyd's  murder.  The  detectives  remembered  seeing  Hernandez  on  the  nightclub's  surveillance  video  screened  in  July,  2012.These  two  disparate  pieces  of  information  prompted  police  to  take  a  closer  look  at  surveillance  videos  already  examined,  including  those  from  another  nightclub,  called  Cure,  and  a  nearby  parking  garage,  according  to  the  court  documents.Judge  seizes  home  of  Aaron  HernandezAfter  going  back  to  the  surveillance  tapes,  authorities  recognized  Hernandez  driving  a  silver  Toyota  4Runner  into  a  parking  garage  just  after  midnight  on  July  16,  2012,  the  warrant  states.  About  a  half  hour  later,  Hernandez  is  seen  with  another  man  later  identified  as  Alexander  Bradley  following  the  soon-to-be  victims  of  the  double  homicide  and  two  other  men  as  they  entered  the  nightclub  Cure  about  midnight,  the  affidavit  adds.Ten  minutes  later,  "after  consuming  two  drinks,"  Hernandez  is  seen  leaving  Cure  with  Bradley.  the  document  says.At  about  2:20  a.m.,  a  video  reviewed  by  police  showed  the  same  silver  SUV  looping  around  the  block  "at  a  very  slow  rate  of  speed"  after  the  victims  leave  the  club  and  enter  a  parking  garage,  the  documents  show.A  short  time  later,  police  said,  victims  Daniel  Abreu  and  Safiro  Furtado,  were  fatally  shot  in  a  2003  BMW.  Two  others  in  the  car  survived.  There  is  no  video  of  the  shooting.One  of  the  survivors  told  police  that  just  before  the  gunfire,  an  SUV  was  stopped  next  to  them  at  a  red  light.According  to  the  documents,  another  witness  came  forward  on  July  19,  2012,  days  after  the  double  homicide.  A  man  told  police  he  and  a  friend  saw  a  Nissan  or  Toyota  SUV  with  Rhode  Island  plates  pull  next  to  his  car,  then  run  a  red  light  the  night  of  the  double  homicide.  The  driver  was  described  as  a  "light-skinned  Hispanic  man  with  short  hair,"  the  documents  state.At  the  next  intersection,  the  witness  said,  the  same  SUV  pulled  next  to  a  BMW.  Then,  according  to  the  warrant,  the  witness  heard  six  quick  gunshots,  pulled  up  to  the  BMW,  and  saw  the  wounded  men  inside.  He  called  police.At  the  time,  Boston  police  asked  the  public  to  be  on  the  lookout  for  a  light-colored  or  silver  SUV  but  were  unable  to  locate  the  vehicle  with  Rhode  Island  plates.That  changed  after  Lloyd's  murder  when  the  focus  on  Hernandez  as  a  possible  suspect  in  Lloyd's  death  led  police  to  his  uncle's  home  in  Bristol,  Connecticut.Who  was  Odin  LloydInside  the  uncle's  garage,  authorities  discovered  a  silver  Toyota  4Runner  with  Rhode  Island  license  plates,  according  to  sources.  As  CNN  has  previously  reported,  law  enforcement  sources  believe  it  is  the  same  vehicle  described  in  the  unsolved  double  homicide  in  Boston.The  warrant  confirms  the  vehicle  is  the  same  SUV  given  to  Hernandez  by  a  dealership  return  for  promoting  its  business.Police  have  since  recovered  a  .38  caliber  handgun  they've  identified  as  the  murder  weapon  in  the  unsolved  double  homicide  in  Boston.  But  police  have  not  established  a  connection  between  the  gun  and  Hernandez.Hernandez  hit  with  wrongful  death  suitAlexander  Bradley,  the  man  identified  by  the  document  and  law  enforcement  sources  as  being  with  Hernandez  in  the  club  the  night  of  the  double  homicide,  is  suing  Hernandez  for  allegedly  shooting  him  in  the  face  last  year  in  Florida  after  they  left  a  Miami  strip  club.According  to  law  enforcement  sources,  Bradley  has  testified  before  separate  grand  juries  investigating  the  unsolved  Boston  homicides  and  Lloyd's  murder.However,  before  Bradley  appeared  before  the  grand  juries,  he  was  jailed  in  Connecticut  because  he  failed  to  show  up  despite  a  subpoena.The  new  court  documents  state  while  in  jail,  Bradley's  calls  were  routinely  recorded.  According  to  the  documents,  when  a  correction's  officer  listened  to  the  conversations  --  five  of  them  in  October,  2013  --  he  heard  Bradley  "discussing  details  of  the  Boston  homicide  investigation."The  affidavit  doesn't  reveal  who  he  was  talking  to  or  exactly  what  was  said.Bradley's  attorney  did  not  respond  to  a  CNN  call  on  Thursday.  He  previously  has  declined  to  address  any  details  about  his  client  beyond  acknowledging  the  lawsuit.</TEXT></DOC>

He  is  the  author  of  "Jimmy  Carter"  and  "Governing  America."(CNN)  --  The  year  ended  with  the  familiar  laments  about  partisan  gridlock  in  Washington,  and  2014  began  with  more  of  the  same.  The  list  of  failures  that  can  be  attributed  to  the  parties  constantly  bickering  is  long.  Congress  has  been  unable  to  address  the  big  problems  of  the  day,  such  as  immigration  or  climate  change,  and  party  polarization  has  caused  ongoing  distress  in  economic  markets.But  with  all  of  our  discussions  of  difference  and  discord,  too  often  we  miss  some  areas  where  both  parties  are  actually  in  unspoken  agreement.  There  is  a  consensus  view  that  encapsulates  what's  really  wrong  in  Washington.There  are  three  points  of  agreement  that  have  had  particularly  ill  effects  on  the  nation:The  national  security  stateNeither  party  is  interested  in  seriously  reforming  our  national  security  state.  This  is  an  old  problem.  In  1961,  President  Dwight  Eisenhower  warned  during  his  farewell  address  that  the  "military-industrial  complex"  that  was  created  during  the  Cold  War  threatened  the  nation's  budget,  its  military  strategy  and  its  civil  liberties.Over  half  a  century  later,  the  problem  continues.  For  all  the  fights  that  have  taken  place  on  Capitol  Hill,  it  is  remarkable  how  the  national  security  system  created  in  the  wake  of  9/11  has  proven  so  resilient.After  the  National  Security  Agency  surveillance  revelations  of  2013,  there  has  certainly  been  more  momentum  for  restricting  how  much  information  the  federal  government  can  collect  in  pursuit  of  terrorists.  But  thus  far  the  push  has  been  limited.The  leaders  of  both  parties  have  been  extremely  hesitant  to  make  this  a  priority  issue,  with  most  of  them  fearing  the  blame  that  would  result  if  another  attack  takes  place  following  any  reforms.  Even  President  Barack  Obama  --  who  once  championed  these  kinds  of  limitations  and  whose  reputation  among  his  supporters  has  been  severely  damaged  by  his  change  of  heart  on  these  issues  --  responded  to  the  report  of  a  presidential  commission  with  words  of  caution  about  how  far  he  take  reform.The  danger  of  mass  surveillance  is  that  it  severely  infringes  on  civil  liberties  and  erodes  the  kinds  of  freedoms  our  war  against  terrorism  aimed  to  protect.  When  the  surveillance  of  foreign  leaders  was  revealed  by  Edward  Snowden's  disclosures,  it  had  an  extremely  damaging  impact  on  U.S.  diplomatic  relations  with  key  allies  and  undermined  support  for  the  U.S.  overseas.Neither  have  we  seen  much  momentum  for  serious  scrutiny  of  the  massive  defense  budget.  Budget  cuts  from  the  sequestration  measure  posed  a  threat  to  military  contracts,  many  of  which  are  outdated  and  were  designed  to  please  congressional  districts  rather  than  making  rational  defense  policy.  But  even  that  has  receded.  The  budget  deal  orchestrated  last  month  by  Democrat  Sen.  Patty  Murray  and  Republican  Rep.  Paul  Ryan  provided  substantial  relief  from  the  cuts  to  defense  spending.There  is  no  shortage  of  evidence  that  the  military  budget  is  bloated  and  that  defense  spending  often  pours  valuable  resources  into  unnecessary  programs.In  2012,  the  Center  for  a  New  American  Society  pointed  to  a  number  of  ways  in  which  Congress  could  spend  money  much  more  efficiently.  For  example,  the  group  pointed  out  how  the  government  has  continued  to  spend  on  the  MV-22  tilt  motor  aircraft  despite  ongoing  technological  failures.  The  government  has  also  unnecessarily  maintained  its  enormous  nuclear  stockpile,  costing  tens  of  billions  of  dollars,  decades  after  the  Cold  War  ended.Entrenched  povertyFifty  years  ago,  President  Lyndon  Johnson  and  the  88th  Congress  launched  an  ambitious  War  on  Poverty  that  aimed  to  provide  tools  for  the  poor  to  become  self-sufficient.  For  over  a  decade,  the  program  --  which  Johnson  broadly  defined  to  include  all  of  his  programs  to  help  the  poor  --  had  a  powerful  effect.  The  poverty  rate  fell  from  19%  in  1964  to  11.2%  in  1974.  New  government  services,  such  as  Head  Start  and  Medicaid,  have  remained  integral  to  those  without  economic  means.But  since  the  1970s,  political  concern  about  poverty  has  vastly  diminished.Even  though  politicians  occasionally  talk  about  inequality  --  with  some  Democrats  calling  for  more  muscular  programs  to  address  these  communities  and  Republicans  such  as  Ryan  calling  for  the  use  of  tax  incentives  to  help  the  poor  --  substantive  poverty  policy  has  been  abominable.  New  government  support  for  the  poor  is  nonexistent  while  ongoing  programs  don't  receive  adequate  funding.  Key  programs  such  as  food  stamps  have  been  under  direct  attack.The  nation  has  allowed  entire  communities  in  inner  city  and  rural  America  to  disintegrate.  There  are  parts  of  the  country  where  jobs  are  far  too  scarce,  where  crime  and  drug  use  is  rampant  and  where  kids  grow  up  in  dilapidated  housing  and  without  any  strong  education.One  recent  study  found  that  poverty  in  the  suburbs  increased  by  64%  from  2000  to  2011,  with  16.4  million  people  living  in  poverty  in  the  suburbs  in  2012,  more  than  the  13.4  million  poor  in  America's  cities.In  Rolling  Stone,  reporter  Matt  Taibbi  provided  a  gripping  portrait  of  Camden,  New  Jersey,  revealing  a  community  that  was  once  a  thriving  industrial  town  now  having  a  ruined  economy  and  the  nation's  highest  crime  rate.  Almost  42%  of  the  city's  residents  are  living  in  poverty.There  are  obvious  political  reasons  for  the  silence  on  this  crisis.A  large  number  of  Democrats  have  been  so  focused  on  winning  middle  class  suburban  votes  and  the  elusive  independent  center  that  they  have  dropped  these  kinds  of  issues  from  their  discussion.  Republicans  have  pursued  economic  policies  that  tend  to  exacerbate  inequality  and  are  reluctant  to  embrace  the  use  of  government  to  help  anyone,  including  the  disadvantaged.The  most  active  interest  in  anti-poverty  policies  has  come  at  the  state  and  local  level.  In  New  York,  former  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg,  who  as  an  independent  wasn't  beholden  to  either  major  party,  launched  one  of  the  most  ambitious  programs,  which  earned  the  praise  of  liberal  scholars  such  as  Michael  Katz.  "Criticism  of  Mayor  Michael  R.  Bloomberg,"  Katz  wrote  in  The  New  York  Times,  "for  neglecting  the  poor  ignored  his  bold  and  unprecedented  antipoverty  measures."Bloomberg  launched  a  number  of  programs,  including  cash  rewards  for  families  in  poverty  that  were  able  to  abide  by  certain  health  and  educational  guidelines.The  time  has  come  for  the  federal  government  to  do  much  more.  Democrats  have  turned  their  attention  to  issues  such  as  the  minimum  wage  increase,  but,  as  we  saw  in  the  1960s,  a  real  attack  on  poverty  will  require  a  more  ambitious  and  holistic  approach  to  help  transform  the  basic  conditions  under  which  those  in  poverty  live.  It  will  need  to  include  aggressive  programs  to  bring  investment  into  depressed  areas  and  provide  job  training,  child  care  and  better  educational  services.The  power  of  lobbyistsEveryone  who  follows  politics  knows  the  power  that  lobbyists  wield  in  Washington.  For  all  the  celebration  that  surrounds  the  start  of  every  new  administration  and  Congress,  a  large  number  of  the  key  players  in  Washington  remain  the  same  regardless  of  which  parties  controls  the  town.  Lobbyists  rule  the  roost.The  lobbying  community  of  Washington  has  vastly  expanded  since  the  1970s  with  thousands  of  organizations  and  interest  having  set  up  shop  in  the  capital.  In  1971,  there  were  175  registered  lobbyists;  by  1982,  the  number  reached  2,500,  according  to  political  scientists  Jacob  Hacker  and  Paul  Pierson.  By  2012,  there  were  more  than  12,000  lobbyists  in  Washington  by  2012  with  the  industry  raking  in  more  than  $3  billion  a  year.Lobbyists  work  hard  to  protect  the  programs  that  matter  to  their  clients.  They  marshal  an  enormous  amount  of  resources,  ranging  from  campaign  contributions  to  advertisements,  to  make  sure  that  politicians  don't  touch  their  interests.Everyone  knows  this  is  a  problem.  The  ways  in  which  lobbyists  and  money  pervert  the  democratic  process  is  obvious.  It  also  fuels  the  kind  of  gridlock  that  American  citizens  decry.  Only  certain  people  gain  a  seat  at  the  table.  And  politicians  in  both  parties  like  to  rail  against  Washington  and  the  evil  ways  of  K  Street,  where  most  of  the  lobbies  are  located.  Many  legislators  take  on  lucrative  jobs  in  the  lobbying  industry  (advising  rather  than  directly  lobbying  to  get  around  the  rules)  to  cash  in  on  their  years  of  service.  Almost  50%  of  retiring  senators  take  this  path.But  government  reform  has  been  a  neglected  issue.  Democratic  and  Republican  incumbents,  who  have  learned  to  benefit  from  the  existing  system,  don't  have  much  of  an  incentive  to  change  the  status  quo,  even  after  Supreme  Court's  Citizen  United  decision  helped  open  the  floodgates  for  more  money  in  campaigns  and  the  ongoing  innovations  in  political  advertising  that  are  allowing  interest  groups  new  levels  of  influence  in  campaigns.In  these  cases,  what  we  really  need  is  more  partisanship  --  more  debates  between  Democrats  and  Republicans  about  how  to  tackle  these  problems  and  more  competition  to  offer  solutions  that  will  make  things  better.There  is  a  glimmer  of  hope  about  poverty.  Democrats,  including  President  Obama,  are  stressing  issues  of  economic  inequality  at  the  start  of  2014,  focusing  attention  on  the  minimum  wage,  extending  unemployment  insurance  and  pushing  for  the  expansion  of  Medicaid  in  Republican  states  that  have  stood  firm  against  this  aspect  of  the  Affordable  Care  Act.Even  some  Republicans,  including  Ryan  and  Sen.  Marco  Rubio  of  Florida,  are  talking  about  new  efforts  to  fight  poverty.  Time  will  tell  how  serious  these  initiatives  are  and  whether  they  can  break  through  the  bipartisan  consensus  that  has  stifled  action  for  years.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Julian  Zelizer.</TEXT></DOC>

The  event  marked  the  first  time  the  former  National  Security  Agency  contractor  has  directly  addressed  people  in  the  United  States  since  he  fled  the  country  with  thousands  of  secret  documents  last  June.In  response  to  a  question,  Snowden  said  he  had  no  regrets  about  his  decision  to  leak  the  NSA  documents,  which  showed  the  intelligence  agency  has  conducted  secret  monitoring  of  Americans'  phone  and  Internet  behavior  in  the  name  of  national  security."Would  I  do  it  again?  Absolutely.  Regardless  of  what  happens  to  me,  this  is  something  we  had  a  right  to,"  he  said."I  took  an  oath  to  support  and  defend  the  Constitution.  And  I  saw  the  Constitution  was  being  violated  on  a  massive  scale,"  he  added,  to  applause  from  the  3,000  people  in  the  auditorium  at  the  Austin  Convention  Center."South  by  Southwest  and  the  tech  community,  the  people  in  the  room  in  Austin,  they're  the  folks  who  can  fix  this,"  Snowden  said  earlier.  "There's  a  political  response  that  needs  to  occur,  but  there's  also  a  tech  response  that  needs  to  occur."He  appeared  on  video  screens  with  a  copy  of  the  U.S.  Constitution  as  a  backdrop.  The  live  stream  was  slow,  repeatedly  freezing  Snowden's  image  onscreen.The  pair  of  American  Civil  Liberties  Union  lawyers  who  hosted  the  discussion  said  Snowden's  video,  ultimately  delivered  via  Google  Hangouts,  was  streamed  through  several  routers  for  security.Snowden  also  said  Internet  users  need  more  awareness,  and  better  tools,  to  help  them  secure  their  online  information  from  prying  eyes.While  tech  geeks  may  have  no  problem  using  encryption  tools  to  scramble  their  messages  or  accessing  the  more-private  "deep  Web"  via  clients  like  Tor,  Snowden  said  the  average  Web  user  should  be  able  to  access  similar  protections."This  is  something  that  people  have  to  be  able  to  interact  with,  and  the  way  we  interact  with  it  now  is  not  that  good,"  he  said.Snowden  took  questions  from  two  moderators  --  the  ACLU's  Chris  Sogohian  and  Ben  Wizner,  his  legal  counsel  --  from  the  audience,  and  from  Twitter.  The  first,  fittingly,  came  from  Tim  Berners-Lee,  who  created  the  World  Wide  Web  25  years  ago  this  week.  Berners-Lee  asked  Snowden  what  he  would  change  about  the  nation's  surveillance  system."We  need  public  oversight  ...  some  way  for  trusted  public  figures  to  advocate  for  us.  We  need  a  watchdog  that  watches  Congress,  because  if  we're  not  informed,  we  can't  consent  to  these  (government)  policies."Asked  about  the  difference  between  government  surveillance  and  snooping  by  private  Internet  companies,  Snowden  said  he  considers  government  surveillance  more  insidious  because  "the  government  has  the  ability  to  deprive  you  of  rights.  They  can  jail  you."Snowden,  a  former  CIA  employee  and  NSA  contractor  who  fled  the  United  States  after  leaking  details  of  the  American  government's  spy  programs,  was  granted  temporary  asylum  in  Russia  last  year.He  faces  felony  charges  of  espionage  and  theft  of  government  property  in  the  United  States,  and  he  has  said  he  won't  return  until  the  U.S.  changes  its  whistleblower  protection  laws.Reaction  among  SXSW  audience  members  to  Snowden's  comments  appeared  mixed."I  think  it  was  right  on,"  said  Michael  Chalcraft,  a  retired  software  entrepreneur  from  Seattle.  "There's  always  a  balance  between  what  the  government  should  know  about  us  and  what  we  would  expect  to  be  private."If  we're  not  constantly  protecting  that  privacy,  then  we  give  it  up."But  Megan  Betterman,  a  health-care  marketer  from  Minneapolis,  didn't  hear  everything  she  wanted  from  Snowden."I  wanted  to  hear  about  what  his  life  is  like  there  (in  Russia),  and  whether  he'll  ever  come  back  to  the  U.S.,"  she  said.  "It  (his  talk)  was  very  encryption-heavy."More  than  30,000  attendees  are  currently  in  Austin  for  the  10-day  SXSW  festival,  which  began  Friday  and  wraps  on  March  16.The  Texas  Tribune,  a  nonprofit  media  organization,  live  streamed  the  session.Also  scheduled  to  speak  at  the  tech-themed  conference  Monday  afternoon  --  although  in  person  --  was  journalist  and  civil-liberties  lawyer  Glenn  Greenwald,  who  broke  the  story  about  Snowden's  leaks  of  classified  NSA  documents.Snowden's  call  for  developers  to  create  secure,  private  networks  for  their  users  is  less  of  a  no-brainer  at  South  by  Southwest  than  it  may  have  once  been.  Having  emerged  from  the  counter-culture  of  the  early  Web,  SXSW  Interactive  has  exploded  in  recent  years  as  more  businesses  have  sought  to  tap  into  successful  startups'  millions  of  users.In  the  same  Austin  convention  hall  where  Snowden  called  for  new  privacy  tools,  other  sessions  were  helping  entrepreneurs  learn  how  to  make  money  with  the  data  they  collect  about  the  users  of  their  products.READ:  Military  spy  chief:  Have  to  assume  Russia  knows  U.S.  secretsREAD:  NSA  leaker  Edward  Snowden  says  U.S.  return  'not  possible'  given  current  lawsREAD:  Norwegian  lawmakers  nominate  Edward  Snowden  for  Nobel  Peace  Prize</TEXT></DOC>

"We  are  brainwashed  that  we  have  the  best  system  and  sharia  law  comes  from  god.  But  they  teach  us  to  hate  others.  I  came  to  America  to  clear  my  mind."Asseri  grew  up  in  a  middle  class  conservative  Saudi  family,  the  middle  child  with  three  brothers  and  three  sisters.  His  parents  had  little  education  and  raised  him  and  his  brothers  and  sisters  true  to  Saudi  culture  and  religion.  There  was  no  music  or  TV.He  didn't  know  for  years  that  he  was  gay.  By  age  13,  he  realized  he  was  different  than  other  boys  his  age,  he  just  had  no  idea  what  that  difference  was."We  don't  have  any  education  about  sex.  You  don't  know  what  gay  means.  You  just  know  that  you  have  feelings.  You  can't  talk  about  it  with  anyone.  According  to  the  Koran  they  are  a  sin.  I  thought  it  would  just  go  away.  I  just  had  feelings  but  you  can't  talk  about  it  with  any  person."As  a  law  student,  he  considered  a  career  as  an  attorney  and  took  a  job  as  a  clerk  for  a  judge  in  the  Saudi  court.  After  a  few  months,  he  quit.In  a  petition  seeking  asylum  to  the  United  States  obtained  by  CNN,  he  wrote  that  "unfair  bias"  in  the  treatment  of  cases  in  Saudi  Arabia  made  it  "morally  impossible  for  me  to  continue.""I  was  frequently  upset  and  saddened  by  the  system  in  general  and  the  punishments  given  to  the  accused,"  he  wrote.Investigates  sexualityFor  another  year  he  worked  as  a  trainee  in  the  Bureau  of  Investigation  and  Prosecution,  where  he  would  check  on  the  prisoners  to  see  whether  they  were  receiving  proper  treatment.  He  was  forced  by  his  managers  to  witness  prisoners  being  lashed,  which  gave  him  bad  dreams.  He  quit  his  job  once  again,  frustrated  with  the  harsh  punishments  and  his  inability  to  do  anything  to  stop  them.At  that  time  he  started  to  investigate  his  faith,  religion  and  sexuality."Without  these  jobs  I  wouldn't  be  the  same  person  now,"  he  said.  "I  began  to  understand  something  isn't  right  about  the  way  we  practice  religion.  Something  didn't  feel  good.  I  said  to  myself  the  only  way  you  can  have  freedom  is  to  be  a  diplomat  and  travel  out  of  the  country."He  joined  the  Foreign  Ministry  as  a  diplomat  and  got  married  to  a  Saudi  woman,  all  the  time  hiding  his  feelings  and  dreaming  of  the  day  he  could  leave  the  country  and  live  his  life  as  an  openly  gay  man.When  his  wife  gave  birth  to  his  son,  Fahad,  Asseri  tried  one  last  time  to  give  his  arrangement  a  chance.  But  he  found  he  could  not  keep  up  the  charade  and  they  divorced  in  2004.Asseri  was  transferred  to  the  Saudi  consulate  in  Los  Angeles  the  next  year.A  double  lifeHere,  he  writes  in  his  asylum  petition,  "I  discovered  the  gay  community,  the  gay  culture  and  that  I  was  in  fact  gay."  For  four  years  he  led  a  double  life.  By  day,  he  was  a  traditional  diplomat.  By  night,  he  visited  gay  bars  and  told  friends  he  was  from  Italy  or  any  other  country  than  his  own.Asseri's  two  worlds  collided  in  2009  when  he  fell  in  love  and  moved  into  a  West  Hollywood  apartment  with  his  boyfriend.  Finding  happiness  for  the  first  time,  he  enjoyed  an  open  social  life  in  West  Hollywood  with  his  new  friends.Soon  his  colleagues  began  to  ask  him  about  his  life  outside  of  work  and  started  following  him.  When  his  passport  expired  and  he  submitted  it  for  renewal,  he  received  no  reply.  After  several  months,  his  office  told  him  his  time  in  the  United  States  was  up  and  he  would  have  to  return  to  Saudi  Arabia.He  began  to  fear  he  was  found  out.  He  called  a  friend  in  the  foreign  ministry  in  Riyadh,  who  told  him  indeed  the  Consul  General  sent  a  letter  to  the  ministry  stating  he  was  gay  and  had  information  about  his  lifestyle."This  is  when  I  became  really  scared  and  paranoid,"  he  writes  in  his  asylum  petition.  "I  was  so  scared  they  would  do  something  to  me  physically.  I  was  even  afraid  to  go  to  my  car  thinking  there  could  be  a  bomb  in  it.  When  I  came  home  I  had  to  check  every  closet."He  sent  a  letter  to  various  news  organizations  saying  he  was  being  harassed  by  colleagues  and  he  feared  for  his  life.Fearing  persecutionHe  applied  for  asylum  as  a  gay  person  who  would  face  persecution  if  sent  home.  In  more  than  eight  hours  of  questioning,  immigration  officers  focused  on  his  jobs  in  the  Saudi  courts  and  Bureau  of  investigation.His  bid  for  asylum  was  no  common  occurrence.The  last  Saudi  diplomat  to  seek  asylum  was  in  1994,  when  Mohammed  al-Khilewi,  then  first  secretary  for  the  Saudi  mission  to  the  United  Nations,  was  granted  asylum  for  publicly  criticizing  his  country's  human  rights  record  and  alleged  support  for  terrorism.Fourteen  months  later  in  October  2011,  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  denied  Asseri's  application.In  the  rejection  letter,  obtained  by  CNN,  the  government  says  "evidence  indicates  that  you  ordered,  incited,  assisted  or  otherwise  participated  in  the  persecution  of  others  on  account  of  race,  religion,  nationality,  membership  in  a  particular  social  group  or  political  opinion."The  case  went  to  automatic  appeal."They  interviewed  him  once  and  it  took  14  months  and  it  showed  they  were  going  for  denial,"  says  Ali  Ahmed,  a  Saudi  dissident  and  activist  that  has  been  helping  Asseri  with  his  case.  "They  used  the  reason  that  he  worked  for  the  courts  to  call  him  a  human  rights  violator  which  is  really  bogus."Obama  on  gay  rightsTwo  months  later,  Obama  signed  a  Memorandum  on  International  Initiatives  to  Advance  the  Human  Rights  of  LGBT  Persons.  It  included  a  program  to  protect  gay  refugees  and  asylum  seekers,  including  "ensuring  the  federal  government  has  the  ability  to  identify  and  expedite  resettlement  of  highly  vulnerable  persons  with  urgent  protection  needs."In  the  memo,  Obama  writes  that  the  fight  to  end  discrimination  against  LGBT  people  is  "a  global  challenge"  and  "central  to  the  United  States'  commitment  to  promoting  human  rights.""I  am  deeply  concerned  by  the  violence  and  discrimination  targeting  LGBT  persons  around  the  world  —  whether  it  is  passing  laws  that  criminalize  LGBT  status,  beating  citizens  simply  for  joining  peaceful  LGBT  pride  celebrations,  or  killing  men,  women,  and  children  for  their  perceived  sexual  orientation,"  Obama  said.In  its  most  recent  human  rights  report,  the  State  Department  said  under  sharia  law  in  the  Saudi  Arabia,  "consensual  same-sex  conduct  is  punishable  by  death  or  flogging."Ongoing  caseIt  wasn't  until  this  past  February  that  Asseri  was  finally  granted  a  hearing  date  for  his  appeal.  At  the  court,  the  immigration  officer  offered  him  a  deal  to  remain  in  the  country  permanently  without  possibility  of  asylum  or  a  green  card.Additionally,  he  could  never  leave  the  country.  When  he  rejected  the  offer,  the  immigration  officer  applied  for  another  continuance,  saying  she  needed  to  submit  more  documents  in  the  two-year  case.  He  is  now  looking  at  a  new  hearing  date  in  2015.Today,  Asseri  barely  makes  ends  meet  as  a  part-time  security  guard.  He  lives  on  couches  at  friends'  apartments  in  West  Hollywood.  His  family  has  shunned  him  and  his  ex-wife  won't  allow  him  to  talk  to  his  son.As  unbearable  as  his  life  in  limbo  is,  he  says  returning  to  Saudi  Arabia  would  be  a  death  sentence."There  is  no  question,"  he  says.  "If  you  go  back  and  say  I  am  gay  and  proud  and  I  don't  believe  in  religion  anymore.  Under  sharia  law  this  is  death.  You  will  be  happy  if  they  kill  you  right  away.  "Ahmed,  the  Saudi  activist,  says  Asseri  is  a  victim  of  U.S.  desires  not  to  upset  the  Saudi  monarchy.Asseri  had  been  convinced  that  Obama's  stated  commitment  to  gay  rights  would  trump  politics  and  keep  him  safe  in  the  United  States."When  President  Obama  ran  in  2008  I  supported  him.  I  cried  for  him,  I  encouraged  my  American  friends  to  vote  for  him.  Now  I  can't  stand  to  watch  him  on  TV,"  he  says.  "I'm  angry.  He  said  he  supports  the  rights  of  gay  people,  so  why  is  this  happening  to  me?"The  Saudi  embassy  in  Washington  and  consulate  in  Los  Angeles  did  not  return  phone  calls.  The  Department  of  Homeland  Security  declined  comment,  saying  asylum  cases  were  confidential.</TEXT></DOC>

He  was  sentenced  last  year  to  10  years'  probation.His  story  made  national  headlines  after  a  witness  claimed  Couch  was  a  victim  of  "affluenza"  --  the  product  of  wealthy,  privileged  parents  who  never  set  limits  for  the  boy.That  particular  defense,  however,  played  no  part  in  the  judge's  decision,  Couch's  lawyer  told  reporters  on  Wednesday.  Court  proceedings  were  closed  to  the  public."She  (Boyd)  said  it  (affluenza),  and  specifically  mentioned  that  that  was  not  a  basis  for  her  decision,"  said  attorney  Reagan  Wynn.  "She  heard  all  the  evidence  and  she  made  what  she  thought  was  the  appropriate  disposition."'Affluenza'  defense  psychologist:  'I  wish  I  hadn't  used  that  term'The  judge  ordered  that  Couch's  parents  pay  for  the  treatment  facility,  which  was  not  identified.  It  was  also  unclear  how  long  Couch  might  stay  there.As  part  of  his  probation,  the  teen  must  refrain  from  using  drugs  or  alcohol.  He  will  also  not  be  allowed  to  drive.  If  Couch  violates  the  terms  of  his  probation,  he  could  face  up  to  10  years  behind  bars."I  think  he  can  be  rehabilitated  given  intensive  therapy  and  I  hope  that  he  gets  it,"  Wynn  said  about  the  teen.  "The  juvenile  system  is  about  rehabilitation  and  if  it's  going  to  be  about  rehabilitation,  she  (Boyd)  absolutely  made  the  right  decision."Eric  Boyles,  who  lost  his  wife  and  daughter  in  the  crash,  disagrees.He  told  reporters  he  has  no  doubt  that  money  played  a  role  in  the  case.Steering  teen  drivers  out  of  harm's  way"Had  he  (Couch)  not  had  money  to  have  the  defense  there,  to  also  have  the  experts  testify,  and  also  offer  to  pay  for  the  treatment,  I  think  the  results  would  have  been  different,"  he  said  Wednesday  after  the  proceedings.Last  June,  his  wife,  Hollie  Boyles,  and  daughter,  Shelby,  left  their  home  to  help  Breanna  Mitchell,  whose  SUV  had  broken  down.  Brian  Jennings,  a  youth  pastor,  was  driving  past  and  also  stopped  to  help.All  four  were  killed  when  the  teen's  pickup  plowed  into  the  pedestrians  on  a  road  in  Burleson,  south  of  Fort  Worth.  Couch's  vehicle  also  struck  a  parked  car,  which  then  slid  into  another  vehicle  headed  in  the  opposite  direction.Opinion:  'Affluenza'  isn't  as  crazy  as  it  soundsTwo  people  riding  in  the  bed  of  the  teen's  pickup  were  tossed  in  the  crash  and  severely  injured.  One  is  no  longer  able  to  move  or  talk  because  of  a  brain  injury,  while  the  other  suffered  internal  injuries  and  broken  bones.According  to  prosecutors,  three  hours  after  the  crash,  tests  showed  Couch  had  a  blood  alcohol  content  of  0.24,  three  times  the  legal  limit."There  has  been  nothing  from  Ethan  from  these  proceedings  with  regards  to  remorse  on  his  part  at  all  --  that  I  do  think  would  have  helped.  It  would  have  helped  the  victims.  No  doubt  about  it,  it  would  have  helped,"  said  Boyles.Prosecutors  were  similarly  disappointed  with  the  judge's  decision.They  had  asked  for  the  maximum  of  20  years  behind  bars."This  has  been  a  very  frustrating  experience  for  me,"  said  prosecutor  Richard  Alpert.  "I'm  used  to  a  system  where  the  victims  have  a  voice  and  their  needs  are  strongly  considered.  The  way  the  system  down  here  is  currently  handled,  the  way  the  law  is,  almost  all  the  focus  is  on  the  offender."'Affluenza':  Is  it  real?CNN's  Jason  Morris  and  Ed  Lavandera  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

The  boy  suffered  a  scratch  below  his  right  eye.Shein  said  in  a  February  statement  that  her  client  was  in  distress  and  grieving  during  the  flight  after  learning  the  day  before  that  his  son  was  in  a  coma,  after  overdosing  on  insulin.Hundley  was  headed  to  Atlanta  to  decide  whether  or  not  to  take  his  son  --  who  died  the  day  after  the  flight  --  off  life  support.Shein  said  Hundley  "had  paid  a  terrible  price  for  his  hurtful  words  but  asks  only  that  people  understand  that  he  was  not  doing  well  that  night  and  spoke  hurtful  words  he  would  have  not  otherwise  have  said."CNN's  Janet  DiGiacomo  and  Kevin  Conlon  contributed  to  this  story.</TEXT></DOC>

She  co-authored  a  perspective  paper  published  Monday  in  the  journal  Pediatrics  on  bullying  by  coaches.(CNN)  --  Just  like  issues  of  concussions  and  hydration  in  sports  at  all  levels,  bullying  by  athletic  coaches  needs  to  be  brought  to  the  forefront.It  happens  more  frequently  than  you  might  think,  researchers  have  found,  although  it's  under-acknowledged.Although  the  issue  hasn't  been  extensively  researched,  one  study  found  that  45%  of  children  reported  verbal  misconduct  from  coaches,  including  name-calling  and  insults  during  play.  Another  study  of  4,500  students  who  reported  at  least  one  incident  of  emotional  harm  during  their  sports  tenure  showed  that  nearly  one-third  pinpointed  their  coach  as  the  main  source.Pediatricians  are  regularly  asked  by  patients  and  their  parents  about  such  bullying.  Both  parents  and  pediatricians  are  often  confused  by  the  responses  from  the  coaches,  athletic  departments  and  school  administrators  when  the  behavior  is  brought  to  their  attention.I've  written  a  perspective  paper  on  this  issue  with  Brett  Enneking  and  Kristin  Hendrix  in  the  journal  Pediatrics.  In  one  case  we  learned  of,  a  woman  entered  a  gym  when  picking  her  daughter  up  early  from  basketball  practice  and  saw  the  coach  screaming  at  the  team  that  they  lacked  intelligence  and  were  lazy  because  they  had  not  executed  a  play  properly.When  she  confronted  the  coach,  she  was  told  that  no  one  was  allowed  in  the  gym  during  practice  "for  safety  reasons."After  asking  around  and  finding  that  the  coach  had  a  history  of  intimidating  players,  she  approached  the  principal,  who  told  her  he  had  spoken  to  the  coach,  and  the  coach  had  apologized.  The  coach,  he  said,  was  successful  and  won  a  state  title  the  year  before  but  sometimes  got  "overexcited."Opinion:  Rutgers  coach  and  sports'  bully  cultureAs  we  note  in  our  perspective  paper,  most  research  on  bullying  addresses  peer-to-peer  bullying,  but  "nothing  in  the  definition  (of  bullying)  requires  a  peer-to-peer  relationship,  only  one  individual  with  perceived  power  over  another."Bullying  can  have  dramatic  and  long-lasting  effects  on  victims,  studies  have  showed.We  have  observed  four  defensive  techniques  that  bullying  coaches  have  used  to  rationalize  and  minimize  others'  negative  perceptions  of  their  behavior.  When  pediatricians  can  identify  these  defensive  techniques,  they  are  better  able  to  counsel  parents  and  educate  school  officials  about  the  use  of  these  techniques  in  order  to  maintain  focus  on  the  behavior  that  needs  to  be  addressed.Moral  justificationThe  bully  attempts  to  portray  the  behavior  as  socially  acceptable.  They  use  normalization  statements  like  "all  coaches  lose  it  once  in  a  while"  or  "this  is  how  we've  always  done  things,  and  we  win  games."By  arguing  that  the  behavior  is  normal,  they  attempt  to  show  that  common  behavior  is  acceptable  behavior.  When  a  culture  of  bullying  is  accepted  within  a  team  or  school,  it  may  actually  seem  normal,  and  bullying  of  athletes  tends  to  be  rationalized  and  ignored.Backhand  apologyThis  sounds  like,  "I  am  really  sorry;  I  got  a  little  carried  away,  but  we  really  need  to  work  on  fundamentals  if  we  are  going  to  win."There  are  two  problems  presented.  First,  the  coach  is  minimizing  the  harm  by  saying  "a  little";  second,  he  or  she  places  the  blame  on  the  victims  by  implying  that  if  the  team  had  mastered  fundamentals,  he  or  she  would  not  have  acted  in  such  a  manner.  The  apology  becomes  part  of  the  bullying  behavior  cycle  because  it  is  a  power  play  that  belittles  the  victim.Advantageous  comparisonsA  coach  might  say,  "I  never  push  them  around  or  lay  a  finger  on  them."  Even  if  physical  violence  was  not  the  concern,  the  coach  implies  that  there  are  far  worse  behaviors,  to  downplay  the  severity  of  his  actual  misconduct.Parents,  beware  of  bullying  on  sites  you've  never  seenEscalationIn  escalation,  the  "stakes"  are  raised  until  the  person  with  the  grievance  gives  up.  Here,  the  bully  essentially  "bluffs"  the  person  making  the  complaint  into  backing  down.With  athletes,  the  coach  may  make  statements  like,  "If  you  don't  like  the  way  I  do  things,  you  can  quit  the  team."  The  bully  is  not  necessarily  escalating  his  bullying  behavior  but  escalating  the  situation  by  presenting  the  secondary  consequences  a  victim  might  face  by  fighting  back.Bullying  by  coaches  should  be  immediately  reported  to  school  officials,  and  a  report  to  child  welfare  officials  may  also  be  warranted.Such  behavior  is  unacceptable,  and  coaches  should  face  consequences  for  not  only  physical  but  also  verbal  misconduct,  including  demeaning,  name-calling  and  insulting  young  athletes.The  opinions  expressed  are  solely  those  of  Dr.  Nancy  Swigonski.</TEXT></DOC>

Chris  Christie  has  kept  a  relatively  low  profile  in  recent  weeks  with  investigations  of  the  George  Washington  Bridge  traffic  fiasco  heating  up.  But  he  boiled  over  this  weekend  following  the  disclosure  of  potentially  damaging  new  information  and  was  striking  out  again  on  Monday.David  Wildstein,  a  one-time  top  Christie  transportation  appointee  and  a  central  figure  in  the  political  scandal  roiling  the  Republican's  administration,  alleged  in  a  letter  released  by  his  lawyer  that  "evidence  exists"  to  contradict  statements  Christie  made  previously  about  the  controversy.Specifically,  the  letter  released  on  Friday  covers  Christie's  statement  in  January  on  when  he  found  out  about  unannounced  bridge  access  lane  closures  over  a  work  week  last  September  in  Fort  Lee.State  Assembly  investigators  and  e-mails  suggest  the  lanes  were  shut  down  deliberately,  creating  a  traffic  mess  for  days  to  punish  that  town's  mayor  for  not  endorsing  the  governor  for  reelection.Wildstein,  who  is  said  to  have  carried  out  the  lane  closures  as  a  top  official  of  the  Port  Authority  of  New  York  and  New  Jersey,  alleges  in  the  letter  that  "evidence  exists"  that  would  tie  "Mr.  Christie  to  having  knowledge"  of  the  shutdown  "during  the  period  when  the  lanes  were  closed."Although  Christie  aides  have  not  pinpointed  exactly  when  he  knew  of  the  closures,  he  has  said  --  and  they  agree  --  that  it  was  not  until  media  reports  began  to  appear  some  time  after  they  were  reopened.  Christie  also  has  said  he  knew  nothing  of  any  scheme  to  exact  political  revenge.Christie  is  now  going  on  the  offensive,  which  includes  efforts  to  discredit  his  accusers  and  critics.Here's  what  you  need  to  know:Christie  to  speakChristie  plans  to  take  questions  about  the  lane  closure  Monday  at  7  p.m.  ET  on  a  local  New  Jersey  radio  show  called  "Ask  the  Governor."Chris  Christie  to  take  questionsIt  will  be  the  first  time  Christie  will  address  the  unfolding  controversy  in  any  detail  verbally  since  his  nearly  two-hour  news  conference  on  January  9  --  the  one  referenced  in  Wildstein's  letter.  That's  when  he  last  talked  about  the  lane  closures  and  his  knowledge  of  them.  He  also  denied  having  any  connection  to  a  political  scandal.Chris  Christie  scandal:  A  primerFirst  on  CNN:  Mayor  behind  Christie  allegations  full  of  contradictionsHis  office  on  the  offensiveBut  he  launched  a  strike  over  the  weekend  ahead  of  the  radio  appearance,  lashing  out  at  Wildstein,  his  old  high  school  classmate  who  along  with  others  key  appointees  and  advisers  have  been  subpoenaed  by  state  legislative  investigators  to  turn  over  documents  and  other  materials  related  to  the  scandal  by  Monday."Bottom  line  -  David  Wildstein  will  do  and  say  anything  to  save  David  Wildstein,"  a  letter  released  by  the  governor's  office  said.In  new  push  back  on  Monday  ahead  of  the  radio  show,  Christie's  office  planned  to  send  to  friends  and  allies  a  list  of  tweets  and  stories  aiming  to  put  the  focus  on  the  New  York  Times'  handling  of  Wildstein's  letter  on  Friday,  according  to  CNN's  Jake  Tapper.The  paper  broke  the  story,  saying  Wildstein  "had  the  evidence  to  prove"  Christie  knew  about  the  lane  closures.  The  newspaper  quickly  revised  its  lead  to  simply  reflect  what  the  letter  written  by  Wildstein's  attorney  actually  said:  that  "evidence  exists,"  not  that  Wildstein  was  in  possession  of  it.Christie's  office  accused  the  paper  of  "sloppy  reporting."  The  paper's  public  editor  said  the  change  was  more  than  a  nuance  and  could  have  taken  the  form  of  a  "straightforward  correction."Christie  blasts  WildsteinRead  Wildstein's  letterThe  Wildstein  letter  could  be  important  for  a  few  reasons.  One,  he  was  a  top  Port  Authority  official  appointed  by  Christie  alleged  to  be  at  the  center  of  the  scandal;  two,  he  has  refused  to  testify  before  legislative  investigators  although  he  is  subject  to  a  subpoena  to  turn  over  documents;  and  three,  the  U.S.  attorney  in  New  Jersey  has  taken  an  interest  in  the  case.The  letter  did  not  actually  divulge  any  evidence,  nor  did  it  suggest  that  Christie  had  knowledge  of  what  his  people  might  have  been  up  to  --  political  or  otherwise.Super  boosThen  there  was  a  super  Sunday  for  New  Jersey  that  was  not  so  super  for  the  political  host  of  the  big  game  at  MetLife  Stadium.Christie's  presence  at  a  ceremony  where  he  passed  the  symbolic  football  to  Arizona  Gov.  Jan  Brewer  --  next  year's  Super  Bowl  host  -  was  met  with  boos.That's  something  Christie  rarely  has  heard  as  the  state's  popular  governor  and  potential  Republican  presidential  candidate.The  New  York  Daily  News  reported  that  one  heckler  said,  "You  made  it  across  the  bridge?"Opinion:  Are  clouds  gathering  for  Christie?Christie  speaks  for  only  30  seconds.Not  enough  factsIt's  not  all  bad  for  Christie.The  man  in  charge  of  the  state  legislative  investigation  is  not  calling  for  him  to  step  down  although  the  state's  largest  newspaper  suggested  that  should  occur  if  Wildstein's  allegations  are  proven  true.New  Jersey  Assemblyman  John  Wisniewski  said  calls  for  Christie's  resignation  are  "premature.""We  don't  have  enough  facts  to  even  get  to  that  conversation,"  he  said  Sunday  on  CBS  News'  "Face  the  Nation."Resignation  talks  prematureAnd  his  predecessor  at  the  top  of  the  Republican  Governors  Association,  a  plum  political  post  some  have  used  as  a  stepping  stone  to  White  House  campaigns,  said  Christie  should  still  lead  the  group  this  year."Yes,  I  don't  think  he  should  step  down,"  Louisiana  Gov.  Bobby  Jindal  told  CNN's  "State  of  the  Union"  host  Candy  Crowley  Sunday.  "I  think  he  should  stay  there."Invite  still  goodChristie,  who  has  rarely  received  praise  from  the  conservative  base,  will  let  him  speak  at  next  month's  Conservative  Political  Action  Conference.He  was  not  invited  to  the  meeting  last  year,  sparking  a  war  of  words  between  the  governor  and  the  American  Conservative  Union,  which  organizes  the  conference.  The  group  criticized  Christie  for  not  being  conservative  enough  to  address  the  gathering.But  the  frosty  relations  began  to  thaw  late  last  year  after  a  mutual  friend  acted  as  an  intermediary  between  the  two  after  the  governor's  landslide  re-election.Christie  to  appear  at  CPACPoll  numbers  downFollowing  his  landslide  re-election  victory  in  November,  Christie  was  riding  high  in  the  polls.  He  topped  the  other  potential  GOP  2016  White  House  hopefuls  in  surveys  of  Republicans'  choice  for  their  next  presidential  nominee,  and  he  was  knotted  up  with  Hillary  Clinton  in  hypothetical  general  election  showdowns.Now,  Christie's  numbers  have  faded,  according  to  a  new  CNN/ORC  International  survey.  In  a  possible  2016  matchup  with  Clinton,  the  poll  indicates  Christie  trails  her  by  16  percentage  points,  with  Clinton  at  55%  and  the  Governor  at  39%  among  registered  voters  nationwide.  That's  a  dramatic  switch  from  December,  when  Christie  held  a  48%-46%  edge  over  Clinton.More  Christie  aides  leaveAnd  there's  more  fallout.  Christina  Renna,  Christie's  director  of  departmental  relations,  has  resigned.  She  reported  to  Bridget  Kelly,  Christie's  former  deputy  chief  of  staff  who  Christie  fired  for  her  alleged  role  in  the  bridge  scandal.Who's  who  in  the  bridge  scandalRenna's  attorney  indicated  in  a  letter  that  she  had  been  planning  on  leaving  her  job  since  Christie  was  re-elected  in  November,  according  to  New  Jersey.com.CNN's  Jason  Seher,  Chris  Frates  and  Mark  Preston  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

So  when  I  heard  about  "The  Monuments  Men,"  his  sixth  outing  as  a  filmmaker,  I  figured  it  probably  couldn't  miss.Based  on  one  of  those  reality-is-stranger-than-fiction  historical  incidents,  it  tells  the  unlikely  story  of  a  team  of  museum  curators  and  art  historians  who  were  sent  behind  enemy  lines  during  World  War  II  to  recover  hundreds  of  pieces  of  art  that  had  been  pilfered  by  Nazi  thieves.  The  purpose  of  the  mission  was  to  rescue,  and  preserve,  the  very  civilization  we  were  fighting  to  save.'Monuments  Men'  trailer:  George  Clooney,  Matt  Damon  are  saving  historyAs  film  material,  this  story  would  seem  to  have  everything:  suspense,  hidden  treasure,  Nazis,  aesthetic  resonance  —  and  a  chance  for  actors  like  Matt  Damon,  Bill  Murray,  John  Goodman,  and  Clooney  to  cut  loose  in  new  ways,  playing  professorial  dweebs  who  become  cloak-and-dagger  heroes.  "The  Monuments  Men"  sounds  like  a  "what's-not-to-like?"  movie,  but  it  turns  out  to  be  a  bizarre  failure.It's  not  just  that  the  film  is  dull  —  it's  that  there's  no  "there"  there  to  like.  This  should  have  been  a  historical  heist  film,  but  the  script,  by  Clooney  and  Grant  Heslov,  leaves  out  the  heist,  or  anything  else  of  conventionally  pleasing  intrigue.  The  basic  detective  story  —  how  did  these  men  locate  the  works?  —  barely  makes  it  into  the  foreground.Bill  Murray  insists  he's  'physically  dominant'  to  his  'Monuments  Men'  co-starsWhat's  there  instead?  A  bunch  of  wispy  anecdotal  scenes  that  go  nowhere,  with  characters  who  are  too  underwritten  to  be  called  Johnny  one-notes;  most  of  the  actors  hardly  get  a  note  to  hum.  The  key  trait  of  Damon's  character,  for  instance,  is  that  he  speaks  French  badly  (this  results  in  quels  hi-larious  fractured-syntax  subtitles).  As  for  Murray,  Goodman,  and  Jean  Dujardin,  they  all  stand  around  dropping  toothless  quips  into  the  void.As  the  art  restorer  who  organizes  the  mission,  Clooney  gives  himself  way  too  many  lofty  lines  in  which  he  explains  why  saving  art  is  worth  the  price  of  soldiers'  lives.  He  makes  the  case,  but  that  isn't  a  movie  —  it's  closer  to  a  high-toned  movie  pitch  meeting,  with  a  built-in  liberal  subtext  about  the  trashing  of  artifacts  during  the  Iraq  war.Next  time,  Clooney  should  make  sure  that  the  film  he's  making  is  as  good  as  the  pitch.Grade:  C-See  the  original  story  at  EW.com.CLICK  HERE  to  Try  2  RISK  FREE  issues  of  Entertainment  Weekly©  2011  Entertainment  Weekly  and  Time  Inc.

I'm  in  Hong  Kong,  in  an  identical  mock-up  of  the  hotel's  Paris  rooms.The  room's  large,  with  three-meter  ceilings  you  might  find  inside  a  century-old  Beaux  Arts  building.There's  a  dressing  room  that's  as  big  as  the  oval-shaped  white  marble  bathroom  next  door,  where  the  clock  above  the  vanity  is  set  to  Paris  time.In  the  bedroom,  there's  a  stack  of  French  magazines  in  a  rack  next  to  the  sofa.It  does  feel  like  I'm  in  the  French  capital,  even  down  to  the  exact  street  views  you  get  from  the  real  property.Peninsula's  Paris  hotel  doesn't  open  until  August,  but  the  project  team  at  The  Hongkong  and  Shanghai  Hotels  (HSH),  Peninsula's  parent  company,  designed  and  built  this  fully  functioning  model  room  back  in  2011.Test  before  releaseThis  is  where  Peninsula  tries  out  new  ideas  and  technology  for  a  full  year,  before  releasing  its  designs  into  the  world.I'm  the  first  journalist  allowed  access  to  see  how  the  concept  works.  Such  is  the  confidentiality  surrounding  these  unseen  rooms,  I'm  sworn  to  secrecy  as  a  condition  of  my  visit.The  Paris  property's  pictures  aren't  even  made  available  to  me.This  is  basically  a  place  to  make  mistakes,  so  they  don't  get  made  in  the  real  world."What  happens  if  you  wake  up  in  the  middle  of  the  night?  Do  you  bump  your  knee  on  anything?  If  you're  in  the  bathroom,  does  it  all  work?"  asks  Clement  Kwok,  CEO  of  HSH.For  example,  the  "Dior  grey"  carpet  originally  laid  will  never  see  action.  When  the  housekeepers  came  in  to  vacuum,  it  grew  bald  patches.The  built-in  television  cabinet  flanked  by  a  hidden  mini-bar  and  built-in  espresso  machine  (with  bilingual  instructions)  replaces  a  design  that  featured  a  fireplace  and  an  in-mirror  hidden  TV.The  team  learned  that  watching  TV  during  daylight  hours  was  impossible,  due  to  the  glare  from  the  mirror,  which  stretched  up  to  the  ceiling.Eventually  the  fireplace  was  cut  too,  and  the  single-panel  door  design  was  revised  because  it  was  too  heavy  to  lift.What  I  see,  and  what  will  appear  in  Paris,  are  two  ivory-colored  panels  that  split  and  slide  up  and  down.Peninsula  has  been  building  these  rooms  at  a  location  in  Hong  Kong  with  every  new  property  or  major  renovation  since  the  1990s,  including  the  construction  of  its  tower  rooms  in  Hong  Kong  (1994),  and  its  hotels  in  Tokyo  (2007)  and  Shanghai  (2009).To  visit  Shanghai,  I  just  have  to  go  next  door,  where  the  colors  are  richer  and  bolder,  and  the  accents  Art  Deco,  in  keeping  with  the  hotel's  location  on  the  Bund.Tokyo's  modern  lines  and  Zen  touches  must  be  around  here  somewhere,  though  my  hosts  remain  tight-lipped.Rooms  full  of  secretsI  later  learn  the  Tokyo  tester  room  has  been  demolished.With  construction  in  its  final  stages  in  Paris,  and  the  Shanghai  hotel  open  for  more  than  three  years,  these  rooms  haven't  seen  as  many  visitors  lately.But  in  2011  and  2012,  the  Paris  mock-up  would  have  been  busy  with  members  of  management  teams  and  special  guests  staying  one  or  two  nights.Chairman  Sir  Michael  Kadoorie,  whose  family  opened  the  first  Peninsula  in  Hong  Kong  85  years  ago,  has  stayed  overnight  in  the  Paris,  Shanghai  and  Tokyo  models.Even  couples  have  shared  the  king-sized  bed.At  the  end  of  their  stay,  guests  are  asked  to  fill  out  a  questionnaire  that  can  take  hours  to  complete.Executives  give  their  suggestions  directly  to  the  project  team,  or,  in  the  case  of  COO  Peter  Borer,  experiment  with  changes  themselves  onsite.Peninsula  says  Borer  moved  around  and  angled  different  sofas,  armchairs,  and  coffee  tables  until  he  was  satisfied  with  the  setup.There  was  also  debate  over  the  look  and  feel  of  the  curved  bathroom  in  Paris  and  whether  it  was  worth  the  wasted  space  (its  predecessors  in  Shanghai  and  Tokyo  are  rectangular,  though  the  guestrooms  have  a  similar  overall  layout).Other  changes  were  initiated  from  feedback  that  the  room  didn't  feel  "Parisian"  enough.The  color  scheme  was  changed  from  beige  and  bronze,  to  grey  and  chrome,  and  the  wall  coverings,  carpet,  and  some  of  the  furniture  was  adjusted.And  there  were  lots  of  other  small  tweaks,  including  the  addition  of  a  built-in  reading  light  in  a  floor  lamp.A  world  of  mock-upsPeninsula  isn't  the  only  hotel  company  to  build  and  test  model  rooms.Starwood  Hotels  &  Resorts  which  owns  St.  Regis,  Westin,  Sheraton,  and  others  brands,  has  a  design  lab  at  its  U.S.  headquarters  that  features  test  rooms  for  some  of  its  hotel  lines,  though  not  for  each  new  property.And  while  Peninsula  won't  disclose  how  much  it  costs  to  build,  test,  and  maintain  the  model  rooms,  its  CEO  says  they  are  an  investment  worth  making."The  purpose  of  doing  all  of  this  is  not  to  add  more  gold  and  silver  into  the  design,"  Kwok  explains.  "It  is  very  focused  on  ergonomics,  which  is  the  sheer  convenience  of  staying  in  that  room  and  whether  everything  works."My  Paris  stroll  and  fresh  croissants  will  have  to  wait.  I  head  down  a  short  hallway  past  some  Eiffel  Tower-inspired  art,  open  a  mirrored  door,  and  step  back  into  the  Hong  Kong  sunshine.The  Peninsula  Paris,  the  luxury  hotel  group's  10th  hotel,  is  set  to  open  on  August  1.  Peninsula  is  also  planning  properties  in  London  and  Yangon,  Myanmar.</TEXT></DOC>

Answer:  The  coolest  robot  band  you've  ever  seen.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Art  of  Movement  is  CNN's  monthly  show  exploring  the  latest  innovations  in  art,  culture,  science  and  technology.(CNN)  --  Quick  math  question:  What  has  78  fingers,  22  arms,  and  no  brain?Answer:  "Z-Machines,"  the  robot  band  with  a  surprisingly  human  sound.Listen  to  this  three-piece  with  your  eyes  closed  and  it  could  be  any  group  of  musicians  plucking  a  guitar,  twinkling  on  an  electric  keyboard,  or  beating  a  drum.Sure,  there's  a  synthesized  quality  to  the  music  --  which  sweeps  from  orchestral  to  experimental  rock  --  but  what  band  doesn't  get  a  little  help  from  computers  these  days?Open  your  eyes  and  you'll  find  something  very  different  indeed.For  starters,  the  guitarist  is  a  humanoid  looming  two-meters-tall,  with  78  fingers  sweeping  across  the  glowing  instrument  strapped  to  its  torso.The  rocking  robot  --  called  March  --  bangs  its  impressive  mane  of  multi-colored  cables  in  time  to  the  music,  albeit  a  little  jerkily.Seated  a  little  behind  is  Ashura,  the  drummer  with  22  arms  extending  like  a  futuristic  octopus  and  playing  four  times  faster  than  any  human  ever  could.And  then  there's  Cosmo,  perhaps  the  most  alien  band  member  of  all,  a  keyboardist  with  green  lasers  hitting  each  key  with  pinpoint  accuracy."The  footage  of  the  robot  performer  is  almost  like  watching  a  broken  human,  with  a  skeleton  of  steel,  and  oil  for  blood,"  said  Tom  Jenkinson,  better  known  as  British  recording  artist  Squarepusher,  who  composed  the  music  for  the  mechanical  band's  new  EP."Using  robots  has  this  eerie  narrative  associated  with  it  --  the  twilight  area  between  human  and  machine.  It's  just  a  box  of  tricks,  but  it  still  haunts  us  because  we  see  it  as  an  impression  of  ourselves."Big  in  JapanCreated  by  engineers  at  the  University  of  Tokyo,  the  robot  band  uses  around  300  kilowatts  of  electricity,  which  designer  Kenjiro  Matsuo  admitted:  "Is  a  big  amount  of  power.""We  just  bought  a  power  board  which  has  a  switch  --  many  people  can  try  to  make  this  kind  of  robot  in  their  house  now."The  machine  musicians  made  their  stage  debut  at  a  "Future  Party"  in  Tokyo  last  year,  performing  an  electro-rock  mash-up  for  the  screaming  crowd.Girls  in  space-age  outfits  gyrated  around  guitarist  March,  whose  screen  face  flashed  slogans  like  "Party!"Each  time  the  audience  raised  their  drinks  in  the  air,  the  band  would  play  faster,  in  an  event  sponsored  by  the  drinks  company.Soul  music?Now  the  machine  musicians  are  set  to  release  a  five-track  album,  with  the  first  single  "Sad  Robot  Goes  Funny,"  a  more  melancholy  tune  than  you  might  expect  from  a  band  without  hearts."Can  these  robots  play  music  that  is  emotionally  engaging?'  asked  Jenkinson,  who  composed  the  song  and  has  experimented  with  electronic  music  in  a  career  spanning  two  decades."It's  a  fascinating  question,  and  one  that  I've  tried  to  explore  in  this  project.  I'll  let  people  make  up  their  own  minds."So  how  do  you  create  music  for  a  machine  with  78  fingers,  which  can  hit  a  note  every  eight  milliseconds?"It's  just  another  way  of  making  sound,  but  in  this  case  what's  interesting  is  the  aesthetics  of  the  instrument,"  said  Jenkinson."Just  like  when  you're  writing  music  for  a  human,  there  are  certain  possibilities  and  certain  limits.  The  robot  guitarist  for  example,  can  play  much  faster  than  a  human  ever  could,  but  there  is  no  amplification  control."Electronic  evolutionIf  you  imagine  that  this  is  the  start  of  a  robot  revolution,  never  fear,  we've  still  got  a  fair  way  to  go  before  people  tire  of  flesh  and  blood  performers,  said  Jenkins."Is  the  performance  going  to  be  less  compelling  because  it's  robots?"  he  asked."For  me,  part  of  the  appeal  has  to  do  with  hearing  a  familiar  instrument  being  'played'  in  an  unfamiliar  fashion."And  behind  every  robot  musician,  is  a  human  being  bringing  it  to  life.</TEXT></DOC>

Yet  there  was  no  verdict  on  the  first-degree  murder  charge  tied  to  the  death  of  17-year-old  Jordan  Davis.As  the  jury's  decisions  became  clear  about  7  p.m.  Saturday,  Dunn  looked  ahead  solemnly  with  a  frown  but  no  tears.  His  lawyer,  Cory  Strolla,  told  reporters  later  that  his  client  was  "in  disbelief.""Even  as  he  sat  next  to  me,  he  asked,  how  is  this  happening,"  Strolla  said.  "...  It  has  not  set  in.  I  don't  think  it  will  set  in  anytime  soon."The  incomplete  finale  to  this  emotional,  hot-button  trial  --  partly  because  of  the  fact  Dunn  is  white  and  the  teenagers  who  were  shot  at,  including  Davis,  are  black  --  echoed  George  Zimmerman's  trial  for  the  killing  of  17-year-old  Trayvon  Martin  about  120  miles  down  the  road  in  Sanford,  Florida.  While  stand  your  ground  wasn't  used  by  Dunn,  his  lawyers  did  argue  that  he  fired  in  self-defense.Given  the  partially  hung  jury,  State  Attorney  Angela  Corey  said  prosecutors  would  press  for  a  new  trial  in  Duval  County  on  the  murder  charge."Justice  for  Jordan  Davis  is  as  important  as  it  is  for  any  victim,"  said  Corey,  whose  office  also  handled  the  Zimmerman  case.Even  without  a  final  decision  on  the  murder  count  --  and  pending  defense  appeals  --  the  47-year-old  Dunn  is  looking  at  a  lengthy  prison  term.Prosecutor  Erin  Wolfson  explained  Saturday  night  that  each  attempted  second-degree  murder  conviction  carries  a  minimum  sentence  of  at  least  20  years.  There's  also  a  15-year  sentence  possible  on  the  conviction  for  shooting  in  the  teenager's  vehicle."You  are  looking  at  basically  at  life  in  prison,"  Strolla  said,  even  as  he  vowed  to  challenge  the  convictions.  "At  47  years  old,  that's  a  life  sentence  regardless  of  count  one."The  decision  to  convict  on  these  counts,  and  not  on  murder,  didn't  come  easily  for  a  jury  that  had  deliberated  for  about  30  hours  since  getting  the  case  late  Wednesday.Judge  Russell  Healey  acknowledged  earlier  Saturday  that  the  jury  of  four  white  women,  two  black  women,  four  white  men,  an  Asian  woman  and  a  Hispanic  man  was  "struggling,  obviously.""But  it's  not  for  want  of  trying  to  reconcile  all  of  this,"  he  said  then.  "I  think  we've  got  some  analytical  people  in  there  who  are  trying  to  do  just  that  --  trying  to  analyze  this  from  every  possible  angle."The  lack  of  a  murder  conviction  upset  some,  including  protesters  who  marched  outside  the  Jacksonville  courthouse  calling  for  Corey  to  lose  her  job.  "The  people  united  will  never  be  defeated,"  they  also  chanted.Yet  Davis'  mother,  Lucia  McBath,  didn't  express  any  anger  when  she  addressed  reporters  Saturday  night.  Her  family,  she  said,  is  "so  very  happy  to  have  just  a  little  bit  of  closure.""It's  sad  for  Mr.  Dunn  that  he  will  live  the  rest  of  his  life  in  that  sense  of  torment,  and  I  will  pray  for  him,"  McBath  said.  "And  I've  asked  my  family  to  pray  for  him."Confrontation  at  a  gas  stationIt  was  November  23,  2012,  when  Michael  Dunn  pulled  into  a  gas  station  in  Jacksonville,  parking  next  to  a  red  Dodge  Durango  full  of  teenagers.The  teens  had  pulled  in  for  gum  and  cigarettes;  Dunn,  meanwhile,  had  just  left  his  son's  wedding  with  his  fiancee,  who'd  gone  inside  the  convenience  store  for  wine  and  chips.Dunn  didn't  like  the  loud  music  --  "rap  crap,"  as  he  called  it  --  coming  from  the  teens'  SUV.  So  he  asked  them  to  turn  it  down.What  followed  next  depends  on  whom  you  believe.  Dunn  claimed  Davis  threatened  him,  and  he  decided  to  take  matter  into  his  own  hands  upon  seeing  what  he  thought  was  the  barrel  of  a  gun  sticking  out  of  the  Durango.But  prosecutors  asserted  that  it  was  Dunn  who  lost  control,  firing  three  volleys  of  shots  --  10  bullets  total  --  at  the  SUV  over  music  he  didn't  like.Prosecutors  challenged  what  he  did  next:  He  left  the  gas  station  and  drove  40  miles  away  to  a  bed  and  breakfast  in  St.  Augustine.  There,  Dunn  walked  his  dog,  ordered  a  pizza,  then  drank  rum  and  cola  --  "stunned  and  horrified,  (shocked  how)  things  escalated  the  way  they  did  over  a  common  courtesy."After  learning  almost  six  hours  later  that  he  had  killed  Davis,  Dunn  testified  that  he  became  "crazy  with  grief,"  experiencing  stomach  problems  for  about  four  hours  before  taking  a  nap."My  intent  was  to  stop  the  attack,  not  necessarily  end  a  life,"  he  testified.  "It  just  worked  out  that  way."Yet  his  fiancee,  Rhonda  Rouer,  testified  that  Dunn  had  never  mentioned  any  weapon  to  her  --  be  it  a  shotgun,  a  stick,  a  barrel  or  a  lead  pipe  --  unlike  what  Dunn  had  said.In  fact,  police  found  a  basketball,  basketball  shoes,  clothing,  a  camera  tripod  and  cups  inside  the  teenagers'  Durango,  but  no  gun.And  Dunn  himself  never  called  police.  The  first  contacts  he  had  with  them  were  at  his  home  in  Satellite  Beach  --  130  miles  south  of  St.  Augustine  --  as  he  was  being  apprehended.Arguing  that  he  wasn't  in  a  rational  state  of  mind,  Dunn  admitted,  "It  makes  sense  that  I  should  have  (contacted  authorities).  We  didn't.  I  can't  tell  you  why."Echoes  of  Trayvon  Martin  and  George  ZimmermanSome  were  quick  to  compare  Dunn  to  George  Zimmerman,  who  ultimately  was  acquitted  of  murder  for  the  shooting  of  Martin.Martin's  own  parents  were  among  them,  claiming  Davis'  killing  is  another  reminder  that,  in  Florida,  "racial  profiling  and  stereotypes"  may  serve  as  the  basis  for  illegitimate  fear  "and  the  shooting  and  killing  of  young  teenagers."But  Dunn's  defense  attorney,  Strolla,  told  CNN's  Chris  Cuomo  on  Friday  that  the  Zimmerman  and  Dunn  cases  aren't  so  similar.There  was  a  physical  confrontation  between  Zimmerman  and  Martin,  and  police  gave  Zimmerman  the  benefit  of  the  doubt  about  defending  himself,  Strolla  said."My  client  did  not  wait  to  become  that  victim,"  he  said.  "My  client  did  not  wait  to  either  get  assaulted  by  a  weapon  or  have  someone  potentially  pull  a  trigger,"  he  said.Though  a  weapon  was  never  found,  Strolla  maintains  the  youths  could  have  had  one  and  somehow  ditched  in  and  around  the  gas  station.  Regardless,  the  key  point  was  that  Dunn  believed  they  were  armed  and  that  his  life  was  in  danger."Now,  does  it  sound  irrational?  Of  course  it  sounds  irrational.  But  have  you  ever  been  in  that  situation?"  the  lawyer  asked.After  Saturday's  night  decision,  it  seems  unlikely  --  unless  he  wins  on  appeal  --  that  Dunn  will  ever  be  in  that  or  many  other  situations  again.  Instead,  spending  the  rest  of  his  life  in  prison  seems  a  more  likely  outcome.Strolla  said  on  Saturday  the  four  convictions  leave  him  with  regret,  even  as  he  said  he  couldn't  immediately  think  of  anything  he'd  do  differently  in  the  case.At  the  same  time,  the  prosecution  didn't  manage  a  conviction  on  what  was  by  far  the  biggest  charge:  first-degree  murder.This  mixed  bag  means  that  no  one  can  fully  celebrate  the  jury's  decision."Everybody  lost  something  in  this,"  the  lawyer  said.His  client  "will  live  to  fight  another  day"  in  court,  but  he  and  his  loved  ones  are  suffering  now.  Strolla  acknowledged,  too,  the  pain  felt  by  Davis'  family.Especially  on  Sunday,  which  would  have  been  Davis'  19th  birthday.CNN's  Sunny  Hostin  reported  from  Jacksonville;  CNN's  Greg  Botelho  reported  and  wrote  from  Atlanta.

Nothing  pushes  my  buttons  quite  like  that  irritating  sound  coming  from  my  bedside  alarm  clock  in  the  morning.  Luckily,  my  ticker  comes  with  a  snooze  feature.  Just  one  tap  and  I  buy  myself  another  nine  minutes  of  slumber.The  rumor:  Slapping  the  snooze  button  actually  makes  you  more  sleepyI've  always  assumed  that  those  extra  snooze-induced  minutes  of  rest  are  good  for  me.  But  recently  I've  heard  they're  not  helpful  --  in  fact,  it's  said  hitting  the  snooze  button  can  actually  make  me  more  tired  throughout  the  day.  Is  it  true?upwave:  Is  it  normal  to  feel  tired  all  the  time?The  verdict:  If  you  hit  snooze,  you  may  lose  (productivity,  that  is)When  you  doze  off  after  your  alarm  wakes  you  in  the  morning,  you're  actually  setting  yourself  up  to  feel  less  alert  and  productive  later  in  the  day."When  you  hit  the  snooze  button  repeatedly,  you're  doing  two  negative  things  to  yourself,"  says  Robert  S.  Rosenberg,  medical  director  of  the  Sleep  Disorders  Centers  of  Prescott  Valley  and  Flagstaff,  Arizona."First,  you're  fragmenting  what  little  extra  sleep  you're  getting  so  it  is  of  poor  quality.  Second,  you're  starting  to  put  yourself  through  a  new  sleep  cycle  that  you  aren't  giving  yourself  enough  time  to  finish.  This  can  result  in  persistent  grogginess  throughout  the  day."Scientists  have  identified  the  culprit  behind  this  stupor  that's  brought  on  by  a  too-brief  slumber:  sleep  inertia.  The  National  Sleep  Foundation  defines  this  state  as  "the  feeling  of  grogginess  and  disorientation  that  can  come  from  awakening  from  a  deep  sleep."It  slows  down  your  decision-making  abilities,  impairs  your  memory  and  hurts  your  general  performance  once  you  do  get  out  of  bed.  Even  worse,  coffee  and  a  cold  shower  can't  combat  it:  It  can  take  up  to  an  hour  and  a  half  to  shake  off  sleep-inertia  grogginess.According  to  Rosenberg,  that's  because  the  snooze  button  messes  with  your  brain  hormones.  "You're  throwing  off  your  circadian  cycle,"  he  says.  Disrupting  the  circadian  cycle  can  impair  your  ability  to  feel  awake  during  the  day  and  sleepy  at  night.upwave:  14  tips  to  help  you  sleep  betterSo,  is  banishing  the  snooze  button  enough  to  make  you  feel  your  best  during  the  day?  Nope,  says  Rosenberg.  The  urge  to  sleep  a  bit  longer  is  really  a  symptom  of  a  larger  problem."Most  people  are  doing  this  because  they're  not  getting  enough  sleep  on  a  daily  basis,"  he  says.  This  chronic  sleep  deprivation  (which  is  defined  as  six  or  fewer  hours  of  sleep  a  night)  is  called  "social  jetlag."  Over  time,  some  sufferers  have  been  shown  to  have  a  higher  body-mass  index  and  an  elevated  risk  of  diabetes.If  hitting  the  snooze  button  isn't  the  key  to  better  sleep,  what  is?  Rosenberg  has  a  few  suggestions  to  help  you  stay  alert  and  refreshed:Turn  in  earlier,  consistently.  Rosenberg  suggests  going  to  bed  a  half-hour  earlier  than  you  have  been.  Over  time,  he  says,  this  will  reduce  your  overall  sleep  deprivation.  And  if  it  doesn't?  Turn  in  an  hour  earlier.upwave:  How  dangerous  is  sleep  deprivation,  really?Banish  computers  from  the  boudoir.  Devices  like  smartphones,  digital  tablets  and  laptops  emit  blue  light  that  hurts  your  sleep.  "The  exposure  to  blue-light-emitting  devices  results  in  a  delay  in  melatonin  production,"  says  Rosenberg.  So  give  yourself  a  tech  curfew:  Turn  off  those  electronics  90  minutes  before  lights  out  to  help  promote  sounder  sleep.upwave:  What  are  you  going  to  bed  with?Make  mornings  a  scavenger  hunt.  If  you're  still  having  trouble  getting  up,  hide  the  alarm  from  your  groggy  early-morning  self.  "Put  that  alarm  clock  where  you  can't  reach  it,"  Rosenberg  advises.  That  search  to  put  an  end  to  the  annoying  beeping  sound  is  sure  to  foil  your  desire  to  sneak  in  more  Z's.  It  may  seem  silly,  but  it's  doctor-approved.This  article  was  originally  published  on  upwave.com.©  2013  upwave,  All  Rights  Reserved.</TEXT></DOC>

A  week  later  she  offered  a  tearful  apology  for  what  followed.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Los  Angeles  (CNN)  --  MSNBC  host  Melissa  Harris-Perry  chastised  her  guests  for  being  too  serious  just  before  the  controversial  segment  about  former  Republican  presidential  nominee  Mitt  Romney's  adopted  black  grandson.She  told  viewers  the  panel  of  comedians  would  "be  forced  to  drink  during  the  commercial  so  they  can  get  their  funny  back."Harris-Perry  would  tearfully  apologize  for  the  resulting  jokes  a  week  later."My  intention  was  not  malicious,  but  I  broke  the  ground  rule  that  families  are  off  limits,  and  for  that  I  am  sorry,"  Harris-Perry  said  Saturday.The  apology  comes  weeks  after  MSNBC  host  Martin  Bashir  lost  his  job  because  of  remarks  about  former  GOP  vice  presidential  nominee  Sarah  Palin.Controversial  comments  by  journalists  about  an  American  politician's  family  are  not  new.  Harry  Truman  threatened  physical  violence  against  a  Washington  Post  critic  who  famously  wrote  in  1950  that  the  president's  daughter  "cannot  sing  very  well."While  Margaret  Truman  put  herself  into  the  public  eye  with  her  performance,  Romney's  grandson  Kieran  James  only  sat  on  his  grandfather's  lap  for  a  family  Christmas  card  photograph.  And  this  instance  involved  race.Ridiculing  transracial  adoption?Harris-Perry  asked  her  panelists  to  come  up  with  captions  for  the  photo  of  Romney,  his  wife  and  their  21  grandchildren,  all  white  except  for  Kieran.Comedic  actress  Pia  Glenn  sang  a  Sesame  Street  song:  "One  of  These  Things  Is  Not  Like  the  Others."Comedian  Dean  Obeidallah  joked  that  the  photo  "really  sums  up  the  diversity  of  the  Republican  Party."Harris-Perry  described  the  baby  as  "gorgeous"  and  suggested  Kieran  could  someday  marry  North  West,  the  daughter  of  Kanye  West  and  Kim  Kardashian.  "Can  you  imagine  Mitt  Romney  and  Kanye  West  as  in-laws?"  she  joked.Unlike  Truman  and  the  critic,  Romney  quickly  forgave  Harris-Perry.  "People  make  mistakes,  and  the  folks  at  MSNBC  made  a  big  mistake  and  they  apologized  for  it,"  Romney  said  in  an  interview  on  "Fox  News  Sunday."  "They  apologized  for  it.  That's  all  we  can  ask  for."Daily  Beast  political  columnist  Sally  Kohn,  a  guest  Sunday  on  CNN's  "Reliable  Sources,"  blamed  the  growing  competitiveness  and  immediacy  of  media  today  for  the  increase  in  such  incidents."There's  always  this  incentive  to  say  something  that's  newsworthy,  attention-getting,  but  it's  real  easy  to  cross  the  line  into  offensive  and  stupid,"  Kohn  said.  "And  that's  a  split-second  judgment  sometimes."The  punch  lines  drew  fire  from  critics  who  said  they  disrespected  transracial  adoptions,  which  the  Department  of  Health  &  Human  Services  says  make  up  40%  of  all  adoptions  in  the  United  States."Allow  me  to  apologize  to  other  families  formed  through  transracial  adoption  because  I  am  deeply  sorry  that  we  suggested  that  interracial  families  are  in  any  way  funny  or  deserving  of  ridicule,"  Harris-Perry  said  in  her  Saturday  apology.Romney  accepts  MSNBC  host's  apologyHarris-Perry,  who  is  a  political  science  professor  at  Tulane  University,  was  surrounded  by  four  comedians  and  no  professional  journalists.  The  live,  unscripted  show,  which  she  said  was  her  second  annual  "Look  Back  in  Laughter"  edition,  seemed  more  like  a  night  at  the  improv  than  a  cable  news  program."This  is  the  show  where  we  dispense  with  the  serious  and  sober  coverage  of  the  year  in  politics,"  she  promised  viewers.  They  would  look  back  on  "some  of  the  political  absurdity  of  2013  with  the  ridicule  and  mockery  it  so  rightly  deserves."Harris-Perry  delivered  an  opening  monologue  loaded  with  obvious  sexual  puns  about  the  Anthony  Weiner  sexting  scandal.Comedian  Judy  Gold  joked  about  Sen.  Ted  Cruz,  saying  it  was  scary  that  the  Texas  Republican  had  daughters.  Other  comments  came  about  the  daughters  of  "rich,  white  Republicans."The  mandate  for  more  punch  lines  was  made  clear  by  Harris-Perry  after  one  somewhat  serious  segment.Opinion:  Lesson  of  the  Romney  adoption  joke  story"My  comedians  are  all  going  to  be  forced  to  drink  during  the  commercial  so  they  can  get  their  funny  back  because  they've  got  real  serious  about  sexism  and  feminism,"  the  host  said."We  are  basically  ratings  whores,"  Harris-Perry  added.Politico  media  reporter  Dylan  Byers  said  the  MSNBC  brand  has  been  damaged  by  these  controversies,  considering  the  channel  was  "supposed  to  elevate  the  discourse"  with  smart,  well-educated  progressives  who  "lean  forward.""It's  leaning  backward  and  it's  totally,  it's  not  what  MSNBC,  I  think,  was  supposed  to  be  about  originally,  and  I  think  it's  doing  real,  severe  damage  to  the  brand,"  Byers  said  on  CNN's  "Reliable  Sources."Boston  radio  host  Callie  Crossley  told  "Reliable  Sources"  that  Harris-Perry's  brand  has  been  damaged  by  the  controversy  as  well.  "Her  brand  is  to  exactly  be  on  top  of  the  kind  of  ignorant  and  other  kind  of  racist  commentary."Blurry  ground  rulesThe  Society  of  Professional  Journalists  has  a  code  of  ethics  that  says  journalists  should  "use  special  sensitivity  when  dealing  with  children"  and  "show  good  taste."  Students  learn  it  in  most  journalism  schools.But  the  rule  book  in  the  rough-and-tumble  world  of  politics  and  media  is  an  unwritten  common  law  of  precedents  that  evolves  partly  through  apologies,  resignations  and  firings.  Harris-Perry's  apology  makes  one  rule  clear:  The  kids  are  off  limits.There  are  exceptions  to  the  rule,  such  as  when  politicians  decide  to  use  family  members  to  win  support.The  campaign  of  New  York's  new  mayor,  Bill  de  Blasio,  prominently  featured  his  biracial  family  in  commercials  and  campaign  events.  Teenage  son  Dante  appeared  in  his  own  ad  highlighting  his  father's  stance  against  "stop-and-frisk."  Dante  and  his  Afro-style  hair  became  a  social  media  sensation  and  is  credited  with  helping  his  father  surge  to  the  top  of  the  polls  last  year."His  family,  just  because  of  the  racial  mix,  represents  a  big  and  increasingly  large  part  of  the  city  and  speaks  to  certain  sensibilities,"  said  Harold  Ickes,  a  veteran  Democratic  Party  operative  who  advised  the  campaign  and  has  known  de  Blasio  for  two  decades.  "The  family  is  very  important  to  Bill.  ...  From  the  outside,  this  family  represents  a  part  of  the  city  not  represented  in  city  government."Opinion:  Why  Romney  adoption  jokes  hurt</TEXT></DOC>

James'  "Fifty  Shades"  trilogy.The  list  spans  12  categories  --  Dangerous  Love,  Dystopian  Love,  First  Love,  Historical  Romance,  Love  Overseas,  Love  on  the  Big  Screen,  Modern  Love,  Paranormal  Love,  Sizzling  Series,  Star-Crossed  Love,  True  Love  and  Unlikely  Love  --  with  entries  sprinkled  among  the  adult  and  young  adult  genres.While  many  categories  are  filled  with  fictional  romances,  the  True  Love  set  features  memoirs  and  autobiographies,  including  "Just  Kids"  by  Patti  Smith,  "Love  &  War"  by  James  Carville  and  Mary  Matalin,  and  "The  Pioneer  Woman"  by  Ree  Drummond  (known  for  her  Food  Network  show  of  the  same  name).The  CNN  Living  team  noted  that  several  modern  classics  we  love  that  were  omitted  from  the  Amazon  list,  including  "Love  in  the  Time  of  Cholera"  by  Gabriel  García  Márquez,  "Love  Is  a  Mix  Tape"  by  Rob  Sheffield,  "All  the  Living"  by  C.E.

Take  a  look  and  see  if  you  agree  with  our  top  picks.Sara  Nelson,  editorial  director  of  print  and  Kindle  books  at  Amazon.com,  said  her  team  wanted  to  capture  the  essence  of  the  Valentine's  Day  season  in  a  bigger  way  this  year  by  expanding  last  year's  50  Great  American  Love  Stories,  which  highlighted  love  stories  set  in  each  U.S.  state."We  sat  in  front  of  the  computer  and  the  shelves  of  books  in  Seattle,  and  we  took  out  everything  we  thought  would  count  as  a  love  story,"  Nelson  said.  "I  think  the  big  surprise,  though,  is  how  many  kinds  of  love  there  are.  When  we  came  up  with  the  categories,  it  wasn't  hard  to  fill  them."Though  some  were  surprised  that  Shakespeare  didn't  make  the  100  Books  to  Read  in  a  Lifetime  list,  "Romeo  and  Juliet"  made  the  cut  this  time  under  in  the  Star-Crossed  Lovers  category.

It  was  just  four  degrees  in  Central  Park,  breaking  a  record  of  six  set  in  1896.That's  not  quite  as  bad  as  the  all-time  low  of  15  below  zero  in  1934.  But  with  the  wind  chill,  temperatures  still  felt  well  below  zero  Tuesday  --  a  69-degree  drop  from  Monday,  when  the  weather  was  a  relatively  sultry  50  degrees  with  wind  chill.Temperatures  plummeted  below  freezing  somewhere  in  all  50  states  Tuesday  morning  --  most,  but  not  all,  due  to  the  arctic  blast  hovering  like  an  ice  chest,  according  to  CNN  meteorologist  Dave  Hennen.  (The  cold  regions  of  California  and  Hawaii,  for  example,  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  vortex.)In  Florida,  despite  the  low  temperatures,  crops  were  not  damaged  Tuesday  morning,  the  state's  Fruit  and  Vegetable  Association  told  CNN.Hard  freeze  warnings  were  in  effect  from  eastern  Texas  to  the  Florida  Panhandle.Authorities  have  blamed  at  least  16  deaths  on  the  cold  so  far,  including  11  from  traffic  accidents  and  three  involving  hypothermia.  A  spokesman  for  the  Cook  County  medical  examiner's  office  said  Tuesday  that  one  person  had  died  as  a  result  of  the  extreme  cold.The  record  cold  in  many  areas  is  putting  a  strain  on  electric  grids  --  creating  dangers  that  more  people  could  lose  power.  "We're  past  our  expected  peak  power  demand  for  today,"  the  Tennessee  Valley  Authority  said  on  Twitter.  "Thanks  for  conserving  where  you  can."  In  Alabama,  27,000  customers  were  without  power  Tuesday  morning,  but  that  figure  dropped  to  about  18,000  as  service  was  restored  in  some  areas,  according  to  Alabama  Power.At  Chicago's  Lincoln  Park  Zoo,  Anana  --  a  polar  bear  who  never  grew  the  thick  layer  of  fat  that  bears  in  the  Arctic  do  --  had  to  be  brought  inside  Monday.  And  at  the  National  Aviary  in  Pittsburgh,  bald  eagles  and  African  penguins,  "who  are  used  to  temperate  climates,"  were  taken  off  exhibit  until  the  weather  warms  up,  the  facility  reported.Travel  snarledThe  weather  left  more  than  500  people  stranded  on  three  Amtrak  trains  overnight  in  western  and  north-central  Illinois,  Amtrak  spokesman  Marc  Magliari  said.All  three  Chicago-bound  trains  --  two  coming  from  California,  and  one  originating  in  Quincy,  Illinois  --  stopped  Monday  afternoon  or  evening  because  conditions  prevented  them  from  going  farther.  At  least  one  was  stopped  by  "heavy  snow  drifting  in  a  trenchlike  area,"  Magliari  said."The  passengers  were  sheltered  in  place  overnight,"  Magliari  said.  "It  wasn't  safe  to  take  people  off  these  trains  ...  because  there  wasn't  a  good  way  to  get  people  to  and  from  the  trains  in  the  bad  weather."Amtrak  worked  to  make  other  arrangements,  putting  some  passengers  on  buses.  The  first  buses  arrived  in  Chicago  at  7  a.m.  ET;  the  last  bus  wasn't  expected  to  reach  the  city  until  early  Tuesday  afternoon,  Magliari  said.All  the  trains  had  heat  and  electricity  throughout,  he  said."It  certainly  wasn't  as  comfortable  as  anyone  would  have  liked,  but  it  was  not  unsafe,"  Magliari  said.  "It  was  the  best  thing  to  do  in  these  temperatures  in  these  conditions  at  that  time  overnight  in  that  part  of  the  state."Jeanette  Floyd,  who  boarded  one  of  the  California  trains  in  Kansas  City,  praised  the  crew  for  helping  to  keep  passengers  positive,  but  said  her  trip  --  which  ended  up  taking  more  than  a  day  from  start  to  finish  --  still  was  "one  of  the  worst  (experiences)  ever.""I  can't  feel  my  butt  because  it's  just  not  there  anymore,  just  sitting  for  literally  26  hours,"  Floyd  told  CNN  Tuesday  after  arriving  in  Chicago  by  bus.Floyd  and  other  passengers  said  the  crew  gave  them  a  complimentary  meal  during  the  stranding.A  fourth  Amtrak  train  was  stuck  for  nine  hours  Monday  night  and  early  Tuesday  near  Kalamazoo,  Michigan,  about  300  passengers  had  to  wait  more  than  nine  hours  to  reach  their  destination,  CNN  affiliate  WXMI  reported."It  was  kind  of  like  purgatory,"  a  passenger  told  CNN  affiliate  WLS,  adding  that  it  was  "not  quite  hellish  because  there  was  good  company."  The  train,  which  was  bound  for  Chicago,  finally  arrived  at  the  city's  Union  Station  on  Monday  night,  WLS  reported.More  than  2,500  flights  were  canceled  within,  into  or  out  of  the  United  States  on  Tuesday  morning,  according  to  flightaware.com.New  York  resident  Mindy  Goldberg  said  her  family's  flight  back  from  Mexico  had  been  diverted  to  Boston  because  of  the  weather."I  just  called  my  kids'  school  to  tell  them  they  wouldn't  be  there,  and  she  said,  'Everyone's  stuck  somewhere,'"  Goldberg  told  CNN  affiliate  WBZ.Ships  ran  into  trouble  as  well.  The  U.S.  Coast  Guard  Cutter  Hollyhock  had  to  break  through  ice  in  Lake  Michigan.In  Indianapolis,  Los  Angeles  resident  Jason  Bentley  decided  to  play  in  the  snow  outside  the  airport  after  learning  that  his  flight  home  had  been  canceled  Sunday.  It  was  15  below  zero  Farenheit  (-26  Celsius).JetBlue  cancels  Northeast  flights  to  rest  crews"This  is  the  wettest  snow  I've  ever  touched,  the  easiest  snow  to  make  a  snowman  and  to  have  snowball  fights,"  Bentley  wrote  in  a  CNN  Facebook  discussion.  "It's  also  probably  the  worst  (weather)  I've  ever  been  in  because  of  the  temperature.""Sick  as  a  dog.  Car  is  dead.  Roads  are  closed.  Space  heater  died  yesterday,"  Amanda  Brooke  of  Valparaiso,  Indiana,  said  on  Facebook.  "Missing  doctors'  appointments  I've  had  for  six  months."  She  described  herself  as  "cold,  sick,  and  trying  not  to  be  miserable."In  Columbus,  Ohio,  Alexis  Mitchell-Tremain  posted  that  she  still  had  to  go  to  work.  "So,  it's  layers  of  clothing,  the  hubby's  big  woolly  scarf,  and  a  lot  of  coffee."Jason  Coppula  in  Pittsburgh  can  relate.

I  know  he's  telling  me  the  truth,  but  it's  hard  to  imagine  terrifying  demons  in  a  child  this  small.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  His  mother  is  direct  and  matter-of-fact  about  her  son  over  the  phone.Severe  anxiety.  Depression.  Voices  and  visions  in  his  head.  Suicidal  at  age  4.I,  too,  have  a  4-year-old  child.  I  wonder,  is  that  even  possible?Jennifer  Cristini  is  calm  and  methodical  in  our  first  phone  conversation.  She  says  it's  from  years  of  repeating  these  same  symptoms  and  stories  to  doctors,  teachers,  neighbors  and  friends.I  imagine  their  reaction  must  be  similar  to  mine:  dismay,  sadness  and  helplessness."But  there's  no  sympathy,"  says  Cristini.It's  hard  to  imagine  how  anyone  cannot  be  sympathetic  when  they  first  meet  10-year-old  Giovanni  Cristini,  or  Gianni,  as  his  family  has  called  him  since  he  was  adopted  at  birth.He  looks  younger  than  10,  with  cherubic  cheeks  and  freckles  dotting  his  nose.  His  adult  teeth  are  too  large  for  his  face,  which  breaks  widely  into  a  smile  when  you  talk  about  his  favorite  Pokemon,  Pikachu.  His  hair  is  curly  and  a  little  unruly  from  recess  with  his  friends.Do  you  know  what  you  have?  "I  have  bipolar,"  Gianni  says  to  me,  looking  down  and  rocking.  He  has  a  little  nervous  energy  and  hard  time  focusing.  But  like  many  children  his  age,  he  just  wants  to  please.Do  you  hear  voices?  "Yeah,  from  my  stuffed  animals  and  other  things.  It  scared  the  crap  out  of  me."I  can  feel  his  mom,  who  is  standing  several  feet  away  from  us,  flinch.  She  doesn't  like  coarse  language  from  her  children.Your  stuffed  animals?  What  do  you  mean,  you  hear  things  from  your  stuffed  animals?  "Yeah.  Voices  came  in  my  head.  So  I  told  my  mom.  I  couldn't  even  listen  to  my  music."Are  they  friendly?  Are  they  nice?  "No!"Gianni  says  the  word  loudly,  his  tone  serious  and  adult.  He  wants  me  to  understand:  "They're  just  not  friendly,"  he  stresses,  emphasizing  every  word.My  son  is  mentally  ill,  so  listen  upI  know  he's  telling  me  the  truth,  but  it's  still  hard  to  believe  --  maybe  because  he's  so  young  and  innocent-looking.  It's  hard  to  imagine  terrifying  demons  in  a  child  this  small.'The  fire  in  his  brain'Then  Cristini  hands  me  a  thumb  drive  with  some  home  video.  She  couldn't  possibly  capture  every  episode.  These  are  just  a  few  from  the  last  few  years.Gianni  is  younger  in  the  video,  maybe  7  years  old.  He  looks  even  smaller  but  the  sound  coming  out  of  him  is  the  bloodcurdling  screams  of  horror  movies.  It  is  sheer  terror  coming  out  of  a  pint-sized  human."They're  not  going!"  Gianni  screams  on  the  video,  his  arm  extended  at  the  ghosts  in  front  of  him.Gianni's  father  lays  his  body  over  his  son.  The  weight  and  pressure  calm  him,  he  explains  to  me.You  can  hear  his  mother's  voice,  even  and  calm  on  the  video  as  she  coaxes  Gianni  to  practice  his  breathing."I'm  just  trying  to  get  the  fire  in  his  brain  out,"  she  says.Cristini  is  as  calm  with  me  as  her  voice  is  on  the  video.  She  is  statuesque,  with  the  sort  of  remarkable  beauty  that  opens  doors  and  others  assume  reflects  a  life  of  ease.  It  hides  the  amount  of  practice  she's  had  dealing  with  her  child's  psychotic  rages.Gianni  has  been  with  the  Cristinis  --  Jennifer  and  her  husband,  Vittorio  --  since  he  was  born.  Jennifer  Cristini  carried  him  out  of  the  hospital  in  her  arms,  as  ecstatic  as  if  she'd  carried  and  birthed  him  herself.  Gianni  may  be  adopted,  but  there  is  no  question  that  he  is  a  Cristini,  down  to  the  Italian  first  name  his  father  --  a  Rome  native  --  gave  him.The  Cristinis  were  like  any  new  parents,  nervous  and  a  little  overprotective  of  their  first  child.  They  rejoiced  when  he  walked  at  10  months.  He's  ahead  of  the  curve,  thought  his  mother  proudly.  With  curly  hair,  his  eyes  brown  and  wide,  the  little  boy  was  perfect  in  every  way  to  his  parents.But  when  her  son  was  as  young  as  18  months,  Jennifer  Cristini  began  looking  up  childhood  behavior  regularly  on  the  Web.I  lost  my  husband  to  bipolar  disorderLike  most  new  mothers,  she  wasn't  sure  if  the  behavior  her  son  was  exhibiting  was  normal.  Most  mothers  only  look  here  and  there  out  of  a  brief  moment  of  anxiety.  But  it  was  all  Cristini  researched  on  the  Web.Her  beautiful  boy  was  obsessive  about  toys  and  clothing.  He  demanded  the  same  shirt  every  morning  and  threw  a  tantrum  if  it  wasn't  ready.  And  it  wasn't  just  crying;  it  was  like  the  end  of  his  world.  They  didn't  ever  stop;  they  just  kept  getting  worse.When  Gianni  stopped  sleeping  because  of  his  rages,  his  mother  was  terrified.  All  the  parenting  books  said  sleep  was  as  important  as  nutrition.  Why  wouldn't  he  sleep?And  these  weren't  night  terrors  that  kept  her  boy  up  at  night.  His  parents  were  terrified  of  sleeping  themselves.Searching  for  answersThe  Cristinis'  pediatrician  sent  him  to  a  specialist.  The  waiting  list  was  a  year."Just  for  testing,  and  you  don't  get  a  diagnosis,"  she  says.  "You  ask  friends  or  neighbors  and  nobody  has  a  clue.  They  stop  talking  to  you.  They're  tired  of  hearing  your  son  screaming  all  the  time.  There's  nothing  you  can  do  except  fight  and  wait  and  call."The  doctors  first  thought  Gianni  might  be  on  the  autism  spectrum,  although  he  didn't  quite  fit  the  profile.  Cristini  still  leapt  at  the  diagnosis,  because  it  allowed  her  to  make  an  appointment  with  another  specialist.Then  more  waiting.When  he  was  almost  5  years  old,  a  doctor  prescribed  him  an  antidepressant.  The  doctor  didn't  know  what  was  wrong  with  Gianni  and  thought  maybe  it  was  an  attention  problem  or  a  depression  issue.The  drug  wasn't  tested  on  children,  because  of  the  obvious  ethical  complications.  Cristini  was  nervous."You're  so  desperate  you're  willing  to  take  anything  as  a  diagnosis,"  she  recalls  of  that  episode.  "There's  this  massive  guilt  you  carry  all  the  time.  What  more  can  I  do?  Maybe  I  brought  him  to  the  wrong  doctor?"She  watched  Gianni  take  the  pill.  It  took  only  an  hour  for  her  to  realize  what  a  terrible  mistake  it  was."After  that  one  dose  he  says,  'Mom,  I'm  gonna  kill  myself.'  He's  saying,  'I  can't  take  it  anymore.  I  just  want  to  die.  I  want  to  go  to  the  woods  and  kill  myself.  Can  you  just  leave  me  on  the  road  somewhere?'  At  (nearly)  5.  You're  like  --  this  isn't  ...  he  doesn't  have  ADD.  There's  something  else  going  on  here."The  doctor's  office  suggested  another  specialist.  And  then  another  waiting  list.There  was  a  doctor  who  warned  Cristini  her  son  wouldn't  amount  to  much  so  she  should  just  get  used  to  it.Then  there  was  the  doctor  who  prescribed  Gianni  a  drug  even  though  he'd  never  seen  him  in  person.Warning  signs  parents  can't  ignoreIt  is  little  wonder  Cristini  has  a  gallon-sized  plastic  bag  of  prescription  bottles,  all  with  Gianni's  name  on  them.  Many  of  the  bottles  still  have  pills  in  them."You  try  a  medicine  and  it  works  for  one  day,  or  two  days,  maybe  a  week,  and  then  it  stops  working,"  says  Cristini,  her  frustration  visible  as  she  holds  up  the  bottles."You  feel  like  no  one  knows  how  to  help  you  or  really  what  to  do  or  really  what  they're  doing.  It's  this  incredible  puzzle  that  you're  trying  to  figure  what  piece  goes  where  and  what  combination  will  work.  And  that  puzzle  is  always  changing  as  he  grows."The  Cristinis  blame  an  entire  culture  and  medical  field  that  lacks  research  or  compassion  toward  children  with  mental  illness.The  National  Alliance  on  Mental  Illness  estimates  "4  million  children  and  adolescents  in  this  country  suffer  from  a  serious  mental  disorder  that  causes  significant  functional  impairments  at  home,  at  school  and  with  peers."Despite  the  numbers,  public  schools  struggle  to  cope  with  mentally  ill  children.  Gianni  attends  Pathways  Academy,  a  rare  private  institution  in  Albuquerque  that  accepts  mentally  ill  children.  At  this  small  school,  being  bipolar  or  schizophrenic  doesn't  make  you  too  dangerous  to  educate.Pathways  was  started  11  years  ago  by  a  parent  frustrated  by  the  lack  of  resources  in  public  schools  for  her  two  special-needs  children."People  blame  parents  for  their  child's  behavior.  'If  you  take  a  switch  to  them,  they'll  be  better  and  do  better  things,'"  explains  principal  Jan  Secunda.  "That  kind  of  mentality  still  exists  that  it's  the  parent's  fault  or  the  child  has  a  character  flaw,  not  that  it's  a  neurobiological  disorder  or  illness."What's  worse,  says  Secunda,  is  that  there's  even  less  sympathy  for  patients  the  younger  they  are.  "I  think  there's  a  lot  more  acceptance  of  adult  mental  illness  than  there  is  of  childhood  mental  illness.  They  think  it's  a  bad  kid,  not  an  ill  kid."The  school  is  a  lifesaver  for  the  Cristinis,  who  want  desperately  for  Gianni  to  socialize  with  other  children.'I  come  in  my  room  and  hide'Vittorio  Cristini,  a  scientist  in  cancer  research,  says  a  school  infrastructure  for  mentally  ill  children  is  more  important  to  him  than  any  cure.  "Gianni  needs  a  place  where  he  can  thrive,"  he  says.Like  most  scientists,  he  is  a  rational  man.  He  understands  the  biology  of  his  son's  illness.  You're  almost  distracted  by  the  rolling  Italian  accent  covering  every  word,  until  the  seriousness  of  his  words  land.Mental  illness  in  children:  Know  the  signsBut  with  every  day  that  passes,  Gianni  grows  stronger  while  his  parents  grow  older.He  has  frightened  his  father  and  mother.  "He's  threatened  to  kill  us.  He  says  'I  want  you  dead,  I  want  to  kill  you.  I  want  you  out  of  my  life.'  And  he  comes  after  us,"  says  Jennifer  Cristini.  She's  heard  it  so  often  that  she  can't  say  how  many  times  her  son  has  screamed  those  threats  at  her.The  parents  worry  about  protecting  their  other  two  children,  5-year-old  Tizita  and  7-year-old  Gabriella.  They  both  know  their  brother  has  been  diagnosed  with  bipolar  schizophrenic  affective  disorder.  At  least,  that's  the  current  diagnosis.Tizita  grabbed  me  by  the  hand  and  took  me  to  her  room,  filled  with  the  telltale  dollhouse  and  pink  blankets  of  a  little  girl.Her  brother's  room  is  next  door  and  she  loves  to  run  into  his  room.  But  when  Gianni  is  in  the  middle  of  a  psychotic  rage,  "sometimes  I  come  in  my  room  and  hide,"  she  says.Then  she  shares  her  worst  fear  about  her  family.  "I  feel  like  Gianni's  gonna  kill  my  mom  and  dad.""I  lift  weights  to  stay  strong,"  Vittorio  Cristini  says.  But  "what  will  happen  when  we  are  old?""He  isn't  getting  better,"  says  Jennifer  Cristini.  "We  see  his  mental  illness  getting  worse  every  year.  You  hope  for  everything  but  you  have  to  be  realistic."When  he's  18  and  taller  than  me,  weighs  more  than  me?  I  worry  about  that.  I  worry  about  the  fact  that  he  comes  at  me  now,  at  age  10.  What's  he  going  to  be  like  in  eight  years?  Will  there  be  a  medicine  that  works  for  him  anymore?"She  says  she  wants  CNN  to  come  into  her  home  and  share  her  family's  personal  story  so  other  parents  don't  feel  alone.  She  wants  pediatricians,  schools  and  her  community  to  change.But  most  of  all,  she  wants  this:  "We  need  help."Mental  illness  in  children:  Where  to  turn</TEXT></DOC>

She  is  the  author  of  "Shadows  in  the  Sun:  Healing  from  Depression  and  Finding  the  Light  Within."(CNN)  --  For  more  than  a  decade  of  my  life,  I  struggled  with  debilitating  anxiety,  panic  attacks  and  depression.  And,  like  millions  of  people  around  the  world,  I  longed  to  discover  a  magic  pill  to  cure  my  ills  and  promise  me  nirvana.But,  despite  taking  many  medications,  ongoing  psychotherapy,  electroconvulsive  therapy  (ECTs),  hospitalizations  and  failed  suicide  attempts,  wellness  remained  a  distant  dream.The  anti-anxiety  medications  and  antidepressants  worsened  my  symptoms,  and  made  me  more  agitated,  depressed  and  suicidal.  And  I  was  utterly  confused  why  the  medications  that  were  supposed  to  alleviate  my  symptoms  exacerbated  them  instead.Staring  out  of  the  fifth-floor  hospital  window  one  day  after  yet  another  failed  suicide  attempt,  I  promised  to  take  charge  of  my  life  and  create  a  life  of  wellness.  I  was  sick  and  tired  of  being  a  chronically  mentally  ill  patient.  I  just  wanted  to  be  well.Most  of  all,  I  wanted  to  be  able  to  take  my  little  girl  to  school,  play  with  her  in  the  park,  and  tuck  her  to  bed  at  night  with  her  favorite  story.Somewhere  deep  in  my  soul,  I  was  convinced  that  the  medications  were  making  me  sicker  instead  of  helping  me  heal.  So,  despite  my  fears  and  those  of  my  family,  I  decided  to  listen  to  my  inner  wisdom  and  wean  myself  off  all  medications  under  the  supervision  of  my  psychiatrist  and  explore  holistic  pathways  to  health  and  wellness.Transcendental  meditationWhen  a  medical  resident  at  the  hospital  suggested  I  try  transcendental  meditation  to  manage  my  anxiety  and  depression,  I  did.Ironically,  it  was  an  American  teacher,  Pat,  who  taught  me  this  life-affirming  practice  that  had  originated  in  India,  my  country  of  birth.  I  still  remember  sitting  cross-legged  on  a  Persian  carpet  across  from  Pat,  in  the  dining-room-turned-shrine  in  her  home.While  Pat  sat  still,  Buddha-like,  eyes  closed,  breath  steady,  body  relaxed,  face  serene,  my  breath  was  erratic,  my  eyelids  fluttered  like  the  wings  of  a  hummingbird,  and  my  "monkey  mind"  ran  amok.But,  one  day,  one  breath  at  a  time,  I  learned  how  to  sit  still.  Despite  my  mind's  tendency  to  wander,  like  a  mother  lovingly  guiding  her  wayward  child  back  to  its  task  I  learned  to  gently  guide  my  mind  back  to  its  still  center.  There,  I  discovered  an  oasis  of  energy,  creativity,  and  restful  calm.In  time,  meditation  offered  me  a  sacred  space  to  reflect  on  my  life,  and  taught  me  to  become  an  observer  of  my  thoughts  and  emotions  instead  of  getting  entangled  in  them.  Eventually,  the  daily  practice  of  meditation  helped  me  regulate  my  emotions  and  live  each  moment  with  mindfulness.  Ultimately,  meditation  set  me  free  from  the  limitations  of  my  suffering,  and  awakened  me  to  a  life  filled  with  eternal  possibilities.ExerciseDuring  a  visit,  my  psychiatrist  recommended  I  start  exercising,  and  educated  me  about  the  benefits  of  exercise  in  managing  my  anxiety  and  depression  and  promoting  overall  well-being.I  joined  a  health  club  and  started  working  out  three  times  a  week,  attended  aerobics  and  yoga  classes  and  trained  with  free  weights.I  fell  in  love  with  my  yoga  classes.  They  relaxed  and  rejuvenated  my  mind,  body,  and  spirit.  Having  never  been  athletic,  I  was  surprised  to  find  that  exercise  energized  me  and  elevated  my  mood.  It  also  provided  a  much-needed  reprieve  from  my  duties  as  a  mother  and  homemaker,  and  helped  me  create  a  social  network  outside  of  my  family.Cognitive  behavioral  therapyAlthough  I  was  highly  skeptical  about  how  talking  with  a  therapist  could  help  me  heal,  it  transformed  my  life.For  the  first  time  in  my  life,  Dr.  Lin,  my  therapist,  explained  how  our  thoughts,  feelings,  moods  and  behavior  were  interwoven,  and  taught  me  how  to  identify  negative,  self-defeating  thoughts  and  replace  them  with  positive,  life-affirming  thoughts.She  also  taught  me  how  to  regulate  my  breathing  to  manage  my  anxiety,  and  self-talk  to  break  through  the  vicious  cycle  of  depressive  ruminations  and  suicidal  ideation.  She  recommended  I  read  "Feeling  Good"  by  Dr.  David  Burns,  which  further  reinforced  the  skills  she  taught,  and  served  as  a  workbook  for  my  life.Difficult  at  first,  with  practice  the  cognitive  behavioral  skills  gradually  became  autonomous  as  breathing.  Albert  Einstein  once  said,  "The  world  we  have  created  is  a  product  of  our  thinking;  it  cannot  be  changed  without  changing  our  thinking."  The  tools  of  cognitive  behavioral  therapy,  in  essence,  helped  change  my  thinking,  and,  therefore,  my  world.Over  the  past  24  years,  I  have  learned  that  wellness  does  not  come  encapsulated  in  a  pill;  rather,  it  encompasses  the  way  I  live.  The  consistent  practice  of  transcendental  meditation,  exercise,  and  cognitive  behavioral  therapy  have  helped  me  thrive  in  life  despite  recurrent  bouts  of  anxiety  and  depression.Depression  is  no  longer  a  demon  I  fear,  it  is  a  teacher  whose  wisdom  I  seek.The  opinions  expressed  are  solely  those  of  Gayathri  Ramprasad.</TEXT></DOC>

But  it  also  will  recommend  how  more  data  can  be  collected,  said  another  project  leader,  Jeffrey  Rosen  of  Corona  Environmental  Consulting."Our  project  will  clarify  at  what  levels  (the  chemical)  should  be  ingested  at,"  though  there's  no  timetable  yet  for  those  findings,  Whelton  told  reporters  at  a  news  conference.The  effort  --  called  the  West  Virginia  Testing  Assessment  Project  --  comes  after  the  chemical  4-methylcyclohexane  methanol,  or  MCHM,  was  discovered  leaking  from  a  storage  tank  into  the  Elk  River  and  into  Charleston's  water  supply  last  month.  The  state's  health  bureau  set  up  the  testing  this  month  at  Gov.  Earl  Ray  Tomblin's  direction.A  licorice-like  smell  alerted  residents  to  the  contamination  and  led  to  a  do-not-use  order  for  300,000  West  Virginians,  some  of  whom  could  not  drink  or  bathe  in  their  water  for  more  than  a  week.Officials  lifted  the  do-not-use  order  last  month,  saying  the  chemical  was  found  at  very  low  levels.  But  Tomblin  ordered  the  in-depth  studies  after  questions  persisted.West  Virginians:  We  don't  drink  the  waterWhelton  said  sample  collection  at  10  homes  started  last  week  and  finished  Wednesday.  Six  hundred  samples  were  sent  to  laboratories  in  three  states.Little  is  known  about  the  health  effects  of  the  chemical,  which  is  used  to  wash  coal  before  market  to  reduce  ash.An  expert  panel  that  will  explore  how  much  of  the  chemical  can  safely  be  consumed  "will  be  finalized  in  the  coming  weeks,"  Rosen  said.An  independent  water  test  conducted  early  this  month  at  CNN's  request  found  trace  levels  of  MCHM,  both  in  untreated  river  water  and  in  tap  water  from  two  homes  in  Charleston.  The  amounts  ranged  from  less  than  0.5  parts  per  billion  to  1.6  parts  per  billion,  well  below  the  1  part  per  million  that  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  has  said  it  considers  unlikely  to  be  associated  with  any  adverse  health  effects.In  its  official  guidance,  the  CDC  does  not  use  the  word  "safe."  It  merely  says  that  based  on  animal  studies,  levels  of  the  chemical  were  calculated  at  levels  where  "a  person  could  likely  ingest  without  resulting  in  adverse  health  effects."Rosen  said  the  limited  data  from  which  the  CDC  made  its  guidance  was  not  ideal,  but  the  guidance  was  justifiable  based  on  the  information  the  CDC  had.  Rosen  said  the  new  panel  will  try  to  obtain  data  the  CDC  didn't  have,  but  still  said  the  information  pool  wouldn't  be  ideal.Asked  if  the  Charleston-area  public  should  stop  drinking  the  water  until  the  new  panel  made  its  determination,  Rosen  said  that  "has  to  be  a  personal  decision."Earlier  this  week,  Dr.  Rahul  Gupta,  health  officer  and  executive  director  of  the  Kanawha-Charleston  and  Putnam  County  health  departments,  told  CNN  that  "the  official  agencies  are  saying  (the  water  is)  OK  to  drink,"  but  "they're  not  saying  it's  safe  to  drink.""That's  the  word.  People  are  looking  for  that  word  (safe),"  Gupta  said.After  the  spill,  two  waves  of  patients  sought  treatment  from  private  doctors  and  10  emergency  rooms  in  a  nine-county  area  for  nonspecific  symptoms  such  as  rashes,  nausea,  vomiting  and  coughing,  Gupta  said.West  Virginia  asks  feds  to  study  possible  health  effects  of  chemical  spillThe  first  peak  --  about  250  patients  --  happened  in  the  first  three  days  after  the  spill  was  reported  on  January  9,  he  said.A  lull  ensued  during  the  several  days  of  the  do-not-use  advisory,  followed  by  a  second  peak  --  about  the  same  number  --  during  the  first  few  days  after  the  advisory  was  lifted  January  13,  he  said.Gupta  acknowledged  his  findings  were  "nonscientific"  and  he  did  not  know  what  the  baseline  incidence  would  be  of  patients  appearing  at  an  emergency  room  with  such  symptoms  but  said  the  anecdotes  point  to  the  need  for  further  studies."Those  two  peaks  are  undeniable,"  he  said.  "Perhaps  there  is  something  going  on  here."He's  called  for  a  long-term  study  to  be  carried  out  "in  a  manner  able  to  capture  any  long-term  impact."CNN's  Elizabeth  Cohen  and  Tom  Watkins  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Ashton  said  in  an  investigative  report  Tuesday.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  The  shooting  death  of  Ibragim  Todashev,  an  associate  of  the  alleged  mastermind  of  the  Boston  Marathon  bombing  who  was  killed  in  a  scuffle  with  FBI  agents,  was  justified,  Florida  State  Attorney  General  Jeffrey  L.  Ashton  said  in  an  investigative  report  Tuesday.As  expected,  the  report  concluded  that  there  was  no  wrongdoing  in  the  shooting  of  Todashev  and  that  "the  actions  of  the  Special  Agent  of  the  FBI  were  justified  in  self-defense  and  in  defense  of  another."The  finding,  reported  by  CNN  last  week,  concurs  with  an  FBI  internal  review  of  the  shooting,  which  supported  the  agent's  account.  It  also  matches  what  the  Florida  state  attorney  for  Orange  and  Osceola  counties  found  in  his  investigation.Evidence  reviewed  includes  photos  of  the  agent  showing  his  injuries,  officials  said.The  shooting  occurred  on  May  22,  2013,  as  Massachusetts  state  troopers,  accompanied  by  FBI  agents,  questioned  Todashev,  27,  in  his  apartment  in  an  Orlando  suburb,  officials  said.The  report  cites  FBI  documents  that  said  Todaschev  was  writing  a  confession  to  a  triple  murder  when  when  he  attacked,  flipping  the  table  he  was  writing  on  and  striking  an  FBI  agent  in  the  head.  Todaschev  ran  to  the  kitchen  and  was  heard  frantically  grabbing  items  before  reappearing  in  the  doorway  wielding  a  long  metal  handle  of  a  mop  or  broom.The  report  said  Todashev  took  an  attack  stance  with  the  pole  and  lunged  violently  at  the  agent,  who  fired  three  to  four  rounds.  Todaschev  went  down  on  his  knees  momentarily  before  he  "sprang"  to  his  feet  again.  The  agent  fired  another  three  to  four  rounds.  Todaschev  was  hit  seven  times,  with  fatal  shots  to  his  head  and  his  heart,  according  to  the  documents.Massachusetts  investigators  were  pursuing  information  about  a  grisly  2011  triple  murder  that  they  thought  could  have  been  tied  to  Todashev  and  Tamerlan  Tsarnaev,  who  allegedly  carried  out  the  deadly  bombing  in  April  2013  with  his  younger  brother,  Dzhokhar  Tsarnaev.Tamerlan  Tsarnaev  was  killed  as  he  and  his  brother  confronted  police  in  the  days  after  the  bombing.  Dzhokhar  Tsarnaev  was  later  arrested  and  jailed.  He's  awaiting  trial.Last  week,  the  Florida  chapter  of  the  Council  on  American-Islamic  Relations,  which  called  for  an  investigation  into  Todashev's  shooting,  said  it  was  conducting  its  own  investigation  of  his  death."Certainly,  the  FBI's  failure  to  prosecute  a  single  agent  in  its  history  for  shooting  a  suspect  does  not  help  its  credibility,"  the  council  said  in  a  statement.  "Our  concern  however  is  not  only  regarding  whether  the  agent  was  justified  at  the  time  he  pulled  the  trigger,  which  was  the  focus  of  the  state  and  federal  investigation,  but  about  the  pattern  of  civil  rights  abuse  that  occurred  before,  during,  and  after  the  killing  of  Ibragim  Todashev."Todashev's  family  has  disputed  that  he  posed  any  threat  to  the  law  enforcement  officers  and  agents  in  his  apartment."My  son  was  definitely  unarmed,  because  he  never  had  a  gun,"  his  father,  Abdulbaki  Todashev,  told  CNN  in  Moscow  in  a  June  2013  interview.  "He  couldn't  attack  them  or  fight  them;  he  couldn't  do  anything  because  even  two  men  could  easily  handle  him."U.S.  law  enforcement  officials  said  Todashev  made  statements  implicating  himself  and  Tamerlan  Tsarnaev  in  the  2011  killings.The  FBI  had  interviewed  Todashev  before  about  the  marathon  bombing  because  he  was  a  friend  who,  like  Tamerlan  Tsarnaev,  trained  in  martial  arts.  He  was  cooperative,  and  the  FBI  didn't  consider  him  to  be  involved.Still,  Todashev's  shooting  has  raised  questions  about  the  FBI's  handling  of  the  matter,  because  any  evidence  he  could  have  provided  is  now  lost.According  to  the  investigative  report,  the  agents  knew  of  Todashev's  skills  in  mixed  martial  arts  and  his  criminal  history,  which  included  acts  of  violence.  The  suspect  refused  to  meet  agents  and  state  troopers  at  a  police  station,  insisting  instead  that  they  come  to  his  Florida  apartment.  During  the  nearly  five-hour  meeting,  the  suspect's  demeanor  changed  while  discussing  and  eventually  confessing  to  his  involvement  in  the  triple  slaying  in  Waltham,  Massachusetts,  the  report  said.After  Todashev  asked  to  use  the  bathroom,  one  of  the  law  enforcement  officers  removed  a  large,  Samurai-type  sword  mounted  on  the  wall  near  the  kitchen,  the  report  said.  Concerned  about  his  changing  demeanor,  one  trooper  texted  another  trooper  and  FBI  agent:  "Be  on  guard,  He  (Todashev)  is  in  a  vulnerable  position  to  do  something  bad.  Be  on  guard  now.  I  see  him  looking  around  at  times."Moments  later,  Todashev  attacked.The  report  said  Todashev  "struck  the  FBI  Agent  in  the  head  with  a  coffee  table  and  then  armed  himself  near  the  front  door  of  the  address.  As  he  then  re-engaged  the  FBI  Agent  and  Trooper  One,  they  both  perceived  Mr.  Todashev's  movements  towards  them  as  being  potentially  life  threatening."Todashev  "armed  himself  with  a  red  broom  handle"  and  charged  at  the  officers,  the  report  said."The  FBI  Agent  engaged  the  impending  threat  twice,  by  discharging  his  issued  handgun  a  total  of  seven  (7)  times  during  two  volleys  of  gunfire."The  use  of  deadly  force  by  the  agent  was  "reasonable  and  justified,  and  therefore,  lawful,"  the  report  concluded.CNN's  Evan  Perez  and  Shimon  Prokupecz  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Every  week,  in  fact,  it  seems  there's  another  athlete  accused  of  some  heinous  crime.Are  sports  stars  more  prone  to  dangerous,  criminal  behavior  --  including  those  involving  guns  --  than  your  everyday  Joe?  Will  they  more  likely  carry  guns  and  use  them?  And  are  more  and  more  of  them  breaking  the  law  and  spiraling  out  of  control?"Statistically,  absolutely  not,"  said  Mitch  Abrams,  a  sport  psychologist  and  clinical  assistant  professor  at  Rutgers'  Robert  Wood  Johnson  Medical  School.  "But  nobody  gives  a  hoot.  ...  These  athletes  are  more  celebrities  than  anything  else."Sports  stars  have  been  hailed  for  decades  in  American  society,  and  with  that  comes  extra  attention  and  scrutiny.  Still,  in  today's  24-hour  news  cycle  --  in  a  media  world  with  the  NFL  and  NHL  and  NBA  and  MLB  networks,  not  to  mention  the  ESPNs  of  the  world  --  that  spotlight  has  gotten  brighter.And  when  someone  such  as  Ray  Rice  of  the  Baltimore  Ravens  is  accused  of  knocking  his  wife  unconscious  or  former  NFL  standout  turned  analyst  Darren  Sharper  is  charged  in  multiple  date  rapes,  people  take  notice  because:  1)  their  alleged  crimes  are  egregious,  and  2)  they  are  known  to  millions  of  Americans.That  celebrity  aspect  is  critical  when  you're  trying  to  put  such  stories  into  perspective,  according  to  Dan  Lebowitz,  the  executive  director  for  the  Sports  in  Society  center  at  Boston's  Northeastern  University.Because  "celebrity  culture  drives  the  news  cycle"  and  because  star  athletes  are  celebrities,  he  says,  these  kinds  of  stories  are  read  and  spread  everywhere.  Yet  even  if  it  might  seem  that  way,  it  doesn't  change  the  fact  that  --  when  compared  with  crime  rates  for  all  adult  males  --  professional  athletes  are  no  more  likely  to  kill  someone,  get  arrested  for  a  gun  crime  or  be  convicted  of  domestic  violence."It's  upsetting,  and  it  stands  out,"  Lebowitz  says  of  news  about  alleged  killings,  rapes,  abuse  and  other  horrific  acts  involving  athletes.  "But  that  doesn't  mean  it's  (endemic)."There  have  been  examples  in  which  that  ubiquitous  celebrity  seemingly  has  come  at  a  steep  price.Take  Sean  Taylor,  a  Washington  Redskins  star  defender  shot  dead  inside  his  Florida  home  during  what  appeared  to  be  a  botched  burglary.  There's  also  Washington  Nationals'  catcher  Wilson  Ramos,  who  was  kidnapped  in  Venezuela.  And  it's  not  just  players  who  are  targeted,  as  seen  in  the  kidnapping  of  the  mother  of  iconic  Baltimore  Orioles  shortstop  Cal  Ripken  Jr.For  that  reason,  Abrams  says,  many  athletes  legitimately  "fear  that  they  are  going  to  be  in  danger.""The  problem  is,  they  don't  know  what  they're  doing  with  their  guns."Burress  could  be  exhibit  No.  1:  He  inadvertently  shot  himself,  having  never  threatened  anyone  else.  Gilbert  Arenas,  then  a  standout  with  the  Washington  Wizards,  was  charged  with  a  felony  gun  violation  after  drawing  guns  in  the  locker  room  --  something  he  insisted  was  a  joke.Lebowitz  said  such  cases  reflect  more  on  America's  "gun  culture"  than  its  sports  culture.  While  Department  of  Justice  statistics  show  the  number  of  purposeful  and  accidental  shootings  have  fallen  in  recent  decades,  "There  is  (still)  an  inordinate  amount  of  kids  being  killed  on  a  daily  basis."Yes,  Abrams  admits,  sometimes  an  intense,  hypermasculine  pro  athlete  who  acts  like  a  warrior  on  the  field  has  a  fragile  ego  off  it,  unsure  what  to  do  when  someone  (particularly  a  woman)  challenges  him."He  feels  insecure,  he  feels  hurt,"  said  Abrams,  the  author  of  "Anger  Management  in  Sport."  "As  things  escalate,  maybe  it  becomes  physical."This  isn't  the  norm,  though.  Most  past  and  present  athletes  carry  themselves  well  or  at  least  don't  commit  crimes.When  some  of  them  do  go  down  the  wrong  path,  that's  more  a  function  of  the  fact  they  are  human,  not  that  they  are  athletes.Lebowitz  calls  "sports  ...  the  ultimate  common  denominator,"  because  any  given  roster  can  represent  society  as  a  whole  --  all  colors,  races,  classes  and  creeds.Some  of  these  athletes  commit  crimes,  just  like  some  nonathletes  do.As  Abrams  says,  "Sports  are  a  microcosm  of  society.  And  we  live  in  a  violent  society."</TEXT></DOC>

She  is  a  senior  fellow  at  the  Council  on  Contemporary  Families,  a  nonprofit  organization  that  gathers  research  on  American  families,  and  chairwoman  of  the  advisory  board  for  the  Ph.D.  program  in  sexual  studies  at  the  California  Institute  for  Integral  Research.(CNN)  --  It's  not  news  that  looks  matter.  Depending  on  how  attractive  people  think  we  are,  we  may  have  at  times  found  ourselves  dateless  or  overwhelmed  with  unwanted  attention.Studies  have  indeed  shown  that  people  attribute  more  intelligence  and  competence  to  taller,  well-turned-out  or  otherwise  good-looking  people.  However,  a  new  briefing  paper  by  the  Council  on  Contemporary  Families  tell  us  life's  uneven  distribution  of  beauty  counts  in  an  even  more  poignant  place  than  we  may  have  considered:  in  school  evaluations  of  our  children  by  teachers  and  peers.In  a  recently  releasted  briefing  report,  "In  School,  Good  Looks  Help  and  Good  Looks  Hurt  (But  They  Mostly  Help)."  sociologists  Rachel  Gordon  and  Robert  Crosnoe  show  that  in  high  school,  some  students  --  say,  a  prom  queen  and  king  --  will  be  rated  higher  in  intelligence,  personality  and  potential  for  success  just  because  they  are  considered  good-looking.More  than  that,  they  will  actually  get  higher  grades  and  be  more  likely  to  graduate  from  college.In  fact,  the  authors,  whose  the  larger  study  --  published  in  book  form  by  Wiley  --  say  that  "the  difference  in  GPA  and  college  graduation  rates  between  youth  rated  by  others  as  attractive,  versus  average  in  looks,  is  similar  to  the  differences  in  academic  achievement  between  youth  raised  in  two-parent  versus  single-parent  families."If  the  idea  that  kids  get  better  grades  based  on  "getting  by  on  looks"  frosts  you,  wait.  This  will  make  you  nuts:  Based  on  their  findings,  Gordon  and  Crosnoe  believe  that  the  effects  of  beauty  (or  lack  thereof)  may  last  far  beyond  high  school  graduation.They  say  there  is  a  cumulative  boost  (or  loss)  of  self-esteem  about  one's  own  appearance  that  carries  over  from  high  school  into  college  and  perhaps  over  a  lifetime.And  even  though  the  authors  say  that  beauty  has  its  pitfalls  (good-looking  men  and  women,  for  example,  dated  more  and  drank  more  and  some  of  this  had  a  negative  impact  on  their  grades  and  college  success),  their  conclusion  is  that,  overall,  this  period  of  "lookism"  in  high  school  is  important  enough  to  merit  the  same  kind  of  consciousness-raising  discussion  given  to  unfair  racial  or  class  stereotypes.If  looks  translate  into  higher  praise,  better  grades  and  even  more  credit  for  being  warm  and  sensitive,  as  the  authors  found  in  their  research,  this  is  a  real  boon  for  the  people  with  the  lucky  DNA.  Each  advantage  a  student  has  is  likely  to  make  that  young  man  or  woman  feel  more  self-confident  --  and  self-confidence  is  an  extraordinary  tool  to  use  in  adult  life.The  other  side  of  the  coin  is  what's  concerning:  There  is,  as  many  parents  know,  the  depression  and  sense  of  worthlessness  a  young  adult  may  feel  when  he  or  she  is  not  deemed  good-looking  in  high  school.  It  is  frightening  to  think  this  may  lead  to  a  lifetime  of  feeling  awkward,  unlovable  and  inferior.We  have  all  become  more  sensitive  and  activist  about  issues  of  adolescence  we  used  to  ignore.  We  now  know  how  dangerous  bullying  is,  how  destructive  depression  can  be  and  how  important  it  is  to  reframe  our  view  of  people  who  have  physical  or  mental  disabilities.While  we  can't  mandate  that  people  change  their  opinion  about  who  is  or  is  not  good-looking,  we  could  ask  our  kids'  teachers  to  be  aware  of  their  own  tendency  to  give  a  higher  grade  or  greater  approval  to  a  good-looking  kid  than  to  one  that  is  not.  We  could  all  bring  attention  to  slang  that  kids  use  to  assess  or  denigrate  another  person's  looks.Does  this  sound  too  PC?  Maybe.  But  a  little  sensitivity  here  wouldn't  be  a  bad  thing.Terms  such  as  "tubby"  or  "skinny"  or  "lame"  or  other  insult  equivalents  you  may  have  heard  don't  need  to  be  leveled  at  anyone.  Young  people  are  acutely  aware  when  they  are  not  the  favored  ones,  and  they  know  that  popularity  and  good  looks  are  usually  paired.Moreover,  an  ambitious  student  who  is  attractive  might  prefer  to  be  complimented  on  what  he  or  she  said  or  did  rather  than  for  appearance.  It  does  them  no  favor  to  allow  them  to  think  that  their  looks  are  their  primary  and  best  attribute;  it  could  cause  them  to  be  insecure  about  other  aspects  of  their  personality  or  behavior.Talking  openly  about  this  could  make  it  clearer  to  the  people  in  our  children's  day-to-day  world  that  their  casual  remarks  can  have  long-term  effects.  It  can  also  take  some  of  the  sting  out  of  not  being  in  the  running  for  prom  king  or  queen.  And  here  I  would  suggest  that  such  beauty  and  popularity  contests  are  a  dicey  idea  for  schools  in  the  first  place.  They  have  an  impact  on  the  impressions  and  behavior  of  everyone  in  the  school,  even,  potentially,  teachers.We  spend  time  and  energy  to  make  sure  our  kids  are  treated  fairly  in  life.  Let's  help  ensure  they  are  not  discriminated  against  --  or  given  a  free  ride  --  just  because  of  the  way  they  look.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Pepper  Schwartz.</TEXT></DOC>

The  federal  Lacey  Act  combats  trafficking  in  "illegal"  wildlife,  fish  and  plants.In  a  plea  agreement,  Rakower  admitted  that  his  company  purchased  piranhas  from  a  Hong  Kong  tropical  fish  supplier  and  imported  them  to  the  city,  according  to  the  statement.Rakower  instructed  the  foreign  supplier  to  falsely  label  the  exotic  fish  on  packing  lists  as  silver  tetras,  a  common  and  unaggressive  aquarium  fish,  because  New  York  City  prohibited  the  possession  of  piranhas,  the  statement  said.Rakower  smuggled  39,548  piranhas  over  the  course  of  2011  and  2012,  swimming  up  costs  of  approximately  $37,376,  according  to  the  statement.Piranhas,  freshwater  fish  originating  in  South  American  rivers,  are  described  as  extremely  aggressive  and  territorial.  As  a  result,  25  states  have  either  banned  or  regulated  piranhas,  making  them  illegal  to  own  or  sell.Rakower  was  "driven  by  greed  and  without  regard  for  the  health  and  safety  of  people  or  the  environment,"  said  Queens  District  Attorney  Richard  Brown,  who  helped  investigate  the  case.Rakower  agreed  to  pay  more  than  $70,000  in  fines  and  restitution,  and  his  company  will  serve  a  two-year  period  of  probation.  Rakower  will  be  sentenced  on  April  24.Warning  over  testicle-biting  fish  in  Denmark?  It's  all  wet70  people  injured  in  Argentine  fish  attack</TEXT></DOC>

I  ...  am  handing  in  my  resignation,"  it  quoted  him  as  saying.Tenyukh  was  Ukraine's  acting  defense  minister  as  troops  wearing  unmarked  uniforms  --  which  the  West  said  were  Russian  forces  --  surrounded  Ukrainian  bases  in  Crimea  this  month.  Russia  annexed  Crimea  last  week  after  a  controversial  referendum  that  Ukraine  and  the  West  say  was  illegal.The  new  leaders  in  Kiev,  who  took  office  after  months  of  protests  forced  pro-Moscow  President  Viktor  Yanukovych  from  office,  say  Crimea  is  still  a  part  of  Ukraine.Russia  snubbed  at  summitRussia  insists  its  actions  are  legitimate.  Crimea  belonged  to  Russia  until  1954  when  it  was  given  to  Ukraine,  which  was  then  part  of  the  Soviet  Union.  The  region  has  a  majority  ethnic  Russian  population  and  other  long  historic  ties  to  Russia.Speaking  at  The  Hague  on  Tuesday,  U.S.  President  Barack  Obama  said  Russia  had  a  way  out  of  tensions  over  the  crisis:  Negotiate  with  Kiev  and  be  prepared  to  "act  responsibly"  and  respond  to  international  norms,  such  as  respecting  Ukraine's  territorial  integrity.If  Russia  doesn't  act  responsibly,  "there  will  be  additional  costs"  that  could  hurt  the  global  economy  but  will  affect  Russia  most  of  all,  Obama  said  at  the  Nuclear  Security  Summit  in  the  Netherlands.He  added  that  Russia's  annexation  of  Crimea  "is  not  a  done  deal"  because  it's  not  internationally  recognized.  But  he  acknowledged  that  the  Russian  military  controls  Crimea,  and  said  the  world  can  make  sure,  through  diplomacy  and  sanctions,  that  Russia  pays  a  price."I  think  it  would  be  dishonest  to  suggest  there  is  a  simple  solution  to  resolving  what  has  already  taken  place,"  Obama  said,  dismissing  any  suggestion  that  Russia's  intervention  in  Crimea  --  and  hints  that  it  could  intervene  in  Ukraine  to  support  Russian  speakers  --  was  similar  to  NATO's  intervention  in  Kosovo.Obama  also  said  Russia  was  more  isolated  now  than  it  was  roughly  five  years  ago  during  its  war  with  the  former  Soviet  republic  of  Georgia,  and  more  than  it  was  during  most  of  the  20th  century  when  it  was  the  Soviet  Union.Moscow  has  doggedly  pursued  its  own  course,  even  as  Western  leaders  have  denounced  its  actions  as  violations  of  Ukraine's  sovereignty  and  a  breach  of  international  law.In  what  has  become  the  biggest  East-West  confrontation  since  the  Cold  War,  the  United  States  and  European  Union  have  imposed  visa  bans  and  asset  freezes  on  some  of  Russian  President  Vladimir  Putin's  closest  political  and  business  allies.  Russia  responded  with  its  own  list  of  sanctions  against  a  number  of  U.S.  lawmakers  and  officials.The  G7  group  of  leading  industrialized  countries  has  condemned  both  the  Crimean  vote  to  secede  and  Russia's  annexation  of  Crimea.  Russia  has  now  been  excluded  from  what  was  the  G8.  Moscow  had  joined  the  G7  group  in  1998  to  form  the  G8.Russia  initially  reacted  to  the  snub  by  saying  "the  G8  is  an  informal  organization  that  does  not  give  out  any  membership  cards  and,  by  its  definition,  cannot  remove  anyone."But  on  Tuesday,  the  Kremlin  said  it  wants  to  maintain  contact  with  G8  partners."As  for  the  contacts  with  the  G8  countries,  we  are  ready  for  them,  we  are  interested  in  them,  but  the  unwillingness  of  other  countries  to  continue  the  dialogue,  in  our  view,  is  counterproductive  both  for  us  and  our  partners,"  presidential  spokesman  Dmitry  Peskov  told  Russia's  state  ITAR-Tass  news  agency.Ahead  of  the  G7  gathering,  a  representative  for  British  Prime  Minister  David  Cameron  said  that  no  G8  meeting  would  take  place  in  Russia  this  year  as  previously  planned.Concerns  over  military  buildupAlso  at  the  nuclear  summit  Monday,  Russian  Foreign  Minister  Sergey  Lavrov  met  his  Ukrainian  counterpart,  Andrii  Deshchytsia,  and,  separately,  U.S.  Secretary  of  State  John  Kerry.During  his  meeting  with  Lavrov,  Kerry  expressed  concern  about  Russian  troops  amassed  on  the  Ukrainian  border,  U.S.  State  Department  spokeswoman  Marie  Harf  said.Other  officials,  including  NATO's  top  military  commander,  have  already  expressed  concern  about  the  buildup  of  Russian  forces  on  Ukraine's  border.Russia  has  added  10,000  troops,  along  with  air  defense  artillery  and  wheeled  vehicles,  to  its  positions  near  Ukraine's  eastern  border  in  the  last  week  to  10  days,  according  to  a  U.S.  official  with  knowledge  of  the  situation.  Russian  forces  in  the  vicinity  now  total  30,000,  according  to  U.S.  estimates.Russia  had  maintained  a  level  of  about  20,000  troops  in  the  area  but  began  reinforcing  and  adding  to  their  positions  in  recent  days,  the  official  said,  leading  to  U.S.  concern  that  they  are  positioned  to  move  into  Ukraine  if  and  when  they  are  ordered  to  do  so.Separately,  a  senior  U.S.  defense  official  told  CNN  that  Russia  "has  enough  troops  that  we  believe  they  could  move  against  Ukraine  at  any  time  now."  The  official  emphasized  the  United  States  still  does  not  know  Russia's  intentions  on  the  border  despite  statements  by  its  defense  minister  that  the  troops  are  there  only  for  exercises.U.S.  intelligence  also  indicates  the  Russian  forces  are  positioned  possibly  to  go  after  three  Ukrainian  cities  --  Kharkiv,  Luhansk  and  Donetsk  --  to  establish  a  "land  bridge"  of  access  into  Crimea.  Russian  forces  have  moved  so  close  to  the  border,  there  would  be  no  warning  time,  and  the  United  States  would  likely  only  see  an  incursion  as  it  was  happening.Russian  forces  are  currently  positioned  in  and  around  Rostov,  Kursk  and  Belgorod,  according  to  U.S.  intelligence  information.Far-right  group  leader  killedSeparately,  a  Ukrainian  leader  of  a  far-right  group  was  shot  dead  in  what  Ukraine's  Interior  Ministry  called  a  shootout  with  police.Ukrainian  special  forces  were  trying  to  arrest  Oleksandr  Muzychko,  better  known  as  Sashko  Biliy,  in  a  cafe  in  the  western  city  of  Rivne,  the  ministry  said.  Muzychko  was  wanted  "for  his  criminal  background  and  illegal  carrying  of  weapons,"  the  ministry  said."He  tried  to  escape  and  used  gun  shots  against  the  police,"  the  ministry  said.  "Shots  were  fired  in  response,  injuring  Muzychko,  who  died  soon  after."Muzychko  was  a  leader  of  Right  Sector,  a  far-right  group  prominent  in  the  recent  anti-government  protests.  Three  others  were  arrested  and  taken  to  Kiev,  the  ministry  said.A  Ukrainian  lawmaker,  Oleksandr  Doniy,  whose  constituency  is  in  Rivne,  gave  a  different  version  of  events.  In  a  post  on  his  Facebook  page,  he  said  two  vehicles  had  forced  Muzychko's  car  to  stop,  and  he  had  then  been  dragged  into  one  of  the  other  cars."Then  they  threw  him  out  of  the  car  on  the  ground,  with  hands  handcuffed  behind  his  back,  and  shot  twice  in  his  heart,"  Doniy  wrote,  without  saying  where  he  got  his  information.Rival  hackers  fighting  proxy  war  over  CrimeaU.S.,  other  powers  kick  Russia  out  of  G8Is  Russia  done  after  Crimea?CNN's  Barbara  Starr,  Boriana  Milanova,  Anna  Maja  Rappard  and  Jason  Hanna  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Up  your  resistance  with  these  tips.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(upwave.com)  --  Sick  and  tired  of  getting  sick  and  tired  every  time  a  cold  or  flu  bug  rolls  through  your  world?  Want  to  improve  your  well-being,  have  more  energy  and  maybe  even  live  longer?Start  working  some  of  these  fun  (and  simple!)  immune  boosters  into  your  regular  schedule,  and  you  may  be  able  to  ward  off  illness  better  in  the  future.  Here's  looking  achoo,  immune  system!upwave:  Take  the  challenge  --  Boost  your  immunity!1.  SingingResearch  shows  that  singing  is  an  effective  immunity  booster  --  even  if  you're  off-key.  So  sing  in  the  shower  in  the  morning.  Sing  in  the  car  during  your  commute.  Sing  at  home  when  you're  doing  the  dinner  dishes.  But  don't  sing  at  work.  That  would  be  weird.  (Just  sayin'.)2.  LaughingAccording  to  a  variety  of  studies,  laughter  activates  protective  T-cells  and  increases  antibody  production.  So  listen  to  a  hilarious  podcast  or  shock-jock  while  you  get  ready  for  work.  Watch  an  episode  of  your  favorite  sitcom  while  you  eat  breakfast.  Watch  a  stand-up  DVD  during  dinner.  Crack  open  a  funny  book  before  you  hit  the  hay.  The  more  you  LOL  on  a  daily  basis,  the  more  you  help  your  immune  system  stay  strong.  (And  the  nice  thing  about  laughter  is,  it's  often  contagious.  So  you  can  spread  the  healthy  benefits  to  others!)upwave:  Does  laughing  really  help  your  health?3.  Stress-bustersStress  is  Public  Enemy  No.  1  when  it  comes  to  your  immune  system  (the  cortisol  it  produces  suppresses  your  immune  cells),  so  anything  that  lowers  your  stress  levels  will  help  your  immune  system  do  its  job.  Identify  the  people  and  activities  that  calm  you  down  and  take  you  to  your  happy  place,  then  start  fitting  'em  into  your  schedule  on  a  regular  basis.4.  ProbioticsThe  health  of  the  GI  tract  plays  a  big  role  in  bolstering  the  immune  system.  In  fact,  Amanda  Bontempo,  a  registered  dietitian  at  NYC's  Montefiore-Einstein  Center  for  Cancer  Care,  told  upwave  that  "the  health  of  the  GI  system  determines  the  health  of  the  immune  system."A  major  key  to  digestive  health?  Probiotics  such  as  yogurt,  kefir,  sauerkraut,  miso  and  sourdough  bread,  all  of  which  contain  so-called  "good  bacteria"  that  helps  your  GI  tract  do  its  thang.upwave:  7  ways  to  lighten  up  with  Greek  yogurt5.  PrebioticsThese  soluble  fibers  --  which  are  found  in  foods  such  as  bananas,  artichokes,  onions  and  leeks  --  help  probiotics  work  their  magic,  and  therefore  help  the  GI  tract,  too.6.  Human  touchGetting  a  massage,  hugging,  holding  hands,  having  sex  --  all  lower  the  body's  immunity-weakening  cortisol  levels.  According  to  research,  getting  a  45-minute  massage  also  bolsters  pathogen-fighting  white  blood  cells  and  reduces  inflammatory  cytokines,  which  have  been  connected  to  autoimmune  diseases.Having  sex,  hugging  and  holding  hands  cause  our  bodies  to  release  cortisol-lowering  oxytocin,  making  them  awesome  immune-system  improvers.  Some  experts,  in  fact,  recommend  eight  hugs  a  day  to  take  your  oxytocin  benefits  to  the  max.  So  get  your  hug  on!upwave:  6  ways  sex  makes  you  healthy7.  MeditationMindfulness  meditation  positively  influences  the  immune  system;  according  to  one  study,  participants  who  meditated  for  eight  weeks  showed  an  increased  immune  response  to  the  flu  shot.  If  you're  a  morning  person,  start  your  day  with  a  three-minute  meditation  session.Not  an  early  bird?  Meditate  for  three  minutes  when  you  get  home  from  work,  or  when  you're  getting  ready  for  bed.  Meditation  newbie?

Solid  shut-eyeStudies  have  found  that  sleep  deprivation  lowers  your  T-cell  count,  thereby  reducing  your  body's  ability  to  fight  off  disease-causing  pathogens.  If  you  don't  get  eight  hours  of  sleep  on  a  regular  basis,  start  taking  steps  to  improve  your  sleep  hygiene  now.

Moderate  exerciseExercise  doesn't  just  help  your  body  fight  infection:  Research  shows  that  it  also  decreases  your  risk  of  getting  diseases  such  as  osteoporosis  and  cancer.  Even  taking  a  20-minute  walk  every  day  will  strengthen  your  body's  disease-fighting  capabilities  --  10  minutes  out,  and  10  minutes  back.  That's  it!upwave:  Walking  workout  tips10.  Human  connectionAccording  to  research  published  by  the  American  Psychological  Association,  social  isolation  weakens  immunity  and  compromises  the  body's  ability  to  fight  infection.  Social  ties  such  as  marriage,  on  the  other  hand,  strengthen  it.  Feeling  lonely?  Seek  the  company  of  others  --  it  will  strengthen  your  immune  functioning.11.  GreensGreen  veggies  like  bok  choy,  kale  and  broccoli  give  your  immune  system  a  leg  up  by  ensuring  that  immune  cells  in  your  gut  are  functioning  properly.

Veronica  was  determined  to  find  out  who  committed  the  crime  to  the  point  of  ostracizing  herself,  which  wasn't  hard  to  do  after  her  father  was  raked  over  the  coals  for  pinning  the  murder  on  the  wrong  guy.Fairly  typical  mystery  series  stuff,  right?  Yet  the  real  beauty  of  the  show  was  never  in  Veronica's  search  or  the  cases  she  cracked  along  the  way;  it  was  in  her  total  embrace  of  her  outsider  status  and  her  refusal  to  be  treated  differently  because  of  it.  Life  could  suck,  and  many  unfair  things  happened  to  Veronica  and  her  friends,  but  she  always  rebounded  with  spunk  and  smarts."Other  girls  on  television,  like  Buffy  (on  'Buffy  the  Vampire  Slayer')  or  'Alias,'  they  could  literally  kick  a**,"  creator  Thomas  recently  said.  "I  felt  like  Veronica's  superpower  could  be  that  she  just  doesn't  give  a  s***  what  people  think  about  her."That  attitude  has  gone  a  long,  long  way.  While  "Veronica  Mars"  the  TV  series  was  a  cult  hit  that  wound  up  canceled  after  three  seasons,  those  who  did  watch  were  so  devoted  to  the  character  and  her  multicultural,  multiclass  beach  town  that  they  single-handedly  got  a  film  version  off  the  ground  via  Kickstarter.CNN  Money:  Will  'Veronica  Mars'  be  a  hit?For  those  who  never  got  into  the  teen  drama,  the  idea  of  a  fan  base  strong  enough  to  drum  up  $2  million  in  less  than  12  hours  to  resurrect  a  TV  character  was  nothing  short  of  insane.  But  that  would  be  underestimating  the  world  Thomas  and  his  crew  created."Veronica  was  the  best  friend  I  would  beg  not  to  go  to  Europe,"  Bell  told  Entertainment  Weekly  in  a  February  issue.  The  actress,  33,  reprises  her  role  in  the  film  version,  which  sees  Veronica  returning  to  Neptune  to  solve  a  murder  case  that  involves  her  ex-boyfriend  Logan  (Jason  Dohring)."I  feel  so  much  responsibility  to  the  girls  that  this  show  affected,"  Bell  went  on.  "There  is  a  role  model  here  that  I  care  about.  I  think  when  you  get  that  amount  of  love  from  a  fan  base,  you  would  be  an  a**hole  not  to  give  it  back."Those  who  supported  reuniting  the  "Veronica  Mars"  team  on  film  --  and  it  does  reunite  everyone,  from  main  characters  to  actors  who  had  guest  arcs  --  are  getting  that  love  returned  on  March  14,  when  "Veronica  Mars"  the  movie  will  debut  in  theaters  and  as  Video  On  Demand.It's  still  up  in  the  air  whether  Veronica  will  have  better  luck  as  a  big-screen  hero  than  she  did  on  TV,  and  can  draw  in  a  larger  audience  this  time  around.  Yet  even  if  "Mars"  doesn't  find  much  life  at  the  theaters,  Thomas,  Bell  and  company  can  rest  easy  knowing  they've  already  left  an  indelible  mark  on  pop  culture.  Here  are  five  ways  they  did:1.  It  featured  a  smart,  young,  kick-a**  heroine.When  "Veronica  Mars"  debuted,  it  arrived  in  a  TV  landscape  populated  by  soapy  teen  dramas  like  "The  O.C."  and  "One  Tree  Hill,"  and  reality  series  like  "America's  Next  Top  Model.""Buffy  the  Vampire  Slayer"  had  staked  her  last  vamp  the  year  before,  and  the  best  place  to  find  women  who  weren't  presented  as  being  one-dimensionally  focused  on  looks  or  their  romantic  lives  --  or  damaged  and  in  need  of  being  rescued  --  was  in  prime  time,  with  shows  like  "Charmed"  (about  a  trio  of  sister  witches)  and  "Alias"  (about  a  take-no-prisoners  international  spy).But  "Mars"  was  the  place  to  go  if  you  wanted  a  character  who  felt  like  a  teen  girl  you  would  actually  meet  in  high  school,  albeit  one  who  had  way  better  one-liners  and  better  time  management  skills.  (This  was  a  character  with  the  caseload  of  a  working  private  investigator  who  was  still  dead  serious  about  her  homework.)Fearless,  focused  and  funny,  she  made  individualism  look  so  much  better  than  fitting  in.2.  It  featured  a  strictly  platonic  relationship.The  TV  trope  of  an  opposite  sex  friendship  is  so  well-worn  that  we  know  as  soon  as  we  see  a  pair  of  male  and  female  buds  that  there  will  be  something  more  eventually.But  on  "Veronica  Mars,"  the  plot  refreshingly  never  went  there.  One  of  Veronica's  closest  friends  is  a  guy  named  Wallace  Fennel  (Percy  Daggs  III),  a  companion  whose  shoulder  she  can  cry  on  and  whom  she  would  readily  help  out  in  a  jam,  but  with  whom  she's  an  equal,  not  a  romantic  interest.  For  once,  the  teens  who  tuned  in  were  shown  that  yes,  a  nonsexual  friendship  between  men  and  women  can  work.3.  It  had  a  strong  father-daughter  relationship.After  "Mars"  fans  kicked  in  the  funds  needed  to  launch  a  "Veronica  Mars"  movie,  their  collective  breath  was  held  until  stars  like  Enrico  Colantoni  were  a  sure  deal.  As  Keith  Mars,  Veronica's  dad,  Colantoni  was  the  older,  wiser  heart  of  the  series.  He  wasn't  always  the  best  parent  but  he  was  a  realistic  one,  and  his  relationship  with  Veronica  was  the  foundation  of  the  show.  When  everything  else  came  crashing  down  around  her,  Veronica  always  had  her  dad  --  the  sort  of  comforting  story  that  you  don't  see  in  a  lot  of  teen  TV,  where  the  parents  are  often  worse  off  than  their  kids.4.  It  proved  that  teen  dramas  could  thoughtfully  deal  with  tough  issues.From  rape  to  class  tensions,  bullying  to  predatory  older  men,  "Veronica  Mars"  had  an  endless  supply  of  plot  lines  that  wouldn't  be  out  of  place  on  an  after-school  special.  What  saved  the  series  wasn't  its  commitment  to  talking  about  complex  problems  but  the  way  in  which  they  were  talked  about.  The  script  brought  real  issues  into  a  fictional  world,  and  still  made  them  relatable.The  topic  of  race,  for  example,  wasn't  danced  around;  it  could  crop  up  in  a  natural  exchange  between  characters.  The  subject  of  classism  was  virtually  the  backbone  of  the  entire  series,  as  much  of  the  plot's  tension  revolved  around  the  wealthy  kids  who  came  from  a  rich  ZIP  code  and  the  have-nots  they  shunned.5.  It  showed  that  nothing  ever  really  dies  in  Hollywood.By  industry  logic,  this  show  should  have  fallen  to  the  wayside  and  enjoyed  a  life  only  on  fan  sites  and  in  DVD  sales  of  its  three  seasons.  But  thanks  to  the  on-demand  era  we  now  live  in,  where  Netflix  can  craft  an  entire  series  based  on  what  its  users  want  most,  "Veronica  Mars"  and  its  fervent  fan  base  have  proven  that  anything  can  have  a  second  life.</TEXT></DOC>

The  attacker  took  the  violin  and  fled  to  a  waiting  vehicle,  which  a  second  suspect  was  driving,  police  said.Stradivarius  violin  stolen  from  Milwaukee  concertmasterAccording  to  the  symphony,  Almond  plays  on  a  violin  made  by  Antonio  Stradivari  from  1715.Hersh  has  spoken  to  Almond  since  the  recovery,  saying  the  musician  is  understandably  relieved.  Almond  has  not  yet  been  reunited  with  the  instrument,  according  to  Hersh.Stradivari  was  born  in  1644.  He  set  up  shop  in  Cremona,  Italy,  where  he  made  violins,  harps,  guitars,  violas  and  cellos.  Before  his  death  in  1737,  Stradivari  is  thought  to  have  made  more  than  1,100  instruments  --  of  which  some  650  remain  today.He  is  the  world's  most  celebrated  violin  maker.</TEXT></DOC>

The  second  most  affected  day  of  a  notoriously  brutal  winter  was  January  6,  when  more  than  4,100  flights  were  canceled,  Baker  said.The  winter  weather  took  a  big  bite  out  of  schedules  at  airports  in  Charlotte,  North  Carolina,  Philadelphia  and  the  New  York  and  Washington  metro  areas,  and  was  still  having  a  big  impact  in  Atlanta,  where  the  storm  tapered  off  Thursday  morning.After  more  than  3,400  flight  cancellations  Wednesday,  the  familiar  scene  of  stranded,  weary  passengers  roaming  around  airports  will  only  get  worse."I  think  what  makes  this  so  exceptional  is  that  it  affected  so  many  different  areas  over  so  many  days  and  comes  on  the  heels  of  several  different  storms,"  Baker  said  via  e-mail  of  the  week's  pileup  of  airline  cancellations.Another  flight  tracking  service,  masFlight,  has  tracked  73,000  U.S.  flight  cancellations  so  far  in  2014  due  to  the  barrage  of  winter  storms.Airline  experts  say  this  year's  rash  of  flight  cancellations  is  the  worst  to  hit  the  industry  since  the  entire  U.S.  airspace  was  closed  following  the  September  11,  2001,  terrorist  attacks.On  the  rails:  Amtrak  cutting  backIf  you  were  planning  to  travel  long-distance  by  train,  it's  time  to  make  other  arrangements.Amtrak  said  at  least  six  long-distance  routes  along  the  East  Coast  have  been  canceled  since  Wednesday.Several  shorter  routes  will  be  running  less  often  or  on  modified  schedules  Thursday,  including  those  between  Washington  and  Boston,  Boston  and  Virginia,  New  York  to  Albany  and  New  York  to  Harrisburg,  Pennsylvania.In  the  car:  Don't  do  itTake  a  lesson  from  Atlanta's  debacle  two  weeks  ago  and  Charlotte's  fiasco  on  Wednesday  --  cars  and  ice  don't  play  well  together.Yes,  those  who  live  farther  up  the  East  Coast  can  handle  winter  weather  better  than  their  Southern  neighbors.  But  it  isn't  just  a  little  precipitation."This  is  going  to  happen  up  and  down  the  East  Coast.  New  York,  Philadelphia,  D.C.,  Richmond,  same  story  --  it's  going  to  snow  hard,"  CNN  meteorologist  Chad  Myers  said."You  could  get  6  inches  in  a  couple  of  hours,  and  then  it's  going  to  rain  on  top  of  it,  sleet  on  top  of  that,  and  then  snow  comes  back  in  because  cold  air  comes  in  behind  it."Washington  was  pummeled  with  snow  late  Wednesday  night.

"I'm  still  going  through  it  right  now,"  Yarbough  said  Friday."I  haven't  slept  yet.  I've  been  up  for  two  days  now.  I  have  no  words  for  it  right  now."Nearly  22  years  of  hard  timeImagine  more  than  two  decades  in  a  maximum  security  prison.  Add  to  that  the  fact  that  you're  accused  of  killing  your  mother,  your  sister  and  your  cousin.As  if  that's  not  enough,  you  were  the  one  who  discovered  their  lifeless,  bloodied  bodies  when  you  opened  the  door  to  your  home  one  night.If  it's  hard  to  imagine  what  that's  like,  Yarbough  will  tell  you.After  years  in  Attica's  maximum  security  prison  among  New  York's  toughest  criminals,  he  left  its  high,  gray  walls  behind  him  Thursday."It  was  a  nightmare,"  Yarbough  told  CNN's  Piers  Morgan  in  an  exclusive  interview.  "Twenty-one  years  and  seven  months  was  more  like  42  years  and  seven  months,  when  you  know  you're  in  prison  for  something  you  didn't  do."After  reviewing  DNA  evidence,  District  Attorney  Kenneth  P.  Thompson  said  the  previous  convictions  for  the  1992  murders  in  Brooklyn  would  most  likely  not  stand  up  in  court  again  and  agreed  the  two  men  should  be  freed."Anybody  looking  at  this  evidence  with  an  open  mind  would  see  that  there  is  no  chance  in  the  world  that  Tony  murdered  his  mother  and  these  two  little  girls,"  his  lawyer  Zachary  Margulis-Ohuma  said.And  that  goes  beyond  the  DNA  evidence  alone.  Margulis-Ohuma  was  convinced  Yarbough  was  innocent  years  before.At  least  one  false  confession  detectives  coerced  out  of  a  scared  teenage  boy  over  20  years  ago  led  to  the  convictions.A  night  outAfter  a  night  of  partying,  Yarbough,  18  at  the  time,  and  Wilson,  15,  went  home  to  Coney  Island.  Wilson  was  staying  with  friends,  they  said.When  Yarbough  got  home,  he  opened  the  door  to  find  his  mother,  sister  and  a  close  family  friend  lying  stabbed  and  strangled  to  death.  The  two  girls  were  partially  undressed.Police  came."I  was  asked  to  come  down  to  the  precinct,"  he  said.  Officers  said  they  wanted  him  to  tell  them  who  might  have  killed  his  family,  he  said."Before  you  know  it,  I  had  this  photograph  shoved  in  my  face,  and  I  was  being  threatened  and  slapped  around,  and  they  wanted  me  to  sign  a  false  confession.  And  I  wouldn't,"  Yarbough  said.Police  also  took  in  Wilson  and  questioned  him  separately  from  Yarbough.  But  he  got  similar  treatment,  he  said."I  was  scared,  afraid;  I  was  lied  to,  manipulated  into  believing  that  I  was  going  to  go  home,  if  I  do  tell  ...  what  they  said  happened."  Wilson  said.Faced  with  a  life  behind  bars,  the  young  boy  cooperated  for  the  promise  of  lighter  treatment.Life  in  prisonThe  two  were  convicted  in  separate  trials.  Yarbough  was  sentenced  to  75  years  to  life.  Wilson  got  a  lower  sentence  of  nine  years  to  life.They  sat  behind  bars  for  about  12  years,  then  something  important  arrived  by  mail."Out  of  the  blue,  I  got  a  letter  from  his  (Yarbough's)  aunt,"  Wilson  said.  "And  she  asked  me,  did  we  really  do  it.  And  I  had  to  tell  the  truth."He  wrote  back  to  her:  "I  was  wrong  for  turning  on  him,  but  I  was  scared  and  pressured  into  it."  We're  innocent,  he  told  her."For  many  years  I  felt  horrible  that  I  had  to  do  that  and  that  I  actually  did  it  knowing  that  we  weren't  guilty  for  a  crime  we  didn't  commit,"  Wilson  said."I  still  feel  horrible  now,"  he  said,  sitting  next  to  Yarbough.Wilson's  letter  led  lawyer  Margulis-Ohuma  and  the  district  attorney  Thompson  to  review  their  cases  in  2010  --  five  years  after  he  sent  it.Wrongful  convictionsThompson  came  into  office  in  January  with  promises  to  restore  justice  to  the  wrongfully  convicted.  This  case  is  part  of  a  review  of  Brooklyn  killings  from  the  1980s  and  early  1990s.Then,  last  year,  the  right  shred  of  evidence  came  along  in  the  form  of  a  DNA  sample  from  a  rape-murder  committed  in  1999.It  matched  DNA  found  under  the  fingernails  of  Yarbough's  mother,  indicating  that  the  same  killer  probably  committed  both  crimes.  In  1999,  Yarbough  and  Wilson  were  in  prison  and  couldn't  have  committed  the  second  murder.Margulis-Ohuma  called  Yarbough  in  prison  to  tell  him  that  he  was  going  to  be  free."When  I  heard  about  it,  I  was  extremely  overwhelmed,"  Yarbough  said.

The  victim  was  stabbed  and  strangled."Hope  had  finally  started  to  sink  in,"  he  said.Free  at  lastWilson  and  Yarbough  had  not  seen  each  other  for  more  than  two  decades,  when  they  met  in  court  Thursday.Wilson  approached  the  man  he  had  testified  against.

Finding  a  resolution  will  be  difficult,  he  said,  "but  I'd  rather  be  where  we  are  today  than  where  we  were  yesterday."French  Foreign  Minister  Laurent  Fabius  offered  an  optimistic  assessment."For  the  first  time,  something  has  moved  in  the  process,"  he  said,  "and  we  will  continue  to  talk."Meanwhile,  Russia's  foreign  ministry  said  in  a  statement  that  an  agreement  with  the  United  States  had  been  reached  to  help  implement  a  February  21  deal  over  the  transition  of  power  in  Ukraine.  But  Kerry  did  not  mention  that  agreement  in  his  remarks.The  closely  watched  talks  among  top  diplomats  came  after  days  of  simmering  tensions  in  Ukraine's  Crimean  peninsula.Ukrainian  officials  and  Western  diplomats  accuse  Russia  of  sending  thousands  of  troops  into  the  region  in  the  past  week  --  a  claim  Russia  has  denied,  while  maintaining  that  it  has  the  right  to  use  military  force  there  if  necessary  to  protect  ethnic  Russians.But  what  if  diplomacy  fails?  Interim  Ukrainian  Prime  Minister  Arseniy  Yatsenyuk  told  CNN  Wednesday  that  he's  worried  about  that  possibility.Yatsenyuk  told  CNN's  Matthew  Chance  that  he'd  spoken  directly  with  Russian  Prime  Minister  Dmitry  Medvedev  and  called  for  a  diplomatic  solution."We  have  just  two  options  on  the  table.  The  first  one  is  a  political  option,  and  the  other  one  is  military,"  Yatsenyuk  said.  "I  believe  that  the  right  one  is  to  use  all  diplomatic  and  political  tools  to  tackle  the  crisis  and  to  stop  the  invasion."Military  force,  he  said,  "is  the  way  to  nowhere."Kerry  said  Wednesday  that  it  is  up  to  Russia  "to  choose  to  de-escalate  the  situation"  by  having  its  troops  return  to  their  military  bases  and  "welcome  international  observers  and  human  rights  monitors"  into  the  peninsula."The  United  States  is  ready  to  work  with  all  parties"  --  including  Russia  --  "to  make  that  happen,"  Kerry  said.The  United  States'  position  on  the  crisis  has  not  changed,  he  said."Russia's  violation  of  Ukraine's  sovereignty  and  territorial  integrity  has  actually  united  the  world  in  support  of  the  Ukrainian  people,"  Kerry  said.Fears  of  instabilityAs  talks  continued,  tensions  mounted  on  the  ground  in  Crimea.Robert  Serry,  the  U.N.  envoy  to  Ukraine,  said  he  was  threatened  by  unidentified  armed  men  in  Sevastopol  who  tried  to  force  him  into  a  car.For  hours,  he  said  he  was  holed  up  in  a  cafe  as  protesters  swarmed  the  area.  Eventually,  he  was  escorted  safely  to  the  airport  and  left  the  country.Speaking  to  CNN's  Wolf  Blitzer  via  phone  from  Istanbul,  Serry  said  his  experience  shows  how  terrible  tensions  have  become."What  has  happened  to  me,  I  hope  serves  as  a  reminder  to  all,  how  dangerous  the  situation  has  become  in  the  Crimea,"  he  said.  "There  is  a  very  urgent  need  to  de-escalate  the  situation.  All  those  who  are  responsible,  who  can  do  that  must  have  cool  heads  (and)  lower  their  rhetoric."World  leaders,  he  said,  must  do  what  they  can  to  calm  the  situation."Ukraine  threatens  to  be  pulled  apart  if  the  rhetoric  between  East  and  West  is  increasing  rather  than  decreasing,"  he  said."There  is  a  lot  of  mistrust.  That  can  only  be  overcome  if  we  find  a  mechanism  now  for  all  these  people  to  start  talking."In  the  eastern  Ukrainian  city  of  Donetsk,  protesters  took  over  a  local  government  building  and  were  seen  heading  to  the  local  treasury,  witnesses  told  CNN  Wednesday.The  protesters  were  calling  for  a  referendum  on  the  status  of  the  Donetsk  region  and  said  they  want  to  see  the  region  gain  more  autonomy.Sergey  Aksyonov,  the  newly  installed  pro-Russian  Prime  Minister  of  Crimea,  told  CNN's  Diana  Magnay  Wednesday  that  the  descriptions  of  the  realities  on  the  ground  had  been  overblown.  Troops  in  the  region,  he  said,  are  legal  self-defense  forces."I  think  somebody  is  just  overestimating  the  situation,"  he  said.  "People  of  Crimea  are  controlling  the  situation  themselves."Some  Russian  troops  could  end  up  among  them,  he  said,  but  that  shouldn't  be  cause  for  alarm."Today  in  almost  all  of  our  cities,  there  is  an  active  military  selection  to  the  future  army  of  Autonomous  Republic  of  Crimea.  So  it  is  not  excluded  that  there  may  be  some  Russian  military  personnel  that  theoretically  could  sign  up,"  he  said.  "We  are  not  checking  passports  and  don't  know  where  all  the  people  there  belong  to."Andriy  Parubiy,  secretary  of  Ukraine's  Security  and  Defense  Council,  told  reporters  in  Kiev  on  Wednesday  that  the  situation  in  Crimea  was  calmer  than  it  had  been  Tuesday.Parubiy  said  Russian  forces  had  made  no  new  military  gains  on  the  peninsula  but  warned  of  the  danger  of  new  attempts  by  pro-Russian  protesters  to  take  over  government  buildings  in  eastern  and  southern  Ukraine.Several  U.S.  officials  said  that  though  those  Russian  forces  had,  for  the  most  part,  not  returned  to  their  barracks,  they  saw  no  major  strategic  movements  by  them  on  either  side  of  the  border  --  for  the  second  consecutive  day.No  meeting  between  foreign  ministers  of  Russia,  UkraineKerry  and  his  Russian  counterpart,  Sergey  Lavrov,  met  three  times  Wednesday  in  Paris.  They  greeted  each  other  cordially  during  one  session  at  the  Russian  Embassy,  according  to  the  pool  reporter  traveling  with  Kerry.Kerry  urged  direct  talks  between  Russia  and  Ukraine  to  resolve  the  crisis,  the  official  said."We  are  all  concerned  at  what  is  happening  there  (Ukraine),"  Lavrov  told  reporters.  "We  agreed  to  continue  those  discussions  in  the  days  to  come  to  see  how  best  we  can  help  stabilize  normalize  the  situation  and  overcome  the  crisis."By  day's  end,  Lavrov  had  not  met  with  his  Ukrainian  counterpart,  Andrii  Deshchytsia.But  Ukrainian  acting  Economy  and  Trade  Minister  Pavlo  Sheremeta  told  CNN  that  he  believed  there  had  been  some  communication  between  officials  from  the  two  countries."I  think  our  prime  minister  talked  to  the  Russian  prime  minister,"  he  said.German  Chancellor  Angela  Merkel  called  Russian  President  Vladimir  Putin  on  Wednesday  and  the  two  leaders  discussed  possible  moves  to  normalize  the  situation,  the  Kremlin  said.NATO  reviews  Russia  relationshipEarlier  Wednesday,  NATO  warned  it  was  reviewing  its  relationship  with  Russia  and  threats  of  sanctions  --  and  retaliations  --  flew  between  Europe  and  Russia.At  NATO  headquarters  in  Brussels,  Belgium,  Secretary  General  Anders  Fogh  Rasmussen  told  reporters  that  the  international  body  had  decided  to  "put  the  entire  range  of  NATO-Russia  cooperation  under  review"  to  send  "a  clear  message  Russia's  actions  have  consequences."Planning  for  the  first  NATO-Russia  joint  mission  --  the  maritime  escort  of  a  U.S.  ship  involved  in  neutralizing  chemical  weapons  --  has  been  suspended,  though  the  decision  will  not  affect  the  destruction  of  chemical  weapons,  he  said.And  no  staff-level  civilian  or  military  meetings  with  Russia  will  take  place  "for  now,"  Rasmussen  said.In  addition,  he  said,  the  organization  will  "intensify"  its  partnership  with  Ukraine,  stepping  up  engagement  with  its  civilian  and  military  leadership  through  increased  joint  training  and  exercises  and  doing  more  to  include  Ukraine  in  multinational  projects.Russia's  ambassador  to  NATO  criticized  the  secretary  general's  statement,  saying  it  was  made  before  his  country  had  a  chance  to  present  its  side."We  are  very  much  disappointed  by  the  outcome  of  the  meeting  we  had  today.  The  Russia  delegation  arrived  assuming  that  we  are  going  to  have  discussions  to  exchange  our  points  of  view,"  Ambassador  Alexander  Grushko  said."This  meeting  proved  that  NATO  still  has  a  double-standards  policy,  and  still  Cold  War  stereotypes  are  applied  to  the  Russian  Federation,"  Grushko  said.After  the  meeting,  a  NATO  diplomat  said  there  had  been  tense  moments  as  Russian  representatives  skirted  questions  about  practical  steps  that  could  be  taken  to  de-escalate  the  situation."There  were  was  nothing  from  the  Cold  War  atmosphere  that  we  hear  mentioned  a  lot  by  Russian  officials.  It  was  actually  a  frank  discussion,  as  we  should  have  in  these  sorts  of  meetings,"  the  NATO  diplomat  said,  "because  this  is  a  very  serious  situation  where  security  in  Europe  is  at  stake  and  the  basic  principals  of  international  relations  are  at  stake  and  Russia  is  in  clear  breach  of  those."Kerry:  Clear  legal  obligations  at  stakeIn  the  Paris  discussions,  Kerry  reminded  Moscow  that  it  had,  like  Washington  and  London,  signed  an  agreement  in  1994  --  when  Ukraine  agreed  to  give  up  its  nuclear  weapons  --  "to  refrain  from  the  threat  or  use  of  force  against  the  territorial  integrity  or  political  independence  of  Ukraine."There  are  "very  clear  legal  obligations  that  are  at  risk  in  this,"  Kerry  said.At  issue  is  Russia's  insistence  that  the  new,  acting  government  in  Ukraine  is  not  legitimate.Western  powers  argue  that  ousted  President  Viktor  Yanukovych  fled  the  country,  leaving  a  void  that  had  to  be  filled.  They  point  out  that  the  interim  government  was  voted  in  by  a  large  majority  of  parliament,  including  members  of  Yanukovych's  Party  of  Regions.In  a  joint  statement  after  their  meeting,  the  United  States,  the  United  Kingdom  and  Ukraine  called  for  international  observers  to  be  deployed  to  Ukraine.This,  they  said,  "would  help  address  any  concerns  regarding  irregular  forces,  military  activity  and  the  treatment  of  all  Ukrainians  irrespective  of  their  ethnicity  or  spoken  language."Putin  vs.  Obama:  facing  off  over  facts  in  UkrainePossibility  of  sanctionsRussia  has  been  warned  that  possible  sanctions  will  be  on  the  agenda  when  European  Union  leaders  meet  Thursday  in  Brussels  if  no  progress  is  made  in  ending  the  showdown  sparked  by  Russia's  military  intervention  in  Ukraine's  Crimea  region.The  impact  of  sanctions,  if  they  were  imposed,  might  be  felt  by  other  countries,  too.  In  a  tit-for-tat  move,  Russian  lawmakers  are  drafting  a  law  that  would  allow  Russia  to  confiscate  assets  belonging  to  U.S.  and  European  companies  if  sanctions  are  slapped  on  Moscow,  Russian  state  media  reported.The  Russian  threat  was  not  specific,  but  numerous  large  European  and  U.S.  companies  have  interests  in  the  region,  and  Russia  is  a  major  supplier  of  gas  to  EuropeEU  Commission  President  Jose  Manuel  Barroso  announced  Wednesday  in  Brussels  that  the  EU  would  offer  an  aid  package  worth  $15  billion  (11  billion  euros)  to  Ukraine.  He  said  the  package  was  "designed  to  assist  a  committed,  inclusive  and  reforms-oriented"  Ukrainian  government.Barroso  said  on  Twitter  that  the  aid  package  would  consist  "of  immediate  short  and  medium  term  measures  offering  trade,  economic,  technical  and  financial  assistance  to  #Ukraine."During  his  visit  to  Kiev  on  Tuesday,  Kerry  announced  the  United  States  will  give  Ukraine's  interim  government  $1  billion  in  loan  guarantees.  Senior  U.S.  administration  officials  told  CNN  the  move  would  help  insulate  the  Ukrainian  economy  from  the  effects  of  reduced  energy  subsidies  from  Russia.Ukrainian  authorities  have  said  they  will  need  $35  billion  by  the  end  of  2015  to  keep  their  struggling  economy  afloat.Meanwhile,  the  EU  said  it  had  acted  to  freeze  what  it  suspects  are  misappropriated  Ukrainian  state  funds  held  in  Europe  by  18  people  whom  it  did  not  identify.In  Crimea:  'I  feel  unsure  about  what  will  be  tomorrow'State-funded  network's  news  anchor:  'What  Russia  did  is  wrong'Ukraine  developments:  Get  the  updatesWhat  you  need  to  know  about  the  Russia-Ukraine  standoffCrisis  in  Ukraine:  Complete  coverageCNN's  Michael  Holmes  reported  in  Kiev,  Laura  Smith-Spark  wrote  and  contributed  in  London  and  Catherine  E.

Chris  Christie,  Hoboken  Mayor  Dawn  Zimmer  said  Sunday  that  Christie  directly  ordered  the  withholding  of  Superstorm  Sandy  recovery  funds  unless  she  backed  a  redevelopment  plan  he  favored.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  In  another  controversy  surrounding  New  Jersey  Gov.  Chris  Christie,  Hoboken  Mayor  Dawn  Zimmer  said  Sunday  that  Christie  directly  ordered  the  withholding  of  Superstorm  Sandy  recovery  funds  unless  she  backed  a  redevelopment  plan  he  favored.Appearing  on  CNN's  "State  of  the  Union,"  Zimmer  said  she  was  told  by  a  member  of  Christie's  administration  that  Sandy  relief  funds  hinged  on  her  support  for  a  real  estate  development  project  and  that  the  directive  was  coming  directly  from  Christie."She  said  that  to  me  --  is  that  this  is  a  direct  message  from  the  Governor,"  Zimmer  said,  referring  to  Lt.  Gov.  Kim  Guadagno,  who  Zimmer  said  approached  her  in  a  parking  lot  in  May  to  deliver  the  message.It's  "stunning"  and  "outrageous,"  but  true,  the  Hoboken  mayor  told  CNN's  Candy  Crowley.  "I  stand  by  my  word."Zimmer  said  the  Christie  administration  wanted  her  to  approve  a  project  by  The  Rockefeller  Group,  a  real  estate  developer  with  ties  to  Christie's  administration.When  asked  by  CNN  to  respond  to  Zimmer's  accusation  that  Christie  had  a  direct  hand  in  the  threat,  Christie  spokesman  Colin  Reed  refused  to  address  it  and  instead  referred  to  a  previous  statement,  which  said  Zimmer's  allegations  that  relief  funds  were  withheld  is  based  on  partisan  politics.The  allegations  come  as  other  controversies  revolve  around  Christie's  administration.  In  one,  evidence  mounts  showing  that  Christie  aides  were  involved  in  tying  up  traffic  in  a  town  at  the  foot  of  the  George  Washington  Bridge  in  what  may  have  been  an  act  of  political  retribution  against  another  mayor.  In  another,  the  Christie  administration  hired  a  firm  for  post-Sandy  tourism  ads  that  cost  nearly  twice  as  much  as  the  next  highest  proposal.This  is  the  first  time  Christie  has  been  directly  connected  to  the  controversy.Christie  administration  pushes  backIn  his  statement  to  CNN  on  Saturday,  Reed  blasted  Zimmer's  claim  that  the  funds  were  based  on  the  real  estate  project.  He  said  her  accusations  are  false,  adding,  "It's  very  clear  partisan  politics  are  at  play  here  as  Democratic  mayors  with  a  political  ax  to  grind  come  out  of  the  woodwork  and  try  to  get  their  faces  on  television."Reed  went  on  to  attack  the  cable  news  channel  that  first  broke  the  news  Saturday.  "MSNBC  is  a  partisan  network  that  has  been  openly  hostile  to  Governor  Christie  and  almost  gleeful  in  their  efforts  attacking  him,"  Reed  said.MSNBC  said  its  story  is  based  on  an  interview  with  Zimmer  "and  e-mails  and  personal  notes  she  shared  with  MSNBC."The  Governor's  spokesman  also  said  the  Mayor  and  Governor  have  had  a  "productive  relationship,"  noting  an  August  tweet  by  Zimmer  saying  she's  "very  glad  Governor  Christie  has  been  our  Gov."Christie  marches  on  as  controversy  at  home  unfoldsZimmer's  comments  Saturday  and  Sunday  are  a  change  from  what  she  told  CNN  just  last  week,  when  she  said  that  while  she  wondered  whether  Sandy  aid  funds  were  being  withheld  because  she  didn't  endorse  the  governor's  re-election,  she  concluded  that  "I  don't  think  that's  the  case.""I  don't  think  it  was  retaliation  and  I  don't  have  any  reason  to  think  it's  retaliation,  but  I'm  not  satisfied  with  the  amount  of  money  I've  gotten  so  far,"  Zimmer  told  CNN  last  week,  not  mentioning  her  concerns  about  the  redevelopment  project.But  Sunday  morning,  Zimmer  told  CNN's  Crowley  that  she  didn't  speak  out  before  because  she  didn't  think  anyone  would  believe  her,  adding  that  she  is  now  "offering  to  testify  under  oath."Zimmer  admitted  to  supporting  Christie  in  the  past,  saying  she  is  not  a  part  of  "the  Democratic  machine."  But  the  information  around  the  George  Washington  Bridge  scandal  --  involving  lane  closures  at  the  entrance  to  the  busy  bridge,  apparently  for  political  retaliation  --  prompted  her  to  speak.  She  said  she  sees  parallels  between  her  story  and  the  bridge  controversy:  "The  Christie  administration  using  their  authority  to  try  and  get  something."Zimmer  said  Guadagno  appeared  to  feel  guilty  for  delivering  the  message."I  believe  if  and  when  she  is  asked  to  testify  under  oath,  the  truth  will  come  out,  because  I  believe  she  will  be  truthful  and  she  will  tell  the  truth,"  Zimmer  told  Crowley.Zimmer  also  said  she  is  speaking  because  she  wants  Hoboken  to  receive  an  appropriate  level  of  funds  in  the  second  round  of  recovery  dollars  about  to  be  released.Sandy  recovery  fundsAfter  Sandy,  Hoboken  was  80%  underwater.  Zimmer  told  CNN  last  week  that  Hoboken  received  only  about  $300,000  of  the  roughly  $100  million  in  state  funds  the  city  requested  for  flood  prevention.Reed,  Christie's  spokesman,  told  CNN  that  Zimmer  asked  for  $100  million  from  a  roughly  $300  million  pot  of  money  for  which  there  was  $14  billion  worth  of  requests.Since  that  request,  Reed  said,  Hoboken  has  been  approved  for  nearly  $70  million  in  aid.  The  city  has  also  been  identified  as  a  pilot  community  for  a  federal  program  to  prevent  flooding,  one  of  only  four  such  projects  in  New  Jersey.Zimmer,  however,  had  a  different  account  of  allocated  funds.  She  said  the  $70  million  given  to  Hoboken  was  through  flood  insurance  and  other  mechanisms  that  did  not  need  approval  from  the  state.  She  received  only  $300,000  in  Christie-approved  funds,  she  said.CNN  received  images  of  journal  entries  from  the  Mayor's  office  that  Zimmer  told  CNN  she  wrote  at  the  time.See  the  journal  entriesIn  one,  Zimmer  writes  that  the  conversation  with  Guadagno  left  her  upset  and  shattered  the  image  she  had  of  Christie."I  thought  he  was  honest,  I  thought  he  was  moral  --  I  thought  he  was  something  very  different.  This  week  I  found  out  he's  cut  from  the  same  corrupt  cloth  that  I  have  been  fighting  for  the  last  four  years.  I  am  so  disappointed  --  it  literally  brings  tears  to  my  eyes,"  the  journal  entry  says.Zimmer  also  wrote  that  Guadagno  told  her  she  needs  "to  move  forward  with  the  Rockefeller  project.  It  is  very  important  to  the  Gov."Reed,  asked  by  CNN  about  Zimmer's  comments  on  Guadagno,  said,  "Mayor  Zimmer's  characterization  of  her  conversation  in  Hoboken  is  categorically  false."Three  days  after  the  purported  Guadagno  comments,  state  Community  Affairs  Commissioner  Richard  Constable  was  on  a  panel  with  Zimmer,  discussing  Sandy  relief.Zimmer  told  MSNBC  that  Constable  leaned  over  and  told  her,  "If  you  move  (the  redevelopment  project)  forward,  the  money  would  start  flowing  to  you."In  a  statement  to  CNN,  Constable  spokeswoman  Lisa  Ryan  said,  "Mayor  Zimmer's  allegations  that  on  May  16,  2013,  in  front  a  live  auditorium  audience  Commissioner  Constable  conditioned  Hoboken's  receipt  of  Sandy  aid  on  her  moving  forward  with  a  development  project  is  categorically  false."Debate  about  redevelopmentZimmer's  claims  center  around  a  property  owned  by  The  Rockefeller  Group,  which  had  its  plan  for  "redevelopment"  of  a  three-block  area  of  Hoboken  rejected  by  the  city's  planning  board.  Instead,  the  panel  voted  to  classify  the  area  owned  by  the  company  as  available  for  "rehabilitation."  The  "redevelopment"  label  was  sought  because  its  tax  incentives  offered  a  much  more  lucrative  deal  for  the  development  company.Aides  and  advisers  to  Christie  have  ties  to  Wolff  &  Samson,  the  law  firm  representing  The  Rockefeller  Group.The  Hoboken  Planning  Board  rejected  the  "redevelopment"  plan  three  days  before  Zimmer  was  allegedly  first  approached  by  Guadagno.Zimmer  provided  MSNBC  with  a  2012  e-mail  from  Wolff  &  Samson's  Lori  Grifa  --  previously  commissioner  of  the  New  Jersey  Department  of  Community  Affairs  --  to  Hoboken's  lawyer  that  shows  her  lobbying  on  behalf  of  the  project:  "Our  client,  The  Rockefeller  Group,  has  specifically  asked  us  to  speak  with  you  regarding  its  property  in  Hoboken."Grifa  is  not  the  only  connection  between  the  Christie  administration  and  The  Rockefeller  Group.  The  Samson  in  Wolff  &  Samson  is  David  Samson,  chairman  of  the  Port  Authority,  who  was  appointed  by  Christie.  Samson  was  recently  served  with  a  subpoena  in  the  George  Washington  Bridge  case  by  an  investigative  committee  seeking  relevant  documents.The  Rockefeller  Group  told  CNN,  "We  have  no  knowledge  of  any  information  pertaining  to  this  allegation.  If  it  turns  out  to  be  true,  it  would  be  deplorable."The  law  firm,  in  a  statement,  denied  Zimmer's  allegations  and  said  it  did  nothing  wrong:  "The  firm's  and  Ms.  Grifa's  conduct  in  the  representation  of  our  client  was  appropriate  in  all  respects.  Further,  Ms.  Grifa  notes  that  while  DCA  Commissioner,  she  never  met  with  Mayor  Zimmer  or  The  Rockefeller  Group  to  discuss  the  Hoboken  project."Zimmer  told  MSNBC  that  she  couldn't  agree  to  The  Rockefeller  Group  proposal  because  "there  are  fundamental  problems  with  the  site  in  northern  Hoboken,  including  traffic  and  flooding  issues,  that  would  be  magnified  if  the  plan  were  to  go  forward.A  spokesperson  for  The  Rockefeller  Group  told  CNN  that  it  still  hopes  to  develop  the  site  under  the  designation  of  "rehabilitation,"  but  that  this  is  "contingent  on  the  plan  the  city  comes  up  with."Another  investigation?As  word  of  the  allegations  spread  Saturday,  the  chairman  of  the  investigative  committee  tasked  with  looking  into  the  George  Washington  Bridge  scandal  weighed  in.Assemblyman  John  Wisniewski,  D-Middlesex,  told  CNN:  "This  certainly  has  attracted  our  attention.

I'm  trying  to  make  sense  of  what  happened  that  day.  My  boys  went  to  watch  a  friend  run  the  marathon,  and  one  came  home  46  days  later.  The  other  one,  32  days  later.  And  their  lives  are  forever  changed,"  she  told  CNN's  Wolf  Blitzer.  "So  I  want  to  try  and  find  out,  somehow,  to  make  some  sense  of  how  somebody  could  do  this  to  all  these  innocent  people."Attorney  general:  Harm  caused  was  factorAuthorities  allege  Tsarnaev,  a  Chechnya-born  American,  and  his  brother  Tamerlan  planted  two  homemade  bombs  near  the  finish  line  of  the  marathon,  then  killed  a  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  police  officer  three  days  later.The  attacks  triggered  the  massive  manhunt  that  led  to  Tsarnaev's  capture.  Police  shot  and  killed  Tamerlan  Tsarnaev  during  the  manhunt."The  nature  of  the  conduct  at  issue  and  the  resultant  harm  compel  this  decision,"  U.S.  Attorney  General  Eric  Holder  said  in  a  statement  released  by  the  Justice  Department  Thursday  announcing  that  prosecutors  would  pursue  the  death  penalty  in  the  case.Death  penalty  in  the  United  States  gradually  decliningAfter  Holder  made  his  decision,  prosecutors  filed  a  notice  listing  factors  that  they  argue  justify  a  death  sentence  in  the  case.  Among  them:  The  attack  killed  multiple  people,  involved  substantial  planning  and  premeditation  and  involved  betrayal  of  the  United  States,  prosecutors  said.Dzhokhar  Tsarnaev  is  charged  with  30  federal  counts  stemming  from  the  attack.  He  has  pleaded  not  guilty  to  all  charges.The  decision  announced  Thursday  is  no  surprise,  CNN  senior  legal  analyst  Jeffrey  Toobin  said."This  is  a  case,  that,  if  you  believe  in  the  death  penalty,  seems  to  cry  out  for  the  death  penalty,  even  though  the  defendant  is  only  19  years  old,  and  potentially  the  junior  partner  to  his  late  brother,"  Toobin  said.But  that  doesn't  mean  it's  an  open-and-shut  case."One  of  the  most  interesting,  difficult,  strategic  decisions  the  defense  faces,"  Toobin  said,  is  whether  to  push  for  a  change  of  venue  for  the  trial."Boston  was  obviously  deeply  traumatized  by  this  incident.  And  the  jury  pool  is  Boston,  if  the  case  remains  where  it  is.  But  Boston  is  also  probably  the  most  liberal  city  in  the  country.  Death  penalty  opposition  there  is  higher  than  anywhere  else,"  Toobin  said.  "So  does  the  defense  go  somewhere  else,  where  people  don't  have  the  immediate  association  with  the  crime?  Or  do  they  go  somewhere  that  might  not  oppose  the  death  penalty  in  the  same  numbers?"Massachusetts  abolished  the  death  penalty  three  decades  ago,  but  prosecutors  can  seek  the  death  penalty  against  Tsarnaev  because  federal  law  allows  for  the  penalty  in  certain  circumstances.Despite  Holder's  decision  to  authorize  the  death  penalty  in  the  Tsarnaev  case,  prosecutors  still  could  reach  a  plea  deal  for  a  lesser  sentence  with  his  attorneys,  who  include  death  penalty  lawyer  Judy  Clarke.Boston  Marathon  terror  attack  timelineSurvivor  speaks  outFederal  officials  weighed  a  number  of  factors  before  they  announced  their  decision,  including  the  opinions  of  victims  of  the  deadly  attack.Survivors  were  asked  to  fill  out  a  questionnaire  about  what  they  thought  about  the  death  penalty.Marc  Fucarile,  who  lost  a  leg  in  the  bombing,  said  he  has  no  doubt  about  where  he  stands:  Tsarnaev  deserves  to  die."I  prefer  the  death  penalty,  because  I  prefer  that  people  know  that  if  you  terrorize  our  country,  you're  going  to  be  put  to  death,"  he  told  CNN  affiliate  WCVB.  "And  I  strongly  believe  that's  how  it  should  be."Life  since  the  bombing  hasn't  been  easy,  he  said."This  is  almost  kind  of  too  easy  for  him  (Tsarnaev),"  Fucarile  told  WCVB.  "I  still  haven't  walked  for  more  than  day  in  a  prosthetic,  and  it's  almost  a  year  later.  ...  Life's  good,  you  know.  It's  going  to  get  better,  but  it's  going  to  be  a  road,  and  it's  going  to  be  a  long  road  for  the  rest  of  our  lives."In  a  statement  Thursday,  Gov.  Deval  Patrick  urged  the  state's  residents  to  stay  strong."One  way  or  another,  based  on  the  evidence,  Tsarnaev  will  die  in  prison.  In  each  milestone  of  the  case  --  today's  announcement,  the  trial  and  every  other  significant  step  in  the  justice  process  --  the  people  hurt  by  the  Marathon  bombings  and  the  rest  of  us  so  shocked  by  it  will  relive  that  tragedy,"  he  said.  "The  best  we  can  do  is  remind  each  other  that  we  are  a  stronger  Commonwealth  than  ever,  and  that  nothing  can  break  that  spirit."Victims'  mom:  'It  shouldn't  have  happened'Tsarnaev's  attorney  did  not  immediately  respond  to  a  request  for  comment.Reached  before  federal  authorities  announced  their  decision  to  seek  the  death  penalty,  Zubeidat  Tsarnaev,  the  suspect's  mother,  did  not  comment  on  the  specifics  of  the  case."We  are,  you  know,  sickened  about  our  child.  ...  We  have  nothing  in  our  heads  or  in  our  hearts,  so  what  should  I  say?  We  are  just  really  sick,"  she  told  CNN's  Nick  Paton  Walsh  in  a  telephone  interview."The  only  thing  I  want  to  say,"  she  said,  "is  I  want  the  whole  world  to  hear  that  I  love  my  son,  my  precious  Dzhokhar.  That's  it."Thousands  of  miles  away,  another  mother  --  Norden  --  said  her  love  for  her  own  sons  makes  her  want  to  learn  more  about  Dzhokhar  Tsarnaev  during  the  trial,  to  try  to  understand  why  the  deadly  attacks  occurred."I  watch  my  sons,  and  it's  sad.  Their  lives  have  changed,  and  they're  OK  with  it.  They've  learned  to  accept  it.  But  I  can't,"  she  said,  her  voice  cracking.  "You  know,  those  are  my  kids,  and  they  went  to  watch  a  marathon  on  the  streets  of  Boston,  and  it  shouldn't  have  happened."For  Boston  Marathon  bombing  victims:  $8.4  million  of  assistanceCNN's  Evan  Perez,  Susan  Candiotti,  Chuck  Johnston,  Dave  Stewart  and  Jason  Hanna  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

If  approved,  the  new  labels  would  place  a  bigger  emphasis  on  total  calories,  added  sugars  and  certain  nutrients,  such  as  Vitamin  D  and  potassium.The  FDA  is  also  proposing  changes  to  serving  size  requirements  in  an  effort  to  more  accurately  reflect  what  people  usually  eat  or  drink.  For  example,  if  you  buy  a  20-ounce  soda,  you're  probably  not  going  to  stop  drinking  at  the  8-ounce  mark.  The  new  rules  would  require  that  entire  soda  bottle  to  be  one  serving  size  --  making  calorie  counting  simpler.This  is  the  first  overhaul  for  nutrition  labels  since  the  FDA  began  requiring  them  more  than  20  years  ago.  There  has  been  a  shift  in  shoppers'  priorities  as  nutrition  is  better  understood  and  people  learn  what  they  should  watch  for  on  a  label,  administration  officials  said."You  as  a  parent  and  a  consumer  should  be  able  to  walk  into  your  local  grocery  store,  pick  up  an  item  off  the  shelf,  and  be  able  to  tell  whether  it's  good  for  your  family,"  first  lady  Michelle  Obama  said  in  a  press  release.  "So  this  is  a  big  deal,  and  it's  going  to  make  a  big  difference  for  families  all  across  this  country."The  proposed  labels  would  remove  the  "calories  from  fat"  line  you  currently  see  on  labels,  focusing  instead  on  total  calories  found  in  each  serving.  Nutritionists  have  come  to  understand  that  the  type  of  fat  you're  eating  matters  more  than  the  calories  from  fat.  As  such,  the  breakdown  of  total  fat  vs.  saturated  and  trans  fat  would  remain.Put  down  that  doughnut:  FDA  takes  on  trans  fatThe  proposed  labels  would  also  note  how  much  added  sugar  is  in  a  product.  Right  now,  it's  hard  to  know  what  is  naturally  occurring  sugar  and  what  has  been  added  by  the  manufacturer."Now  when  Americans  pull  a  product  from  the  supermarket  shelf,  they  will  have  a  clear  idea  of  how  much  sugar  that  product  really  contains,"  American  Heart  Association  CEO  Nancy  Brown  said.Chemically,  added  sugar  is  the  same,  but  studies  show  many  Americans  eat  more  sugar  than  they  realize.  The  American  Heart  Association  recommends  you  limit  added  sugar  to  no  more  than  half  your  daily  discretionary  calories.  That  means  for  American  men,  about  150  calories  a  day,  or  nine  teaspoons.  For  women  it's  a  smaller  amount  --  no  more  than  100  calories  per  day  from  added  sugar,  or  about  six  teaspoons  of  sugar.The  FDA  also  plans  to  update  the  daily  values  for  certain  nutrients  such  as  sodium,  dietary  fiber  and  Vitamin  D.  For  instance,  the  daily  limit  for  sodium  was  2,400  milligrams.  If  the  new  rules  take  effect,  the  daily  value  will  be  2,300  milligrams,  administration  officials  said.Food  and  beverage  companies  would  also  be  required  to  declare  the  amount  of  Vitamin  D  and  potassium  in  a  product,  as  well  as  calcium  and  iron.  Research  shows  Americans  tend  not  to  consume  enough  Vitamin  D  for  good  bone  health.  And  potassium  is  essential  in  keeping  your  blood  pressure  in  check.Vegetarian  diet  could  help  lower  your  blood  pressureAdministration  officials  said  about  17%  of  current  serving  size  requirements  will  be  changing,  and  the  FDA  is  adding  25  categories  for  products  that  weren't  commonly  around  20  years  ago  (think  pot  stickers,  sesame  oil  and  sun-dried  tomatoes).Most  of  the  required  serving  sizes  will  be  going  up;  no  one  eats  just  half  a  cup  of  ice  cream,  for  instance.  Others,  like  yogurt,  will  be  going  down."This  will  help  people  better  understand  how  many  calories  they  actually  consume,  especially  if  they  plan  to  eat  all  the  food  in  a  container  or  package,"  Brown  said.While  the  American  Heart  Association  and  advocacy  group  Center  for  Science  in  the  Public  Interest  commended  the  FDA's  changes,  they  noted  that  there  was  more  to  do.Both  organizations  said  the  FDA's  sodium  recommendation  was  still  too  high.  Brown  said  the  association  will  continue  to  recommend  sodium  intake  be  limited  to  1,500  milligrams  a  day.CSPI  said  it  will  also  request  that  the  FDA  include  a  daily  value  of  25  grams  for  added  sugars.  "Thus,  the  Nutrition  Facts  label  for  a  16.9-ounce  bottle  of  soda  would  indicate  that  its  58  grams  of  added  sugars  represents  230  percent  of  the  DV,"  the  group  said  in  an  e-mail.With  this  announcement,  the  FDA  has  opened  a  90-day  comment  period,  during  which  experts  and  members  of  the  public  can  provide  input  on  the  proposed  rules.  The  FDA  will  then  issue  a  final  rule.  Officials  said  they  hope  to  complete  the  process  this  year.Manufacturing  companies  will  then  have  two  years  to  implement  the  changes.Nutrition  labels  have  remained  pretty  much  the  same  for  decades.  It  wasn't  until  the  late  1960s  that  most  food  labels  listed  any  nutrition  information.At  the  time,  labels  with  calorie  or  sodium  counts  were  mainly  used  on  products  the  FDA  considered  to  have  "special  dietary  uses,"  for  people  with  high  blood  pressure  who  were  watching  sodium,  for  instance.Most  people  were  making  meals  at  home  then,  so  there  wasn't  a  huge  demand  for  this  information.  That  changed  as  more  people  started  eating  processed  foods.Noticing  the  trend,  the  White  House  pulled  together  a  conference  of  nutritionists  and  food  manufacturers  in  1969.  Nutrition  labeling  was  voluntary  at  first.  It  wasn't  until  1990  that  the  FDA  required  nutrition  labels  for  most  prepared  and  packaged  foods.  Labels  for  raw  produce  and  fish  remain  voluntary.More  Americans  today  are  interested  in  what's  on  these  nutrition  labels,  research  shows.A  USDA  study  released  last  month  showed  42%  of  working-age  adults  between  29  and  68  looked  at  these  labels  most  or  all  of  the  time  when  shopping.  Some  57%  of  Americans  older  than  68  did  as  well.  That's  up  from  2007,  when  34%  of  working-age  adults  looked  at  the  label,  and  51%  of  Americans  older  than  68  did.The  increase  is  good  news  as  the  United  States  struggles  with  an  obesity  epidemic.  Some  studies  have  shown  that  people  who  read  labels  eat  healthier.  More  than  a  third  of  all  Americans  are  obese,  according  to  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention.Obesity  rates  drop  for  2-  to  5-year  oldsCNN's  Elizabeth  Cohen  and  Saundra  Young  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

He  decried  what  he  called  an  illegitimate  government  that  illegally  seized  power  in  a  coup  with  U.S.  backing,  arguing  that  his  country  has  a  right  to  use  military  force.U.S.  President  Barack  Obama  and  his  country's  top  diplomat  said  Ukraine's  new  government  is  democratically  responding  to  the  people's  will.  They  warned  of  invading  forces  and  a  desperate  Russia  breaking  international  law."President  Putin  seems  to  have  a  different  set  of  lawyers  making  a  different  set  of  interpretations,"  Obama  said,  "but  I  don't  think  that's  fooling  anybody."Putin  blamed  Western  powers,  particularly  the  United  States,  for  causing  what  he  called  "anarchy  and  armed  coup"  in  Ukraine."I  have  a  feeling  people  in  America  sit  in  some  lab  doing  experiments,  like  on  rats,"  he  said,  "without  knowing  consequences."The  conflicting  descriptions  are  enough  to  give  you  whiplash.  Ukraine's  shaky  new  government  is  caught  in  the  middle,  and  it's  clear  that  world  powers  don't  see  eye  to  eye  over  basic  facts  about  what's  happening.READ:  In  phone  call,  Obama  and  Putin  argued  the  factsHere  are  some  of  the  questions  at  play,  with  a  look  at  how  key  players  are  weighing  in:What's  happening  in  Kiev  and  Crimea?Russia's  take:Putin  described  a  country  in  chaos.  "Military  men  are  walking  around  Kiev  in  masks  still  now.  They  wanted  to  humiliate  someone  or  show  their  force,"  he  said.  "I  think  this  is  very  stupid."United  States'  take:The  streets  in  Kiev  are  "calm  and  friendly,"  U.S.  Secretary  of  State  John  Kerry  said,  and  Ukrainian  soldiers  in  Crimea  have  "stood  their  ground  but  never  fired  a  shot,  never  issued  one  provocation,  have  been  surrounded  by  an  invading  group  of  troops."What  we've  seen:In  Crimea,  the  situation  is  calm  but  tense,  CNN's  Ben  Wedeman  and  Clare  Sebastian  report.  Russian  forces  have  surrounded  10  Ukrainian  military  bases.  There's  been  no  fighting  --  or  loss  of  life  --  but  there  are  ample  signs  of  preparation.There's  a  "war  of  information"  in  the  region  "between  those  who  watch  Russian  state  TV  and  those  who  are  getting  their  news  from  the  West,  none  of  them  listening  to  the  calls  from  Kiev  for  unity  in  this  country,"  CNN's  Diana  Magnay  reported.In  Kiev,  there  are  still  barricades  and  battle  scars  from  recent  fighting  before  Viktor  Yanukovych's  ouster,  CNN's  Anderson  Cooper  and  Elise  Labott  reported.  Protesters  there  are  waving  posters  depicting  caricatures  of  Putin  and  declaring  their  willingness  to  fight  against  Russian  forces,  if  necessary.In  Crimea:  'I  feel  unsure  about  what  will  be  tomorrow'Who's  in  charge  of  Ukraine?Russia's  take:Viktor  Yanukovych  remains  Ukraine's  elected  leader,  and  Ukraine's  new  government  is  illegitimate."The  legitimate  president  is  only  Yanukovych,"  Putin  said.  "There  are  just  three  ways  to  dismiss  the  president  from  power:  death,  his  personal  request  and  the  third  one,  impeachment.  ...  This  procedure  was  not  followed."United  States'  take:Yanukovych  abandoned  his  post  last  month,  refused  to  sign  a  transition  deal,  fled  the  country  and  was  then  voted  out  of  office  by  Ukraine's  democratically  elected  parliament."He  broke  his  obligation  to  sign  that  agreement  and  he  fled  into  the  night  with  his  possessions,  destroying  papers  behind  him,"  Kerry  said  in  Kiev  on  Tuesday.  "He  abandoned  his  people  and  eventually  his  country."Ukraine's  take:Ukraine  has  a  legitimate  government  and  is  set  to  have  new  presidential  elections  on  May  25."Let's  give  an  opportunity  for  that  to  work,"  Ukrainian  Ambassador  to  the  U.N.  Yuriy  Sergeyev  said.But  not  everyone  in  the  country  agrees.

He  told  reporters  Tuesday  that  the  surge  in  forces  in  Crimea  were  local  self-defense  groups  pushing  for  the  will  of  the  people  to  be  respected.  Asked  whether  they  were  Russian,  he  said  the  uniforms  the  troops  are  wearing  could  be  purchased  at  a  store.United  States'  take:Kerry  sounded  shocked  by  Putin's  explanation  Tuesday.  Putin,  he  said,  "is  insisting  against  all  evidence  everywhere  in  the  world  about  troops  being  in  Crimea  that  they're  not  there."Russian  forces  "have  complete  operational  control  of  the  Crimean  peninsula,"  a  senior  U.S.  administration  official  told  CNN  on  Sunday,  with  estimates  of  6,000  Russian  ground  and  naval  forces  in  the  regionUkraine's  take:Russia  has  sent  military  ships,  helicopters  and  cargo  planes  to  deploy  16,000  troops  into  Crimea  since  February  24,  Sergeyev  told  the  United  Nations  on  Monday.Does  Russia  have  a  right  to  send  more  military  forces  into  Ukraine?Russia's  take:Yes.  A  treaty  between  the  neighboring  nations  allows  Russia  to  have  up  to  25,000  troops  in  Crimea,  Russia's  U.N.  envoy  said  Monday,  adding  that  Yanukovych  asked  Russia  to  send  military  forces.  Putin  said  Russia  has  no  plans  to  take  over  Crimea."If  I  take  the  decision  to  use  military  force,  it  will  be  completely  legitimate  and  correspond  to  the  international  law,"  Putin  said,  "because  we  have  the  request  of  the  legitimate  president  and  also  (it)  corresponds  to  our  duties  and  corresponds  to  our  interest  in  protecting  the  people  who  are  close  to  us  historically  and  have  connected  culturally."United  States'  take:  No,  and  Putin  is  playing  a  dangerous  game.  Obama  said  Tuesday  that  the  Russian  President  doesn't  have  the  right  to  use  force  to  influence  the  neighboring  country.Russia  "has  chosen  aggression  and  intimidation  as  a  first  resort,"  Kerry  said  Tuesday,  accusing  the  country's  government  of  "hiding  its  hand  behind  falsehoods,  intimidation  and  provocations."Ukraine's  take:No.  Russian  troops  amassing  in  Crimea  and  near  the  border  with  Ukraine  are  an  "act  of  aggression."If  judged  by  the  numbers,  Ukraine's  military  loses  war  with  RussiaWhy  is  the  tense  standoff  unfolding  now?Russia's  take:Parliament  approved  Putin's  use  of  military  force  to  protect  Russian  citizens  inside  Ukraine."This  corresponds  to  our  national  interest  to  protect  these  people,  and  this  is  a  humanitarian  mission.  We  are  not  trying  to  enslave  people,  or  dictate  anything  to  anyone,"  Putin  said.  "Of  course,  we  can't  stay  aside  if  we  see  the  people  persecuted,  bullied  or  killed.  We  very  much  hope  it  will  not  come  to  this."United  States'  take:Putin,  the  administration  believes,  is  threatened  by  challenges  to  his  influence,  especially  popular  uprisings  against  governments  that  are  supportive  of  the  Russian  leader,  a  senior  Obama  administration  official  said  Tuesday."They  are  externally  taking  over  and  trying  to  annex  Crimea,"  Kerry  said.Ukraine's  take:There's  no  evidence  of  any  threat  to  Russians  inside  Ukraine.  Russia  wants  to  annex  Crimea.CNN's  Jim  Acosta  and  Dana  Ford  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

But  that  they  first  saw  the  airport  beacon  and  the  runway  lights  of  M.  Graham  Clark  Downtown  Airport,  located  in  Hollister,  Missouri,  about  seven  miles  away.The  pilots  "mistakenly  identified"  it  as  Branson  Airport,  the  NTSB  said.They  cited  the  bright  runway  lights  at  Clark  Downtown  Airport  and  the  fact  that  the  runway  was  oriented  in  a  similar  direction.They  told  investigators  they  flew  a  visual  approach  into  the  airport  and  did  not  realize  they  were  at  the  wrong  airport  until  they  had  landed.They  confirmed  that  they  utilized  heavy  braking  to  bring  the  aircraft  to  a  stop  and  then  advised  the  Branson  Airport  tower  that  they  had  landed  at  the  wrong  airport.The  NTSB  said  it  has  downloaded  information  from  the  plane's  flight  data  recorder  and  cockpit  voice  recorder  and  are  analyzing  the  data.The  cockpit  voice  recorder  shows  air  traffic  controllers  informed  the  Southwest  crew  that  that  they  were  15  miles  from  their  intended  target,  which  was  Branson  Airport.

Well,  it  left  out  one  tiny  detail,  says  his  son."Missed  the  Woody  Allen  tribute,"  Ronan  Farrow  tweeted,  "did  they  put  the  part  where  a  woman  publicly  confirmed  he  molested  her  at  age  7  before  or  after  Annie  Hall?"That's  a  reference  to  Allen's  adopted  daughter,  Dylan,  who  accused  the  director  of  molesting  her  20  years  ago.So,  why  would  Allen's  own  son  allude  to  the  allegation?It's  part  of  the  messy,  convoluted  story  that  is  Woody  Allen's  personal  life.AccusationsFarrow  is  the  child  Allen  fathered  with  actress  Mia  Farrow.  (Or  is  he?  More  on  that  later)Mia  Farrow  also  adopted  several  other  children  --  Dylan  among  them.After  a  12-year  relationship,  the  couple  split  after  Mia  Farrow  learned  that  Allen  was  having  an  affair  with  Soon-Yi,  a  daughter  Mia  Farrow  adopted  before  she  began  dating  Allen.  (Soon-Yi  is  now  Allen's  wife).The  same  year,  Dylan  said  Allen  inappropriately  touched  her.  (A  court  case  was  later  dropped)."I'm  scared  of  him,  his  image,"  Dylan  --  who  goes  by  another  name  now  --  told  Vanity  Fair  in  October.  "I  have  never  been  asked  to  testify.  If  I  could  talk  to  the  seven-year-old  Dylan,  I  would  tell  her  to  be  brave,  to  testify."Woody  Allen's  lawyer  Elkan  Abramowitz  told  the  magazine  that  Allen  still  denies  the  allegations.Award  showWhich  brings  us  back  to  Sunday  night  where  Allen,  78,  was  honored  with  the  Cecil  B.  DeMille  Award.Right  before  the  segment  aired,  Mia  Farrow  tweeted  she'd  be  switching  the  channel:"Time  to  grab  some  icecream  &  switch  over  to  #GIRLS"But  Ronan  Farrow  went  for  the  jugular  with  his  tweet.  And  his  mom  retweeted  it  --  as  did  many,  many  others.5  things  we  learned  from  the  2014  Golden  GlobesReactionThe  reaction  was  swift  and  mixed.Many  took  Farrow's  side,  including  correspondent  Luke  Russert  (son  of  legendary  journalist  Tim)  who  tweeted  a  link  to  the  Vanity  Fair  article.Others  said  Allen's  personal  life  shouldn't  take  away  from  his  filmmaking  achievements."Sorry  to  hear  @RonanFarrow's  rage,  and  @thelist  which  fuels  it,  but  Woody  is  one  of  the  greatest  film  directors  and  deserved  the  tribute,"  tweeted  Antonio  Vantaggiato.PaternityNow,  on  to  that  bit  about  Ronan  Farrow  maybe,  possibly  not  being  Allen's  son.In  the  Vanity  Fair  interview,  his  mom  calls  Frank  Sinatra  the  great  love  of  her  life  and  said  the  two  "never  really  split  up."Asked  if  her  son  was  Sinatra's,  Mia  Farrow  answered,  "Possibly."Ronan's  response?"Listen,  we're  all  *possibly*  Frank  Sinatra's  son."When  a  parent  really  isn't  yoursRonan  talks  Allen,  Sinatra</TEXT></DOC>

"It's  always  refreshing  to  get  it  straight  from  the  source."Hugh  Forrest,  director  of  SXSW  Interactive,  said  it  took  more  than  three  months  to  secure  Snowden's  participation  and  called  it  an  essential  part  of  this  year's  programming."The  growth  of  social  media  has  fueled  so  much  of  the  growth  of  the  online  ecosystem,  but  the  revelations  from  the  summer  of  2013  expose  the  costs  and  downsides  of  this  growth,"  he  said.Forrest  added  that  Snowden  "wants  to  talk  to  a  tech-focused  audience  about  the  importance  of  building  the  next  generation  of  online  tools  that  protect  user  privacy."Privacy  and  government  surveillance  is  a  subplot  of  SXSW  Interactive's  programming  this  year,  with  other  slated  speakers  to  include  journalist  and  civil  liberties  lawyer  Glenn  Greenwald  as  well  as  WikiLeaks  founder  Julian  Assange.Assange  and  Greenwald  helped  Snowden  disseminate  stolen  NSA  documents,  and  both  will  also  appear  via  teleconference.Greenwald  moved  to  Rio  de  Janeiro,  the  hometown  of  his  domestic  partner,  David  Miranda,  and  Assange  was  granted  diplomatic  asylum  at  the  Ecuadorian  Embassy  in  London  after  Sweden  sought  to  question  him  in  connection  with  a  sexual  assault  investigation.Snowden,  a  former  CIA  employee  and  NSA  contractor  who  fled  the  United  States  after  leaking  details  of  the  American  government's  spy  programs,  was  granted  temporary  asylum  in  Russia  last  year.He  faces  felony  charges  of  espionage  and  theft  of  government  property  in  the  United  States,  and  has  said  he  won't  return  until  the  U.S.  changes  its  whistleblower-protection  laws."Surveillance  and  online  privacy  look  to  be  one  of  the  biggest  topics  of  conversation  at  the  2014  SXSW  Interactive  Festival,"  a  festival  statement  says.

But  it's  also  weirdly  controversial,  writes  CNN's  John  D.  Sutter.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  John  D.  Sutter  is  a  columnist  for  CNN  Opinion  and  head  of  CNN's  Change  the  List  project.  Follow  him  on  Twitter,  Facebook  or  Google+.  E-mail  him  at  ctl@cnn.com.(CNN)  --  I  spent  a  recent  Saturday  morning  at  a  field  house  in  Juneau,  Alaska,  where  girls  with  pink  hair  and  stars  and  rainbows  drawn  on  their  cheeks  run  27  laps  around  a  gymnasium  track.  That  may  not  seem  like  international  news,  but  it  should  be.  Their  race  was  part  of  the  international  "Girls  on  the  Run"  program,  which  is  amazingly  effective  at  empowering  young  women.I  watched  most  of  the  race  from  the  sidelines  with  Andrew,  a  grandpa  wearing  a  driver's  cap,  and  Jennifer,  the  mother  of  one  of  the  young  runners."Good  job!  Keep  going!  Love  you!  You're  awesome!""Remember  to  breathe!"Encouragement  is  the  hallmark  of  the  program,  which  pairs  girls  with  adult  mentors  who  help  train  them  to  run  a  5K  --  and,  more  importantly,  talk  to  them  about  what  it  means  to  be  women  in  modern  America.  "You  have  to  set  a  goal  to  become  a  powerful  girl  on  the  run,"  Ati  Nasiah,  the  local  organizer,  with  a  feather  stuck  in  her  hair,  told  the  girls  before  the  race.  "Each  of  us  is  unique,  and  that  is  what  makes  us  so  powerful.  With  every  heartbeat  and  every  breath,  we  are  changing  the  world."These  girls  are  changing  the  world  and  Alaska,  the  state  FBI  crime  estimates  rank  as  having  the  highest  rate  of  reported  rape  in  the  country.  Teaching  young  women  that  they  can  be  whoever  and  whatever  they  want  to  be  is  an  important  part  of  preventing  rape  and  abuse.  I  visited  Alaska  in  December  because  you  voted  for  me  to  cover  rape  in  the  United  States  as  part  of  CNN's  Change  the  List  project,  which  focuses  on  bottom-of-the-list  places  like  Alaska.Jennifer,  the  mom  I  watched  the  race  with,  and  whose  last  name  I'm  not  using  to  protect  her  privacy,  was  a  victim  of  domestic  violence.  Her  husband  beat  her,  she  told  me,  and  she  got  together  with  him  when  she  was  13  and  he  22.  One  reason  Jennifer  brought  her  daughter  to  Girls  on  the  Run,  with  the  help  of  a  scholarship  and  free  sneakers,  is  that  she  doesn't  want  her  daughter  to  accept  violence  against  women.  "Instead  of  me  just  sitting  back  and  taking  it,  (my  kids)  see  me  standing  up,"  she  said.  "And  that's  what  they  need.  Otherwise,  they  will  grow  up  and  think  it's  OK."That's  hugely  important.  But  the  largely  unspoken  reality  also  remains:  Victims  aren't  to  blame  for  rape  and  domestic  violence;  offenders  are.  So,  while  they  are  essential,  programs  like  Girls  on  the  Run  aren't  enough  to  end  what  Alaska's  governor  has  termed  its  "epidemic"  of  rape  and  violence  against  women.To  stop  the  violence,  men  have  to  stop  raping  and  battering.That  seems  like  common  sense.  But  it's  still  controversial.For  evidence,  look  no  further  than  Zerlina  Maxwell,  an  attorney  and  rape  survivor  who  went  on  Fox  News  last  year  to  make  that  very  point.  Other  pundits  argued  that  women  should  carry  weapons  to  protect  themselves.  No,  Maxwell  said.  Men  should  stop  raping,  and  that  would  solve  it.  For  those  remarks,  she  received  death  threats.  On  Twitter,  one  person  wrote,  according  to  a  news  report,  "I  hope  you  get  raped  and  your  throat  slit."This  same  pro-gun  sentiment  came  up  in  the  comments  sections  of  other  Change  the  List  stories  published  earlier  this  month  about  rape  in  Alaska.  "Time  to  arm  and  train  the  women  to  defend  themselves,"  one  person  wrote  on  my  op-ed  about  a  lawless  village  at  the  far  edge  of  the  state,  where  troopers  fly  in  by  plane.  That's  wrong-headed.  Instead  of  putting  the  burden  on  women  to  defend  themselves,  the  state  should  continue  to  expand  its  Village  Public  Safety  Officer  program.  I  hope  it  soon  will  include  that  village."What  we  have  been  doing  for  the  past  100  years  hasn't  been  working,"  Maxwell  told  me  by  phone  from  New  York.  "Focusing  on  women's  behavior  isn't  working."Andrew,  the  adoptive  grandpa  who  I  spoke  with  during  the  race  in  Juneau,  gets  it,  too.  "They  need  a  program  for  boys,  that's  for  sure,"  he  told  me.  "They've  got  this  program  to  rebuild  the  confidence  and  self  esteem  in  the  girls,  and  keep  them  going.  But  where  is  the  support  structure  to  stop  it  in  the  boys?  You  know,  break  the  cycle."Alaska  has  more  of  a  jump-start  on  that  than  some  states.  It  was  encouraging  to  see  members  of  a  local  men's  high  school  basketball  team  acting  as  cheerleaders  for  the  Girls  on  the  Run  event.  Those  players,  from  Juneau's  Thunder  Mountain  High  School,  are  participating  in  a  program  called  Coaching  Boys  into  Men.  It's  designed  to  teach  young  men  about  safe  relationships  and  respect  for  women.  Gov.  Sean  Parnell,  a  Republican,  has  requested  $12.4  million  to  fund  his  "Choose  Respect"  initiative,  which  also  is  aimed  at  preventing  violence  and  helping  survivors.That's  progress.  But  such  programs  should  be  expanded.We  have  to  keep  encouraging  girls,  but  always  remember  offenders  are  to  blame.Some  of  that  should  happen  through  formal  training  and  programs.  It's  also  on  all  of  us  to  call  out  inappropriate  behavior  when  we  see  it.The  family  I  sat  with  as  we  watched  the  girls  sprint  by  understood  this.

"It  appears  your  doing  well  in  the  program,"  he  told  Brown."There's  no  reason  to  put  him  into  custody  at  this  point,"  Brown  attorney  Mark  Geragos  said  after  the  hearing.  "We're  happy  that  the  judge  agreed  with  us."Brown  is  expected  to  complete  the  rehab  program  on  February  19,  but  he  has  to  travel  to  Washington  for  a  hearing  on  the  assault  charge  on  February  20.  That  case  could  still  send  Brown  to  jail  in  Los  Angeles  if  he  is  found  guilty.The  probation  imposed  when  he  pleaded  guilty  to  a  felony  charge  in  the  2009  attack  on  Rihanna  requires  that  he  stay  out  of  legal  trouble.  The  judge  will  hold  another  hearing  on  February  28  to  decide  his  fate  after  rehab.The  latest  probation  report  praises  Brown's  new  improved  attitude  in  complying  with  probation  rules.  "He  appears  to  have  a  more  serious  and  responsible  demeanor  and  is  responding  well  to  dual  diagnosis  treatment  program  and  changes  in  medication,"  his  probation  officer  wrote.Brown  is  working  on  a  community  labor  crew  three  days  a  week  until  he  completes  1,000  of  work  ordered  by  the  judge  in  November.  He's  finished  109  hours  and  still  has  809  hours  left  before  his  probation  can  be  completed,  the  probation  officer  said.  At  that  pace,  Brown  has  another  101  days  of  work  left.The  glowing  report  is  a  stark  contrast  to  what  the  probation  officer  wrote  in  November  after  Brown  was  booted  from  another  rehab  facility  after  smashing  his  mother's  car  window  during  a  family  session."There  is  much  concern  with  the  probationer's  new  arrest  and  his  violent  outburst  that  resulted  in  his  discharge  from  a  treatment  facility,"  that  probation  report  said.Brown  and  his  bodyguard,  Christopher  Hollosy,  face  assault  charges  stemming  an  incident  outside  the  a  hotel  near  the  White  House  in  October.  The  federal  prosecutor  handling  the  case  offered  to  let  them  each  plead  guilty  to  one  count  of  simple  assault,  but  they  rejected  the  offers  at  court  last  month.Chris  Brown  rejects  plea  deal  in  D.C.  court</TEXT></DOC>

Wallace  told  John  Peter  Smith  Hospital  to  act  on  his  order  by  5  p.m.  Monday.Munoz  and  other  family  members  had  been  fighting  to  have  the  body  released  for  burial.  Hospital  officials  resisted,  saying  they  were  trying  to  obey  a  Texas  law  that  says  "you  cannot  withhold  or  withdraw  life-sustaining  treatment  for  a  pregnant  patient,"  in  the  words  of  the  hospital  spokesman.Munoz  left  the  courthouse  without  talking  to  reporters,  but  the  family's  lawyers  spoke  out.  Jessica  Janicek  argued  that  the  hospital  was  "utilizing  (Marlise  Munoz's)  body  as  a  science  experiment."A  breakthrough  came  when  the  hospital  and  the  Munoz  family  agreed  on  crucial  facts  listed  in  a  court  document:  that  Marlise  Munoz,  33,  has  "met  the  clinical  criteria  for  brain  death  since  November  28"  and  that  "the  fetus  gestating  inside  Mrs.  Munoz  is  not  viable."The  woman's  husband  repeatedly  made  these  claims  in  his  efforts  to  have  her  removed  from  the  machines.Mom  of  pregnant  woman:  Change  the  lawThe  story  may  have  more  chapters.  The  hospital  could  appeal  or  decide  to  remove  Marlise  Munoz  from  a  ventilator  and  respirator  before  that  deadline.  The  judge  did  not  rule  on  the  constitutionality  of  a  state  law  regarding  the  treatment  of  a  pregnant  patient.Erick  and  Marlise  Munoz,  two  trained  paramedics,  had  been  awaiting  the  arrival  of  their  second  child  when  she  was  found  unconscious  on  her  kitchen  floor  around  2  a.m.  November  26.  She  was  rushed  to  the  north-central  Texas  hospital.Once  there,  Erick  Munoz  said,  he  was  told  his  wife  "was  for  all  purposes  brain  dead."  The  family  also  says  the  fetus  may  have  been  deprived  of  oxygen.  Erick  Munoz  had  contended  doctors  told  him  his  wife  "had  lost  all  activity  in  her  brain  stem"  and  an  accompanying  chart  stated  that  she  was  "brain  dead."Husband  said  wife  didn't  want  to  be  on  ventilatorDuring  Friday's  hearing  in  Fort  Worth,  representatives  of  the  hospital  --  in  this  case,  from  the  Tarrant  County  District  Attorney's  office  --  argued  that  state  law  was  correctly  applied.Erik  Munoz  and  other  family  members  said  the  hospital  should  abide  by  her  wishes  --  which  weren't  written  down  but,  they  said,  relayed  verbally  to  them  --  and  not  have  machines  keep  her  organs  and  blood  running.In  an  affidavit  filed  Thursday  in  court,  Erick  Munoz  said  little  to  him  now  is  recognizable  about  Marlise.  Her  bones  crack  when  her  stiff  limbs  move.  Her  usual  scent  has  been  replaced  by  the  "smell  of  death."  And  her  once  lively  eyes  have  become  "soulless."After  the  Friday  hearing,  another  family  lawyer,  Jessica  King,  said,  "Pregnant  women  die  every  day.  They  die  in  car  accidents,  of  heart  attacks  and  other  injuries.  And  when  they  die,  their  fetus  dies  with  them."It's  the  way  it's  always  been  and  the  way  it  should  be."Lawyers:  Records  back  claim  that  woman  is  brain  deadIn  his  lawsuit,  Munoz  claims  subsequent  measures  taken  at  the  hospital  --  and,  in  turn,  the  state  law  used  to  justify  them  --  amounted  "to  nothing  more  than  the  cruel  and  obscene  mutilation  of  a  deceased  body  against  the  expressed  will  of  the  deceased  and  her  family."The  hospital  and  the  Tarrant  County  District  Attorney's  Office,  which  defended  the  medical  facility,  did  not  offer  the  same  level  of  detail  as  members  of  the  Munoz  family.But  earlier  this  month,  hospital  spokesman  J.R.  Labbe  told  CNN  that  his  hospital  believed  "the  courts  are  the  appropriate  venue  to  provide  clarity,  direction  and  resolution  in  this  matter."Late  Friday,  the  hospital  issued  this  statement:  "JPS  Health  Network  appreciates  the  potential  impact  of  the  consequences  of  the  order  on  all  parties  involved  and  will  be  consulting  with  the  Tarrant  County  District  Attorney's  office."When  life  support  is  really  'death  support'CNN's  Ed  Lavandera  and  Josh  Rubin  reported  from  Fort  Worth.

And  if  you  do  even  less  than  nothing,  at  what  point  does  it  become  completely  counterproductive  and  silly?We've  reached  it.Have  you  noticed  lately  that  real  ideas  are  out  of  vogue?  A  serious  GOP  committee  chairman  makes  a  big  —  and,  yes,  controversial  --  proposal  to  reform  the  tax  code.  Here's  how  his  ultimate  leader,  House  Speaker  John  Boehner,  reacts  when  asked  about  parts  of  the  plan:  "Blah,  blah,  blah  blah."  No  kidding.The  President,  who  once  endorsed  an  idea  to  change  the  way  Social  Security  benefits  are  calculated  as  a  way  to  curb  its  growth,  has  now  said  "Never  mind."  It  won't  be  in  his  budget,  for  fear  that  his  liberal  base  would  desert  him  over  it.Republicans,  who  started  the  year  saying  that  immigration  reform  should  be  on  the  agenda,  are  now  saying,  as  the  speaker  put  it,  the  President  can't  be  "trusted"  to  implement  any  serious  measure.  And  Democrats  say  the  President  can't  be  trusted  to  do  a  trade  agreement  without  angering  the  important  constituency  of  organized  labor,  so  bye-bye  "fast  track"  trade  bill.Bill  to  help  veterans  failsTruth  is,  it  isn't  about  trust  at  all.  It's  about  winning  in  2014.  And  an  important  part  of  winning,  it  seems,  is  to  paper  over  all  dissent  within  your  own  party  in  order  to  present  a  united  front  to  the  voters.So  the  election  will  be  this:  Us  or  them?  Obamacare  or  no  Obamacare?  Do  you  like  me  better?  Do  you  like  government?  Do  you  like  poor  people  or  rich  people?That's  our  debate  --  the  sum  total  of  our  big  ideas  right  now.  Not  wanting  to  start  any  fights  within  your  own  party.  Unity  above  all  heading  into  the  midterm  elections.So  maybe  Congress  should  just  close  up  shop  and  leave  town  because  nothing  is  going  to  happen  for  the  next  nine  months.  Just  turn  off  the  lights.  Both  parties  are  making  the  same  political  calculation  for  the  same  reason:  They  can't  afford  to  have  any  internal  debate  lest  they  seem  less  than  united  against  the  enemy.  Turns  out  that  the  permanent  campaign  is  still  alive  and  well.Here's  the  glitch  in  this  narrative:  Voters,  it  turns  out,  actually  want  some  solutions  to  problems.  They  want  to  see  the  deficit  go  down;  they  want  to  find  a  way  to  fix  immigration.  A  majority  (63%)  is  worried  the  country  is  on  the  wrong  track.  And,  according  to  a  new  CBS/New  York  Times  poll,  eight  in  10  Americans  are  fed  up  with  Washington.Somehow,  voters  haven't  gotten  the  message  that  Congress  --  in  its  steadfast  intent  to  accomplish  nothing  --  is  just  trying  to  appeal  to  them.But  remember  what  happened  to  Mitt  Romney's  campaign.  Romney  lost  for  lots  of  reasons,  but  one  of  them  was  sticking  too  long  to  the  assumption  that  if  people  were  unhappy  with  the  direction  of  the  country  and  the  other  guy,  that  would  be  enough  to  win.  It  wasn't.  The  candidate  mattered.  And  ideas  mattered,  too.The  "big"  GOP  idea  this  time  is  to  bash  Obamacare,  relentlessly,  endlessly,  in  a  continual  loop.  Sure,  it's  unpopular,  but  what  about  if  it  starts  working  for  people?  What  if  people  are  sick  of  hearing  about  it  now  that  the  website  is  working?  And  what  if  people  are  more  inclined  to  mend  it  than  end  it?If  Obamacare  is  the  only  trick  in  the  bag,  it  might  not  be  enough.Then  there's  the  Democrats'  income  inequality  refrain.  It's  not  new,  it  can  work,  and  sure,  it  unites  the  Democrats.  But  by  taking  almost  everything  of  substance  off  the  table,  it's  the  President's  legacy  and  record  of  achievement  that  gets  compromised,  along  with  the  voters.The  truth  is  this:  It's  a  tight  political  fight.  Polls  right  now  show  that  the  public,  by  a  small  42%-39%  margin,  would  back  Republicans  for  office  in  the  2014  midterm  elections.  They're  not  thrilled  with  the  President's  job  performance.  They  have  soured  on  the  President  personally,  and  they  can  barely  stomach  the  Congress.So  what's  the  political  solution?  No  substance,  no  ideas,  no  serious  debate  that  might  actually  engage  voters.  Each  side  suits  up,  armed  with  its  slogans  and  its  bromides.And  we  inevitably  re-elect  the  Congress  we  hate.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Gloria  Borger.</TEXT></DOC>

On  the  other  hand,  Matthew  McConaughey?  And  "Brooklyn  Nine-Nine"?Though  McConaughey  has  gotten  terrific  reviews  for  his  performance  in  "Dallas  Buyers  Club,"  he  was  seen  as  a  dark  horse  behind  Chiwetel  Ejiofor  ("12  Years")  and  Robert  Redford  ("All  is  Lost"),  not  to  mention  perennial  favorite  Tom  Hanks  ("Captain  Phillips").  But  the  Texas-born  actor,  who  has  given  his  acting  career  new  life  with  such  films  as  "Magic  Mike,"  "Mud"  and  a  small  but  pivotal  performance  in  "The  Wolf  of  Wall  Street,"  has  put  himself  in  the  forefront  of  the  best  actor  conversation.

"No  further  information  is  available  at  this  time,  ticket  holders  are  asked  to  hold  on  to  their  tickets  until  a  further  update  is  available."Scott  had  been  dating  Jagger,  70,  since  at  least  2003,  and  the  rocker  was  often  a  fixture  at  his  girlfriend's  fashion  shows.MickJagger.com,  the  singer's  official  website,  posted  the  following  statement  Tuesday:  "I  am  still  struggling  to  understand  how  my  lover  and  best  friend  could  end  her  life  in  this  tragic  way.  We  spent  many  wonderful  years  together  and  had  made  a  great  life  for  ourselves.  She  had  great  presence  and  her  talent  was  much  admired,  not  least  by  me.  I  have  been  touched  by  the  tributes  that  people  have  paid  to  her,  and  also  the  personal  messages  of  support  that  I  have  received.  I  will  never  forget  her."The  same  statement  was  also  posted  on  Jagger's  Facebook  page  where  fans  left  messages  of  encouragement  for  the  singer,  including,  "My  deepest  condolances  mick,  there  are  no  answers  for  these  kind  of  situations"  and  "peace,  mate."A  representative  for  the  New  York  Police  Department  said  the  New  York  medical  examiner  will  determine  the  cause  of  death  as  the  investigation  continues  into  what  led  up  to  it.  CNNMoney  reports  the  designer's  business  was  facing  mounting  losses  and  debts.CNNMoney:  L'Wren  Scott's  business  was  in  troubleThe  fashion  industry  registered  shock  at  the  death  of  the  famed  designer  whose  fashions  graced  such  luminaries  as  first  lady  Michelle  Obama,  Madonna  and  Oprah  Winfrey.  Scott  was  beloved  for  her  designs  as  well  as  her  personal  fashion  that  she  honed  as  a  model  for  designer  Thierry  Mugler  in  the  1980s  before  she  began  a  steady  climb,  first  as  a  stylist,  and  later  with  her  own  label."She  was  so  tall  and  so  glamorous,  so  unlike  anyone  else  you'd  ever  seen,"  Amy  Larocca  of  New  York  magazine  wrote.  "She  was  easy  in  her  six-foot-three  skin  as  she'd  sit  down  to  watch  the  models  parade  their  narrow  pencil  skirts,  their  snug  little  cardigans,  and  their  general  air  of  film-noir  fantasy  up  and  down  the  runway."In  a  reflection  of  Scott  and  her  early  career  in  The  New  York  Times,  fashion  writer  Suzy  Menkes  noted,  "As  a  much  lauded  but  discreet  stylist,  she  became  a  power  behind  the  Hollywood  thrones."Menkes  added,  "The  discretion  that  the  designer  showed  in  her  work  was  mirrored  by  her  attitude  as  a  partner  to  a  rock  icon.  Her  clothes  suggested  a  strong  and  feisty  woman,  yet  she  remained  a  very  private  person."Scott  was  once  quoted  as  saying,  "I'm  a  fashion  designer.  I  don't  want  to  be  defined  as  someone's  girlfriend,"  and  following  her  death  several  observers  took  exception  with  the  media  focus  on  her  relationship  with  Jagger.Fashion  writer  Nico  Bellay  tweeted,  "My  thoughts  are  with  Mick,  but  her  name  is  L'Wren  Scott,  not  'Mick  Jagger's  Girlfriend."Another  admirer  of  Scott's  work,  Johanna  Fuentes,  tweeted,  "L'Wren  Scott  was  a  renowned  designer,  successful  model  and  stylist.  Can  we  not  reduce  her  to  being  called  Mick  Jagger's  girlfriend?"There  was  also  buzz  surrounding  the  timing  of  a  reported  picture  on  Scott's  Facebook  page.  The  New  York  Post  reported  that  following  her  death  a  pre-written  post  with  a  picture  showing  several  dresses  hanging  from  trees  appeared  on  the  designer's  Facebook  page  and  tweets  were  sent  from  her  Twitter  account,  causing  some  to  question  if  news  of  her  death  was  a  hoax.  The  social  media  accounts  have  since  been  deleted.</TEXT></DOC>

Chat  directly  with  Kat  about  your  experiences  with  anxiety  on  Wednesday  at  11  a.m.  ET  in  the  comments  section  below.(CNN)  --  "The  blues  are  because  you're  getting  fat  or  maybe  it's  been  raining  too  long.  You're  sad,  that's  all.  But  the  mean  reds  are  horrible.  You're  afraid  and  you  sweat  like  hell,  but  you  don't  know  what  you're  afraid  of.  Except  something  bad  is  going  to  happen,  only  you  don't  know  what  it  is.  ...  What  I've  found  does  the  most  good  is  just  to  get  into  a  taxi  and  go  to  Tiffany's.  It  calms  me  down  right  away,  the  quietness  and  the  proud  look  of  it;  nothing  very  bad  could  happen  to  you  there."  --  "Breakfast  at  Tiffany's"  by  Truman  CapoteI  am  hunched  in  half  on  a  blue  chair  on  the  third  floor  of  the  Tiffany  &  Co.  flagship  store,  willing  myself  to  calm  down  or  simply  disappear.  At  this  moment,  the  latter  seems  a  more  likely  possibility,  but  even  so,  it's  not  working.  A  neatly  suited  young  woman  is  dispatched  to  assess  the  state  of  my  well-being,  because  so  far  as  I  can  tell,  most  other  ladies  are  pretty  jazzed  to  be  in  the  temple  of  sparkle  and  promise.I,  on  the  other  hand,  am  a  quivering  storm  cloud,  desperately  trying  to  contain  the  shocks  and  sog  of  my  current  upset  so  they  don't  stain  anyone  else's  happy  pre-holiday  afternoon.  She  approaches,  kind-eyed  and  discreet,  "Soooo,  how  are  you  doing  today,  Miss?"Panicked,  I  start  to  babble.  "Finefinefine.  I'm  fine.  My  husband  is  somewhere  around  here  buying  a  present  for  his  mom  and  his  aunt  and  I'm  just  --  there  are  so  many  people  out  today.  So  many  people.  It  took  30  minutes  to  walk  just  a  couple  blocks  and  I'm  --  so  many  people.  I'm  just  here  --  hiding.  Until  he's  done.  See,  there  he  is."My  husband  materializes  with  a  white-stringed  bag  in  his  hand  and  nods  at  the  woman.  She's  relieved.  I'm  mortified  --  that  my  seams  showed,  that  someone  saw  them,  that  my  husband  is  stuck  with  a  wife  so  pathetic  that  she  can't  even  manage  a  couple  of  hours  of  Christmas  shopping  without  falling  apart.Twitching  and  sick  to  my  stomach,  I  eventually  make  it  home  and  cower  under  the  covers  in  our  dark  bedroom  until  early  evening.  Despite  my  best  attempts  at  slow,  deep  breaths  and  all  the  rest  of  the  therapeutic  tricks  I've  been  taught,  I'm  unable  to  slow  my  firecracker  pulse  or  the  explosion  of  toxic  thoughts  rotting  me  from  brain  to  skin."You're  so  useless.  You  let  down  the  people  you  love.  Everyone  who's  been  stupid  enough  to  love  you  will  regret  it  when  they  realize  how  weak  you  are."  It  goes  on  and  on  until  my  body  just  shuts  down  for  a  couple  of  hours.  Then  I  wake  up  in  near-screaming  horror,  and  it  all  starts  up  again.My  son  is  mentally  ill,  so  listen  upThis  happened  just  three  weeks  ago.  Anxiety  and  panic  have  been  my  constant  companions  for  as  far  back  as  my  memory  reaches.  The  outlines  of  most  of  the  milestones  --  birthdays,  graduations,  awards  --  are  etched  in  acid  relief  on  the  walls  of  my  gut  while  my  mind  tries  to  fill  in  the  blanks  with  any  color  and  joy  I  can  muster.  Even  the  mundanities  of  daily  life  are  riddled  with  the  shrapnel  of  the  attack.Empirically,  I  recall  the  verdant,  sheep-dotted  hills,  azure  lakes,  storybook  castles  and  mighty  crags  of  Snowdonia,  Wales,  as  seen  from  an  open  car,  driven  by  the  handsome  man  who  had  become  my  husband  just  days  before.  In  theory,  bliss.  In  reality,  a  steady  series  of  flinches,  gasps  and  stomach  aches  as  we  wound  through  hairpin  turns  on  single-lane,  left-hand-drive  roadways,  while  I  obsessed  about  the  money  we'd  just  spent  on  the  wedding  and  if  I'd  paid  enough  attention  to  each  guest  at  the  reception.After  a  grueling  stint  in  grad  school,  I  stood  in  line  to  receive  my  master's  degree  and  was  convinced  that  a  siren  in  the  distance  meant  I'd  left  on  the  iron  I'd  used  to  press  my  gown,  and  that  my  house  was  burning  down  as  a  result  of  my  carelessness.  In  third  grade,  I  hunched  in  a  ball  at  the  edge  of  the  asphalt,  clawing  at  a  scab  while  the  other  kids  whooped  and  ran.  I'd  messed  up  a  test  question  I  should  have  gotten  right,  and  my  favorite  teacher  was  going  to  know  she  was  wrong  for  thinking  I  was  smart.Anxiety  hurts.  It's  the  precise  inverse  of  joy  and  blots  out  pleasure  at  its  whim,  leaving  a  dull,  faded  outline  of  the  happiness  that  was  supposed  to  happen.  It's  also  as  sneaky  as  hell.Going  public  with  depressionIf  depression  is,  as  Winston  Churchill  famously  described,  a  "black  dog"  that  follows  the  sufferer  around,  anxiety  is  a  feral  cat  that  springs  from  nowhere,  sinks  its  claws  into  skin  and  hisses  invective  until  nothing  else  exists.For  me,  there  is  neither  rhyme  nor  reason  as  to  when  it  will  strike.  I  can  board  a  plane  to  vacation  solo  in  a  strange  city,  hold  forth  on  live  TV  at  a  moment's  notice  or  speak  onstage  in  front  of  a  crowd  of  hundreds  without  many  mussed  feathers.  The  notion  of  leaving  the  house  to  get  half-and-half  for  coffee  flings  me  dead  into  the  eye  of  a  panic  attack.The  store  is  a  30-second  walk  from  my  front  door  and  some  days,  I  just  can't  make  it  there.  The  thought  of  leaving  the  cocoon  of  my  apartment  --  my  bedroom,  even  --  just  crushes  my  lungs  and  tightens  my  skin  until  it's  hot  to  the  touch.  My  hands  bobble  the  outline  of  the  lipstick  I  try  to  apply  so  I  can  masquerade  as  a  functioning  human  person,  and  I  have  to  wipe  it  off  and  start  again.  And  maybe  again.  And  then  my  dress  needs  ironing.  And  the  dogs  need  water.  And  I  should  answer  another  work  e-mail.  Anything  to  keep  me  from  having  to  walk  to  the  door,  open  it  and  face  the  world.  The  coffee  will  have  to  be  black  that  day.Do  you  have  a  personal  essay  to  share?  Post  it  on  CNN  iReportWhat  am  I  afraid  will  happen?  There's  no  easy  answer  to  that.  Anxiety  is  not  easily  explicable  or  rational  --  at  least  not  to  those  who  don't  suffer  from  it  --  and  that  only  compounds  the  problem.  If  it  were  something  concrete  --  a  fear  of  clowns,  birds,  cheese  or  the  music  of  Michael  Bublé  --  there  would  no  doubt  be  a  definitive  course  of  attack  involving  immersion  therapy  and  a  really  weird  party.But  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder  (300.02  in  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  and  the  single  most  common  mental  health  diagnosis)  is  more  nebulous  than  that.  It's  free-floating  fear  that  metastasizes  until  it's  all-consuming  and  often  debilitating.  For  me,  it's  physically  painful,  from  stomach,  head  and  muscle  aches  to  exhaustion  from  chronic  insomnia  to  raw  thumb  skin  that  I've  picked  at  until  it  bled  --  and  kept  picking  some  more.National  Depression  Screening  Day:  Sharing  experiences  can  helpIt's  deeply  alienating  to  friends  who  assume  that  I  didn't  come  to  their  party,  show  up  at  their  event  or  call  to  explain  because  I  didn't  care  enough  or  didn't  love  them  anymore.  It's  perhaps  even  more  humiliating  to  explain  that  I  was  too  terrified  to  leave  my  house  and  interact  with  people  in  person  where  they  could  see  what  a  drab,  value-free  mess  of  a  person  I  am  and  that  they'd  made  a  mistake  for  ever  liking  me  in  the  first  place.It's  senseless  and  hurtful  to  people  I  love,  and  that  more  than  anything  is  why  I've  been  trying  to  get  better.  That's  its  own  litter  of  rabid  kittens.Anti-anxiety  medications  work  beautifully  for  millions  of  people.  The  withdrawal  from  a  particularly  wicked  one  nearly  ended  me,  and  the  brain  zaps  (those  are  sharp,  horrifying  electrical  currents  you  can  physically  feel  inside  your  head)  and  metabolic  sluggishness  increasingly  outweighed  any  benefits  while  I  was  on  it.  Perhaps  I  will  change  my  mind  someday,  but  for  now  that's  not  an  option.The  gym  can  be  useful,  but  it's  on  the  other  side  of  that  damned  door.  So  are  the  much-vaunted  yoga  and  meditation  classes  that  inevitably  make  me  feel  as  if  I've  failed  for  being  insufficiently  zen  and  relaxed.Behavioral  therapy  has  perhaps  been  my  most  effective  weapon,  but  when  panic  bolts  down  and  pins  me,  shivering  to  my  bed  in  the  wee,  small  hours,  it's  hard  to  summon  semi-steady  breath,  let  alone  any  mantras  or  creative  visualizations.Anxiety,  you're  not  the  boss  of  meI  also  suddenly  and  quite  unexpectedly  lost  the  man  who  taught  me  most  of  my  coping  techniques.  Last  spring,  my  therapist  of  nearly  a  decade  and  a  half  had  a  medical  emergency  and  his  practice  abruptly  ended.  I  missed  him  fiercely  and  held  out  hope  for  months  --  both  for  his  well-being  and  for  our  continued  work  together.  It  was  not  to  be,  and  I  spiraled  for  a  while,  allowing  the  terror  to  swallow  me,  along  with  any  scrap  of  happiness  that  might  have  come  fluttering  my  way.But  in  2014,  I  am  resolved,  if  not  to  tame  this  yowling  beast,  then  at  least  to  clip  its  claws.  I'm  sick  to  death  of  feeling  ashamed  for  this  illness,  am  just  plain  worn  out  from  the  physical  fight  and  angry  that  I've  let  it  thieve  so  much  life  and  time  with  my  loved  ones.  I've  got  a  new  therapist  who  is  teaching  me  to  wrangle  upset  where  it  arises,  and  not  damning  myself  when  I  fail  to  do  so.I'm  trying  to  let  myself  enjoy  small  pleasures,  rather  than  brace  myself  for  when  they  might  be  taken  away.  I'm  also  doing  what  I  can  to  increase  the  frequency  of  their  occurrence,  and  encouraging  other  people  to  do  the  same,  with  a  public  Tumblr  --  joyisthenewfancy.tumblr.com  --  where  I  hold  myself  accountable  for  one  joyful  or  "fancy"  thing  a  day  and  tackle  the  issue  of  anxiety  in  a  public  way.  It's  silly,  but  it's  working,  and  even  just  in  the  few  days  it's  been  up,  dozens  of  people  have  reached  out  to  offer  encouragement,  and  share  their  personal  experiences  with  the  condition.If  fear  begets  more  fear,  then  I'm  willing  myself  to  believe  that  joy  begets  more  joy  --  or  at  least  a  measure  of  calm.  This  year,  I  will  find  my  way  to  Tiffany's.Resources:Suicide  Prevention  Lifeline:  1-800-273-TALK  (8255)Substance  Abuse  and  Mental  Health  Services  AdministrationHelp  yourself.

For  instance,  when  her  15-year-old  son  Shawn  comes  to  the  kitchen  for  a  snack,  that  might  be  the  exact  moment  she  asks  him,  "You  ever  have  sex?"  out  of  the  blue."It's  really  weird,"  the  high  school  freshman  and  basketball  star  said  during  a  conversation  at  his  family's  home,  although  he  admitted  he  doesn't  feel  as  uncomfortable  after  the  fact.READ:  SOS  for  stressed  out  teensAs  a  former  teenage  mom  who  grew  up  in  a  household  where  sex  was  never  discussed,  Jay  makes  sure  her  children  know  she  is  open  to  talking  about  sex  as  well  as  drugs,  alcohol,  bullying  --  you  name  it  --  and  that  she  tries  to  keep  it  "light"  whenever  she  can."We're  joking,  but  then  sometimes  I've  found  that  conversation  becomes  serious  later  where  they  come  back  and  say,  'Well,  hey,  this  happened  or  this  occurred  and  I  want  to  talk  about  it,'"  said  Jay,  a  vice  president  of  customer  operations  for  a  mobile  health  services  company  and  the  founder  of  her  own  company  focusing  on  empowering  women  and  businesses.'My  parents,  they've  got  it  going  on'Vicki  Hoefle,  author  of  the  book  "Duct  Tape  Parenting,"  said  when  parents  show  they  aren't  afraid  to  tackle  any  subject  --  and  are  willing  to  showcase  their  own  vulnerabilities,  teenagers  take  notice."I  think  a  fearlessness,  a  fierceness  to  attack  all  those  scary  conversations  with  the  kind  of  zest  that  you  see  in  teens  makes  teens  look  at  their  parents  like,  'Oh  my  god.  My  parents,  they've  got  it  going  on,'"  said  Hoefle,  a  mom  of  five  who  has  spent  the  past  two  decades  working  with  families  on  parenting.READ:  Social  media  positive  for  teens?  Maybe!Tracey  Koch,  a  mom  of  two,  ages  10  and  14,  and  a  nurse  practitioner  who  works  with  teens,  said  she  finds  being  candid  with  her  patients  and  her  own  children  about  the  mistakes  we  all  make  leads  to  more  trust."I  find  that  once  you  confess  to  also  being  imperfect,  it  levels  the  playing  field  and  teens  may  feel  it's  safe  to  open  up,"  said  Koch  of  Lewiston,  Idaho,  in  a  response  to  a  request  for  comment  on  CNN's  Facebook  page.  "I  tell  my  children  that  this  is  my  first  experience  at  raising  children  and  parenting  and  I  am  bound  to  make  mistakes."The  mistakes  parents  makeOne  of  the  biggest  mistakes  parents  make  is  not  being  honest  with  themselves  about  how  strongly  they  already  feel  about  topics  such  as  teens  engaging  in  sex,  driving,  and  using  drugs  and  alcohol,  said  Hoefle.If  your  teen  thinks,  "I  already  know  what  my  mom  will  say  about  this,  so  I'm  not  even  going  to  talk  to  her,"  you  can  forget  about  your  teen  opening  up  to  you,  she  said.Delia  Perez,  a  mom  of  two  boys  ages  9  and  13,  said  she  sometimes  has  to  hold  her  breath."When  we  talk,  I  sometimes  have  to  put  on  my  poker  face  because  the  overprotective  mother  wants  to  emerge  and  scream  'What  the  hell?'"  said  Perez,  also  in  response  to  our  query  on  Facebook.  "My  husband  and  I  always  try  to  put  ourselves  in  their  position  (and)  remember  when  we  were  their  age."READ:  Helping  teens  build  a  healthy  body  imageMichelle  Staruiala,  a  mom  of  three  in  Saskatchewan,  Canada,  follows  the  same  advice  with  her  three  children,  ages  13,  15  and  23."I  don't  judge  or  make  them  feel  stupid  when  they  have  tough  questions,"  she  said.  "We  all  know  growing  up  isn't  always  easy."'Put  duct  tape  over  your  mouth'The  second  grave  error  parents  make,  Hoefle  said,  is  we  talk  too  much.  We  need  to,  quite  simply,  shut  up,  and  maybe  "put  duct  tape  over"  our  mouths."It's  like,  Oh  my  god,  do  you  just  have  to  be  so  smart  all  the  time?  Can't  you  give  your  kid  a  chance  to  be  the  smartest  one  in  the  room?  And  there's  an  attitude  about  stepping  back  and  allowing  your  child  to  be  the  star  in  the  show.  That's  what  secures  you  a  place  in  the  next  conversation."Kelli  Caprine,  a  mom  of  four  in  Santa  Clarita,  California,  said  to  get  teens  to  want  to  talk  to  you,  you  have  to  refrain  from  telling  them  what  to  do  at  every  turn."That  would  turn  my  kids  off  right  away.  So  I  would  have  to  just  listen  and  then  say,  'Would  you  like  advice?'"Hoefle  strongly  encourages  parents  to  take  on  the  mindset  of  a  scientist  and  ask  a  "series  of  open-ended  questions"  to  encourage  their  teen  to  open  up.READ:  Steering  teen  drivers  out  of  harm's  wayHow  and  where  to  have  the  talkEqually  important,  said  Hoefle,  is  understanding  how  your  teens  like  to  communicate  --  whether  it  be  while  cooking  dinner,  driving  in  the  car  or  in  a  quiet  place  with  zero  distractions."How  to  set  up  the  environment  that  best  supports  your  child  is  really  important,"  she  said.Stephanie  True  Fix,  a  mom  of  two  in  South  Portland,  Maine,  said  quick  car  trips  tend  to  be  a  successful  way  to  get  a  little  bit  of  information  from  her  children."Teenagers  may  call  that  a  trap,  but  I  call  it  parental  opportunity,"  said  the  single  mom  of  two  teenagers.For  Carolyn  Austin-Haase,  a  mom  of  four  ages  16  to  26  in  Princess  Anne,  Maryland,  the  dinner  table  has  been  the  best  place  to  get  her  children  to  unload."We  have  talked  about  everything  under  the  sun,"  she  said.  "Sex,  penises,  pubic  hair,  bowel  movements,  periods,  drugs,  masturbating,  pregnancy,  birth  control.  Our  dinner  table  is  not  for  the  faint  of  heart."What  just  about  every  parent  I  spoke  with  and  parenting  expert  Vicki  Hoefle  stress  is  that  parents  need  to  start  early  --  well  ahead  of  the  teen  years."You  can't  wait  until  your  kids  are  teenagers  and  quit  talking  to  you  to  work  on  the  relationship,"  said  Austin-Haase.  "It  must  be  done  early  on."What  do  you  think  is  the  best  way  to  get  teens  to  open  up?

The  Panama-born  designer  has  spent  the  past  three  decades  decorating  all  manner  of  lush,  lavish  events  around  the  globe,  but  weddings  --  complete  with  his  signature  massive  floralscapes  --  are  where  he's  most  deeply  rooted.Bailey  is  far  from  the  only  flower  fanatic  out  there:  A  2014  study  by  the  Association  of  Bridal  Consultants  showed  the  average  wedding  costs  of  $28,016,  and  including  about  $1,800  for  "flowers  and  decorations."  The  study  estimates  bridal  bouquets  at  $139,  reception  table  centerpieces  at  $366,  flower  girl  flower  at  $86  and  flower  girl  petals  at  $84.Bailey's  newest  book,  "Designing  with  Flowers,"  hits  bookstores  on  April  8.  CNN  spoke  with  him  about  how  to  create  a  floral  fantasy  for  your  own  wedding  --  even  if  you  don't  have  a  bloomin'  big  budget.  An  edited  transcript  is  below.CNN:  Why  do  weddings  and  flowers  go  together  so  well?Bailey:  The  reason  is  simple.  Flowers  have  always  been  a  symbol  of  celebration.  It's  a  great  way  to  convey  happiness  and  beauty.  If  you  walk  into  a  room  that  has  flowers,  you  immediately  respond  in  a  very  positive  way.  It's  a  mood-changing  thing.  You  feel  something.  It's  dealing  with  emotions.I  really  got  turned  on  to  flowers  on  one  of  the  cherry  blossom  weekends  in  Washington.  It  was  the  most  incredible  thing  in  the  world  and  I  had  a  moment  where  I  imagined,  "What  would  happen  if  I  could  bring  this  inside?"CNN:  Flowers  aren't  just  visual.  What  impact  are  you  going  for  with  the  rest  of  the  senses?Bailey:  The  scent  can  almost  transport  you  elsewhere.  I've  always  felt  I  did  a  great  job  when  I  created  a  room  with  beautiful  flowers  and  the  guests  are  so  happy  and  excited  that  they  don't  want  to  leave.  I  think  "OK,  I  nailed  it."I  try  to  create  rooms  that  are  so  beautiful  and  powerful,  not  just  visually,  but  with  scent,  that  people  are  happy  and  feel  a  sense  of  celebration.CNN:  People  have  traditional  spots  for  flowers  in  their  wedding  --  maybe  in  a  bouquet,  as  centerpieces  or  tied  to  the  ends  of  pews.  Where  should  they  focus  their  energy  (and  budget)?Bailey:  Flowers  don't  need  to  be  only  in  vases.  They  can  be  in  a  napkin  or  on  the  table  or  in  the  aisle.  In  the  book,  we  have  strands  blowing  in  the  wind.  I'd  like  to  encourage  people  to  think  out  of  the  vase,  in  many  different  ways  that  can  be  exciting.  You  don't  have  to  limit  yourself  to  arrangements.CNN:  Not  everyone  has  a  Preston  Bailey-level  budget.  What  can  they  do  to  get  the  most  bang  for  their  buck?Bailey:  When  I  started,  my  first  budget  was  $200.  I  very  much  believe  today  what  I  did  then:  with  a  smaller  budget,  you  have  to  be  realistic  about  the  things  that  are  most  important.  In  my  mind,  one  of  the  most  important  moments  is  seeing  the  bride  walking  down  the  aisle.  That's  the  first  impression,  so  you  want  to  create  a  beautiful  bouquet.  [Editor's  note:  When  Bailey  married  his  husband  Theo  Bleckmann  in  2013  at  age  63,  he  emerged  from  a  giant  bridal  sculpture  that  was  rolled  down  the  aisle,  carrying  a  bouquet.]Another  important  location  is  the  dinner.  They're  going  to  be  sitting  at  the  table  all  night,  so  you  want  invest  some  money  in  a  centerpiece  or  a  detail  on  a  napkin.  I  also  like  to  do  something  beautiful  for  the  escort  card  arrangement,  because  that  sets  the  tone  for  the  event.But  a  budget's  a  budget.  It's  a  matter  of  how  much  you  can  afford  and  how  much  you  can  do  with  it.  Concentrate  on  the  areas  that  are  more  important  and  visible  and  you'll  be  just  fine.CNN:  When  people  are  buying  flowers,  what  do  they  need  to  consider?Bailey:  A  lot  of  places  where  you  buy  flowers,  they  have  matured,  and  they're  completely  open.  That  means  that  they  might  only  last  another  half  a  day.  You  have  to  know  a  little  bit  --  how  long  they're  going  to  open,  what  room  temperature  they  need  to  open.  There  are  flowers  that  last  10  days  and  flowers  that  last  one  day.  It  is  important  to  do  your  research.If  you're  using  a  florist,  they  will  know  this,  but  if  you're  trying  to  do  it  yourself,  my  strongest  advice  is  that  if  the  wedding  is  not  that  same  day,  don't  buy  flowers  that  are  completely  open,  because  they're  going  to  die  on  your  big  wedding  day.CNN:  Yikes!  So  how  should  the  flowers  be  preserved  during  all  the  preparation?Bailey:  You  have  to  keep  in  mind  that  flowers  are  living  beings.  It's  important  to  always  cut  the  stems  at  an  angle,  before  you  put  them  in  water.  And  I'm  very  old-school.  I  do  not  believe  in  chemicals  of  any  kind.Just  make  sure  that  you  change  the  water  daily.  They  love  fresh  water.  They  do  not  like  to  be  in  a  warm  environment,  unless  you  want  them  to  open  very  quickly.  Make  sure  there's  a  comfortable  room  temperature  if  you  want  them  to  open  slowly,  but  changing  the  water  daily  is  my  best  advice.CNN:  How  much  attention  should  couples  pay  to  seasonality?Bailey:  You  should  use  seasonal  flowers.  It's  much  more  cost-effective,  they're  much  more  available.  In  the  winter,  we  do  not  have  a  lot  available;  however,  there  are  flowers  like  amaryllis,  that  bloom  in  December.  Paperwhites  bloom  then,  too,  and  they  can  be  used  as  potted  plants.  Amaryllis,  by  the  way,  is  a  beautiful  flower  with  one  long  stem  and  it's  perfect  for  a  centerpiece.  After  the  wedding,  you  get  to  keep  it  for  another  couple  of  weeks.There  are  ways  that,  as  a  designer,  I  have  to  think  about  what's  more  practical  for  the  season.  If  you  buy  spring  flowers  in  the  winter,  it's  going  to  be  five  times  more  expensive.CNN:  I'm  sure  some  of  your  clients  want  that!Bailey:  [Laughs]  Yes!  You  can  find  them,  but  it's  a  lot  of  cost  and  I  would  not  advise  that.CNN:  Is  there  some  flower  you  hope  you  never  see  again?Bailey:  I  used  to  say  that  about  carnations,  and  I  changed  my  mind.  There  are  a  couple  of  cultures  that  like  carnations,  and  I'm  using  them  now  for  sculptures  instead  of  just  arrangements.  They're  great  because  they're  very  long-lasting  --  it's  like  a  flower  that  never  dies!But  I  always  get  into  trouble  when  I  say  this,  but  I'm  going  to  say  it  anyway:  I  grew  up  in  Panama,  and  in  my  backyard,  there  was  tons  of  bird-of-paradise,  and  we  considered  them  weeds.  So  I'm  not  crazy  about  them.CNN:  What  flower  would  you  love  for  more  couples  to  use?Bailey:  Vanda  orchids.  It's  a  very  deep  purple  flower,  and  I  think  it's  one  of  the  most  beautiful  orchids  around.  But  they  are  so  cost-prohibitive,  it's  ridiculous.  I  can't  wait  for  the  day  that  somebody  creates  a  less  expensive  way  to  make  them  accessible.On  the  more  affordable  side:  classic  roses.  Throughout  the  year,  the  cost  has  been  going  down  because  the  market  is  so  saturated.  Because  so  many  people  have  been  using  them,  roses  have  become  very  cost-effective.CNN:  Let's  say  the  couple  wants  to  re-create  the  magic  on  their  first  anniversary.  What  would  be  a  fun  way  to  recreate  the  event  on  a  more  intimate  scale,  florally  speaking?Bailey:  I  think  it's  great  to  keep  the  celebration  going  and  see  what  flowers  you  used  in  your  wedding  and  use  them  again  in  a  different  way.  I  remember  one  of  my  clients  was  celebrating  a  second  anniversary,  and  we  replicated  the  bride's  bouquet.  I  think  that  was  really  great!  Celebrate  the  day  with  some  of  the  same  flowers  and  I  think  it  could  be  very  meaningful.CNN:  You  may  or  may  not  be  able  to  answer  this  question,  but  what's  the  biggest  flower  budget  a  client  has  ever  given  you  to  work  with?Bailey:  And  you're  absolutely  right  --  I  can't  answer  that.  It's  such  a  bummer  because  I'm  under  confidentiality  agreements.  But  again,  it's  all  relative  and  what's  a  lot  of  money  for  one  person  is  not  for  the  other.How  much  did  you  spend  on  your  wedding  flowers,  and  did  you  get  creative?

A  smiling  7-year-old  girl  poses  in  her  cheerleading  uniform,  circled  by  a  ring  of  pompons,  her  bald  head  a  telltale  sign  of  her  chemotherapy  treatments.The  photo  hit  Facebook  last  year  and  popped  up  all  over  with  messages  of  support.  "Like"  to  show  this  little  girl  you  care.  "Share"  to  tell  her  she's  beautiful.  Pray  for  her  to  beat  cancer.But  here's  the  truth.  The  photo  was  nearly  six  years  old.  And  neither  the  girl,  nor  her  parents  --  who  never  posted  it  to  Facebook  --  had  any  idea  it  was  being  used  that  way.Welcome  to  the  world  of  Facebook  "like  farming."Those  waves  of  saccharin-sweet  posts  that  sometimes  fill  your  news  feed  may  seem  harmless.  But  all  too  often,  they're  being  used  for  nefarious  purposes.  At  best,  a  complete  stranger  may  be  using  the  photos  to  stroke  their  own  ego.  At  worst,  experts  say,  scammers  and  spammers  are  using  Facebook,  often  against  the  site's  rules,  to  make  some  easy  cash.And  they're  wiling  to  play  on  the  good  intentions  of  Facebook  users  to  do  it."The  average  user  doesn't  know  any  better,"  said  Tim  Senft,  founder  of  Facecrooks.com,  a  website  that  monitors  scams  and  other  illegal  or  unethical  behavior  on  Facebook.  "I  think  their  common  sense  tells  them  it's  not  true,  but  in  the  back  of  their  minds,  they  think  'What  if  it  is  true?  What  does  it  hurt  if  I  press  like?'  or  whatever."What  does  it  hurt?"I  was  first  shocked,"  said  Amanda  Rieth  of  Northampton,  Pennsylvania,  whose  daughter  was  the  subject  of  that  photo.  "And  then  infuriated."After  being  notified  by  a  friend  who  recognized  the  girl  in  a  Facebook  post,  Rieth  tracked  the  image  back  to  a  link  she'd  posted  to  her  Photobucket  account  in  a  community  forum  in  2009,  two  years  after  it  was  taken.Her  daughter,  who  was  diagnosed  with  Stage  IV  neuroblastoma  in  early  2007,  has  been  featured  in  local  news  segments  for  her  fundraising  efforts  to  fight  cancer  through  Alex's  Lemonade  Stand.  But  her  mom  said  she  was  always  part  of  the  decision  and  was  happy  to  help  publicize  the  fight."This?  This  was  entirely  different  and  entirely  out  of  our  control,"  Rieth  said.  "That's  the  most  gut-wrenching  part:  the  total  lack  of  control."Hurting  the  people  featured  in  the  posts,  and  their  families,  isn't  the  only  risk  of  sharing  such  content.  Sometimes,  a  single  click  can  help  people  who  are  up  to  no  good.Often,  Senft  said,  Facebook  pages  are  created  with  the  sole  purpose  of  spreading  viral  content  that  will  get  lots  of  likes  and  shares.Once  the  page  creators  have  piled  up  hundreds  of  thousands  of  likes  and  shares,  they'll  strip  the  page  and  promote  something  else,  like  products  that  they  get  a  commission  for  selling.  Or,  they  may  turn  around  and  sell  the  page  through  black-market  websites  to  someone  who  does  the  same.It's  a  way  to  trick  Facebook's  algorithm,  which  is  designed  to  give  more  value  to  popular  pages  than  the  ones,  like  scams  and  spam,  that  pop  up  overnight."The  more  likes  and  shares  and  comments  and  that  sort  of  thing  you  have,  the  more  likely  it  is  to  be  seen  by  other  people,"  Senft  said.  "If  they're  looking  to  sell  the  page  in  a  black-hat  forum  somewhere,  that's  what  the  value  of  the  page  is."It  gets  worseSometimes,  the  threat  is  more  direct.The  "new"  page  may  be  used  to  spread  malware  --  software  that  attacks  the  user's  computer  --  or  for  phishing,  the  act  of  trying  to  gather  credit  card  numbers,  passwords  or  other  personal  information  through  links  to  phony  giveaways  or  contests.If  the  page  owner  has  access  to  Facebook's  developer  tools,  they  can  collect  data  on  the  people  who  like  the  page.  Personal  information  like  gender,  location  and  age  can  be  used  to  target  more  personalized  attacks.The  kind  of  posts  used  run  a  gamut  from  cute  to  tasteless,  from  manipulative  to  misleading.Rieth  said  she  still  finds  her  daughter's  photo  on  Facebook  from  time  to  time,  even  though  Facebook  eventually  deleted  the  original  after  she  and  others  reported  it.On  the  most  recent  page  she  found,  the  picture  appears  in  a  feed  alongside  posts  such  as  "Who  loves  French  fries?  Like  &  share  if  you  do"  and  multiple  images  encouraging  people  to  like  and  share  if  they  love  Jesus.There's  an  image  of  a  premature  baby,  pictures  of  military  troops  cuddling  puppies  and  an  image  of  a  young  boy  pouring  water  on  a  man's  cigarette  with  the  text  "Sorry  papa  ...  I  need  you.""It's  anything  that's  going  to  kind  of  tug  at  the  heartstrings:  the  sick  kids,  the  animal  abuse,  acting  like  it's  some  kind  of  pet  shelter,"  Senft  said.  "That's  the  bad  part  with  the  scammers.  They  hit  people  where  they're  vulnerable,  play  on  their  emotions."What  to  doBecause  of  Facebook's  sheer  size,  he  said  it  sometimes  takes  lots  of  reports  for  the  site  to  delete  an  offensive  or  misleading  image,  or  shut  down  the  page  it  came  from.  The  best  approach,  Senft  said,  is  to  think  before  sharing."If  it  sounds  too  good  to  be  true,  don't  click  on  it,"  he  said.  "If  it's  something  that's  obviously  geared  toward  tugging  on  the  heartstrings,  check  it  out  first."Facebook  said  it  continues  to  work  to  make  sure  high-quality  content  surfaces  for  users  and  low-quality  posts  don't.  That  includes  trying  to  diminish  the  reach  of  posts  that  appear  to  be  "like  farming"  attempts."People  have  told  us  they  associate  requests  to  like  or  share  a  post  with  lower  quality  content,  and  receiving  that  type  of  feedback  helps  us  adjust  our  systems  to  get  better  at  showing  more  high  quality  posts,"  a  Facebook  spokesperson  said  via  e-mail."If  you  see  a  post  that's  low  quality  and  seems  to  be  focused  only  on  gaining  traffic,  hover  over  the  top-right  corner  of  the  post  and  click  the  arrow  to  report  it."Facebook  uses  "automated  and  manual  methods  to  swiftly  remove  links  and  pages  that  violate  our  policies,"  the  spokesperson  said.  "We're  always  making  improvements  to  our  detection  and  blocking  systems  to  stay  ahead  of  threats."'Truly  angry'Today,  Rieth's  daughter  is  13  --  an  eighth-grader  who  has  shown  no  signs  of  her  cancer  since  September  2007.But  her  mom  compares  that  cheerleading  photo  to  the  mythical  hydra,  a  monster  with  many  heads  that  sprouts  two  more  each  time  one  is  cut  off.  Based  just  on  the  images  she's  found  and  reported,  the  photo  has  been  liked  and  shared  on  Facebook  hundreds  of  thousands  of  times.A  search  Monday  also  found  it  popping  up  on  Pinterest,  as  well  as  one  site  where  it  was  wrongly  used  alongside  a  2010  article  about  actor  Jackie  Chan  helping  a  girl  with  leukemia  find  a  bone-marrow  donor."What  makes  me  truly  angry,  though,  is  knowing  that  they're  using  it  as  an  insidious  way  to  make  money,"  Rieth  said.  "That's  not  what  her  survival  is  about  to  us."For  this  article,  CNN  sent  a  Facebook  message  to  the  owner  of  the  last  page  where  Rieth  found  the  photo.When  asked  whether  he  planned  to  sell  his  page,  the  owner  replied  with  two  words:"How  much?"</TEXT></DOC>

Share  your  personal  story  with  iReport  in  honor  of  World  Rare  Disease  Day  and  you  could  be  featured  on  CNN.(CNN)  --  Laura  Kassem  had  tripped  before.  But  this  time,  she  fell  hard.  She  couldn't  seem  to  control  her  body  as  she  went  down,  even  to  protect  her  face  from  hitting  the  concrete  sidewalk.It  happened  again  the  next  day  as  she  stepped  off  an  escalator.  Then  again  in  the  parking  garage  on  Monday  when  she  went  to  work."I  had  no  idea  what  was  going  on,"  the  33-year-old  remembers.  "I  had  no  idea  why  I  would  just  drop  all  of  a  sudden."The  third  time,  she  went  to  the  emergency  room,  where  a  neurologist  ordered  an  MRI  and  a  cardiologist  performed  a  tilt  test  --  normally  done  on  patients  who  faint  because  of  a  sudden  drop  in  blood  pressure.The  tests  revealed  nothing.  Doctors  sent  Kassem  home  with  instructions  to  drink  more  water.Kassem  continued  to  trip  over  nothing.  So  she  went  to  the  Cleveland  Clinic,  where  she  says  her  symptoms  "baffled"  doctors  in  the  rheumatology,  cardiology  and  neurology  departments.Back  home  in  Sylvania,  Ohio,  a  suburb  of  Toledo,  Kassem  made  an  appointment  with  an  orthopedic  surgeon  to  address  the  extreme  pain  in  her  hips  and  lower  back.  He  sent  her  to  a  neurosurgeon,  who  in  turn  sent  her  to  see  a  neurologist  who  specialized  in  neuromuscular  disorders.Meanwhile,  Kassem  tried  to  avoid  open  spaces.  She  hugged  walls  so  that  if  her  body  froze  up,  she  wouldn't  fall  flat  on  her  face.  She  already  had  a  few  loose  teeth,  and  her  nose  was  a  mix  of  blue  and  purple.One  night,  Kassem  and  her  sister  were  watching  "20/20"  when  the  woman  being  interviewed  began  describing  Kassem's  symptoms.  The  woman  had  been  diagnosed  with  Stiff  Person  Syndrome,  or  SPS,  a  rare  neurological  disorder  characterized  by  painful  muscle  spasms  and  progressive  stiffness  in  the  lower  back  and  limbs.Could  that  be  it?  the  Kassems  asked  themselves.  They  had  never  heard  of  SPS.  But  Kassem's  latest  neurologist  thought  they  could  be  right.  While  waiting  for  the  test  results,  he  put  Kassem  on  benzodiazepine,  a  medication  that  is  known  to  lessen  the  symptoms  of  SPS.It  worked.  For  the  first  time  in  nearly  a  year,  Kassem  was  able  to  walk  without  assistance.Read  more  of  Laura's  story  on  iReportThe  exact  prevalence  of  Stiff  Person  Syndrome  is  unknown,  according  to  the  National  Organization  for  Rare  Disorders,  but  one  estimate  places  it  at  one  in  every  1  million  people.  That  means  about  316  people  in  the  United  States  have  it.The  exact  cause  of  SPS  is  also  unknown.  Doctors  believe  it  has  something  to  do  with  a  deficiency  of  glutamic  acid  decarboxylase,  or  GAD.  GAD  is  involved  in  the  body's  production  of  gamma-aminobutyric  acid,  which  helps  control  muscle  movement.  In  patients  with  SPS,  antibodies  mistakenly  attack  certain  neurons  that  produce  GAD,  leaving  the  body  without  the  protein  it  needs.The  symptoms  of  SPS  generally  start  to  appear  in  patients  after  age  30.  People  with  SPS  initially  experience  muscle  stiffness  or  discomfort.  As  the  disease  progresses,  muscle  spasms  and  rigidity  become  more  pronounced.  These  muscle  spasms  can  last  anywhere  from  a  few  minutes  to  several  hours,  and  are  triggered  by  unexpected  noises,  physical  contact,  stress  and/or  emotional  anxiety."I've  fallen  on  the  streets  and  prayed  to  God  that  someone  wouldn't  run  over  me,"  says  Ingrid  Steppan,  who  was  diagnosed  with  SPS  five  years  ago.  "My  husband  can't  touch  my  arm.  My  kids  can't  give  me  hugs."Steppan  compares  the  muscle  spasms  to  childbirth.  Imagine  contractions  felt  in  the  uterus  happening  from  your  neck  down  to  your  toes,  she  says.  The  whole  body  goes  stiff  --  hence  the  syndrome's  name.When  she  first  began  experiencing  symptoms,  Steppan  couldn't  dress  herself.  Her  9-year-old  son  had  to  help  her  put  on  her  underwear,  because  his  older  siblings  had  all  moved  out  and  her  husband  went  to  work  early."It  was  embarrassing  for  him  and  it  was  embarrassing  for  me,"  she  remembers.  "We  both  cried."Treatment  has  helped.  While  there  is  no  cure  yet  for  SPS,  patients  are  often  put  on  benzodiazepines  to  treat  muscle  stiffness  and  calm  the  spasms.  Anti-seizure  medications  and  painkillers  are  sometimes  prescribed  as  well  to  lessen  symptoms.Yet  after  years  of  freezing  and  falling  unexpectedly  because  of  stress  or  sudden  sounds,  many  patients  with  SPS  develop  agoraphobia,  an  irrational  fear  of  certain  places  and/or  situations.  They  become  housebound,  unable  to  venture  outside  their  comfort  zone."My  mind  knows  I'm  OK,  but  my  body  won't  cooperate,"  Steppan  says.  "If  I  try  to  go  outside,  my  body  completely  stiffens  up,  and  I  will  fall  over  flat.  You  can  put  a  sticker  on  my  head  and  put  me  up  for  sale.  I'm  a  statue  for  your  lawn."A  few  years  ago,  Steppan  underwent  intravenous  immunoglobulin  therapy,  or  IVIg,  a  common  treatment  for  patients  with  SPS.With  IVIg,  a  concentrated  solution  of  sterilized  antibodies  is  given  to  the  patient  through  one  of  their  veins.  IVIg  is  most  commonly  used  to  help  people  with  autoimmune  disorders.  Although  SPS  is  a  neurological  disorder,  it  has  "features"  of  an  autoimmune  disease,  according  to  the  National  Institutes  of  Health.Those  features  could  eventually  lead  scientists  to  a  cure.Dr.  Harry  Atkins,  medical  director  of  regenerative  medicine  at  Ottawa  Hospital  Research  Institute  in  Ontario,  Canada,  has  been  studying  the  effects  of  stem  cell  transplantation  on  autoimmune  diseases  for  close  to  a  decade.Five  years  ago,  a  patient  with  SPS  approached  him  with  her  medical  history.  She  had  done  her  research,  Atkins  says,  and  told  him  that  a  stem  cell  transplant  could  restore  her  immune  system  --  ridding  it  of  the  antibodies  fighting  against  GAD  production."She  made  a  very  compelling  case  that  this  was  worth  trying,"  Atkins  remembers.  "That's  how  I  learned  about  Stiff  Person  Syndrome."During  a  stem  cell  transplant,  doctors  use  strong  doses  of  chemotherapy  to  wipe  out  the  patient's  immune  system.  They  then  return  purified  bone  marrow  stem  cells  to  the  body."It  appears  that  as  the  immune  system  regrows,  it's  like  a  baby's  immune  system,"  Atkins  says.  "It  recognizes  what's  part  of  the  body,  and  is  able  to  fight  against  germs  and  pathogens."It's  a  dangerous  procedure.  When  their  immune  system  is  wiped  out,  patients  are  prone  to  infection  and  organ  damage.  As  such,  it  is  reserved  for  those  with  only  the  most  severe  autoimmune  diseases.Atkins  decided  SPS  fit  that  bill  and  performed  the  stem  cell  transplant.  His  first  SPS  patient  is  now  symptom-free,  he  says,  and  off  all  medications  typically  used  for  treating  the  rare  disorder.  He  performed  another  transplant  on  a  second  SPS  patient  two  years  ago.  That  patient  is  symptom-free  as  well,  he  says,  though  she  still  relies  on  a  few  medications."I  didn't  believe  the  procedure  would  work  so  well,"  Atkins  says.  "It's  like  a  miracle  to  see  what  she  was  like  before,  and  to  see  her  now  --  it's  quite  dramatic."Steppan  will  be  Atkins'  third  SPS  patient.Last  week,  doctors  harvested  her  stem  cells  for  sterilization.  She  hopes  to  receive  her  last  dose  of  chemotherapy  soon,  so  they  can  then  start  rebuilding  her  immune  system.Atkins  is  cautious  about  saying  stem  cell  transplantation  is  the  definitive  treatment  for  Stiff  Person  Syndrome.  The  results  have  been  encouraging,  but  the  procedure  has  only  been  done  in  two  patients.  The  rarity  of  the  disease  makes  it  difficult  to  find  research  funding  --  not  to  mention  participants.  All  three  procedures  were  performed  in  Canada  under  the  country's  universal  health  care  system.Doctors  at  Fred  Hutchinson  Cancer  Research  Center  in  Seattle  have  an  open  clinical  trial  protocol  for  doing  stem  cell  transplants  on  patients  with  Stiff  Person  Syndrome,  says  Dr.  George  Georges.  Unfortunately,  most  insurance  carriers  in  the  United  States  will  not  cover  the  cost  of  the  transplant.Kassem  is  trying  to  raise  $400,000  as  a  deposit.The  Ohio  resident  has  been  bedridden  since  October.  She  has  spasms  that  cause  her  whole  body  to  stretch  out  and  shake.  Her  brother  is  the  only  one  strong  enough  to  bend  her  legs  when  they  go  stiff.  She  lives  with  her  parents,  and  someone  has  to  be  home  24/7.Kassem  has  made  many  new  friends  through  rare  disease  support  groups  online.  They're  so  few  and  far  between  it's  often  the  only  way  patients  with  SPS  can  find  each  other.  She  and  Steppan  have  communicated  through  Facebook."It's  a  very  lonely  life,"  Steppan  says.  "I  talk  to  them  every  day  and  they  talk  to  me.  ...  These  people  need  to  believe  that  there's  hope."See  more  stories  from  people  living  with  Stiff  Person  Syndrome</TEXT></DOC>

Not  just  for  an  electric  car,  but  for  traditional  petrol-engine  cars  as  well.For  years  electric  vehicles  have  been  regarded  as  the  frumpy  inner-city  siblings  of  their  hardier  countryside  4x4  brethren  or  zippier  track-friendly  supercar  sisters.  Electric  vehicles  have  tended  to  have  names  like  Leaf,  Buddy  or  Spark  as  opposed  to  Vanquish,  Venom  or  Phantom.Read:  The  coolest  things  technology  has  up  its  sleeve  in  2014All  this  may  be  set  to  change  when  Rimac  goes  into  production.  First  unveiled  at  Frankfurt  Motor  Show  in  September,  2011,  the  Concept  One  is  an  electric  vehicle  that  aims  to  be  even  faster  than  the  Bugatti  Veyron.  Its  precocious  25-year-old  inventor,  Mate  Rimac,  says  that  the  car  produces  1018  horsepower,  can  accelerate  from  0  to  100  kph  in  just  2.8  seconds,  has  a  top  speed  of  305  kph,  and  can  travel  600  kilometers  on  a  single  charge.Mate  Rimac  says  that  he  has  always  been  motivated  by  the  desire  to  demonstrate  the  superiority  of  electric  over  petrol-powered  cars:  "I  have  two  passions;  cars  and  technology,"  Rimac  says.  "Technology  because  Nikola  Tesla  was  born  in  Croatia,  and  he  invented  the  electric  motor  that  is  used  in  so  many  applications  today.  And  I  knew  simply  by  theory  that  this  motor  is  so  much  better  to  drive  a  car  --  even  a  sports  car."I  decided  to  combine  my  two  passions,  technology  and  cars  and  make  an  electric  car  that  can  prove  the  electric  motor  is  much  better  even  on  the  racetrack.  Not  just  city  cars  for  boring  stuff,  but  to  show  people  that  the  future  will  be  interesting  --  that  one  day  when  petrol  is  gone  and  you  only  have  electric  cars  in  the  world,  you  won't  have  to  compromise  in  terms  of  performance,  speed  or  (how)  far  (it  can  go)."Read:  States'  pledge  could  boost  electric  car  businessWhile  he  was  still  in  high  school,  Rimac  bought  a  lime  green  BMW  for  less  than  €1000  and  began  modifying  it  with  new  parts.  "I  couldn't  wait  to  pull  out  (the  motor)  and  put  batteries  and  electric  motors  inside  instead  of  the  gas  engine,"  Rimac  says.  After  several  years  of  rebuilding  and  alteration,  Rimac  set  a  world  record  with  his  car,  which  became  the  fastest  accelerating  electric  car  in  the  world.  The  car  is  still  recognized  in  the  Guinness  Book  of  World  Records  for  the  fastest  quarter  mile  by  an  electric  vehicle.After  setting  five  separate  world  records  with  his  modified  BMW,  Rimac  began  to  work  towards  building  his  very  own  car  from  scratch.  He  enlisted  the  help  of  the  highly-regarded  young  car  designer  Adriano  Mudri,  and  began  work  on  the  Concept_One.Now  Rimac  is  turning  his  dream  car  into  a  reality  on  a  shoestring  budget:  "In  the  car  industry,  it's  common  to  design  a  new  car  with  1  billion  to  5  billion  dollars.  But,  most  of  those  cars  carry  over  components  from  previous  versions  --  engines,  gear  boxes  and  stuff.  We  had  to  design  a  car  (including)  the  whole  technology  under  the  skin,  (while)  the  company  itself  didn't  have  a  desk  to  put  a  computer  on.  And  we  did  all  that  with  less  than  0.1  per  cent  of  the  budget  which  is  usual  in  the  car  industry,"  Rimac  says.Read:  Formula  E,  the  electrifying  future  of  motorsportPreliminary  impressions  from  the  automotive  press  have  been  generally  positive,  although  many,  such  as  GTspirit.com,  said  that  they  approached  the  concept  of  a  vehicle  that  has  "no  sound,  no  downshift  and  no  smell  of  burnt  petrol"  with  trepidation.  Some  also  disputed  the  figures  Rimac  has  released,  suggesting  that  their  projected  performance  statistics  may  be  ambitious.Still,  the  notion  that  an  electric  car  might  soon  not  just  match,  but  outperform  the  best  petrol  vehicles  on  the  planet  is  certainly  a  captivating  one.  When  Rimac  releases  a  production  car  into  the  wild  in  the  not-too-distant  future,  the  eyes  of  the  world  will  certainly  be  watching.</TEXT></DOC>

The  bags  of  alleged  heroin  were  branded  "black  list"  and  "red  bull"  --  not  the  same  brands  found  in  Hoffman's  apartment,  the  officials  said.A  police  source  said  the  Manhattan  apartments  where  the  four  were  picked  up  are  part  of  the  investigation  into  Hoffman's  death.The  four  under  investigation  in  connection  with  drugs  sold  to  Academy  Award-winning  actor  were  identified  as  Luchkiw;  Rosenblum;  Robert  Vineberg,  57;  and  Thomas  Cushman,  48.The  Manhattan  district  attorney's  office  Wednesday  declined  to  prosecute  Cushman  because  there  was  no  evidence  he  had  any  control  over  the  drugs.Luchkiw,  who  pleaded  not  guilty  to  a  misdemeanor  charge  of  criminal  possession  of  a  controlled  substance,  appeared  Thursday  before  Manhattan  Supreme  Court  Judge  Edward  McLaughlin.Luchkiw's  attorney,  Stephen  Turano,  told  the  court  his  client  has  no  criminal  record.  He  said  her  father,  who  was  present  in  court,  is  a  lawyer  and  her  mother  a  doctor.The  prosecution  asked  for  Luchkiw's  bail  to  be  set  at  $1,500,  but  McLaughlin  ordered  her  released  on  her  own  recognizance,  saying  it  was  a  misdemeanor  case  and  it  was  "illogical"  to  assume  she  would  fail  show  for  her  February  14  court  date."My  client  absolutely  did  not,  is  not  involved  in  selling  any  drugs,  certainly  not  heroin,  but  any  drugs  and  certainly  not  involved  in  selling  drugs  to  Mr.  Hoffman,"  Turano  said  outside  court.Turano  said  a  search  of  her  apartment  turned  up  cocaine,  though  prosecutors  told  the  court  traces  of  what  was  believed  to  be  heroin  also  were  present."She's  tied  to  this  case  because  there  was  a  confidential  informant  who  placed  sales  of  narcotics  —  heroin  —  from,  I  guess,  an  adjacent  apartment,"  he  said.  "How  that  ties  into  my  client's  apartment,  I'm  not  sure.  But  I  can  be  very  adamant  that  my  client  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  sales.  And  again,  I  think  I  said  it  before,  really,  wrong  place,  wrong  time."Luchkiw  walked  out  of  court  with  her  father.Rosenblum  appeared  before  McLaughlin  later  Thursday.  The  judge  said  Rosenblum,  who  had  previously  failed  to  show  up  in  court  in  connection  with  a  2010  drug  possession  case,  "did  flip  his  nose  at  the  court  for  three  years."His  lawyer  David  Hochheiser  said  Rosenblum  would  live  with  his  parents  until  his  court  date  on  Tuesday.  Hochheiser  said  his  client  will  plead  not  guilty.  McLaughlin  set  bond  at  $35,000,  or  $8,500  cash,  which  his  family  posted.Vineberg,  who  faces  a  felony  charge  of  criminal  possession  of  a  controlled  substance  and  has  pleaded  not  guilty,  is  set  to  appear  in  court  February  14.Vineberg  was  found  to  have  the  actor's  phone  number  stored  in  his  cell  phone,  a  law  enforcement  official  told  CNN.  Police  discovered  the  largest  amount  of  what  is  believed  to  be  heroin  in  his  apartment,  the  source  said.A  former  neighbor  described  Vineberg  as  a  talented  musician  who  used  the  stage  name  Robert  Aaron  and  once  toured  with  Wyclef  Jean.  Vineberg  had  a  wife  and  daughter,  said  the  neighbor,  who  lived  in  the  building  years  ago."He  used  to  practice  at  night,"  said  the  ex-neighbor,  recalling  that  Vineberg  played  keyboards.  "Honestly,  he  seemed  like  a  nice  guy,  always  playing  music.  Nothing  sinister."Vineberg's  attorney,  Edward  Kratt,  said  he  hopes  prosecutors  will  not  use  his  client  as  a  scapegoat."These  charges  have  absolutely  nothing  to  do  with  Philip  Seymour  Hoffman's  unfortunate  death,"  Kratt  said.A  spokeswoman  for  the  New  York  medical  examiner's  office  said  Wednesday  a  determination  of  the  cause  and  manner  of  Hoffman's  death  is  pending  further  study,  including  toxicology  reports.When  police  were  called  to  Hoffman's  fourth-floor  Manhattan  apartment  Sunday,  they  found  the  actor,  46,  lying  on  the  bathroom  floor  with  a  syringe  in  his  left  arm.  He  was  wearing  shorts  and  a  T-shirt,  his  eyeglasses  still  resting  on  his  head,  according  to  law  enforcement  sources  familiar  with  the  inquiry.Investigators  discovered  close  to  50  envelopes  of  what  they  believed  was  heroin  in  the  apartment,  the  law  enforcement  sources  said.  They  also  found  used  syringes,  prescription  drugs  and  empty  plastic  bags  of  a  type  commonly  used  to  hold  drugs,  the  sources  said.Also  found  in  Hoffman's  apartment  was  his  personal  journal,  resting  on  a  living  room  TV  stand,  two  law  enforcement  sources  said.Hoffman's  final  hoursFinal  hoursPolice  are  trying  to  piece  together  the  actor's  movements  last  weekend.A  law  enforcement  source  told  CNN  that  the  night  before  Hoffman  died,  he  withdrew  $1,200  from  a  grocery  store  ATM  near  his  apartment.Hoffman  got  the  money  in  six  transactions  Saturday  night,  according  to  the  source.A  witness  told  investigators  he  saw  the  actor  talking  to  two  men  wearing  messenger  bags  about  8  p.m.Police  are  also  reviewing  surveillance  video,  including  that  of  a  restaurant  where  Hoffman  had  brunch  Saturday  morning  with  two  people.How  heroin  kills  youA  family  friend  of  Hoffman's  said  a  small,  private  wake  will  be  held  Thursday  evening  at  Manhattan's  Frank  E.

He  also  tweeted  "i  love  GA."In  contrast,  Bieber's  January  was  a  whirlwind  of  controversy  that  included  a  DUI  arrest  in  Miami,  an  assault  charge  in  Toronto  and  a  felony  vandalism  probe  in  Los  Angeles.The  People  v.  Justin  Bieber:  The  singer's  court  casesJail  video:  Bieber  off  balance?Video  of  Bieber  undergoing  a  sobriety  test  inside  a  Miami  Beach  police  station  on  January  23  was  released  to  the  media  Wednesday.  He  appeared  unsteady  at  times  as  he  walked  along  a  white  stripe  on  the  floor.Bieber  failed  a  series  of  sobriety  tests,  including  "horizontal  gaze,"  "Romberg  balance,"  "walk  and  turn,"  "finger  to  nose"  and  "one-leg  stand"  tests,  the  Miami  Beach  police  report  said.The  preliminary  toxicology  report  on  Bieber's  urine  sample  said  it  tested  positive  for  "metabolite  of  THC,"  which  indicates  marijuana  use,  and  alprazolam,  the  generic  name  for  the  prescription  sedative  Xanax.Bieber's  Southern  hideout?The  aggressive  paparazzi  who  routinely  tail  celebrities  in  Los  Angeles  have  sometimes  clashed  with  Bieber.The  singer  has  been  ticketed  for  speeding,  which  he  blamed  on  his  being  chased  by  photographers.  He  was  investigated  but  not  charged  two  years  ago  after  a  photographer  accused  him  of  assault  after  a  confrontation  in  Calabasas,  California,  where  Bieber  owns  a  mansion.Although  a  hip-hop  recording  center,  Atlanta  lacks  the  robust  hoard  of  photographers  that  stakes  out  all  corners  of  Hollywood.  But  Jason  Winslow,  a  Miami-based  photographer  who  sells  his  images  through  the  Splash  photo  agency,  traveled  to  Atlanta  to  cover  Bieber.Winslow  told  police  he  was  parked  outside  the  Sandy  Springs  Funhouse,  a  north  Atlanta  "family  fun  center,"  waiting  for  Bieber  to  emerge  Tuesday  afternoon  when  Hesny  told  him  to  leave."He  continued  to  take  pictures  from  further  away,"  Officer  K.D.  Sawtell  wrote.  "Eventually,  that  same  person  chased  him  down  in  a  Cadillac  Escalade  as  Winslow  fled  in  his  Chevy  SUV."Hesny,  32,  admitted  to  police  that  he  opened  Winslow's  car  door  and  took  the  camera,  but  he  said  had  no  intentions  of  keeping  it,  the  arresting  officer  said.  He  told  police  "he  just  wanted  to  delete  the  pictures  from  the  camera."He  tossed  the  camera  in  the  back  of  another  Bieber  SUV  and  then  drove  away,  he  told  police.  Winslow's  Nikon  camera,  which  he  valued  at  $10,000,  was  found  when  police  stopped  the  other  Escalade.

And  he  has  given  quite  a  lot  of  thought  about  how  to  connect  his  conservative  stances  on  protecting  personal  liberties  to  those  disparate  groups'  concerns  about  big  government  overreach.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  They  don't  see  many  U.S.  senators  in  ZIP  Code  40203.So  Markham  French,  executive  director  of  the  Plymouth  Community  Renewal  Center,  was  stunned  when  he  received  a  call  last  year  from  Sen.  Rand  Paul's  office  asking  if  the  lawmaker  could  stop  by  the  West  Louisville,  Kentucky,  facility  to  speak  with  patrons.  French  thought  hard  about  what  such  a  visit  would  mean  for  his  impoverished  community,  a  place  with  high  unemployment  and  which,  a  few  years  ago,  was  ranked  one  of  the  nation's  most  dangerous  neighborhoods  because  of  its  high  crime  and  murder  rates."I  initially  was  surprised,"  French  said.  But  "I  came  to  understand  that  he  didn't  want  to  assume  what  was  affecting  the  African-American  community.  He  wanted  to  hear  from  the  African-American  community  what  was  affecting  them."Paul  got  an  earful.So  he  listened.And  he  thought."I  didn't  realize  how  hard  it  was  to  pay  back  child  support  when  you've  been  in  prison,"  Paul  told  CNN.Rand  Paul  fights  for  felon  voting  rightsPaul,  a  tea  party  favorite,  has  been  listening  a  lot  these  days  to  voices  that  have  long  felt  unheard  by  the  Republican  Party:  African-Americans,  Hispanics  and  young  voters.  And  he  has  given  quite  a  lot  of  thought  about  how  to  connect  his  conservative  stances  on  protecting  personal  liberties  to  those  disparate  groups'  concerns  about  big  government  overreach.He  spoke  Wednesday,  touching  on  typically  libertarian  issues,  at  the  University  of  California  at  Berkeley,  a  campus  with  a  famously  progressive  culture."I  find  it  ironic  that  the  first  African-American  president  has,  without  compunction,  allowed  this  vast  exercise  of  raw  power  by  the  NSA,"  Paul  told  the  crowd  of  the  intelligence  community's  domestic  spying  practices.  "Certainly  J.  Edgar  Hoover's  illegal  spying  on  Martin  Luther  King  and  others  in  the  civil  rights  movement  should  give  us  all  pause.  Now  if  President  Obama  were  here,  he  would  say  he's  not  J.  Edgar  Hoover,  which  is  certainly  true.  But  power  must  be  restrained  because  no  one  knows  who  will  next  hold  that  power."Paul  told  CNN  after  his  speech  that  his  Berkeley  address  and  speeches  across  the  country  to  young  voters  and  minorities  reflect  "issues  I  believe  passionately  about  that  haven't  been  discussed  a  lot  in  the  Republican  Party."Paul's  visit  to  Berkeley,  much  like  his  visits  to  historically  black  colleges  Howard  University  in  Washington  and  Simmons  College  in  Louisville  and  his  push  for  so-called  "economic  freedom  zones"  --  areas  of  high  unemployment  in  places  like  Louisville  and  Detroit  that  would  reduce  federal  regulation  and  taxes  to  help  boost  economic  growth  --  are  the  actions  of  a  shrewd  and  ambitious  politician.They  are  the  actions  of  a  lawmaker  who  is  keenly  aware  of  the  nation's  shifting  demographic,  his  party's  self-professed  struggles  to  attract  minority  and  young  voters  and  his  own  desire  to  see  his  policy  proposals  take  hold.And  while  he  hasn't  said  he's  running  to  be  his  party's  2016  presidential  nominee,  he's  doing  all  the  things  that  someone  who's  running  for  president  would  do."It's  pretty  clear  that  Rand  correctly  assesses  the  changing  demographics  of  our  country  and  the  need  to  broaden  our  appeal  if  we're  going  to  compete  in  presidential  elections  and  make  it  clear  we  want  to  be  a  large  and  inclusive  party  that  includes  all  sorts  of  voters,"  Kentucky's  senior  senator,  Minority  Leader  Mitch  McConnell,  told  CNN.McConnell,  a  veteran  lawmaker  who  early  on  helped  tutor  Paul  in  the  congressional  art  of  tactical  strategy  has  watched  with  interest  the  junior  senator's  rise  to  the  national  stage.  The  potential  2016  GOP  presidential  hopeful  has  carefully  navigated  his  path  and  managed  to  benefit  from  an  almost  prescient  sense  of  timing,  close  friends  and  political  operatives  say."He's  a  very  smart  guy  with  extraordinary  political  instincts  and  I  think  that's  the  reason  for  his  rise  to  political  prominence,"  McConnell  said.  "People  tend  to  focus  on  his  (filibuster)  in  the  Senate  ...  but  his  outreach  to  groups  we  haven't  done  well  with  in  national  elections  strikes  me  as  different  from  what  other  aspirants  are  doing."The  son  also  risesPaul  is  his  father's  son.  And  like  Ron  Paul,  the  former  Texas  congressman  known  for  his  devout  libertarian  following,  the  younger  Paul  prides  himself  on  doing  things  differently.His  2010  campaign  for  the  Senate  seat  left  open  by  retiring  Kentucky  Sen.  Jim  Bunning  was  a  long  shot.  He  was  a  political  rookie  and  certainly  was  not  the  party  establishment  --  including  McConnell's  --  choice.He  also  had  a  few  early  stumbles  including  a  near  campaign-ending  misstep  when,  during  an  interview,  he  told  MSNBC  host  Rachel  Maddow  that  private  businesses  shouldn't  have  to  adhere  to  the  civil  rights  laws.  He  beat  a  hasty  retreat  from  that  comment  and  issued  a  statement  saying  he  supports  to  1964  Civil  Rights  Act.It  was  also  the  year  of  the  tea  party  uprising  and,  with  the  help  of  a  fed-up  conservative  electorate,  his  father's  vast  donor  list  and  his  own  edgy  brand  of  pragmatic  libertarianism,  the  younger  Paul  defeated  secretary  of  state  Trey  Grayson,  who  was  groomed  by  the  establishment  for  the  race.Once  in  the  Senate,  Paul  quickly  distinguished  himself  as  unwilling  to  take  the  traditional  freshman  role  of  keeping  quiet.Weeks  into  his  first  term  he  unveiled  a  plan  he  argued  would  trim  $500  billion  from  the  federal  budget  --  a  plan  that,  while  it  garnered  little  backing  on  either  side  of  the  aisle  and  ultimately  failed,  did  receive  support  from  McConnell.That  May,  Paul  led  a  one-man  showdown  over  extending  the  Patriot  Act  which  included  strident  criticism  of  both  Democratic  and  Republican  leadership.  The  ensuing  legislative  delay  in  passage  meant  President  Barack  Obama  was  forced  to  "autopen"  sign  the  law's  extension  while  he  was  in  France  for  the  G8  summit  just  before  it  expired  at  midnight.That  July  he  blocked  extending  FBI  Director  Robert  Mueller's  term  by  two  years  until  the  agency  head  gave  more  details  about  how  two  Iraqi  nationals  were  able  to  live  undetected  in  Paul's  hometown  of  Bowling  Green,  Kentucky,  for  several  years.  In  October,  another  block  --  this  time  millions  in  benefits  for  disabled  and  elderly  refugees  --  based  on  concerns  that  the  money  could  benefit  terrorists.That  year  at  the  Conservative  Political  Action  Conference  McConnell  dubbed  Paul  "one  of  the  great  freshman  conservatives."And  that  was  just  year  one.Now  just  over  halfway  through  his  first  term,  Paul  has  earned  praise  for  his  well-timed  push  against  the  intelligence  community's  domestic  spying  practices,  for  his  criticism  of  the  handling  of  the  nation's  mushrooming  debt  and  for  his  outreach  to  minority  and  young  voters.  He  is  poised  to  stand  as  one  of  the  frontrunners  in  the  potentially  crowded  field  of  2016  presidential  hopefuls  according  to  a  new  CNN/ORC  International  survey,  which  found  16%  of  Republicans  and  GOP-leaning  independents  might  support  his  bid.His  partnership  with  McConnell  on  such  issues  as  pushing  back  against  Obama  administration-backed  regulations  on  the  coal  industry  and  getting  funding  for  industrial  hemp  research  in  the  farm  bill,  illustrates  "what  happens  when  the  tea  party  guys  and  the  guys  who  have  been  around  get  together  and  fight  together,"  said  Scott  Jennings,  a  former  McConnell  aide  and  senior  adviser  to  Super  PAC  Kentuckians  for  Strong  Leadership."As  I  watch  him  move  around  the  country,  he's  incredibly  well  received,"  said  Ron  Kaufman,  a  veteran  Washington  lobbyist  and  former  adviser  to  GOP  presidential  nominee  Mitt  Romney  and  President  George  H.W.  Bush.  "He's  been  incredibly  skillful."Then,  last  year  came  what,  in  hindsight,  now  seems  Paul's  timely  13-hour  filibuster  on  the  perilous  possibilities  of  drone  strikes  on  Americans  in  their  own  country.  The  talk-a-thon  delayed  the  confirmation  of  John  Brennan  as  CIA  head  and  inspired  other  Republicans,  including  McConnell,  to  return  to  the  Senate  and  rally  to  his  aid."I  remember  calling  my  boss  Rep.  (Paul)  Gosar  to  ask  if  he  had  seen  what  was  taking  place  and  he  told  me  he  was  headed  to  join  Rand,"  said  Orlando  Watson,  a  former  Paul  staffer  who  now  is  the  communications  director  for  black  media  for  the  Republican  National  Committee.Friend  and  longtime  Paul  adviser  Trygve  Olson  put  it  this  way:  "People  hadn't  thought  about  drones  and  suddenly  a  guy  doing  a  'Mr.  Smith'  filibuster  on  this  captivated  people."Paul's  possible  pitfallsCaptivating  people  is  one  thing.  Winning  them  over  for  the  long  term  is  another  matter,  said  Alice  Stewart,  a  Republican  strategist  and  radio  host."Any  of  these  people  --  whether  it's  Ted  Cruz,  Chris  Christie,  or  Rand  Paul,  they  are  doing  well  in  the  polls  right  now,  but  it's  the  shiny  penny  effect,"  Stewart  said.  "It's  being  strong  when  we  get  to  Iowa,  New  Hampshire  and  South  Carolina  that  counts."If  he  makes  a  run  at  the  Republican  nomination  for  the  presidency  in  2016,  Paul's  ability  to  knit  together  a  coalition  of  diverse  views  will  really  be  put  to  the  test.  In  the  primaries  he'll  face  tough  questions  from  conservatives  on  his  non-interventionist  foreign  policy  views.Should  he  make  it  to  the  general  election,  he'll  likely  be  grilled  about  how  his  opposition  to  abortion  --  though  he  has  said  he  could  see  "thousands  of  exceptions"  --  reconciles  with  his  staunch  defense  of  personal  liberty."If  another  Republican  started  making  those  links  in  a  negative  way  then  it  could  be  a  problem,"  said  Jennifer  Duffy,  a  senior  editor  with  the  Cook  Political  Report.He'll  also  have  to  convince  big-dollar  donors  that  he's  more  than  just  a  momentary  cause  célèbre.He's  attempted  to  address  that  last  issue  by  such  trips  as  his  whirlwind  Silicon  Valley  tour  last  summer  meeting  with  technology  industry  heads  and  an  address  at  the  Ronald  Reagan  Presidential  Library."We  did  a  trip  to  Silicon  Valley  ...  with  some  Romney  donor-type  people.  We  did  a  meeting  at  Facebook  and  it  was  unclear  whether  we'd  meet  with  (Facebook  founder  Mark  Zuckerberg),"  said  Olson,  a  longtime  friend  who  now  works  with  the  American  Crossroads  Super  PAC.  Zuckerberg  "showed  up  and  said  'I  got  in  late  last  night  from  Europe  but  I  wanted  to  come  here  and  meet  you.'  "Paul  and  the  social  media  guru  hit  it  off."It  was  clear  the  two  smartest  guys  in  the  room  were  having  a  conversation  and  the  rest  of  us  were  just  there,"  Olson  said.  "They  would  have  gone  on  for  quite  a  while  longer  and  I  was  the  one  who  finally  ended  up  saying  we  need  to  get  over  to  (the  venue)  or  you're  going  to  miss  your  speech."As  for  his  ability  to  navigate  the  rarefied  air  of  high  powered  politics  and  mingle  with  ex-cons  in  Louisville,  Paul  said,  "I've  learned  a  lot  by  just  showing  up."Reaching  outDuring  that  June  visit  to  West  Louisville,  Paul  heard  from  frustrated  black  men  who  are  banned  from  volunteering  at  their  children's  schools  because  of  their  criminal  backgrounds  and  from  voting  after  completing  their  prison  terms  for  nonviolent  crimes.That  visit  would  later  help  inform  his  push  to  restore  felon  voting  rights  and  further  his  views  on  changing  mandatory  minimum  sentences  for  some  crimes  such  as  marijuana  possession  --  issues  that  disproportionately  impact  blacks  and  Hispanics."I  think  it  opens  doors  to  people  who  haven't  listened  to  Republicans,"  Paul  said  of  his  outreach.He  has  since  had  regular  conversations  with  the  president  of  a  local  historically  black  college  and  heads  of  charter  schools  in  African-American  neighborhoods.Since  he  left  the  community  center,  Paul  has  dispatched  a  staffer  who  set  up  a  mobile  office  with  hours  that  coincide  with  when  the  food  pantry  opens."No  one  has  been  here.  No  one  else  has  reached  out,"  French  said.  "People  aren't  knocking  down  our  door  to  ask  us  how  they  can  help."French  was  so  impressed  with  Paul  that,  when  he  heard  the  senator  was  in  Shelbyville,  Kentucky,  he  piled  into  his  car  and  drove  30  miles  just  to  see  the  lawmaker."One  of  the  things  I  was  impressed  about  is  in  the  short  run  there  isn't  going  to  be  a  lot  of  support  from  the  African-American  people  for  Rand  Paul,  so  I  give  him  a  lot  of  respect  for  doing  this  knowing  there's  not  going  to  be  a  rush  to  the  polls  for  him,"  French  said.But  that  type  of  outreach  just  might  pay  off  in  the  long  run,  Paul  said.All  it  takes  is  "time  and  sincerity,"  he  said.  "People  know  when  you're  genuine  as  opposed  to  showing  up  during  the  last  six  weeks  to  try  and  get  votes."</TEXT></DOC>

A  dismissal  of  the  charges  against  her  would  allow  her  to  reenter  the  United  States,  where  her  husband  and  two  daughters  reside,  said  her  attorney,  Daniel  Arshack.  A  hearing  is  set  for  January  31.A  motion  filed  in  federal  court  Tuesday  asked  that  the  case  be  thrown  out,  saying  the  court  "does  not  have  jurisdiction  over  the  Defendant  due  to  the  Defendant's  diplomatic  status  which  provides  her  absolute  immunity  from  criminal  prosecution  in  the  United  States."Because  Dr.  Khobragade  was  cloaked  in  diplomatic  immunity  at  the  time  of  her  arrest  on  December  12,  2013,  as  well  as  the  time  of  the  filing  of  the  subsequent  indictment  on  January  9,  2014  (on  which  she  was  not  re-arrested  or  arraigned),  she  cannot  be  prosecuted  thus  necessitating  a  dismissal  of  the  indictment  and  proceeding,"  the  motion  said.U.S.  prosecutors  accused  Khobragade  of  lying  in  a  visa  application  about  how  much  she  paid  her  housekeeper.  She  was  indicted  last  week  by  a  federal  grand  jury  on  one  count  of  visa  fraud  and  one  count  of  making  false  statements.The  Indian  government  denied  a  request  by  the  State  Department  to  waive  Khobragade's  diplomatic  immunity  so  she  can  answer  the  charges,  U.S.  and  Indian  officials  said.  The  immunity  was  granted  after  her  controversial  arrest.Khobragade  arrived  at  the  New  Delhi  airport  Friday,  according  to  an  Indian  official  who  was  not  authorized  to  speak  to  the  media.Khobragade  told  CNN,  through  an  intermediary,  that  the  charges  against  her  "are  false  and  baseless.""I  look  forward  to  demonstrating  that  to  all  of  you,"  she  said  through  the  intermediary.Khobragade  "affirmed  her  determination  to  ensure  that  the  episode  would  not  leave  a  lasting  impact  on  her  family,  in  particular,  her  children,  who  are  still  in  the  United  States,"  the  Indian  Ministry  of  External  Affairs  said.New  Delhi  is  demanding  that  Washington  apologize  and  have  the  charges  dropped.Amid  the  tensions  over  the  case,  the  United  States  announced  that  it  will  withdraw  one  official  from  its  embassy  in  New  Delhi.Federal  prosecutors  allege  Khobragade  promised  in  the  visa  application,  under  which  her  housekeeper  moved  from  India  to  the  United  States,  to  pay  her  at  least  the  minimum  wage  in  New  York,  and  to  require  she  work  no  more  than  40  hours  per  week.They  allege  that  Khobragade  then  had  the  housekeeper,  Sangeeta  Richard,  sign  a  second  contract,  which  set  her  pay  far  below  the  minimum  wage  and  required  that  she  work  much  longer  hours."I  would  like  to  tell  other  domestic  workers  who  are  suffering  as  I  did  --  you  have  rights  and  do  not  let  anyone  exploit  you,"  Richard  said  in  a  statement  released  Thursday.Mix  of  Cold  War  legacy  and  politics?Diplomatic  statusKhobragade's  lawyers  have  repeatedly  said  the  diplomat  is  not  guilty  and  is  entitled  to  diplomatic  immunity.Khobragade  "did  not  make  any  false  statements  and  she  paid  her  domestic  worker  what  she  was  entitled  to  be  paid,"  her  attorney  said.Richard  fled  the  diplomat's  home  last  summer,  and  Khobragade  started  legal  proceedings  against  her  and  her  husband  in  the  Indian  courts.  Richard  has  been  granted  permission  to  remain  in  the  United  States.Arshack,  Khobragade's  attorney,  said  the  diplomat  and  her  legal  team  were  pleased  that  the  State  Department  had  done  "the  right  thing"  Thursday  by  recognizing  her  diplomatic  status.U.S.  officials  had  previously  said  Khobragade  was  entitled  to  consular  immunity,  which  is  less  broad  than  diplomatic  immunity  and  covers  only  actions  carried  out  under  official  duties.Khobragade  was  India's  deputy  consul  general  for  political,  economic,  commercial  and  women's  affairs.  But  after  her  arrest,  Indian  officials  appointed  her  as  counselor  at  the  country's  permanent  mission  to  the  United  Nations  in  New  York.Through  that  post,  she  was  accorded  "the  privileges  and  immunities  of  a  diplomatic  envoy,"  the  ministry  said.Two  senior  U.S.  officials  said  that  the  State  Department  had  no  choice  but  to  grant  Khobragade  full  diplomatic  immunity  once  she  was  accredited  to  the  United  Nations  because  she  did  not  pose  a  national  security  threat,  which  is  the  only  reason  for  which,  in  very  rare  cases,  immunity  is  denied.When  India  refused  the  U.S.  request  to  waive  the  immunity  so  that  she  could  face  the  charges  against  her,  she  had  to  leave  the  country,  the  officials  said.Debate:  Arrest,  strip-search  of  Indian  diplomat  'barbaric?'Arrest  and  searchIndia  has  expressed  outrage  about  the  arrest  of  Khobragade,  who  was  handcuffed  and  strip-searched  by  federal  agents  on  December  12  after  a  complaint  filed  by  Richard.Some  observers  have  suggested  that  Indian  officials'  protests  and  repeated  demands  for  an  apology  are  driven  by  political  concerns.Secretary  of  State  John  Kerry  expressed  "regret"  about  the  situation  last  month,  but  stopped  short  of  saying  authorities  had  done  anything  wrong.U.S.  law  enforcement  officials  have  said  that  Khobragade's  strip  search  was  standard  procedure  and  that  she  received  a  number  of  privileges  not  usually  accorded  to  defendants.During  the  spat,  Indian  authorities  removed  concrete  barriers  from  outside  the  U.S.  Embassy  and  took  away  American  diplomats'  identification  cards.That  was  followed  recently  by  an  order  that  the  United  States  shut  down  "commercial  activities"  at  a  recreational  facility  at  the  U.S.  Embassy  in  New  Delhi.  The  U.S.  Embassy  should  halt  the  activities  at  the  property  by  Thursday,  an  Indian  external  affairs  official  said  last  week.  The  property  houses  a  bowling  alley,  swimming  pool  and  gym.READ:  U.S.  withdraws  official  from  its  embassy  in  New  DelhiREAD:  Did  India  overreact  to  diplomat's  arrest?CNN's  Jethro  Mullen  and  Harmeet  Shah  Singh  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Outrage  in  Kiev.  Bloodshed  in  Simferopol.Tuesday  saw  Russian  President  Vladimir  Putin  announce  the  annexation  of  Crimea,  two  days  after  voters  in  that  semiautonomous  territory  approved  a  hastily  called  referendum  on  separating  from  Ukraine.Putin  told  a  joint  session  of  Russia's  Parliament  that  the  nearly  97%  of  Crimean  residents  who  voted  to  join  Russia  over  the  weekend  was  "an  extremely  convincing  figure.""In  our  hearts,  we  know  Crimea  has  always  been  an  inalienable  part  of  Russia,"  he  said.Ukrainian  Prime  Minister  Arseniy  Yatsenyuk  called  it  "a  robbery  on  an  international  scale,"  one  that  Kiev  will  never  accept."One  country  has  come  and  temporarily  stolen  part  of  of  the  territory  of  an  independent  country,"  he  said.  "It  will  be  difficult  to  find  a  quick  resolution  to  this  problem,  but  Russia  is  now  isolated  by  the  whole  international  community."And  after  a  member  of  its  military  was  killed,  another  wounded  and  more  captured  when  masked  gunmen  seized  their  base  near  the  Crimean  regional  capital,  Simferopol,  Ukraine's  defense  ministry  authorized  its  forces  to  open  fire.Yatsenyuk  warned  that  the  crisis  was  shifting  "from  political  to  the  military  form,  and  the  blame  is  on  the  Russian  military."Crimea,  which  has  an  ethnic  Russian  majority,  has  long  been  a  semiautonomous  region  within  Ukraine.  It  has  had  its  own  Parliament,  but  the  Ukrainian  government  had  veto  power  over  its  actions.After  the  revolt  that  forced  pro-Russian  President  Viktor  Yanukovych  from  office  in  February,  Russian  troops  poured  into  the  Crimean  Peninsula,  effectively  cutting  it  off  in  support  of  a  pro-Russian  government  that  took  power  in  Simferopol.Putin  said  Tuesday  that  Russia  had  to  act  as  Ukraine's  new  government,  backed  by  the  United  States  and  European  powers,  prepared  "to  seize  the  state  through  terror  and  murders.""The  main  executors  of  this  were  nationalists,  Russia-phobes  and  anti-Semites,"  he  said.  "Those  people  define  what  is  happening  today  in  Ukraine."But  international  observers  have  said  Moscow  saw  its  chance  to  annex  a  strategic  territory,  one  that  was  transferred  to  Ukraine  in  the  Soviet  era  and  which  still  hosts  the  home  port  of  Russia's  Black  Sea  Fleet.Ukraine's  interim  President,  Oleksandr  Turchynov,  told  reporters  that  Putin  is  "mimicking  the  fascists  of  the  last  century"  by  annexing  Crimea."The  political  leadership  of  Russia  will  have  to  answer  before  the  whole  world  for  crimes  they  are  committing  today  in  our  country,"  Turchynov  said.Cameron:  Annexation  sends  'a  chilling  message'Putin  declared  Tuesday  that  "We  have  not  used  our  armed  forces  in  Crimea,"  despite  what  has  been  stated  by  international  observers  and  the  government  of  Kiev.  He  said  the  22,000  Russian  troops  in  Crimea  did  not  enter  during  the  current  crisis,  but  "were  already  there,"  in  accordance  with  previous  international  negotiations.Russian  forces  were  allowed  in  Crimea  under  a  treaty  that  allowed  the  Black  Sea  Fleet  to  be  based  there,  but  the  movements  of  its  forces  within  Crimea  are  supposed  to  be  agreed  upon  with  Kiev.Putin  praised  those  forces  for  avoiding  bloodshed,  but  the  tensions  appear  to  have  boiled  over  into  violence  Tuesday.Masked  gunmen  killed  a  member  of  Ukraine's  military,  wounded  another  and  arrested  the  remaining  staff  of  Ukraine's  military  topographic  and  navigation  directorate  at  Simferopol,  Defense  Ministry  spokesman  Vladislav  Seleznyov  told  CNN.After  that,  the  Defense  Ministry  authorized  its  forces  in  Crimea  to  use  weapons  "to  protect  and  preserve  the  life  of  Ukrainian  soldiers,"  according  to  a  statement  posted  on  its  website.Petro  Poroshenko,  a  Ukrainian  member  of  Parliament  and  former  foreign  minister,  said  Tuesday  that  his  country  stands  at  "the  beginning  of  a  very  dangerous  conflict,  and  we  should  do  our  best  to  stop  this  process.""Several  weeks  ago,  we  had  a  guarantee  that  nothing  [would]  happen  with  the  Crimea.  Several  weeks  ago  we  had  [a  situation]  that  there  is  not  any  military  presence  on  Ukrainian  territory,  including  the  Crimea,"  he  told  CNN's  "Amanpour  "  program.  Now,  he  said,  "I  strongly  believe  that  this  is  not  only  Ukrainian  territory  is  now  threatened.""Now  under  attack  can  be  any  country  in  the  European  Union,  including  other  parts  of  Ukraine,"  said  Poroshenko,  a  billionaire  and  leading  potential  candidate  for  president.  "That's  why  we  should  think  that  it  can  never  happen  again."U.S.  and  EU  officials  imposed  sanctions  on  more  than  two  dozen  Russian  and  Crimean  officials  Monday  and  have  urged  Russia  to  avoid  escalating  the  crisis,  but  Moscow  has  ignored  those  calls.Tuesday's  annexation  brought  a  new  round  of  condemnation  from  the  West,  with  British  Prime  Minister  David  Cameron  saying  it  sends  "a  chilling  message  across  the  continent  of  Europe.""It  is  completely  unacceptable  for  Russia  to  use  force  to  change  borders,  on  the  basis  of  a  sham  referendum  held  at  the  barrel  of  a  Russian  gun,"  Cameron  said  in  a  statement  issued  by  Downing  Street.  "President  Putin  should  be  in  no  doubt  that  Russia  will  face  more  serious  consequences,  and  I  will  push  European  leaders  to  agree  further  EU  measures  when  we  meet  on  Thursday."Russia  faces  'more  than  just  sanctions,'  Biden  saysThe  G7  group  of  industrialized  nations  had  already  suspended  preparations  for  a  planned  G8  summit  in  the  Russian  city  of  Sochi.  Now,  U.S.  President  Barack  Obama  has  invited  his  counterparts  from  the  other  G7  countries  and  the  European  Union  to  a  meeting  of  next  week  on  the  margins  of  a  nuclear  security  summit  in  The  Hague,  U.S.  National  Security  Council  spokeswoman  Caitlin  Hayden  said.The  planned  meeting  comes  amid  speculation  that  Russia  will  get  kicked  out  of  the  G8  --  which  comprises  the  G7  countries  plus  Russia  --  because  of  its  actions  in  Crimea.In  Washington,  U.S.  Secretary  of  State  John  Kerry  criticized  "this  rise  of  a  kind  of  nationalism  that  is  exercised  unilaterally,  to  the  exclusion  of  the  international  legal  process.""That's  what  we  have  worked  hard  to  avoid  ever  since  World  War  II,"  Kerry  said.  He  acknowledged  that  Russia  has  interests  in  Crimea  and  "an  enormous  historical  connection  to  Ukraine,"  but  said  he  was  "really  struck  and  somewhat  surprised  and  even  disappointed"  by  Putin's  case  for  annexing  the  territory."With  all  due  respect,  it  just  didn't  (jibe)  with  reality  or  what's  happening  on  the  ground,"  Kerry  said.  "The  President  may  have  his  version  of  history,  but  I  believe  that  he  and  Russia,  for  what  they  have  done,  are  on  the  wrong  side  of  history."German  Chancellor  Angela  Merkel  has  said  the  "so-called  referendum"  and  the  acceptance  of  Crimea  to  the  Russian  Federation  "goes  against  international  law,"  while  French  Foreign  Minister  Laurent  Fabius  and  a  French  delegation  have  postponed  a  planned  visit  to  Moscow  because  of  the  Ukrainian  situation,  the  Russian  Foreign  Ministry  said.And  U.S.  Vice  President  Joe  Biden,  dispatched  to  reassure  NATO  allies  in  Eastern  Europe,  said  Russia  faces  "more  than  just  sanctions"  unless  it  abandons  its  "land  grab"  in  Crimea."We're  talking  about  Russia  putting  itself  on  a  path  that  undermines  long-term  confidence  and  creates  obstacles  for  its  full  participation  in  the  global  economy,"  Biden  said  after  talks  in  Poland's  capital,  Warsaw.  "That  path  that  they've  placed  themselves  on  does  nothing  to  help  the  next  generation  of  Russians  compete  and  succeed  in  a  world  that  will  be  led  by  the  most  dynamic  and  open  economies."Condemnation  abroad,  cheers  at  homeBut  lawmakers  in  Moscow  met  Putin's  address  with  regular  and  enthusiastic  applause.  The  Russian  leader  accused  the  West  of  "double  standards"  and  cynicism  in  its  response  to  the  Crimean  crisis,  citing  Kosovo  --  which  split  from  Russia's  historical  ally  Serbia  over  fierce  objections  from  Belgrade  --  as  a  precedent."It's  absolutely  in  favor  of  their  own  interests  --  black  today,  white  tomorrow,"  he  said.Russia's  Parliament  is  expected  to  vote  on  ratifying  Crimea's  accession  to  the  Russian  Federation  by  the  end  of  the  week.  The  speaker  of  Russia's  upper  house  of  Parliament,  Valentina  Matvineko,  told  state-run  Russia-24  TV  that  the  process  of  adding  a  new  member  to  the  Russian  Federation  "can  be  done  rather  promptly."And  hours  after  the  annexation  announcement,  Putin  appeared  at  a  huge  celebration  on  Red  Square  organized  by  his  supporters  --  a  sign  of  his  widespread  popularity  at  home.  An  opinion  poll  by  the  Moscow-based  Levada  Center  puts  his  approval  rating  at  72%  --  the  highest  in  more  than  three  years,  and  the  second-highest  point  of  his  presidency.  The  highest  point  came  in  2008,  during  Russia's  conflict  with  Georgia,  another  former  Soviet  republic."Putin  in  many  senses,  on  many  levels,  crystallizes  the  Russian  national  consciousness,"  biographer  Alexander  Korobko  told  CNN.  "For  the  past  100  years  perhaps,  we  have  never  had  a  leader  who  would  appeal  to  the  Russian  soul  ...  as  much  as  Putin."Most  Russians  and  Crimeans  feel  Crimea  "is  coming  back  home,"  and  a  country  that  can  produce  "pretty  much  anything"  has  little  fear  of  sanctions,  he  said."It  is  absolutely  not  in  the  U.S.  interest  to  impose  sanctions  on  Russia,  because  who  will  take  American  astronauts  to  space  if  not  us  Russians?"  Korobko  asked.Crimea's  vote:  Was  it  legal?Opinion:  Obama  can't  have  it  both  ways  on  CrimeaWest's  sanctions  on  Russia:  Are  they  just  for  show?Opinion:  Putin  won't  stop  at  CrimeaCNN's  Alla  Eshchenko  reported  from  Moscow  and  Matt  Smith  wrote  in  Atlanta.

Brown  is  a  professor  of  Law  at  Emory  University  School  of  Law,  and  author  of  "Critical  Race  Theory:  Cases,  Materials,  and  Problems."(CNN)  --  On  Sunday  night  "12  Years  a  Slave"  took  the  Oscar  for  best  picture.  The  film  is  must-watch  cinema  because  it  depicts  the  horrors  of  slavery  through  the  eyes  of  a  slave.  Solomon  Northop  did  all  of  humanity  a  favor  when  he  wrote  his  book  more  than  150  years  ago,  and  director  Steve  McQueen  and  producer  Brad  Pitt  have  earned  our  gratitude  for  turning  his  story  into  a  transformative  movie.Through  it,  viewers  confront  the  horror  of  slavery,  see  the  tearing  of  raw  flesh  from  whipping,  the  rapes,  the  complete  lack  of  privacy  that  slaves  experienced.  We  see  depicted  the  system  that  was  designed  to  destroy  human  beings'  free  will  during  a  shameful  period  of  our  nation's  history.That  was  then,  this  is  now.  The  good  news  is  that  slavery  was  repealed  by  the  13th  Amendment  and  whites  can  no  longer  own  blacks.  The  bad  news  is  the  troubling  way  that  too  many  Americans  talk  about  slavery  in  the  21st  century  --  or  more  accurately  do  not  talk  about  slavery.Which  brings  us  to  Paula  Deen.  The  celebrity  chef  and  TV  host,  whose  food  empire  tumbled  over,  among  other  things,  her  use  of  a  racial  epithet,  has  found  $75  million  in  backing  from  a  private-equity  company  and  is  trying  to  make  a  comeback.  She's  also  opening  a  restaurant  in  Pigeon  Forge,  Tennessee.My  first  thought  on  hearing  this  was  "Thank  God  it's  not  in  my  adopted  city  of  Atlanta,  Georgia."  But  then  I  got  very  angry  --  angry  that  I  live  in  a  country  where  someone  who  thinks  like  Deen  can  get  a  $75-million  vote  of  confidence.  Seriously?!I  am  not  angry  that  in  a  deposition  last  year  Deen  admitted  to  using  the  N  word.  It  is  unfair  to  judge  her  based  on  only  this,  because  no  one  is  at  his  or  her  best  during  a  deposition.  No,  I  am  angry  because  her  views  on  race  when  she  is  in  a  more  relaxed  environment  --  not  under  pressure,  with  plenty  of  time  to  think  and  choose  her  words  --  are  so  wrongheaded  that  they  require  an  apology.  Now  I  fear  that  she  has  $75  million  reasons  to  never  look  back.Paula  Deen  was  interviewed  by  New  York  Times  reporter  Kim  Severson  in  the  fall  of  2012.  The  interview  was  before  a  live  audience  and  was  recorded.  Severson  asked:  "Do  you  have  a  pride  about  the  South  that  you  can  articulate  and  how  do  you  place  the  racism  and  the  slavery  within  that?"Deen's  response:  "I  do.  It's  funny.  My  great  grandfather  was  so  devastated.  The  war  was  over.  He  had  lost  his  son,  he  had  lost  the  war  and  he  didn't  know  how  to  deal  with  life,  with  no  one  to  help  operate  his  plantation.  There  were  30  something  people  on  his  books  and  the  next  year's  Census  I  go  to  find  there's  like  zero.  Between  the  death  of  his  son  and  losing  all  the  workers,  he  went  out  I'm  sure  into  the  barn  and  he  shot  himself  because  he  couldn't  deal  with  those  kind  of  changes.  And  they  were  terrific  changes.  I  feel  like  the  South  is  almost  less  prejudiced  because  black  folks  played  such  an  integral  part  in  our  lives.  They  were  like  our  family."Let's  acknowledge  that  it's  sad  when  anyone  takes  his  own  life.  But  listen  carefully  to  Deen's  language.  Never  once  does  she  mention  slavery.  Her  great  grandfather  doesn't  own  slaves  --  he  has  "workers"  or  "people  on  his  books."  He  had  no  one  to  "help"  operate  his  plantation.  Is  that  what  we're  calling  slave  labor  these  days?According  to  Deen,  whites  in  the  South  treated  their  slaves  like  "family."  Let's  travel  back  in  time  and  ask,  say,  a  man  who  might  have  been  the  Solomon  Northop  equivalent  in  her  grandfather's  plantation.  We  do  not  know  how  Paula  Deen's  forebears  treated  their  slaves,  but  do  you  think  a  slave  on  that  plantation  would  say  he  was  treated  like  one  of  the  family?  Let's  not  forget  that  if  he  did  tell  truth,  he  could  be  punished  or  even  killed  for  doing  so.Only  in  Deen's  altered  universe  could  she  think  slaves  were  treated  like  family.  She  also  tells  us  that  Southerners  are  less  prejudiced  because  of  those  very  circumstances.  Who  knew  that  descendants  of  slave  owners  were  less  prejudiced  ...  because  their  relatives  owned  slaves?What  anyone  who  has  seen  "12  Years  a  Slave"  knows  (if  they  didn't  know  it  before)  is  that  slavery  was  brutal  and  cruel.  Somehow  Deen  cannot  bring  herself  to  even  use  the  word,  all  the  while  taking  credit  for  having  slave  owning  relatives  because  that  fact  makes  her  and  the  rest  of  the  South  less  prejudiced.Listen  to  Deen's  words  during  the  New  York  Times  interview  and  you  actually  learn  what  her  views  on  race  are.  For  that  she  should  apologize  and  lean  in  to  the  21st  century.  Until  she  does,  she  is  not  worthy  of  a  second  chance.Follow  us  on  Twitter:  @CNNOpinionJoin  us  at  Facebook/CNNOpinionThe  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Dorothy  A.

Lindsey  Graham  and  Newt  Gingrich  say  the  U.S.  should  approve  military  aid  to  Ukraine  and  grant  natural  gas  export  requests</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Sen.  Lindsey  Graham  is  a  Republican  from  South  Carolina.  Newt  Gingrich  is  a  co-host  of  CNN's  "Crossfire,"  which  airs  at  6:30  p.m.  ET  weekdays.  A  former  speaker  of  the  House,  he  was  a  candidate  in  the  2012  Republican  presidential  primaries.(CNN)  --  America's  response  to  the  most  dangerous  security  crisis  Europe  has  faced  in  decades  has  been  all  speeches  and  symbolism  with  no  actions  of  substance.On  Wednesday,  President  Barack  Obama  hosted  Arseniy  Yatsenyuk,  the  new  interim  Ukrainian  Prime  Minister,  for  lunch  at  the  White  House,  supposedly  a  thumb  in  the  eye  of  Russian  President  Vladimir  Putin  and  a  sign  of  America's  commitment  to  Ukrainian  sovereignty.On  Thursday,  Secretary  of  State  John  Kerry  announced  that  the  U.S.  will  take  "very  serious"  steps  if  Russia  does  not  back  down  by  Monday  from  its  attempt  to  annex  Crimea.But  while  the  White  House  was  serving  lunch  and  the  State  Department  was  issuing  stern  warnings,  the  President  was  also  refusing  to  lift  a  finger  to  actually  deter  Putin's  aggression.  According  to  The  Wall  Street  Journal,  the  Obama  administration,  "wary  of  inflaming  tensions  with  Russia,"  has  refused  to  act  on  Ukraine's  emergency  request  for  military  aid,  including  arms  and  ammunition,  except  to  send  military  rations.Officials  in  Kiev  estimate  that  Putin  has  amassed  80,000  Russian  troops  on  the  Ukrainian  border,  and  we  are  worried  about  "inflaming  tensions"?  When  will  the  administration  put  its  might  where  its  mouth  is:  When  Kiev  is  in  flames?  Or  never?As  for  Yatsenyuk,  whose  visit  symbolized  our  solidarity,  well  Obama  hopes  you  had  a  nice  dessert,  because  we're  not  going  to  give  your  country  the  weapons  it  needs  to  defend  itself.Theodore  Roosevelt  is  famous  for  a  foreign  policy  he  summarized  as  "speak  softly  and  carry  a  big  stick."  Obama's  foreign  policy  is  closer  to  "scream  loudly  and  carry  no  stick."It's  no  wonder  Putin  has  concluded  that  he's  unlikely  to  face  serious  consequences  for  his  imperial  adventure.  The  U.S.  did  nothing  when  he  invaded  Georgia  in  2008.  More  recently,  we  did  nothing  after  the  Syrian  regime  violated  the  "red  line"  Obama  had  established  regarding  the  use  of  chemical  weapons  there.  (Recall  Kerry's  offhand  reference  to  inspections  became  the  pretext  a  day  later  for  backing  off  the  pledge.)Putin  doesn't  take  the  words  of  Obama  or  Kerry  seriously  because  their  words  aren't  serious.  The  speeches  are  gestures  --  much  like  the  President's  Wednesday  luncheon  --  and  their  relationship  to  action  is  nonexistent,  as  the  administration's  refusal  of  Ukraine's  aid  request  makes  quite  clear.The  fact  is  anything  short  of  providing  arms  and  intelligence  to  the  sovereign  Ukrainian  government  is  unlikely  to  deter  Putin.  Clearly,  we  do  not  need  American  boots  on  the  ground  in  Ukraine,  a  step  we  would  both  oppose.  But  if  the  U.S.  wants  to  stop  Russia's  dangerous  incursion  into  Eastern  Europe,  we  have  to  raise  the  cost.  Not  just  talk  about  potentially  raising  the  cost  at  some  point  in  the  future  once  Russia  has  swallowed  half  of  Ukraine  and  stationed  tens  of  thousands  of  troops  there.Unless  the  President  is  willing  to  back  up  his  words  with  military  aid,  he's  not  serious  about  stopping  Putin's  armed  aggression.In  addition,  the  President  should  immediately  issue  an  executive  order  approving  the  export  of  American  natural  gas  to  20  countries  that  are  awaiting  bureaucratic  approval.  The  highest  priority  should  go  to  approving  exports  to  Europe,  where  in  many  places,  Russia  has  a  near-monopoly  on  natural  gas.Furthermore,  the  President  should  issue  an  executive  order  approving  24  pending  liquefied  natural  gas  facilities  that  have  been  delayed  by  bureaucratic  red  tape.This  would  be  a  serious  blow  to  the  Russian  economy  that  would  impose  a  real  cost  on  Putin's  foray  into  Ukraine.  National  emergencies  justify  actions  that  would  not  be  taken  in  quiet  times.  A  Russian  invasion  of  Ukraine  will  create  conditions  that  the  President  himself  in  his  first  executive  order  about  sanctions  called  a  national  emergency.No  one  should  doubt  the  seriousness  of  the  events  in  Eastern  Europe.Russia  is  threatening  to  forcibly  take  over  the  territory  of  a  sovereign  state.  Taking  over  Crimea,  which  was  historically  Russian  and  has  a  substantial  Russian  majority,  has  already  been  described  by  Obama  and  Kerry  as  unacceptable  and  very  dangerous.  Russian  occupation  of  the  rest  of  Ukraine  would  be  a  vastly  more  threatening  and  more  aggressive  action.The  situation  calls  for  more  than  talk.  If  Putin  discovers  that  once  again  the  West  will  do  nothing  to  stop  his  aggression,  he  might  be  reckless  enough  to  test  our  resolve  in  Latvia,  Lithuania  or  Estonia  --  NATO  members  that  we  are  bound  to  protect  with  military  force.  Trouble  there  could  "reset"  us  right  back  to  direct  warfare  with  Russia.  That  would  be  a  disaster  and  very,  very  dangerous.It's  past  time  for  the  United  States  to  help  Ukraine.Indeed,  passivity  is  the  path  most  likely  to  lead  to  war.  The  Obama  administration  should  grant  the  request  for  military  aid  immediately  --  before  it's  too  late  for  deterrence.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  the  authors.</TEXT></DOC>

In  fact,  about  one  in  five  American  adults  are  sleep  deprived.The  rumor:  Sleep  deprivation  is  harmful  and  can  even  be  life-threateningIf  you've  ever  come  close  to  nodding  off  in  the  boardroom  or  behind  the  wheel,  you  know  that  the  effects  of  sleep  deprivation  can  range  from  embarrassing  to  downright  terrifying.  But  are  we  really  putting  ourselves  and  others  at  risk,  however  inadvertently?  And  if  we  are  sleep  deprived,  how  do  we  fix  it?upwave:  14  tips  for  better  sleepThe  verdict:  Sleep  deprivation  really  is  dangerous  for  your  body  and  mindI  hate  to  break  it  to  you,  but  sleep  deprivation  really  can  be  life-threatening."Sleep  deprivation  is  the  single  most  dangerous  aspect  of  any  sleep  disorder,  because  you  have  no  idea  that  you  are  compromised  cognitively,  physically  and  emotionally,"  says  sleep  expert  and  upwave  reviewer  Michael  Breus.Sleep  deprivation  affects  three  distinct  areas  of  life.  The  first,  and  probably  most  life-threatening,  is  reaction  time.  People  who  operate  heavy  equipment  or  drive  any  kind  of  vehicle  are  likely  to  have  dulled  reaction  times  when  sleep-deprived,  making  them  more  prone  to  accidents.  In  fact,  recent  research  has  found  drowsy  driving  to  be  just  as  risky  as  drunk  driving.  So  you  might  want  to  think  twice  before  staying  up  late  to  catch  the  end  of  that  football  game.upwave:  How  to  fall  asleep  fasterCognition  --  how  we  think,  retain  memories,  process  information  and  make  decisions  --  is  also  negatively  impacted  by  sleep  deprivation.  "It's  easy  to  miss  a  fine  detail  when  sleep-deprived,"  explains  Breus.  "We  often  don't  put  information  together  correctly."  This  may  not  seem  like  a  big  deal...  until  you  mess  up  that  major  report  for  your  boss,  or  forget  what  time  your  flight  home  is!Emotions  are  also  greatly  heightened  by  lack  of  quality  sleep,  says  Breus.  Everything  from  anger  to  sadness  to  frustration  all  get  blown  out  of  proportion,  making  a  potentially  bad  situation  that  much  worse.So,  what  can  you  do  to  fix  the  problem?  Well,  you  could  just  try  going  to  bed  earlier.  But  a  late  bedtime  is  hardly  the  only  cause  of  sleep  deprivation.  Others  include  stress,  environmental  factors  (a  snoring  spouse;  an  excessively  warm  bedroom)  and  poor  diet  (heartburn;  excessive  alcohol;  too  much  caffeine).upwave:  Is  sleeping  separately  better  for  some  couples?Also,  there's  no  one  "ideal"  amount  of  sleep.  Some  people  function  just  fine  on  seven  hours,  whereas  others  (like  me)  need  a  heftier  nine.  "The  minimum  number  of  hours  is  six,"  says  Breus.  "Anything  less  is,  in  all  likelihood,  sleep  deprivation."To  identify  your  ideal  time  for  lights-out,  Breus  suggests  counting  backwards  about  seven  and  a  half  hours  from  your  required  wake-up  time.  "If  you  wake  up  five  minutes  before  your  alarm  goes  off,  you've  nailed  it,"  he  says.  By  the  same  token,  if  you  rise  feeling  refreshed,  you're  right  on  the  money.  If  not,  you're  probably  sleep-deprived,  which  can  lead  to  those  cognitive,  reaction  and  emotional  issues  we've  discussed.upwave:  How  to  sleep  7.5  hours  a  nightI  know  that  sleep  often  seems  negotiable,  but  our  bodies  and  minds  really  need  the  consistency  of  a  quality  night's  rest  to  prepare  and  reboot  for  the  coming  day.So  take  an  honest  look  at  your  sleep  hygeine.  Chances  are,  you  can  make  a  few  changes  to  get  more  sleep.  Of  course,  if  problems  persist,  you  may  want  to  consult  your  doctor.  We  all  need  to  be  at  our  thinking,  feeling  and  reactive  best  in  order  to  thrive  and  stay  safe.  In  most  cases,  a  little  extra  shut-eye  will  get  you  there!  Sleep  tight!This  article  was  originally  published  on  upwave.com.©  2013  upwave,  All  Rights  Reserved.</TEXT></DOC>

You  bring  in  the  robot  cops.In  Kinshasa,  the  sprawling  capital  of  the  Democratic  Republic  of  Congo,  two  humanoid  robots  have  been  installed  in  high-traffic  areas  to  regulate  the  flow  of  vehicles  and  help  drivers  and  pedestrians  traverse  the  roads  safely.Read  this:  The  daily  grind  of  commuting  in  Africa's  economic  hubsThe  goal  is  to  ease  the  traffic  woes  of  commuters  and  cut  the  number  of  road  accidents  in  the  center  of  Kinshasa,  a  city  of  some  10  million  people."It  is  an  innovation  about  road  safety,"  Vale  Manga  Wilma,  president  of  the  DRC's  National  Commission  for  Road  Safety  (Commission  Nationale  de  Prevention  Routiere),  told  CNN."The  traffic  is  a  big  problem  in  the  rush  hours,"  he  explained.  "With  the  robots'  policemen  intelligence,  the  road  safety  in  Kinshasa  becomes  very  easy."Read  this:  Megacity's  ambitious  plansStanding  eight  feet  tall,  the  robot  traffic  wardens  are  on  duty  24  hours  a  day,  their  towering  --  even  scarecrow-like  --  mass  visible  from  afar.  They  are  powered  by  solar  panels  and  are  equipped  with  rotating  chests  and  surveillance  cameras  that  record  the  flow  of  vehicles.The  humanoids,  which  are  installed  on  Kinshasa's  busy  Triomphal  and  Lumumba  intersections,  are  built  of  aluminum  and  stainless  steel  to  endure  the  city's  year-round  hot  climate.Featuring  green  and  red  lights,  Kinshasa's  robot  cops  are  designed  to  merge  some  of  the  functions  of  human  officers  and  traffic  lights.  The  anthropomorphic  robots  can  raise  or  bend  their  arms  to  stop  passing  vehicles  or  let  others  pass,  and  are  also  programmed  to  speak,  indicating  to  pedestrians  when  they  can  cross  the  road.Manga  Wilma  said  that  this  is  a  DRC-made  technology,  designed  and  built  by  a  team  of  local  engineers  called  WITECH  ONG.READ  MORE:  Africa's  'new  cities'  -  Urban  future  or  utopian  fantasies?READ  MORE:  Africa's  giant  infrastructure  projects</TEXT></DOC>

He  serves  on  the  boards  or  consults  with  companies  in  the  energy  field.  The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  the  author.(CNN)  --  "Nothing  poses  a  bigger  threat  to  our  water,  our  livelihood  and  our  quality  of  life  than  a  warming  climate."  Those  are  my  words  from  2006  upon  the  signing  of  an  executive  order  on  climate  change  for  New  Mexico  when  I  was  governor.Almost  a  decade  later,  this  statement  still  holds  true.  But  now  we  have  even  more  information  about  climate  change,  both  the  risks  and  solutions.The  just-released  report  by  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC),  a  collection  of  more  than  800  leading  climate  scientists,  reaffirms  that  climate  impacts  are  already  occurring  and  having  a  dramatic  impact  on  society.  Climate  change  is  driven  by  our  dependence  on  fossil  fuels  and  is  expected  to  get  worse.  In  order  to  shift  directions,  we  need  nothing  less  than  to  rethink  how  we  power  our  country.Here's  what  we  know:The  climate  science  is  settled.  The  IPCC  report  is  the  latest  addition  to  a  staggering  body  of  scientific  research  connecting  our  energy  choices  to  costly  climate  disruption.  The  report  is  consistent  with  several  other  authorities  --  such  as  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences,  U.S.  Global  Change  Research  Program,  and  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  --  that  bring  stronger  language  and  greater  certainty  about  climate  change  and  its  risks.  Just  as  we  know  that  smoking  causes  cancer,  we  understand  that  human  activity  causes  climate  change.Climate  change  is  happening  now  and  we  are  all  feeling  the  effects.  Earlier  this  month,  the  American  Association  of  Advancement  of  Science  reminded  us  that  "climate  change  is  happening  here  and  now."We  are  now  witnessing  how  it  is  changing  our  world:  The  past  winter  was  the  eighth-warmest  on  record.  For  348  consecutive  months  --  29  years  --  global  temperatures  have  been  above  average.The  latest  IPCC  report  finds  that  impacts  from  climate  change  are  "widespread  and  consequential"  and  they  are  being  felt  on  every  continent  and  in  our  oceans.  The  world  last  year  experienced  41  weather-related  disasters  that  caused  damages  totaling  at  least  $1  billion.  Over  the  past  decade,  the  western  United  States  experienced  seven  times  more  large-scale  wildfires  than  it  did  in  the  1970s.  Climate  change  has  made  it  much  more  likely  that  we  will  suffer  severe  droughts  like  the  one  that  recently  swept  across  Texas  and  my  home  state  of  New  Mexico.Finally,  without  action,  things  will  get  a  lot  worse.  As  climate  impacts  mount,  they  will  bring  more  damage  to  our  economy  and  communities.  Even  1  degree  Celsius  (1.8  degrees  Fahrenheit)  of  global  temperature  rise  could  cut  yields  of  crops  like  wheat,  rice  and  corn,  driving  up  food  prices.  Unless  greenhouse  gases  are  reined  in,  many  more  people  will  be  at  risk  from  devastating  flooding,  similar  to  what  residents  faced  in  Boulder,  Colorado,  last  year.  Overall,  economic  losses  from  climate  change  will  cause  a  significant  blow  to  the  global  economy,  even  at  the  lower  end  of  climate  projections.So  what  can  we  do  in  the  face  of  a  changing  climate?Fortunately,  local  leaders,  including  mayors  and  governors,  are  responding  to  climate  impacts  and  building  more  resilient  communities.  For  example,  city  officials  from  Chicago  to  Miami  are  taking  steps  to  reduce  urban  flooding  with  permeable  pavement,  dampen  extreme  heat  with  green  roofs,  and  redesign  levies  to  withstand  stronger  storm  surges.At  the  federal  level,  the  Obama  administration  has  called  for  additional  funding  for  climate  resilience  and  just  unveiled  a  climate  data  initiative  to  arm  communities  with  better  information  about  climate  change.Opinion:  Climate  change  could  cost  more  than  $100  billion  a  yearBut,  it's  clear  that  we  need  to  do  more.  According  to  the  IPCC,  by  significantly  reducing  emissions  we  can  avoid  the  worst  consequences  of  climate  change  and  cut  economic  damages  by  half.We're  making  progress  already.  Americans  are  embracing  clean  energy,  buying  solar  panels  at  a  record  pace  as  the  price  has  plummeted  by  80%  in  just  four  years.  Many  large  companies,  like  Apple,  Google  and  Walmart,  are  investing  heavily  in  renewable  energy.  Even  ExxonMobil  is  among  dozens  of  U.S.  businesses  now  operating  with  an  internal  price  on  carbon.And  important  new  emissions  standards  are  coming.  Under  the  U.S.  Climate  Action  Plan  the  president  announced  last  year,  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  is  moving  ahead  with  standards  to  reduce  carbon  pollution  from  existing  coal-fired  power  plants  --  the  largest  source  of  U.S.  emissions.  These  rules  are  the  most  significant  opportunity  to  cut  U.S.  emissions  in  the  near  term  and  will  help  the  country  play  a  leadership  role  in  the  run-up  to  a  universal  climate  agreement  in  2015.The  science  tells  us  that  much  deeper  reductions  are  needed  in  the  decades  ahead.  Ultimately,  a  national  price  on  carbon  would  be  the  most  effective  way  to  expedite  a  transition  to  a  safer,  low-carbon  future.The  evidence  is  overwhelming:  Further  inaction  guarantees  disaster.  Alternately,  we  can  re-balance  our  energy  mix  and  rise  to  the  challenge  of  the  21st  century.  Let's  hope  that  a  decade  from  now  we  will  look  back  with  confidence  that  we  stood  up  to  the  global  climate  crisis.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinion.</TEXT></DOC>

Seinfeld's  initial  response  was  "It  really  pisses  me  off.""People  think  [comedy]  is  the  census  or  something,  it's  gotta  represent  the  actual  pie  chart  of  America,"  he  said.  "Who  cares?"With  his  Super  Bowl  commercial,  Seinfeld  is  back  on  the  radar,  but  his  comments  come  at  the  same  time  as  debate  about  diversity  in  comedy.  "Saturday  Night  Live"  hired  its  first  black  female  cast  member  in  years  after  an  outcry  over  the  show's  lack  of  diversity.Gawker  writer  Kyle  Chayka  writes  that  by  Seinfeld  saying,  "I  have  no  interest  in  gender  or  race  or  anything  like  that,"  the  comic  "seems  to  suggest  that  any  comedian  who  is  not  a  white  male  is  also  not  funny,  though  he's  also  likely  fed  up  with  the  amount  of  bad  comedy  he's  been  forced  to  sit  through  in  his  (waning)  career.""Which  is  too  bad,  because  Seinfeld  is  downplaying  the  work  of  everyone  from  Richard  Pryor  and  Bill  Cosby  to  Aziz  Ansari,  Mindy  Kaling,  and  Eddie  Huang,  who  are  all  in  various  stages  of  their  own  sitcoms  that  just  might  turn  out  to  be  the  next  'Seinfeld,'  "  Chayka  writes.It's  not  the  first  time  Seinfeld  has  faced  criticism  regarding  racial  issues.When  his  hit  NBC  series  "Seinfeld"  ended  in  1998,  the  Los  Angeles  Times  had  a  feature  about  how  it  was  a  "nonevent"  for  many  in  the  black  community  because  it  had  never  seemed  to  capture  the  black  audience  because  of  a  perceived  lack  of  diversity."Observers  said  that  the  lack  of  'Seinfeld'  fever  among  blacks  is  mainly  attributable  to  the  almost  total  absence  of  minority  characters  on  the  New  York-based  sitcom,"  reported  Los  Angeles  Times  writer  Greg  Braxton.  "Some  supporting  characters  --  including  an  attorney  modeled  after  defense  lawyer  Johnnie  L.  Cochran  Jr.  --  have  been  featured  in  the  last  few  seasons,  but  many  said  the  show  is  still  seen  as  a  program  that  excludes  minorities."</TEXT></DOC>

But  the  savvy  frequent  travelers  of  FlyerTalk  have  made  their  preferences  known.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Which  airline,  hotel  and  rental  car  rewards  programs  are  worth  your  while?  With  all  the  mergers  and  changes  in  the  travel  industry,  it's  nearly  impossible  for  the  occasional  traveler  to  know.The  2014  FlyerTalk  Awards  highlight  companies  that  still  impress  the  road  warriors  of  the  sky.FlyerTalk's  online  veterans  know  the  pros  and  cons  of  nearly  every  aspect  of  travel,  including  the  coveted  perks  of  loyalty  programs.  That  information  is  especially  valuable  as  many  reward  programs  make  it  harder  to  reap  their  benefits.  Delta  Air  Lines'  plan  to  award  dollars  spent  rather  than  miles  flown  is  the  latest  move  in  that  direction.While  there  are  many  industry  awards  for  best  travel  loyalty  programs,  "users  of  these  travel  services  are  better  judges  of  the  services  than  the  industry,"  says  Brent  Conver,  general  manager  of  FlyerTalk.Thousands  of  registered  FlyerTalk  members  nominated  their  favorite  programs  in  December  and  voted  for  the  winners,  which  are  being  announced  Wednesday.  Here  are  their  picks  for  best  overall  airline,  hotel  and  rental  car  programs  and  best  specific  program  benefits  around  the  world.Best  overall  rewards  programsAmerican  Airlines  AAdvantage  won  for  top  airline  affinity  program  in  the  Americas,  with  United  Airlines  coming  in  second  place.  Starwood's  Preferred  Guest  program  edged  out  Hilton  HHonors  in  the  hotel  category.  And  Hertz  Gold  Plus  Rewards  took  the  rental  car  honors.Frequent  travelers  want  to  turn  their  airline  and  hotel  points  into  more  travel  easily."People  who  are  big  fans  of  American  say  they  have  the  best  award  availability,  and  they  love  that  Starwood  allows  its  points  to  be  transferred  to  different  airline  programs,"  he  says.  They  also  love  Starwood's  flexibility  (in)  allowing  travelers  to  use  a  combination  of  points  and  cash  to  book  rooms.In  the  Europe/Africa  category,  British  Airways  Executive  Club  was  voted  top  airline  affinity  program.  Starwood  Preferred  Guest  and  Hertz  Gold  Plus  Rewards  both  came  in  first  place  in  this  region,  as  well.Hertz  --  which  collected  several  FlyerTalk  awards  --  also  spends  a  lot  of  time  thinking  about  their  elite  travelers,  and  it  shows  up  in  their  fan  base  at  FlyerTalk,  says  Conver.In  the  Middle  East/Asia/Oceania  region,  India's  Jet  Airways  JetPrivilege  was  the  surprise  winner  in  the  airline  affinity  program,  upsetting  the  winner  for  the  last  two  years,  Cathay  Pacific's  Asia  Miles.  Taj  Hotels  Resorts  and  Palaces'  InnerCircle  took  top  hotel  honors.  And  no  surprise  in  the  rental  car  category:  Hertz  swept  all  three  regions  with  its  Gold  Plus  Rewards.Best  travel  reward  program  benefit  (Americas)FlyerTalk's  American  Airlines  AAdvantage  members  love  their  Executive  Platinum  member  upgrades.  Members  get  eight  free  one-way  upgrades  systemwide  upon  qualification  or  re-qualification  of  elite  status.In  the  hotel  benefit  race,  the  love  that  Marriott  Rewards  members  have  for  the  Concierge  Lounge  dominates.  Their  club  lounges  in  the  United  States  offer  free  food  and  drink  and  a  dedicated  concierge.And  once  again,  Hertz  Gold  Plus  Rewards'  Gold  service  wins  in  the  rental  car  benefit  category.  While  Gold  service  is  a  package  of  upgrades  including  faster  reservations,  a  speedy  vehicle  pick  up  process  and  VIP  treatment,  it's  packaged  together  and  treated  as  a  single  benefit.Best  travel  reward  program  benefit  (Europe/Africa)In  the  airline  awards  category,  British  Airways  Executive  Club  members  love  their  Avios  upgrades.  British  Airways  uses  distance-based  award  charts,  which  allows  travelers  to  trade  in  fewer  miles  (called  Avios  at  the  airline)  for  short  trips,  says  Conver.  "British  Airways  spends  a  lot  of  time  working  with  their  elite  travelers,  and  they  have  a  fan  base,"  he  says.Travelers  love  their  Hilton  HHonors  Executive  lounge  access,  naming  it  the  best  hotel  benefit  in  Europe  and  Africa.  The  lounges  offer  free  food  and  drink,  and  none  of  the  lounges  are  exactly  alike.Hertz  Gold  Plus  Rewards  program  wins  again  in  this  category  for  giving  members  points  toward  free  rentals  or  exchange  for  other  programs'  miles  or  points.Best  travel  reward  program  benefit  (Middle  East/Asia/Oceania)Members  of  Jet  Airways  JetPrivilege  say  that  program's  top  perk  allows  them  to  pay  cash  for  domestic  award  ticket  upgrades.  Hotel  guests  voted  Taj  Hotels  Resorts  and  Palaces  InnerCircle's  room  upgrades  the  top  benefit.  FlyerTalk  members  didn't  nominate  any  car  rental  benefits  in  this  part  of  the  world.  Maybe  next  year?</TEXT></DOC>

But  so  far,  they  have  nothing  to  show  for  it.More  objects  were  pulled  from  the  waters  over  the  weekend,  but  they  weren't  debris  from  the  plane.On  Sunday,  an  Australian  aircraft  spotted  four  orange  items.  Officials  called  them  "the  most  promising  leads."On  Monday,  we  learned  they  were  fishing  equipment.For  families  of  the  passengers,  the  wait  has  been  agonizing.  And  the  mixed  messages  from  Malaysian  officials  haven't  helped.  Last  week,  they  were  told  everyone  aboard  had  died.  Then  on  Saturday,  Malaysia's  acting  transportation  minister  said  there  could  be  survivors."We  are  here  struck  with  sadness  and  urgency,"  said  Jiang  Hui,  the  families'  designated  representative.Here's  a  cheat  sheet  to  help  you  get  up  to  speed  on  the  latest  twists  in  an  investigation  that  has  transfixed  the  world  and  baffled  authorities:What's  the  latest  on  what  searchers  have  spotted?Crews  have  come  across  a  lot  of  debris,  but  none  linked  to  the  missing  plane.An  Australian  search  team  snapped  photos  of  four  orange  objects  it  spotted  in  the  water  on  Sunday.The  items  were  more  than  2  meters  (6.5  feet)  long,  Flight  Lt.  Russell  Adams  said.Adams  called  the  discovery  of  the  four  objects  one  of  the  "most  promising  leads"  searchers  have  come  across.But  after  analyzing  them,  investigators  determined  whether  they're  from  the  missing  plane.Have  ships  in  the  search  area  recovered  anything?Yes,  but  so  far  none  of  the  pieces  of  debris  they've  collected  has  turned  out  to  be  from  the  missing  plane.Objects  picked  up  by  ships  on  Saturday  turned  out  to  be  fishing  equipment  and  other  items,  officials  said.On  Saturday,  crew  members  aboard  a  Chinese  plane  dropped  buoys  to  mark  three  suspected  debris  sites,  China's  state-run  CCTV  reported.  It  later  said  an  orange  "suspicious  object"  spotted  by  a  Chinese  plane  Saturday  turned  out  to  be  a  dead  jellyfish.What  are  the  passengers'  families  saying?On  Sunday,  a  group  of  families  demanded  more  evidence  from  the  Malaysian  government  on  the  fate  of  their  relatives."We  want  evidence,  we  want  truth  and  we  want  our  family,"  they  chanted  outside  a  Kuala  Lumpur  hotel.Far  from  that  crowd,  the  husband  of  one  of  the  plane's  flight  attendants  told  CNN's  Paula  Hancocks  he's  angry  about  the  way  the  airline  has  handled  the  situation,  and  he  doesn't  know  what  to  tell  his  two  children  when  they  ask  when  their  mother's  coming  home.He's  vowed  to  bring  her  back,  but  it's  a  promise  he's  not  sure  he'll  be  able  to  keep."I  really  don't  know  where  she  is  now,"  he  said,  tears  filling  his  eyes.Who's  searching  for  the  plane?Monday's  search  team  consists  of  10  aircraft  and  10  ships,  authorities  said."The  effort  is  ramping  up,  not  winding  down,"  Australian  Prime  Minister  Tony  Abbott  told  CNN's  Atika  Shubert  on  Monday.The  aircraft  include  military  planes  from  Australia,  New  Zealand,  Japan,  China,  South  Korea,  the  United  States  and  Malaysia.  And  a  civil  jet  will  act  as  a  communications  relay,  authorities  said.The  number  of  ships  is  particularly  important,  CNN's  Kyung  Lah  reported.  It's  the  most  vessels  to  comb  the  Indian  Ocean  search  area  so  far.That  could  be  key  if  investigators  do  spot  the  plane's  wreckage,  she  said,  because  they'll  only  be  able  to  know  for  sure  after  they  pull  the  debris  aboard  and  examine  it  more  closely."You  have  to  verify  it  by  having  a  ship  go  out  there  and  pick  it  up,"  Lah  said.  "And  with  more  of  them  at  sea,  there  is  more  hope  that  perhaps  they  can  figure  it  out,  get  to  these  objects  more  quickly  and  verify  them  more  quickly."Are  authorities  sure  they're  searching  in  the  right  place?Abbott  didn't  directly  respond  to  reporters'  questions  about  how  confident  he  was  in  the  area  investigators  are  searching."We  are  searching  a  vast  area  of  ocean,  and  we  are  working  on  quite  limited  information,"  he  said.  "Nevertheless,  the  best  brains  in  the  world  are  applying  themselves  to  this  task.  ...  If  this  mystery  is  solvable,  we  will  solve  it."The  latest  data  analysis  shows  Malaysia  Airlines  Flight  370  ended  up  in  the  southern  Indian  Ocean.  But  officials  have  offered  different  assessments  of  exactly  where  it  could  have  gone  down.Investigators  shifted  the  search  to  an  area  closer  to  Australia's  coast  on  Friday  after  concluding  that  the  plane  had  been  traveling  faster  and  burning  fuel  faster  than  they  previously  had  thought.Is  there  a  time  limit  to  the  search?Speaking  from  the  Royal  Australian  Air  Force  base  where  search  teams  have  been  headquartered,  the  Prime  Minister  said  he  wouldn't  set  a  time  frame  for  the  hunt."We  can  keep  searching  for  quite  some  time  to  come,"  Abbott  said.  "We  will  keep  searching  for  quite  some  time  to  come.  ...  The  intensity  of  our  search  and  the  magnitude  of  our  operations  is  increasing,  not  decreasing."But  he  acknowledged  that  could  change  if  crews  don't  find  anything  after  a  period  of  time."If  nothing  of  substance  is  found,  obviously  such  a  point  is  eventually  reached,  but  we  are  well,  well  short  of  that  point,  and  I  think  we  owe  it  to  the  grieving  families  of  the  239  people  on  board.  We  owe  it  to  the  anxious  governments  of  all  of  the  countries  who  had  people  on  board  that  aircraft.  We  owe  it  in  particular  to  the  Malaysians.  ...  We  owe  it  to  all  of  them  to  do  whatever  we  reasonably  can  to  get  to  the  bottom  of  this  mystery,"  he  said.As  for  Malaysia,  Prime  Minister  Najib  Razak  said  in  a  Facebook  post  late  Sunday  that  the  search  for  the  plane  won't  stop  until  investigators  locate  the  missing  aircraft."The  Malaysian  government  is  fully  committed  to  the  search  operation,"  he  said,  "and  we  will  not  stop  until  the  plane  is  found."What  about  the  flight  recorder?Officials  have  said  they're  racing  against  time  for  another  reason.The  more  time  passes,  the  harder  it  could  be  to  find  the  plane's  flight  data  recorder.  The  batteries  on  the  "pinger"  --  the  beacon  that  sends  a  signal  from  the  recorder  --  are  designed  to  last  about  30  days.  The  plane  disappeared  March  8  --  23  days  ago.To  help  find  the  flight  recorder  once  wreckage  is  found,  an  American  pinger  locator  and  undersea  search  equipment  were  loaded  onto  the  Ocean  Shield,  an  offshore  support  vessel  of  the  Royal  Australian  Navy.  The  ship  was  originally  set  to  depart  Monday  morning,  but  authorities  said  it  would  be  delayed  at  least  six  hours  for  an  inspection,  CNN's  Will  Ripley  reported.It  will  take  the  ship  up  to  three  days  to  reach  the  search  area.U.S.  Navy  Cmdr.  William  Marks  told  CNN's  "State  of  the  Union"  that  his  team  needs  a  conclusive  piece  of  debris  to  narrow  down  the  search  area  before  they  deploy  the  equipment."We  have  to  be  careful  not  to  send  it  in  the  wrong  place,"  he  said,  "but  we  also  wanted  to  get  it  out  there  as  close  as  we  can  to  what  we  believe  is  the  right  place."READ:  Hopes  dashed  as  orange  objects  turn  out  to  be  fishing  equipmentREAD:  Air  search  for  Flight  370:  'I  want  to  give  them  answers'READ:  A  flight  attendant's  husband  wants  to  give  children  answers,  but  has  noneCNN's  Kyung  Lah,  Atika  Shubert,  Steve  Almasy  and  KJ  Kwon  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Steny  Hoyer  says  budget  talks  are  in  a  quasi-"cease-fire"  period  and  now  is  the  time  to  make  the  hard  budget  decisions</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  U.S.  Rep.  Steny  Hoyer,  D-Maryland,  is  House  minority  whip.  You  can  follow  him  on  Twitter  @WhipHoyer.  The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  the  author.(CNN)  --  For  four  years,  I  have  been  among  those  leading  the  call  for  a  big  and  balanced  agreement  on  deficit  reduction  that  can  set  America  back  on  a  fiscally  sustainable  path.After  watching  Congress  lurch  from  fiscal  crisis  to  fiscal  crisis,  kicking  the  can  down  the  road,  Americans  are  rightly  wary  of  talk  about  the  budget.Now  we're  in  what  some  would  call  a  "cease-fire,"  with  top-line  budget  numbers  set  for  this  year  and  next,  and  certainty  that  our  nation  can  pay  its  bills  until  next  March.As  a  result,  it  is  tempting  to  stop  talking  about  what  we  can  do  to  move  our  country  toward  fiscal  sustainability,  but  that  would  be  a  dangerous  missed  opportunity.Now  is  the  time  --  without  an  immediate  crisis  putting  pressure  on  us  to  act  only  according  to  our  short-term  interests  --  when  we  can  clearly  evaluate  our  options  and  make  the  hard  decisions.We  need  to  do  the  hard  work  of  reaching  a  compromise  that  will  allow  us  to  invest  in  our  priorities  and  put  our  nation's  long-term  budget  outlook  on  a  more  sustainable  path.  We  will  have  opportunities  this  year  to  make  progress  toward  this  goal,  and  we  cannot  fail  to  seize  them.Failure  to  achieve  fiscal  sustainability  will  worsen  the  economic  uncertainty  our  families,  businesses  and  workers  are  already  facing.  If  we  don't  act,  the  rising  costs  of  mandatory  spending,  driven  by  growing  interest  on  our  debt  and  baby  boomers'  retirement,  will  crowd  out  investments  in  the  programs  that  make  our  country  great,  including  those  that  advance  education,  innovation  and  research.Today,  interest  payments  on  our  debt  stand  at  1.4%  of  gross  domestic  product,  and  by  2024  that  is  expected  to  reach  3%.  That  may  not  sound  like  much,  but  it's  more  than  we  spend  on  research,  infrastructure  and  education  --  combined.In  the  1960s,  we  spent  $3  in  investments  for  $1  in  entitlement  programs.  Today,  that  ratio  is  reversed.Both  of  these  trends  will  make  it  difficult  for  Congress  to  invest  in  programs  that  help  Americans  lift  themselves  out  of  poverty  and  into  the  middle  class,  promote  business  growth  and  protect  our  national  security.That's  why  it's  so  important  that  we  keep  making  progress  toward  fiscal  sustainability,  so  that  we  can  begin  investing  in  our  people  again.  Congress  will  have  a  number  of  opportunities  this  year  to  take  action,  opportunities  it  would  be  foolish  to  waste.First,  passing  comprehensive  immigration  reform  this  year  would,  according  to  the  nonpartisan  Congressional  Budget  Office,  reduce  the  deficit  by  $900  billion  over  the  next  two  decades,  including  $200  billion  over  the  first  10  years.  The  Senate  has  passed  a  bipartisan  comprehensive  immigration  bill,  and  the  House  ought  to  follow  suit.Second,  we  will  need  to  look  at  making  and  financing  new  infrastructure  investments.  If  we  do  so  with  a  dedicated  revenue  source,  it  would  be  a  win-win  for  both  our  economic  and  fiscal  outlooks.Third,  we're  going  to  have  to  address  a  number  of  expiring  --  and  already  expired  --  tax  provisions  while  replacing  any  revenue  lost  in  extending  them.  I  believe  we  should  go  further  and  pursue  comprehensive  reform  of  our  tax  code  that  simplifies  filing  while  potentially  lowering  rates.  This  will  enable  us  to  raise  revenues  and  promote  growth  by  providing  greater  certainty  to  the  private  sector.Finally,  Congress  will  have  to  act  next  year  to  replace  the  remaining  sequester  cuts.  We  should  adopt  a  more  strategic  approach  that  enables  us  to  prioritize  our  investments  while  achieving  balanced  deficit  reduction.Those  who  recognize  the  need  for  reaching  a  big  deal,  as  I  do,  must  continue  to  promote  its  benefits  --  an  injection  of  certainty  that  will  allow  businesses  to  unleash  job-creating  capital  into  our  economy  and  a  renewed  ability  for  Congress  to  invest  in  a  strong  and  growing  middle  class.Congress  must  maximize  every  opportunity  this  year  to  push  our  country  closer  toward  the  sustainable  long-term  budget  outlook  that  must  be  our  ultimate  goal.Without  a  serious  effort  to  place  our  country  on  a  fiscally  sustainable  path,  our  ability  to  fulfill  the  vision  of  our  Founders  and  the  aspirations  of  the  American  people  will  diminish.I  refuse  to  accept  a  future  where  America  can  no  longer  lead  the  world  because  we  can't  afford  it.It  is  up  to  Democrats  and  Republicans  to  work  together  to  place  our  country  on  a  stable  fiscal  path  that  can  enhance  our  national  security  and  invest  in  the  education  of  our  people  and  in  America's  infrastructure  in  order  to  grow  our  economy.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.</TEXT></DOC>

Stringer  settled  the  pre-litigation  claim  for  wrongful  conviction  and  imprisonment  in  response  to  a  $150  million  claim  that  Ranta  filed  last  year,  according  to  a  statement  from  his  office."After  a  review  process  and  negotiations,  my  office  was  able  to  reach  a  settlement  with  Mr.  Ranta  that  is  in  the  best  interests  of  all  parties  and  closes  the  door  on  a  truly  regrettable  episode  in  our  City's  history,"  Stringer  said  in  a  prepared  statement.According  to  New  York  City  law,  the  comptroller  has  the  authority  to  settle  claims  against  the  city,  the  statement  said."It  is  such  a  significant  case,"  said  Sussman,  who  said  he  believes  the  quick  settlement  is  a  testament  to  the  weakness  of  the  city's  defense  against  the  suit."This  is  the  first  time  in  an  exoneration  case  that  a  settlement  has  been  reached  without  the  claim  making  it  to  the  city's  law  department,"  he  added.Sussman  said  Ranta  still  plans  a  lawsuit  against  the  state.Ranta  was  freed  from  prison  in  March  2013  but  suffered  a  heart  attacked  the  day  after  his  release.  His  attorney  said  Ranta  looks  forward  to  the  stability  the  settlement  will  provide  as  he  continues  to  get  medical  treatment  for  his  heart  condition.Ranta's  second-degree  murder  conviction  stemmed  from  the  1990  killing  of  Rabbi  Chaskel  Werzberger  during  a  diamond  heist.  A  witness  two  decades  later  came  forward  and  said  he  had  been  coached  to  identify  Ranta  from  a  police  lineup.  After  an  investigation,  prosecutors  recommended  that  Ranta's  conviction  be  tossed  out.Since  Ranta's  trial,  another  man's  widow  has  identified  her  now-dead  husband  as  the  killer;  a  onetime  jail  inmate  has  said  he  made  up  statements  about  Ranta  to  boost  his  own  fortunes;  and  the  man  who,  as  a  boy,  picked  him  out  of  a  lineup  has  come  forward  to  say  a  detective  coached  him.Prosecutors  have  determined  the  evidence  underpinning  Ranta's  conviction  "has  been  degraded  to  such  an  extent"  that  it  would  no  longer  support  the  verdict,  John  O'Mara,  the  deputy  district  attorney  in  charge  of  Brooklyn's  conviction  integrity  unit,  said  in  March  2013.When  detectives  questioned  him,  Ranta  initially  denied  any  involvement  in  the  killing,  but  he  then  acknowledged  knowing  Alan  Bloom,  a  man  facing  trial  on  his  own  robbery  charges  who  gave  Ranta's  name  to  police,  according  to  prosecutors.  He  later  admitted  he  had  been  near  the  scene  of  the  crime  and  that  he  knew  his  friends  had  planned  a  holdup.  Then  he  admitted  he  had  been  involved  in  planning  the  diamond  heist,  acted  as  the  lookout  and  had  seen  Bloom  and  another  jailed  witness,  Dmitry  Drikman,  with  a  gun.Ranta  insists  that  he  was  framed  by  police  and  that  detectives  coached  the  witnesses  against  him."No  way  that  happened,"  said  Louis  Scarcella,  one  of  the  detectives  who  investigated  the  case.  He  told  CNN  last  year  that  Ranta  admitted  his  involvement  in  the  heist  attempt  and  that  he  stands  by  the  arrest.Upon  Ranta's  exoneration  in  March  2013,  his  attorney  told  CNN,  "The  detective  work  that  was  done  on  this  case  was  at  best  shoddy  and  at  worst  criminal.  And  I  don't  use  that  word  lightly.  But  when  a  closer  examination  is  done  of  the  detective  work  ...  it  becomes  clear  that  there  were  so  many  leads  that  weren't  followed,  there  were  so  many  notes  that  weren't  taken  and  just  a  general  lack  of  attention  to  an  investigation  that  required  nothing  but  close  scrutiny  of  the  scene,  of  witnesses  and  so  forth.  That  didn't  happen."About  50  cases  in  the  District  Attorney's  Criminal  Investigation  Unit  handled  by  Scarcella  came  under  review  after  Ranta's  second-degree  murder  conviction  was  tossed  out.  Scarcella  retired  from  the  New  York  Police  Department  before  the  investigations  began.CNN's  Laura  Ly,  Mary  Snow,  Matt  Smith,  Catherine  E.  Shoichet  and  Allie  Malloy  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Kirsten  Gillibrand  that  would  have  removed  military  commanders  from  decisions  on  whether  to  prosecute  subordinates  for  rape,  sexual  assault  and  other  serious  crimes  fell  short  in  a  procedural  vote  on  Thursday.Gillibrand  argued  that  commanders  too  often  are  biased  in  their  decisions  on  such  matters,  and  proposed  placing  the  responsibility  with  "non-biased,  professionally  trained  military  prosecutors."Efforts  to  defeat  Gillibrand's  bill  were  led  by  fellow  Democrat  and  Armed  Services  Committee  member,  Sen.  Claire  McCaskill  of  Missouri.By  the  numbers:  Women  in  the  U.S.  militaryGillibrand  and  McCaskill  have  fought  for  months  over  how  best  to  reform  the  prosecution  process  for  military  sexual  assaults.Gillibrand  would  go  outside  of  the  traditional  military  command  structure  to  force  change;  McCaskill's  approach  is  to  reform  from  within.Both  spoke  with  sexl  assault  victims,  members  of  the  military  and  fellow  lawmakers.Their  competing  measures  also  divided  the  newly  expanded  female  caucus  of  senators  with  most  of  them,  including  fellow  Armed  Services  Committee  member  Sen.  Kay  Hagan  of  North  Carolina,  siding  with  Gillibrand.A  number  of  women's  rights  groups  also  backed  her  bill."Forty  five  U.S.  senators  blocked  all  justice  for  survivors  of  sexual  assault  in  the  military,  and  that  is  a  travesty.  Today's  results  show  just  how  pervasive  rape  culture  in  America  has  become,  and  how  hard  we  will  have  to  fight  to  overcome  it,"  Shaunna  Thomas,  co-founder  of  UltraViolet,  a  women's  rights  group,  said  in  a  statement  Thursday  following  the  vote.  "We  won't  stop  fighting,  and  the  45  Senators  who  voted  in  support  of  rape  culture  today  should  be  ashamed  for  not  fighting  with  us."Gillibrand's  bill  also  had  the  support  of  several  veterans  groups."This  was  a  missed  opportunity  for  Senate  leaders  to  overhaul  the  military's  broken  system  of  combating  sexual  trauma.  They  have  turned  their  back  on  veterans  and  service  members  who  pushed  for  reform,"  said  Paul  Rieckhoff,  chief  executive  and  founder  of  Iraq  and  Afghanistan  Veterans  of  America,  a  military  advocacy  group."Instead,  the  Senate  has  chosen  to  keep  the  status  quo.  Our  lawmakers  should  be  able  to  provide  a  fair  and  effective  military  justice  system  worthy  of  our  veterans  and  service  members,"  he  said.Senate  blocks  military  sexual  assault  billGillibrand's  bill  also  had  the  support  of  the  majority  of  the  Senate,  including  potential  2016  Republican  presidential  contenders  Sen.  Rand  Paul  of  Kentucky  and  Sen.  Ted  Cruz  of  Texas.Supporters  cite  a  recent  Pentagon  study  that  showed  an  estimated  26,000  incidents  of  sex  assault  and  unwanted  sexual  contact  in  2012,  but  just  over  10%  of  those  were  reported."The  definition  of  insanity  is  doing  the  same  thing  over  and  over  again  and  expecting  a  different  result,"  Paul  said  of  the  argument  that  that  military  commanders  should  be  allowed  to  decide  whether  to  prosecute  rapes  and  sexual  assault.However,  Gillibrand's  measure  was  staunchly  opposed  by  both  the  Pentagon  and  the  bipartisan  leaders  of  the  Armed  Services  Committee  including  South  Carolina  Republican  Sen.  Lindsay  Graham  who  had  choice  words  for  Republican  presidential  hopefuls  who  backed  the  bill.Rape  victims  say  military  labels  them  'crazy'McCaskill  argued  that  reforms  that  became  law  last  year  will  increase  sexual  assault  prosecutions.Those  reforms  include:  removing  the  authority  of  commanders  to  overturn  convictions;  providing  attorneys  to  victims;  making  it  a  crime  to  retaliate  against  a  victim;  and  requiring  a  dishonorable  discharge  for  anyone  convicted  of  sexual  assault.The  Senate  did  pass  a  separate  bill  Thursday  authored  by  McCaskill  that  adds  to  new  changes  to  the  reforms  adopted  last  year.The  measure,  which  passed  easily  with  Gillibrand's  support,  nixes  the  so-called  "good  soldier"  defense,  which  allows  defendants  to  present  evidence  of  their  good  military  character  at  sexual  assault  trials.McCaskill  has  a  measure,  co-sponsored  by  Republican  Sens.  Kelly  Ayotte  of  New  Hampshire  and  Deb  Fischer  of  Nebraska,  who  also  sit  on  the  Armed  Services  Committee  that  would  allow  an  outside  civilian  review  to  weigh  in  if  a  military  commander  and  prosecutor  disagree  on  sexual  assault  prosecution.A  vote  on  that  bill  is  expected  next  week.Groping  allegation  against  Army  officer  who  helps  fight  sex  crimeThe  political  showdown  over  the  sexual  assault  measure  unfolded  on  the  same  day  Army  Brig.  Gen.  Jeffrey  A.  Sinclair,  who  had  been  accused  of  "forcible  sodomy,"  plead  guilty  to  having  an  affair  with  that  service  member—a  military  crime—and  to  improper  sexual  conduct  with  two  other  subordinates.Additionally  on  Thursday,  news  broke  the  Army  was  investigating  an  officer  whose  job  it  was  to  train  prosecutors  on  sexual  assault  for  allegedly  grouping  an  Army  lawyer  in  2011  at  a  conference.CNN  Senior  Congressional  Producer  Ted  Barrett  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

"Django  Unchained."  "Gangs  of  New  York."  "Kill  Bill."  "Inglourious  Basterds."All  are  celebrated,  popular  films  containing  what  some  saw  as  excessive,  graphic  violence  that  glorified  as  much  as  humanized  the  bloodshed.  And  all  have  uber-producer  Harvey  Weinstein  to  thank  for  bringing  them  to  the  big  screen.No  more.Weinstein  told  CNN's  Piers  Morgan  on  Friday  night  that  he  can't  in  good  good  conscience  advocate  against  on-screen  violence  while  promoting  movies  that  some  claim  revel  in  it.  He  promised  to  steer  clear  of  such  projects  in  the  future."I  can't  do  it,"  Weinstein  said.  "I  can't  make  one  movie  and  say  this  is  what  I  want  for  my  kids,  and  then  just  go  out  and  be  a  hypocrite."The  co-founder  --  with  his  brother  Bob  --  of  Miramax  Films  and  now  the  Weinstein  Co.  spoke  days  after  announcing  plans  for  a  movie  that  will  be  critical  of  the  National  Rifle  Association.He  stressed  Friday  that  "the  movie  will  be  entertaining,"  and  not  a  documentary,  characterizing  it  in  the  same  vein  as  the  classic  "Mr.  Smith  Goes  to  Washington."  In  this  case,  the  Mr.  Smith  role  --  of  a  U.S.  senator  who  goes  toe-to-toe  with  the  NRA  --  will  be  played  by  Oscar-winning  actress  Meryl  Streep."I  know  the  power  of  what  a  movie  can  do,"  Weinstein  said  of  his  hopes  for  the  project,  "because  a  movie  can  galvanize  a  country."There's  been  a  sharp  backlash  to  this  initiative  from  conservative  news  outlets  to  rock  star/gun  rights  advocate  Ted  Nugent,  who  has  speculated  that  the  movie  will  backfire  and  end  up  bolstering  the  NRA.But  Weinstein  --  a  well-known  Democratic  party  donor  --  says  he  isn't  backing  down.  He  characterized  the  resistance  to  gun  control  in  the  United  States  as  a  byproduct  of  the  big  business  of  the  gun  industry.The  producer  said  he  felt  compelled  to  do  more,  and  change  his  tack,  after  the  December  2012  shooting  at  Sandy  Hook  Elementary  School  in  Newtown,  Connecticut  --  some  20  minutes  from  where  he  and  his  children  live  --  left  20  young  students  and  6  others  dead.Weinstein  recalled  calls  to  action  to  address  gun  violence  in  the  wake  of  such  mass  shootings,  only  to  have  that  momentum  seemingly  fade  after  a  few  days.  He  says  he'd  been  among  those  who  spoke  out  for  such  measures,  even  as  some  of  his  movies  had  their  share  of  blood  and  gore.That  won't  happen  any  longer,  Weinstein  said.  While  he  has  no  problems  with  real-to-life  films  like  "Lone  Survivor,"  the  current  hit  chronicling  a  team  of  Navy  SEALs  in  Afghanistan,  the  producer  vowed,  "I'm  not  going  to  make  some  crazy  action  movie  just  to  blow  up  people  and  exploit  people.""I've  done  a  good  job  of  feeling  sympathetic  for  it  over  the  years,  but  I've  done  also  a  good  job  of  ignoring  it  and  saying  that's  somebody  else's  fight,"  Weinstein  said.He  added,  "But  It's  in  my  backyard  now.  And  as  much  as  I  want  to  ignore  it,  as  much  as  I  want  to  go  on  with  my  regular  life,  I  can't  shake  it  this  time."</TEXT></DOC>

He  is  a  consultant  to  the  pro-Obama  Super  PAC,  Priorities  USA  Action.  The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  the  author.(CNN)  --  I  signed  up  for  health  care  through  the  Affordable  Care  Act  last  week.I  did  so  for  one  reason  and  one  reason  only:  it  was  a  good  deal  for  my  family.  In  fact,  it  was  a  better  deal  than  we  were  getting  before  the  ACA.The  website,  which  received  so  much  (well-deserved)  negative  publicity  when  it  failed  to  launch,  is  now  easy-peasy.  The  options  it  generated  for  us  were  more  clearly  delineated  than  those  we'd  been  given  in  the  past  by  a  private-sector  insurance  broker.  The  benefits  were  plainly  spelled  out,  as  were  the  deductibles  and  co-pays.  We  are  fortunate  in  that  we  do  not  need  subsidies,  and  yet  the  Obama  exchange  still  found  us  a  better  deal  than  we  had  found  on  our  own.Let  me  be  clear:  this  was  not  a  political  statement.  This  is  my  family's  health.  If  I  got  the  best  care  by  going  through  Sarah  Palin's  website  I  would  do  so.  Besides,  the  business  decisions  in  our  family  are  made  by  my  wife,  who  has  both  an  MBA  and  a  Masters  in  Public  Administration.  I  haven't  had  a  checkbook  since  the  Reagan  administration,  but  because  this  decision  was  so  personal  and  consequential,  we  made  it  as  a  team.In  the  end,  it  was  not  a  tough  choice.  On  the  one  hand,  we  got  better  coverage  under  the  ACA.  On  the  other,  it  cost  less.  I'm  not  exactly  a  believer  in  Republican  talking  points,  but  even  I  was  surprised  at  how  obviously  superior  my  choices  are  under  the  new  law.  I  knew  there  were  no  death  panels,  and  I  figured  a  plan  originated  by  Newt  Gingrich,  the  Heritage  Foundation  and  Mitt  Romney  couldn't  truly  be  Marxist.  But  I  hadn't  taken  the  time  to  do  the  math  to  figure  whether  the  ACA  would  be  a  better  deal  for  me.  It  is.The  federal  health  exchange  served  me  better  than  the  private  sector  had.  So  I  signed  up.  My  doc  is  still  my  doc.  My  insurance  company  is  still  a  private  corporation  -  not  (gasp!)  a  government  agency.  (Although  I'd  sign  up  for  Medicare  today  if  they'd  let  me;  the  government-run  health  insurance  program  for  seniors  is  terrific.)  Bottom  line  is,  the  ACA  works,  period.And  here's  the  beauty  part:  even  if  you  choose  not  to  use  the  exchanges  at  all,  you  stand  to  benefit  from  the  Affordable  Care  Act.  If  you  or  someone  in  your  family  has  a  pre-existing  condition,  you  are  a  winner  under  the  ACA.  Ditto  if,  God  forbid,  you  have  an  illness  or  an  accident  that  would  have  maxed-out  your  pre-Obamacare  coverage  limit:  the  ACA  outlaws  coverage  caps.  If  you're  a  young  adult  who  can  now  be  covered  on  your  parent's  plan  till  age  26,  or  a  Medicare  patient  who  needs  preventive  care  or  has  fallen  into  the  Donut  Hole,  you  come  out  ahead  too.Mitch  McConnell:  Another  view  on  ObamacareAll  of  those  rights  --  and  more  --  would  disappear  if  the  Republicans  repealed  the  Affordable  Care  Act.  The  Republican-controlled  House  has  voted  54  times  to  do  just  that.Despite  spending  millions  on  ads,  the  right  is  losing  the  debate.  The  latest  Kaiser  Family  Fund  poll  shows  that,  even  though  the  new  health  care  law  is  still  not  popular,  59%  of  Americans  want  to  keep  the  ACA  as-is  or  modify  it  slightly.  Only  18%  want  to  repeal  it  altogether,  and  another  11%  want  to  repeal  it  and  replace  it  with  a  GOP  alternative.As  more  and  more  Americans  actually  deal  with  health  reform  firsthand,  as  they  actually  receive  new  rights  and  new  benefits,  and  as  the  parade  of  right-wing  horribles  fails  to  materialize,  I  suspect  support  for  the  ACA  will  continue  to  grow.As  one  of  the  millions  of  Americans  who  benefits  from  the  ACA,  I  just  want  to  say  thanks,  President  Obama.  And  thank  you,  Nancy  Pelosi,  Harry  Reid  and  everyone  in  Congress  who  voted  for  the  Affordable  Care  Act.  (Obviously,  each  person's  individual  situation  is  unique.  It  may  well  be  that  some  folks  will  not  share  my  positive  experience.  But  you  have  nothing  to  lose  by  checking  it  out.)Thanks  also  to  all  the  Republicans  who  voted  for  it.  Wait,  there  weren't  any.  That's  okay,  I  suppose.  There  were  no  Republicans  who  voted  for  the  Clinton  Economic  Plan  in  1993,  and  it  led  to  balanced  budgets  and  23  million  new  jobs.

However,  the  years  you  spend  in  prison  is  what  you  two  cretins  deserve,"  David  Stow  said  to  the  two  men.Norwood,  however,  was  scheduled  to  be  released  with  credit  for  time  served;  he  had  been  in  jail  in  the  case  for  more  than  two  years.  Federal  authorities  plan  to  take  Norwood  into  custody,  if  released  by  local  authorities,  because  Norwood  faces  a  federal  charge  of  a  being  a  felon  in  possession  of  firearms,  said  spokesman  Thom  Mrozek  with  the  U.S.  Attorney's  office  in  Los  Angeles.Earlier  in  the  day,  Norwood  pleaded  guilty  to  felony  assault  by  means  likely  to  produce  great  bodily  injury.  Sanchez  pleaded  guilty  to  felony  mayhem.In  exchange  for  their  guilty  pleas,  other  felony  charges  were  dropped  against  the  defendants.  Both  men  are  from  Rialto,  California.The  Dodgers  issued  a  statement  saying  "we  are  pleased  that  the  culpable  parties  have  finally  accepted  responsibility  for  their  actions  and  have  been  sentenced  for  their  crimes."The  baseball  team  declined  to  comment  further  because  the  Stow  family  is  suing  the  organization  in  connection  with  the  beating  and  the  stadium's  security.Prosecutors  say  the  men  attacked  Bryan  Stow,  now  45,  in  the  Dodgers'  stadium  parking  lot  after  the  Opening  Day  game  on  March  31,  2011.  The  paramedic  from  Santa  Cruz  went  into  a  coma  as  a  result  of  the  beating  and,  after  returning  to  consciousness,  is  still  struggling  with  a  severe  brain  injury.The  men,  who  appeared  in  court  in  handcuffs,  were  harshly  criticized  by  Judge  George  Lomeli."Mr.  Stow  will  be  forever  trapped  in  the  medical  condition"  that  the  men  put  him  in,  he  said  during  the  sentencing.  "I  have  to  comment  on  the  attack,  which  was  absolutely  brutal."You  blindsided  Mr.  Stow,"  the  judge  said.  "You  are  a  complete  coward."Sanchez  smirked  during  the  judge's  admonishment."You  show  no  remorse  whatsoever,"  Lomeli  added.  "At  the  end  of  the  day,  it  was  only  a  game.  ...  And  you  lost  perspective."A  statement  from  the  district  attorney's  office  said  Sanchez  attacked  Stow  from  behind  in  "an  unprovoked  attack"  and  witnesses  testified  that  Norwood  prevented  Stow's  friends  from  helping  him.Caregivers  and  family  members  shower,  dress  and  feed  Stow,  who  takes  13  medications  a  day,  said  sister  Bonnie  Stow."No  sentencing  you  receive  will  be  long  enough,"  she  told  the  defendants.  "Your  lack  of  regret  makes  me  despise  you  even  more."Another  sister,  Erin  Collins,  said  the  damage  to  her  brother's  brain  was  catastrophic.  A  shunt  now  protrudes  on  the  right  side  of  his  skull,  and  its  left  side  is  slightly  sunken.  His  skull  has  deep  scars."Because  of  your  actions,  Bryan  can't  go  to  the  bathroom  by  himself,"  Collins  said.  "He  has  to  wear  adult  diapers.  I  hate  having  to  say  that  out  loud,  but  it  shows  the  severity  of  what  you  did."Being  here,  I  hope  to  see  one  tiny  bit  of  remorse  in  order  to  not  think  you  are  both  that  despicable,  but  I  don't.  How  can  we  begin  to  consider  forgiveness  when  you  aren't  even  asking  for  it,"  Collins  said.Collins  also  read  aloud  in  court  a  statement  written  by  Stow's  wife  that  was  directed  to  the  defendants:"Our  son  Tyler's  first  word  was  ball.  His  next  word  was  daddy.  And  when  they  started  playing  catch,  Bryan  promised  to  play  catch  with  him  every  day,  and  he  did  until  you  took  that  away  from  him.  Our  daughter,  Tabitha,  loved  to  ride  bikes  with  her  daddy  and  he  did  that  every  day  he  could,  again,  until  you  both  took  that  away."Based  on  your  actions,  it  is  completely  obvious  that  you  have  no  respect  for  human  life."CNN's  Paul  Vercammen  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

It's  another  to  live  with  decisions  made  by  those  who  prepare  your  food  before  it  makes  it  to  the  table.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Dr.  Tom  Frieden  is  director  of  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention.(CNN)  --  Almost  two  years  ago,  Philadelphia  launched  its  Healthy  Chinese  Take-out  Initiative  with  the  goal  of  reducing  sodium  content  by  10%  to  15%.The  city's  Public  Health  Department  worked  with  206  restaurants,  first  evaluating  their  menus  for  sodium  content  and  then  helping  them  choose  ingredients  and  develop  recipes  with  less  sodium.  One  way  found  to  reduce  sodium  was  for  restaurants  to  cut  the  use  of  commercially  prepared  sauces  and  instead  make  their  own.After  nine  months,  the  initiative  analyzed  two  popular  dishes  from  20  participating  restaurants  to  see  what  changed.  The  result?  A  20%  reduction  in  sodium,  more  than  the  project's  goal.It's  one  thing  to  choose  how  much  salt  to  add  to  your  food  when  you  eat.  It's  another  to  live  with  decisions  made  by  those  who  prepare  your  food  before  it  makes  it  to  the  table.It's  not  a  question  of  just  putting  down  the  salt  shaker.The  vast  majority  of  sodium  consumed  in  the  United  States  comes  from  processed  and  restaurant  foods.Americans  eat  out,  on  average,  almost  five  times  a  week,  and  restaurant  foods  make  up  a  surprisingly  high  percentage  of  sodium  in  the  American  diet.On  average,  food  from  fast-food  restaurants  contains  about  1,850  milligrams  of  sodium  per  1,000  calories  and  food  from  sit-down  restaurants  has  nearly  2,100  milligrams  per  1,000  calories.  Many  restaurant  meals  have  twice  that  many  calories  or  more.Toddler  meals  swimming  in  saltU.S.  dietary  guidelines  recommend  limiting  sodium  to  less  than  2,300  milligrams  a  day  --  and  about  six  in  10  adults  should  further  limit  sodium  to  1,500  milligrams  a  day.  Excess  sodium  can  lead  to  high  blood  pressure,  a  major  contributor  to  heart  disease  and  stroke.An  article  published  Thursday  by  scientists  at  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention,  "From  Menu  to  Mouth:  Opportunities  for  Sodium  Reduction  in  Restaurants,"  offers  strategies  that  reduce  sodium  in  restaurant  food.Restaurants  can  provide  nutrition  information  at  the  point  of  purchase  to  give  consumers  the  option  to  make  healthier  choices.  They  can  also  create  group  purchasing  organizations  to  save  on  bulk  purchases  of  lower-sodium  ingredients.Health  departments  can  make  dietitians  available  to  assist  restaurants  with  nutrition  support.It  all  boils  down  to:  reduce,  replace,  reformulate.  When  restaurants  rethink  how  they  prepare  food  and  the  ingredients  they  use,  the  healthy  choice  becomes  the  easy  one  for  the  customer.The  story  in  Philadelphia  shows  it  can  be  done.The  CDC  collaborates  with  the  food  industry  to  reduce  sodium  in  the  food  supply  and  provides  technical  assistance  for  this  important  work.  We  monitor  programs  to  see  what's  working  in  sodium  reduction  as  well  as  broader  blood  pressure  control  initiatives  through  Million  Hearts,  the  national  public-private  effort  to  prevent  1  million  heart  attacks  and  strokes  over  the  next  five  years.  And  we  share  that  information  through  papers  such  as  the  one  published  Thursday.Reducing  sodium  in  restaurant  and  prepared  foods  isn't  about  reducing  choice  --  just  the  opposite.  By  reducing  sodium  in  the  foods  you  buy,  companies  put  control  into  your  hands.  After  all,  it's  easy  to  add  salt  if  you  want  to,  but  not  to  take  it  out  if  it's  there.</TEXT></DOC>

The  United  States  and  European  Union  consider  the  regions  part  of  Georgia.Here  is  a  look  at  possible  responses  to  Putin's  latest  move  in  Ukraine:MilitaryUnless  a  sudden  escalation  causes  open  warfare  between  Ukraine  and  Russia,  forget  about  any  kind  of  U.S.  or  allied  military  response.Secretary  of  State  John  Kerry  said  Sunday  the  United  States  was  keeping  its  options  open,  but  he  made  a  point  of  adding  that  escalated  military  involvement  would  "not  serve  the  world  well.""The  last  thing  anybody  wants  is  a  military  option  in  this  kind  of  situation,"  Kerry  said  on  NBC's  "Meet  the  Press."Even  veteran  Sen.  John  McCain  of  Arizona,  a  proponent  of  exerting  U.S.  influence  abroad,  conceded  that  the  fight  must  involve  diplomacy,  not  the  military."There  is  not  a  military  option  that  could  be  exercised  now,"  McCain  said  Monday  in  remarks  at  the  American  Israel  Public  Affairs  Committee's  annual  conference.  "But  the  most  powerful  and  biggest  and  strongest  nation  in  the  world  should  have  plenty  of  options."On  Monday,  the  United  States  put  on  hold  all  military-to-military  engagements  with  Russia,  an  official  announced."Although  the  Department  of  Defense  finds  value  in  the  military-to-military  relationship  with  the  Russian  Federation  we  have  developed  over  the  past  few  years  to  increase  transparency,  build  understanding,  and  reduce  the  risk  of  military  miscalculation,  we  have,  in  light  of  recent  events  in  Ukraine,  put  on  hold  all  military-to-military  engagements  between  the  United  States  and  Russia.  This  includes  exercises,  bilateral  meetings,  port  visits  and  planning  conferences,"  said  Pentagon  Press  Secretary  Rear  Adm.  John  Kirby.He  denied  reports  speculating  on  possible  ship  movements  in  the  region."There  has  been  no  change  to  our  military  posture  in  Europe  or  the  Mediterranean;  our  Navy  units  continue  to  conduct  routine,  previously  planned  operations  and  exercises  with  allies  and  partners  in  the  region,"  he  said.John  Herbst,  a  former  U.S.  ambassador  to  Ukraine  in  the  administration  of  Republican  President  George  W.  Bush,  suggested  one  possible  military  response  would  be  for  NATO  to  agree  to  deploy  additional  forces  in  countries  with  significant  Russian  populations.Herbst  noted  on  CNN  that  Russia  used  the  need  to  protect  Russian  citizens  and  interests  as  a  pretext  for  what  he  called  "blatant  aggression"  in  Ukraine  now  and  previously  in  Georgia.What  you  need  to  knowG8The  annual  summit  of  the  world's  industrial  powers  is  scheduled  for  Russian  Olympic  venue  Sochi  in  June,  but  the  United  States  and  other  members  have  halted  planning  for  the  gathering  amid  calls  for  Russia  to  be  kicked  out.Once  known  as  the  G7,  the  group  that  also  includes  Germany,  Britain,  France,  Italy,  Japan  and  Canada  agreed  to  add  Russia  in  1998  to  reflect  the  changing  geopolitical  dynamic  after  the  Cold  War  and  breakup  of  the  Soviet  Union.Revoking  Russia's  membership  would  isolate  Putin  diplomatically  to  deny  him  the  Western  acceptance  he  has  sought."He  will  be  isolated  more.  He  won't  look  good  in  front  of  his  people,"  CNN  Chief  International  Correspondent  Christiane  Amanpour  said  Monday.Such  isolation  would  bolster  economic  isolation  and  sanctions  --  a  more  effective  strategy  to  pressure  Putin."The  G8  plus  some  others  and  all  of  them,  every  single  one  of  them  are  prepared  to  go  to  the  hilt  in  order  to  isolate  Russia  with  respect  to  this  invasion,"  Kerry  said  Sunday  on  the  CBS  program  "Face  the  Nation."A  divided  Ukraine?  Think  againSanctionsObama  said  Monday  the  United  States  is  examining  a  series  of  economic  and  diplomatic  steps  to  "isolate  Russia."Kerry  also  said  foreign  leaders  were  prepared  to  act  as  well,  noting  the  possibilities  include  visa  bans,  asset  freezes  and  isolation  by  the  international  community  on  trade  and  investment.Republican  Rep.  Ed  Royce  of  California,  the  chairman  of  the  House  Foreign  Affairs  Committee,  told  CNN  on  Monday  that  "the  Achilles  heel  for  Russia  is  their  economy  --  the  ruble.""We  have  to  lead  and  we  have  to  rally  Europe  around  a  series  of  steps  that  would  actually  impact  the  Russians  economically:  sanctions  against  state-owned  banks,"  Royce  said.Later  Monday,  a  spokesman  told  CNN  that  the  United  States  has  suspended  upcoming  trade  and  investment  talks  with  Russia."Due  to  recent  events  in  Ukraine,  we  have  suspended  upcoming  bilateral  trade  and  investment  engagement  with  the  Government  of  Russia  that  were  part  of  a  move  toward  deeper  commercial  and  trade  ties,"  said  the  U.S.  trade  representative  spokesman,  who  spoke  on  the  condition  of  anonymity.What's  happening?  Depends  on  whom  you  askDiplomacyObama  had  a  lengthy  phone  call  with  Putin  over  the  weekend  in  which  the  U.S.  leader  said  his  Russian  counterpart  violated  international  law  by  sending  military  forces  into  Crimea,  according  to  a  White  House  statement."President  Obama  wants  to  emphasize  to  the  Russians  that  there  are  a  right  set  of  choices  that  can  still  be  made  to  address  any  concerns  they  have  about  Crimea,  about  their  citizens,  but  you  don't  choose  to  invade  a  country  in  order  to  do  that,"  Kerry  said  on  CBS.Putin  has  yet  to  make  any  substantive  public  statement  about  the  situation,  which  follows  the  successful  staging  of  the  Winter  Olympics  in  Sochi  to  bring  Putin  and  Russia  some  pride  in  the  international  community.The  thrust  of  the  Russian  position  is  that  it  had  the  right  to  protect  the  interests  of  Russians  in  eastern  Ukraine.On  Monday,  Vice  President  Joe  Biden  called  Russian  Prime  Minister  Dmitry  Medvedev  to  urge  Russia  to  "pull  back  its  forces,  support  the  immediate  deployment  of  international  monitors  to  Ukraine,  and  begin  a  meaningful  political  dialogue  with  the  Ukrainian  government,"  the  White  House  said.Obama  outlined  a  similar  approach  to  reporters  later  Monday,  saying  that  should  satisfy  Russian  concerns  of  protecting  the  rights  of  ethnic  Russian  residents  and  Russian  citizens  in  Ukraine.Separately,  National  Security  Council  spokeswoman  Caitlin  Hayden  said  the  United  States  has  scrapped  plans  to  send  a  presidential  delegation  to  the  upcoming  Winter  Paralympic  Games  in  Sochi.  U.S.  athletes  still  plan  to  compete.PoliticsCongress  will  have  a  say  in  the  focus  and  size  of  a  U.S.  response,  with  calls  already  for  a  possible  sanctions  package.Hawkish  Republicans  have  criticized  Obama  for  what  they  called  a  lack  of  resolve  that  they  say  emboldened  Putin  to  send  troops  into  the  Crimea  region.McCain  called  Obama's  foreign  policy  "feckless"  on  Monday,  after  House  Intelligence  Committee  Chairman  Mike  Rogers  of  Michigan  said  on  "Fox  News  Sunday"  that  Putin  and  Russia  had  been  "running  circles  around  us."Fellow  GOP  Sen.  Lindsey  Graham  of  South  Carolina  called  for  reviving  plans  for  a  NATO  missile  defense  shield  in  Poland  that  Russia  opposed.Obama  told  reporters  on  Monday  that  there  should  be  "unanimity"  between  Democrats  and  Republicans  in  seeking  to  preserve  "the  principle  that  no  country  has  the  right  to  send  in  troops  to  another  country  unprovoked.""My  expectation  is  we  ought  to  be  able  to  get  Congress  to  work  with  us  to  achieve  that  goal,"  he  said,  specifically  calling  for  an  economic  assistance  package  for  Ukraine  to  help  provide  stability  during  the  crisis.Sen.  Robert  Menendez,  who  is  chairman  of  the  Senate  Foreign  Relations  Committee,  said  Monday  the  panel  was  putting  together  legislation  to  provide  $1  billion  in  loan  guarantees  for  Ukraine's  economy."We  are  also  consulting  with  the  administration  on  possible  sanctions  actions  against  individual  Russians  and  Ukrainians  that  range  from  visa  bans  and  asset  freezes,  to  the  suspension  of  military  cooperation  and  sales,  as  well  as  economic  sanctions,"  the  New  Jersey  Democrat  said.A  Republican  member  of  the  committee,  Ron  Johnson  of  Wisconsin,  told  CNN  he  was  urging  the  panel  to  speak  with  "one  voice"  to  "show  the  Russians  that  this  is  something  we  are  unified  in.""It  will  send  a  much  more  powerful  signal  and  hopefully  get  Putin  to  think  twice,"  Johnson  said,  adding  that  "Putin  needs  to  pay  a  big  price  here"  because  "this  is  no  time  to  be  shrinking  violets  and  rely  on  words."READ:  Tensions  rise  in  Crimea  amid  report  of  Russian  ultimatumREAD:  GPS  Blog:  How  U.S.  should  respond  to  RussiaREAD:  CNN  Money:  Ukraine  crisis:  Why  it  matters  to  the  world  economyREAD:  Ukraine  mobilizes  troops  after  Russia's  'declaration  of  war'CNN's  Dana  Bash  and  Barbara  Starr  contributed  to  this  report</TEXT></DOC>

Soon  after,  it  performed  a  fly-by  at  the  Paris  Airshow.So  far  two  test  planes  have  clocked  1,000  hours  of  flying  time,  some  in  extreme  conditions.To  date  the  A350  has  experienced  the  cold  of  northern  Canada  and  the  high  altitude  of  La  Paz  in  Bolivia.  In  the  next  few  weeks  it  will  also  conduct  tests  in  the  stifling  heat  of  the  Middle  East.All  five  test  A350s  will  have  to  fly  for  2,500  hours  before  achieving  certification.MORE:  Why  Airbus  and  Boeing  are  cozying  up  to  Asia's  booming  budget  airlinesSelling  featuresThis  is  a  passenger  jet  made  up  of  53%  composite  material  according  to  Simon  Azar  from  the  Airbus  Marketing  Division,  the  highest  of  any  commercial  aircraft.This  allows  the  A350  to  travel  as  fuel  efficiently  as  possible,  lowering  operating  costs.The  wings  of  the  jet  incorporate  the  jet  maker's  latest  aerodynamics  and  advanced  low-speed  controls.  The  curled  winglets  are  designed  to  reduce  drag,  again  saving  fuel.Essentially  the  plane  will  fly  further  for  less,  to  help  offset  the  high  cost  of  buying  the  aircraft,  which  has  a  list  price  of  $254  million-322  million  depending  on  size.Also  adding  to  the  customer  experience,  Airbus  says,  are  the  A350's  low  noise  levels.  This  airplane  has  already  been  nicknamed  by  some  as  the  "Hushliner,"  a  title  Airbus  has  embraced."The  noise  levels  for  the  aircraft  are  going  to  be  very  low,"  says  Azar.  "It's  designed  to  be  a  very  quiet  aircraft  both  in  the  cabin  and  for  surrounding  space  as  the  aircraft  flies  around.  That's  very  important.  Noise  pollution  around  airports  is  something  that  we  work  to  reduce."Airbus  also  says  its  custom  Rolls  Royce  engine  is  unrivaled  in  terms  of  fuel  efficiency,  and  contributes  to  the  aircraft  achieving  a  25%  reduction  in  seat-mile  costs  and  25%  lower  carbon  dioxide  emissions.MORE:  Airbus  unveils  first  passenger-ready  A350  XWB  in  JanuaryPassenger  experienceFor  passengers,  Airbus  says  it's  offering  great  quality  air  (replaced  on  the  aircraft  every  two  to  three  minutes),  wider  cabins  and  18-inch-wide  seats  in  economy.When  carrying  315  passengers  this  plane  can  travel  7,800  nautical  miles,  or  an  equivalent  17  hours,  useful  when  research  suggests  passengers  of  the  future  will  be  flying  for  longer.The  twin  aisle  jet  can  carry  between  250  and  400  passengers.It's  designed  to  have  an  economy  class  carrying  nine  abreast,  but  the  A350  will  come  in  three  sizes,  the  A350-800,  A350-900  and  A350-1000,  and  can  be  configured  to  seat  passengers  from  eight  to  10  abreast.It'll  be  up  to  the  customer  airlines  to  choose  the  mode  of  inflight  entertainment.Business  class  passengers  will  experience  all  the  perks,  with  Airbus  promising  mood  lighting  and  the  option  for  full  flat  seats.  First  class  can  be  fitted  at  the  customer  airline's  discretion.It's  a  lot  to  get  your  head  around  when  you  look  at  the  airplane  as  it  is  today."Flight  crew  class"  is  what  Azar  laughingly  calls  the  50  odd  well-worn  gray  seats  the  jet  is  currently  fitted  with,  all  recovered  from  old  aircraft.  For  now,  these  are  strictly  reserved  for  crew  and  mechanics  during  test  flights,  but  that  will  change.The  first  fit-out  of  an  A350  with  a  proper  cabin  is  expected  next  month.VIPs  and  media  onlyThe  A350  arrived  in  Singapore  shortly  before  the  airshow  started.  Only  a  select  few  have  been  allowed  inside,  including  aviation  journalists  and  VIP  visitors,  including  Britain's  Undersecretary  of  State  for  Transport  Stephen  Hammond.On  Thursday  the  plane  is  due  to  fly  13  hours  back  to  Toulouse,  where  rigorous  tests  will  continue  until  the  plane  is  ready  to  go  to  market.Airbus  says  it  expects  that  to  be  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  this  year.Its  debut  customer,  Qatar  Airways,  has  ordered  80  of  the  aircraft.Airbus  has  a  backlog  of  orders  for  814  A350  jets,  from  39  customers,  almost  a  third  of  which  are  from  the  Asia  Pacific  region.MORE:  Boeing  787-9  Dreamliner's  first  flightCharlotte  Glennie  is  an  award-winning  freelance  journalist  living  in  Singapore.

Many  parents  say  that's  not  the  norm  for  their  well-traveled  children,and  they  know  adults  who  have  trouble  traveling  and  keeping  their  manners  in  tact.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  The  child  was  screaming  and  out  of  control  as  he  and  his  mother  boarded  the  aircraft.That  much  psychologist  and  parenting  expert  Kevin  Leman  remembers  well.It  could  have  been  another  tantrum-filled  flight  from  hell.  But  Leman  says  a  quick-thinking  flight  attendant  could  see  what  was  about  to  unfold.  She  got  the  captain's  attention  and  he  ordered  the  family  off  the  aircraft  before  they  could  get  to  their  seats."The  parent  was  incapable  of  controlling  the  kid,  and  nothing  was  going  to  help  in  that  kind  of  situation,"  says  Leman,  the  author  of  several  parenting  books,  including  "Parenting  Your  Powerful  Child,"  and  father  of  five  grown  children.Leman,  who  lives  in  Tucson,  Arizona,  and  travels  constantly  for  speaking  engagements,  says  he  sees  a  child  acting  out  on  his  flight  at  least  once  a  week.  If  you  don't  set  limits  on  the  ground,  he  says,  you  won't  be  able  to  set  them  inside  a  narrow  metal  tube  at  35,000  feet."The  parent  you  are  in  the  ground  is  the  parent  you're  going  to  be  on  the  airplane,"  says  Leman.  "Do  you  have  a  game  plan?  If  you  do,  you're  going  to  have  a  kid  who  will  sit  in  an  airplane,  entertain  himself  and  not  be  a  pain  to  other  customers  on  the  plane."Haunted  by  experiences  and  tales  of  children  behaving  badly  in  flight,  many  travelers  have  pretty  strong  --  and  sometimes  visceral  --  feelings  about  sharing  space  with  young  globetrotters.  And  what  are  the  wee  ones  really  getting  out  of  such  travel?  Aren't  their  parents  going  to  suffer  for  bringing  them  long  after  the  earsplitting  cries  leave  the  confines  of  the  airplane?Can  young  children  benefit  from  travel?Traveling  parents  tell  CNN  those  meltdown  moments  do  not  represent  the  entirety  of  their  experiences.  Navigating  airport  security  and  learning  about  different  cultures  practically  since  birth,  many  well-traveled  children  have  better  airplane  manners  and  more  frequent  flier  miles  than  some  adults."I  think  my  daughter  benefits  from  seeing  there's  a  world  beyond  Baltimore  and  that  there  are  all  different  types  of  people,"  says  aviation  blogger  Benet  Wilson,  who's  taken  her  8-year-old  daughter  on  airplanes  since  she  was  10  days  old.Almira  Coronado  of  Daly  City,  California,  agrees.  "Traveling  enables  people  to  be  more  open-minded,  you  get  out  of  your  comfort  zone,  experience  unique  things,  meet  different  people,  hear/speak  a  different  language,"  writes  Coronado,  owner  of  a  travel  agency.  "It  broadens  the  mind."By  taking  their  daughter  to  foreign  countries  since  she  was  just  a  few  months  old,  Coronado  and  her  husband  see  Michelle,  now  age  7,  developing  a  more  global  point  of  view.  "She'll  have  a  better  appreciation  of  what  makes  each  place  and  each  people  unique."When  can  a  child  fly?We  know  some  of  you  will  not  bend  on  wanting  child-free  flights,  resorts  and  lives.  You  remain  convinced  that  kids  will  never  be  bearable  as  fellow  travelers.  That's  OK.But  you  should  know  that  there's  just  no  blanket  rule  for  when  a  child  is  old  enough  to  be  on  the  move.  Sorry,  baby  haters.  Some  children  are  easygoing  and  can  travel  well  at  any  age,  and  others  are  more  temperamental  and  cannot.A  guerrilla  approach  to  flying  with  kidsThe  temperament  of  the  child  and  the  parent  are  key  in  deciding  if  a  child  is  ready  to  travel  or  not,  says  Yale  Parenting  Center  director  Alan  Kazdin,  a  Yale  University  psychology  professor  and  author  of  "The  Everyday  Parenting  Toolkit."A  mellow,  organized  parent  can  handle  changes  in  flight  plans  and  food  and  can  teach  those  strategies  to  his  or  her  child.  The  parent  who  gets  frantic  easily  may  not  go  with  the  flow  when  faced  with  travel  delays,  jet  lag  or  even  the  "wrong"  kind  of  chicken  nuggets.  "And  that  predisposition  will  be  passed  on  to  your  child,"  says  Kazdin.Do  young  children  benefit  from  travel?There  are  those  parents  who've  taught  their  children  to  behave  in  changing  situations  and  who  can  adapt  when  weather,  flights  and  different  languages  affect  their  plans.  And  they  tell  stories  of  trips  abroad  that  benefited  both  parents  and  children.Coronado  thinks  her  daughter  benefits  from  learning  about  new  places  and  cultures  before  they  travel,  then  seeing  the  reality.  Before  a  2012  trip  to  see  family  in  Italy,  Coronado  borrowed  books  from  the  library  to  teach  her  daughter  about  the  places  they  planned  to  see.  That  got  Michelle,  then  age  5,  excited  about  the  trip.Before  a  2010  trip  to  the  Philippines,  Coronado  told  her  daughter  that  she  could  ask  her  parents  about  anything  she  saw  that  she  didn't  understand."She  can  whisper  her  question  to  us  and  we'll  try  our  best  to  answer  her  question,"  writes  Coronado.  When  Michelle  saw  a  homeless  girl  begging  on  the  street,  it  turned  into  a  (quiet)  conversation  about  poverty,  hunger  and  having  a  safe  place  to  call  home.What  should  my  child  know  about  plane  crashes?Parents  can  benefit  as  well.  Scott  Ribich  and  his  wife  took  their  two  sons,  ages  3  and  1,  to  Machu  Picchu  to  mark  their  10-year  anniversary.  The  Fort  Wayne,  Indiana,  couple  researched  getting  young  children  to  adapt  to  high  elevations  in  Cuzco,  and  they  dealt  with  a  little  altitude  sickness  on  the  second  day  of  the  trip.There  were  also  unexpected  rewards."Traveling  with  young  children  and  spending  time  on  the  playgrounds  with  the  local  children  and  meeting  the  kids  and  their  families  is  something  you  don't  normally  get  to  do  when  you  are  just  two  adults  traveling  somewhere  and  gives  you  a  completely  different  perspective."Choose  your  travel  wiselyNot  convinced  and  still  want  to  avoid  those  kid-filled  flights?  That's  why  Leman  schedules  his  business  trips  early  in  the  day  --  and  not  during  school  breaks.  But  if  he's  traveling  with  younger  children,  he  schedules  those  trips  later  in  the  day."I  don't  want  to  wake  a  4-year-old  at  4  a.m.  to  get  on  a  6  a.m.  flight  to  see  Grandma,"  he  says.  "Some  of  these  problems  we  create  are  brought  on  by  ourselves."Better  yet,  drive  (if  you  can).  Before  Leman  had  sold  a  lot  of  books,  he'd  pile  all  five  children  in  the  back  of  the  station  wagon  for  the  annual  summer  drive  from  Arizona  to  New  York.Although  he  says  it's  not  his  normal  parenting  style,  there  would  be  rewards  at  the  end  of  each  driving  day  for  the  children  who  didn't  get  three  strikes.  "I'm  not  a  reward-punishment  person  but  if  you're  trapped  in  a  car  or  cylinder  at  35,000  feet  for  three  hours,  I'll  do  anything  to  keep  those  kids  in  check,"  he  says.  (As  long  as  it  works.)Be  savvy  about  your  travel  choicesAt  a  family-friendly  resort  or  on  a  Disney  cruise,  there  will  be  children.  That's  what  child-free  travel  blogger  Christina  Saull  and  her  husband  assume.Yes,  of  course  Saull  thinks  parents  should  set  a  good  example  for  their  children  and  be  responsible  parents  while  traveling.  But  child-free  travelers  have  a  job  to  do,  too.  "I  think  it's  equally  my  responsibility  to  know  what  kind  of  trip  I'm  planning,"  she  writes."If  I  want  a  vacation  100%  without  kids  around,  I  need  to  go  to  an  adults-only  resort.  If  I'm  going  on  a  cruise  or  to  Florida  during  spring  break,  I  know  there  are  going  to  be  kids  there  --  shame  on  me  for  expecting  different."Thank  the  good  parentsYou  don't  hear  from  all  children  on  a  flight  because  some  of  their  parents  are  doing  the  right  thing.  Lee  Huffman  and  his  wife  took  their  then-2-year-old  son  to  Spain  last  May,  and  the  Anaheim  Hills,  California,  couple  were  prepared,  as  always."We  keep  him  occupied  as  much  as  possible  while  flying  with  iPad  videos,  coloring  books,  reading  to  him,  Duplo  blocks  for  him  to  build,  and  now  puzzles,"  writes  Huffman.True,  the  flying  was  not  always  so  smooth.  Huffman  admits  to  toddler  meltdowns  when  the  iPad  had  to  be  shut  down  during  takeoff  and  landing  before  the  new  rules.  "We  were  so  happy  when  the  airlines  started  to  allow  iPads  to  remain  on  during  takeoff  and  landing,"  he  writes.Travel  blogger  Saull  likes  to  recognize  those  parents  who  are  trying.  "I  love  well-behaved  kids  on  planes  and  always  compliment  parents  whose  kids  are  well-behaved  on  my  flight,"  she  writes."I  also  always  compliment  parents  whose  kids  might  be  a  bit  restless  or  fussy,  but  the  parents  are  clearly  trying.  Sometimes  it's  hard  to  sit  still  for  two  hours  in  a  metal  tube  --  even  for  adults!"Age  is  no  barrier  to  tantrumsIt  can  be  hard  for  adults  to  behave  as  well.  Just  ask  your  flight  attendant.When  you're  sitting  there  in  your  middle  seat  judging  the  parents  unable  to  calm  their  toddlers,  make  sure  to  take  notes  on  the  adult  passengers.Which  businesspeople  huffed  down  the  aisle  because  they  didn't  get  free  upgrades  to  first  class?  Which  late-boarding  tourists  tried  to  push  their  suitcases  into  already-filled  overhead  bins?  Who  got  up  to  go  to  the  bathroom  as  soon  as  the  flight  attendants  started  beverage  service?  Who  demanded  a  meal  in  coach  on  a  two-hour  flight  when  meals  haven't  been  served  in  coach  in  decades?As  several  parents  point  out,  many  children  behave  better  than  some  adult  travelers.  "I've  seen  adults  AND  kids  throw  the  wildest  tantrums  in  airports  regardless  of  age,"  writes  Doug  Simonton  of  Atlanta.Simonton  waited  until  his  daughter  was  9  years  old,  seven  years  ago,  to  take  her  to  Washington  and  New  York.  Why?  Because  that's  how  old  he  was  when  he  took  a  similar  trip  many  years  ago.  "I  figured  she'd  appreciate  it  as  much  as  I  did.  And  she  did."Asked  if  he  would  do  anything  differently,  he  said  he  would  have  built  in  more  rest  time  for  himself.His  daughter  was  very  well-behaved,  he  said,  but  that's  how  she's  always  been.  "Shannon  has  always  had  a  great  temperament,"  he  writes.  "I  never  had  to  do  anything  to  make  her  behave.  ...  She  was  and  is  quite  mature  for  her  age."Sounds  like  a  dad  who  knows  his  daughter.What  age  do  you  think  is  the  right  age  for  children  to  travel?

It  really  informs  the  whole  pace  of  the  room."The  cast,  as  well  as  fan  favorite  guest  star  Wil  Wheaton,  spoke  to  CNN  backstage  (which  is  something  of  a  museum  of  nerddom  all  its  own,  with  toys  and  comic  book  character  posters  everywhere)  about  some  of  their  favorite  parts  of  the  elaborate  set,  including  some  things  viewers  at  home  might  not  pick  up  on  right  away.("The  Big  Bang  Theory"  is  from  Warner  Bros.  Television,  which  is  owned  by  CNN's  parent  company,  Time  Warner.)CNN:  What's  it  like  being  constantly  surrounded  by  all  of  these  representations  of  nerd  culture?Mayim  Bialik  (Amy):  I'm  a  scientist,  so  I  like  all  that  nerdy  stuff.  That  was  one  of  the  things  that  struck  me  was  the  attention  to  detail.  Our  set  dressing  and  props  department  are  really  important  to  us,  and  that's  important  to  the  producers  as  well.Helberg:  It's  amazing  to  still  discover  new  stuff  in  Sheldon's  apartment.Kaley  Cuoco  Sweeting  (Penny):  It's  like  a  theme  park  walking  onstage.  I've  spent  a  lot  of  time  in  that  living  room  set,  so  I  know  a  lot  of  the  stuff  in  there  --  I  like  how  the  prop  department  lines  the  hallways  with  all  the  things  we've  used.  It  puts  me  in  the  mood  when  I'm  here  at  work.Wheaton:  I  feel  like  I'm  walking  through  my  own  house.  I  have  a  lot  of  the  same  action  figures  and  comic  books.CNN:  What  are  some  of  your  favorite  pieces  of  the  set?Johnny  Galecki  (Leonard):  The  "Star  Wars"  stuff  brings  me  back  because  I  was  a  huge  "Star  Wars"  fan  growing  up  as  a  kid.  There's  really  two  camps  here:  "Star  Trek"  or  "Star  Wars."  I'm  very  much  entrenched  in  the  "Star  Wars"  camp.  As  a  kid,  I  had  dozens  of  "Star  Wars"  figurines.  That's  how  I  told  stories  and  in  a  way  I'm  still  doing  that,  using  myself  as  the  vessel  instead  of  the  figurine.Bialik:  I'm  a  comic  book  person,  I  was  raised  in  comic  book  stores  --  when  we  have  the  comic  book  set,  I  spend  my  breaks  in  the  comic  book  set.  Once  I  saw  "Y  the  Last  Man,"  and  I  was  trying  to  explain  it  to  Jim  Parsons  and  I  was  saying  "This  is  a  collected  'Y  the  Last  Man,'  I  had  to  collect  them  all  individually!"  He  said,  "I  don't  care!  (laughs)  I  play  someone  who  cares  but  I  don't  really  care."Kunal  Nayyar  (Raj):  I  love  the  comic  book  store,  that's  the  best,  because  I'm  a  huge  "Lord  of  the  Rings"  and  "Star  Wars"  fan,  and  they  have  all  these  figurines  from  "Lord  of  the  Rings"  and  "Star  Wars"  and  I  get  to  be  a  kid  again.Wheaton:  When  we  work  in  the  comic  book  shop  set,  I  want  to  take  a  lot  of  the  books  home  with  me.  There  are  some  incredible  DC  archive  collections  that  are  just  used  as  set  decoration.  I  walk  in  like  Indiana  Jones,  "This  belongs  in  a  museum."Nayyar:  We've  had  the  sword  from  "Game  of  Thrones"  and  I  love  it  and  I  want  to  pick  it  up,  but  I  know  if  I  destroy  it,  it's  going  to  be  $10,000.  It's  a  heavy  thing.Helberg:  I  am  a  big  "Game  of  Thrones"  fan  --  that  sword  is  a  real  sword  and  that  was  cool.  There  are  also  some  very  racy  figurines  --  these  women  are  really  decked  out.  One  is  sort  of  a  sadomasochistic  fever  dream.Melissa  Rauch  (Bernadette):  When  we're  doing  stuff  in  Howard's  room,  there's  a  lot  of  action  figures  in  there.  I  was  always  very  intrigued  by  how  detailed  the  action  figures  are,  especially  the  women.  They  are  very,  very  detailed  --  they're  like  miniature  blow-up  dolls.Parsons:  I  do  have  a  unique  relationship  with  (Sheldon's  spot)  on  the  couch.  We  do  a  lot  of  scenes  in  that  apartment  set  and,  as  an  actor,  one  of  the  first  things  you  figure  out  is  where  you  will  physically  start  a  scene  on  the  stage  and,  nine  times  out  of  10,  I  start  on  the  spot  on  that  couch.  It's  as  close  as  I  think  I'll  ever  get  to  Archie  Bunker's  chair.Cuoco  Sweeting:  I  love  being  in  Penny's  apartment.  Being  in  the  kitchen,  drinking  wine,  feels  like  what  I  do  at  home.Galecki:  I  have  a  bit  of  a  superstitious  tradition  of  decorating  my  dressing  room  with  things  the  character  would  have,  so  I  took  quite  a  lot  of  set  dressing  for  my  dressing  room.  In  Season  4,  I  thought  this  is  enough.  I  started  tripping  over  board  games.CNN:  Are  there  any  little  details  that  fans  might  not  be  aware  of  right  away?Galecki:  Guests  are  always  interested  in  the  stairwell,  and  that  it  only  goes  down  about  seven  steps  and  there's  a  wall  there.  You'd  think  they  would  have  given  us  more  room.  We  really  have  to  pack  ourselves  like  sardines  to  be  out  of  the  camera's  view  --  the  Hollywood  magic  that  is  never  quite  as  glamorous  as  one  might  imagine.Cuoco  Sweeting:  People  always  ask  if  we  eat  the  food  (during  scenes).  I  must  be  the  only  one  who  really  eats  the  food.  I  save  my  appetite  until  we  do  those  scenes  --  I  want  to  look  real,  man!Rauch:  Wolowitz's  sheets  are  the  most  comfortable  sheets  and  the  most  comfortable  bed.  I  love  doing  scenes  in  there  --  it's  like  nap  time!  It's  so  comfortable.Bialik:  One  of  my  actual  genetics  textbooks  is  in  the  guys'  apartment.Nayyar:  At  the  back  of  the  guys'  apartment  is  a  "Star  Trek"  communicator.  You  can't  see  it  but  it's  a  big  deal.  It's  really  cool  --  if  you  look  carefully  enough  you'll  see  it.Wheaton:  One  of  my  favorite  things  I  noticed  two  seasons  ago,  is  in  Sheldon  and  Leonard's  apartment,  all  the  way  upstage  where  the  window  looks  out  into  Pasadena,  they  have  action  figures  up  there  and  one  of  them  is  Aquaman,  who  is  articulated  so  he's  doing  the  Vulcan  "Live  long  and  prosper"  salute.  And  it's  super-rad  because  it  will  never  read  on  television.  I  think  it's  such  an  awesome  little  detail  that  of  course  one  of  these  guys  would  have  done  that  --  because  I  would  have.</TEXT></DOC>

Martin  Luther  King  Jr.'s  possessions  a  "spiritually  violent"  moment  in  her  family's  history,  the  civil  rights  icon's  sole  surviving  daughter  said  Thursday  she  already  had  won  the  "moral  high  ground,"  regardless  of  a  court's  decision.At  issue  are  her  father's  1964  Nobel  Peace  Prize  and  traveling  Bible,  used  to  swear  in  President  Barack  Obama  for  his  second  term.  Bernice  King  declined  to  hand  the  items  over  on  Wednesday,  as  mandated  in  a  February  court  order.  She  has  previously  said  her  brothers  would  sell  the  items  if  she  gave  them  up.The  Fulton  County  Superior  Court  in  Georgia  extended  the  deadline  for  King  to  produce  the  items  until  Monday,  saying  it  would  hold  them  in  a  safe-deposit  box  until  the  litigation  between  King  and  her  brothers  is  settled."I  must  say  it  is  deep-in-my-soul  difficult  to  place  my  father's  prized,  precious  heirlooms  under  the  custody  of  the  state,  even  if  only  for  a  season,"  she  told  supporters  who  gathered  at  Atlanta's  historic  Ebenezer  Baptist  Church."Yet  I  recognize  that  justice  and  righteousness  are  not  always  aligned,"  she  continued,  "and  there's  often  a  disconnect  between  God's  law  and  man's  law.  As  dad  said,  'We  must  accept  finite  disappointment  but  never  lose  infinite  hope.'  "King  said  she  "was  led  by  the  Holy  Spirit  to  comply"  with  the  new  Monday  deadline.King  further  told  the  assembled  crowd,  made  up  of  supporters  and  civil  rights  activists,  that  the  public  tug-of-war  was  a  "defining  moment  for  our  family"  and  "an  embarrassing  chapter  in  our  family's  history."She  pleaded  with  her  brothers,  who  were  not  in  attendance,  and  any  prospective  buyers  to  "step  up  to  reason  and  do  what  your  consciousness  says  is  right."According  to  an  affidavit  filed  in  the  lawsuit,  King  wrote  an  e-mail  to  her  brother  Dexter  in  2007,  saying  she  was  OK  with  selling  some  of  her  father's  possessions.  She  now  says  the  Bible  and  Nobel  Prize  are  too  sacred  to  part  with.Emphasizing  her  deep  love  for  her  brothers,  Bernice  King  said  she'd  ask  them  to  reconsider  their  stance  on  the  heirlooms  and  noted  that  only  one  brother  would  need  to  agree  to  keep  the  items  in  the  family.However,  Bernice  King  told  CNN  she  did  not  foresee  her  and  her  brothers  reaching  any  middle  ground.  She  has  not  spoken  to  them  in  some  time,  she  said.CNN's  attempts  to  reach  the  attorney  for  the  Martin  Luther  King  Estate  were  not  immediately  successful.The  three  King  siblings  make  up  the  surviving  board  of  the  estate.  They  took  a  vote  before  the  lawsuit  over  whether  to  sell  the  items,  which  Bernice  King  lost  1-2.  The  King  brothers  say  that  the  future  of  the  estate  would  be  threatened  if  a  sale  could  not  be  made.No  prospective  buyers  or  dollar  amount  have  been  publicly  disclosed.  Bernice  King  says  she  wants  to  keep  the  items  for  reasons  other  than  money."If  it  was  about  money,  hey,  I  should  have  just  been  quiet  and  took  my  cut  from  the  sale  of  these  items,  but  I  try  to  live  my  life  on  principle."The  case  is  scheduled  to  be  heard  September  29.</TEXT></DOC>

They  can  reject  or  approve  new  voter  ID  laws  and  limits  on  abortion.Additionally,  the  State  House  is  often  a  spring  board  to  the  White  House.  Many  Presidents  --  including  four  of  the  past  six  --  were  governors  first.Here  are  five  gubernatorial  races  to  watch  in  2014:TexasGov.  Rick  Perry  is  retiring,  opening  the  door  for  a  newcomer.  While  Texas  is  a  solidly  Republican  state,  the  liberal  left  is  heavily  involved  as  they  see  a  winner  in  candidate  Wendy  Davis.A  state  Senator,  Davis  rose  to  prominence  last  June  when  she  filibustered  a  bill  that  would  make  it  much  more  difficult  for  Texas  women  to  obtain  an  abortion.  The  left  got  behind  her  and  helped  propel  her  candidacy  for  governor.Stuart  Rothenberg  of  the  non-partisan  Rothenberg  Political  Report  wrote  that  Davis  faces  an  uphill  battle  with  the  still-to-be-determined  Republican  candidate  holding  an  advantage  in  the  reliably  red  state.  Still,  Democrats,  he  said,  have  incentive  to  push  for  her  victory."Democrats  and  liberals  believe  that  long-term  demographic  trends  will  turn  Texas  purple,  and  Davis'  effort  could  speed  up  that  process,  they  hope.  Moreover,  she  could  well  be  a  national  fundraising  machine  for  liberal  groups,  no  matter  how  realistic  her  prospects,"  he  wrote.OhioThe  Buckeye  State  is  a  perennial  battleground  in  presidential  races,  so  anyone  leading  it  factors  into  the  bigger  conversation.  This  year,  Gov.  John  Kasich  is  asking  voters  for  a  second  chance.Elected  in  2010  with  the  support  of  the  tea  party,  the  former  Congressman  initially  championed  conservative  agenda  that  included  dramatic  cuts  to  state  pensions.But  he  ran  into  trouble  with  fellow  Republicans  during  the  2012  presidential  election  when  he  touted  Ohio's  vastly  improved  economy  during  his  time  in  office,  a  talking  point  that  did  not  mesh  with  Republican  presidential  candidate  Mitt  Romney.  His  campaign  focused  heavily  on  U.S.  economic  difficulties.Mostly  ignored,  shifts  emerge  in  the  politics  of  povertyAnd  as  in  any  battleground  state,  the  party  not  in  power  often  has  a  shot.  Polls  show  Kasich  and  the  leading  Democratic  contender,  Ed  FitzGerald,  in  a  close  matchup.A  tough  general  election  fight,  however,  is  not  in  the  cards  yet.  Kasich  must  first  win  a  primary  sought  by  conservativesdisappointed  with  Kasich's  decision  to  expand  Medicaid  for  the  poor.  The  funding  for  that  comes  from  federal  money  made  available  as  part  of  President  Barack  Obama's  health  care  reforms  that  are  detested  by  most  Republicans  and  a  centerpiece  of  their  campaign  overall  to  defeat  Democrats  in  November.  Kasich's  Republican  challenger:  tea  party  leader  Ted  Stevenot.FloridaThe  primary  will  be  the  first  real  test  for  the  governor's  race  in  one  of  the  most  populous  and  politically  important  states.Former  Republican  Gov.  Charlie  Crist  is  now  Democratic  gubernatorial  candidate  Charlie  Crist.Crist  has  a  long  political  history  in  the  Sunshine  State.  Instead  of  running  for  re-election  in  2010,  he  aimed  for  the  Senate.  But  he  was  bested  in  the  GOP  primary  by  tea  party  favorite  Marco  Rubio,  which  led  Crist  to  change  his  affiliation  to  Independent.  He  still  lost  that  election.Now  he's  trying  again  for  the  post  he  once  held.  If  he  wins  his  primary  against  state  Sen.  Nan  Rich,  he'll  face  Republican  incumbent  Rick  Scott,  whose  tenure  has  been  tenuous.A  recent  Tampa  Bay  Times/Bay  News  9  and  AM  820  News  poll  in  the  vote-rich  Tampa  Bay  area  found  that  44%  of  respondents  said  Scott  is  doing  a  "not  so  good"  or  "poor"  job.The  non-partisan  Rothenberg  Political  Report  rates  this  race  as  a  tossup  and  likely  to  be  extremely  expensive.A  competitive  statewide  fight  will  be  very  closely  noted  by  2016  White  House  contenders  --  who  may  include  Rubio  --  to  detect  campaign  and  voter  trends  in  what's  been  a  presidential  battleground  in  the  past.WisconsinRepublican  incumbent  Scott  Walker  is  running  for  re-election  --  again.  This  will  be  his  third  election  in  four  years.  He  was  forced  into  a  recall  election  in  2012  after  Democrats  successfully  forced  a  vote  in  response  to  severe  cuts  in  state  pensions  as  a  budget-cutting  measure.Walker  won  his  recall  bid  with  53%  of  the  vote,  1%  more  than  his  2010  election.While  Cook  rates  this  race  as  a  likely  win  for  Walker,  Democrats  are  rallying  behind  Mary  Burke,  a  member  of  the  Madison  school  board  and  former  Trek  bike  executive.This  race  is  also  notable  because  Walker  could  be  making  a  play  for  a  possible  2016  presidential  run.IllinoisDemocrats  don't  hold  that  many  gubernatorial  seats,  so  keeping  this  one  in  Democratic  hands  is  critical.It  is  a  reliably  Democratic  state  and  home  to  the  President,  so  a  loss  would  be  especially  difficult  for  a  party  that  has  lost  ground  in  state  legislatures  in  recent  years.Whether  they  like  it  or  not,  Democrats  have  incumbent  Pat  Quinn  as  their  candidate.  The  race  is  considered  a  tossup  by  Cook  even  though  Republicans  don't  yet  have  a  strong  candidate.Quinn  has  angered  and  pleased  Democrats  in  the  past  month  alone.  He  signed  a  bill  that  cut  state  pensions,  angering  unions,  and  approved  a  measure  legalizing  same-sex  marriage,  pleasing  social  liberals.The  Chicago  Tribune  wrote  that  his  actions  could  benefit  him  politically.  If  so,  that's  a  stark  shift  from  the  just  a  couple  months  earlier  when  he  tangled  with  the  Democratic-controlled  state  Legislature.The  Rothenberg  Political  Report  wrote  during  Quinn's  tumultuous  fall,  "Democrats'  saving  grace  could  be  the  ineptness  of  the  state  Republican  Party."5  Senate  races  to  watch  in  2014</TEXT></DOC>

For  guests  who  prefer  a  more  traditional  take  on  play,  there's  a  life-size  chess  set  on  the  lawn,  and  a  very  civilized  weekly  Bingo  service,  where  men  age  12  and  up  are  required  to  wear  a  jacket.8  elegant  U.S.  mansion  hotelsHotel  Zetta,  San  Francisco,  CaliforniaThis  months-old  Viceroy  Hotel  Group  property  in  San  Francisco's  Union  Square  neighborhood  was  meant  to  attract  those  traveling  to  the  city  for  business  --  the  startup  variety.  To  appeal  to  that  "work  hard,  play  hard"  mentality,  a  massive  Plinko  wall  greets  guests  in  the  lobby.  The  rest  of  the  hotel's  playful  perks  can  be  found  in  the  sharply  curated  Playroom,  where  Wii  consoles  share  the  space  with  ping-pong  and  pool  tables,  a  massive  assortment  of  board  games  and  life-size  Jenga.  The  phone  booths,  which  have  been  updated  with  Samsung  tablets  that  will  allow  users  to  Skype,  are  a  nice  touch.  Heading  up  to  your  room?  Have  an  Atari  game  sent  up  on  request.10  record-setting  natural  wondersMartinhal  Resort,  Sagres,  PortugalLocated  on  the  southwest  corner  of  continental  Europe  in  the  Portuguese  fishing  town  of  Sagres,  Martinhal  Resort  is  a  true  family-friendly  destination,  where  every  member  of  the  brood  can  find  something  to  do.  Everything  from  stand-up  paddling  to  kayaking  to  jeep  safaris  to  surfing  to  Pilates  on  the  beach  are  on  offer.  Or  give  Padel  a  try.  This  racquet  sport,  popular  in  the  Iberian  Peninsula  and  Latin  America,  is  a  combination  of  tennis  and  racquetball.  Martinhal  has  two  glass-sided  courts  in  which  to  learn.  The  resort's  Village  Square  acts  as  its  entertainment  hub,  where  children  can  let  loose  at  the  playground  while  older  children  head  to  the  Blue  Room  to  play  foosball  and  video  games.  Bonus:  All  dining  venues  here  are  outfitted  with  play  areas  separate  but  visible  from  and  near  to  the  actual  dining  room,  allowing  adults  to  eat  in  peace  without  totally  losing  sight  of  the  kids.Primland  Resort,  Meadows  of  Dan,  VirginiaThis  resort  in  Virginia's  Blue  Ridge  Mountains  sits  on  12,000  acres  --  that's  roughly  the  size  of  Bermuda  --  so  there's  always  a  variety  of  activities  available  for  guests.  One  of  the  most  fun,  given  the  abundance  of  space,  is  a  game  of  geocaching,  a  high-tech  treasure  hunt  in  which  a  GPS  device  helps  participants  locate  hidden  canisters,  or  geocaches,  that  reveal  interesting  information  about  the  resort's  surroundings  as  well  as  local  fauna  and  flora.  Some  of  the  geocaches  might  reveal  a  puzzle  to  solve  for  an  added  challenge.  In  addition,  clay  shooters  will  enjoy  the  Game  Trail  Virtual  Simulation  Hunt,  featuring  10  challenging  scenarios.  Younger  guests,  on  the  other  hand,  can  take  on  the  Blue  Ridge  Tree  Climbing  contest.7  secret  Caribbean  islandsYotel,  New  YorkThis  pod-style  hotel  right  next  to  the  Lincoln  Tunnel  may  not  win  points  for  space  --  a  luxury  in  New  York  City  (though  its  4,000  square-foot  terrace  is  the  largest  hotel  terrace  in  town),  but  it  certainly  delivers  if  it's  whimsical  playfulness  guests  are  after.  For  example,  luggage  storage  is  manned  by  a  mechanical  robot,  programmed  to  collect  suitcases  and  backpacks  and  stuff  them  into  their  assigned  lockers.  But  Yotel's  pièce  de  résistance  is  its  Lego  wall,  which  was  unveiled  in  January  2014.  The  30-foot  long  lobby  wall  includes  thousands  of  colorful  bricks,  tools  for  Yotel  guests'  next  masterpieces.  Some  have  drafted  messages  while  others  used  the  Lego  bricks  to  create  more  ambitious  visuals  (flags,  animals,  cartoon  characters,  even  NYC  landmarks).  See  some  examples  of  them  online.Travaasa,  Austin,  TexasPlayful  activities  at  the  original  Travaasa  property  (there's  also  one  in  Hawaii)  are  heart-pounding  but  fun.  Take  the  mechanical  bull  exercise  as  an  example.  Guests  who  have  completed  Pilates  or  the  core-conditioning  workout  can  take  on  this  core-strengthening  task  --  cowboy  hat  not  included.  There's  also  an  adventurous  bike  track  for  riders  of  all  levels  and  the  renowned  Prickly  Pear  Challenge  Course  --  with  its  multistep,  vertical  climbing  elements  and  zip-line  finish  --  is  sure  to  push  all  sorts  of  physical  boundaries.  To  unwind,  guests  can  always  participate  in  a  game  of  Texas  Hold'em.Four  Seasons  Hotel,  Hampshire,  EnglandThe  Four  Seasons  property  in  the  English  countryside  is  so  committed  to  its  family-friendly  programing  that  it  has  planned  activities  during  key  school  holidays.  So,  it  might  be  a  Segway  adventure  during  the  Easter  break  or  themed  tea  parties  during  the  February  half-term  holiday.  There's  also  Henry's  Hangout  --  a  wooden  playground  stocked  with  swings,  slides  and  a  climbing  wall.  "Tweens"  may  prefer  the  Rose  Cottage  with  its  games.  The  grand  estate,  however,  is  better  suited  for  outdoorsy  endeavors  --  think  boat  rides  on  the  canals,  croquet,  falconry,  quad  bikes  --  especially  when  a  new  equestrian  center  opens  this  spring,  featuring  stabling  space  for  12  horses  and  a  petting  zoo.Hotel  Unique,  São  Paulo,  BrazilHotel  Unique  lives  up  to  its  name.  One  of  the  most  design-forward  hotels  in  the  world  has  an  exterior  resembling  a  slice  of  watermelon.  While  this  hotel  doesn't  offer  the  games  of  many  of  the  hotels  on  our  list,  its  curvaceous  silhouette  merits  a  mention  --  and  takes  the  edge  off  the  see-and-be-seen  vibe  that  attracts  local  glitterati  to  the  rooftop  terrace  and  bar.  Many  guests  have  not  been  able  to  resist  trying  to  slide  on  a  sloping  wall  near  suites  on  the  edges  of  the  property.  And  fortunately,  the  multicolored  indoor  pool  has  something  few  city  pools  do:  a  slide.</TEXT></DOC>

It  addresses  the  spread  of  the  flu,  not  its  severity.However,  20  states  experienced  a  high  proportion  of  outpatient  visits  to  health  care  providers  for  flu-like  illnesses.  The  most  severe  activity  seems  to  be  located  in  the  Southeastern  states.So  far,  "it's  a  typical  influenza  season,  if  I  can  use  that  word,"  Dr.  Michael  Jhung,  a  medical  officer  in  the  CDC's  flu  division,  told  CNN  last  week.The  season  usually  begins  in  the  winter  months  and  peaks  in  January  or  February.The  only  atypical  thing  seen  this  year  is  that  the  most  common  strain  has  been  H1N1,  which  became  known  as  swine  flu  during  a  2009  outbreak."It's  the  same  virus  that  we  saw  in  2009  that  caused  the  pandemic,"  Jhung  said.  At  the  time,  it  was  called  swine  flu  since  it  was  seen  for  the  first  time  in  humans.But  since  then,  "it's  established  itself  very  nicely  in  the  human  population,"  Jhung  said.  "We've  seen  it  every  season  since  2009  in  people."  The  virus  is  no  longer  referred  to  as  swine  flu,  but  instead  as  a  human  seasonal  virus.The  strain  is  so  common  that  it  was  included  in  this  year's  vaccination,  he  said.5  ways  to  combat  flu  in  your  homeTwo  new  pediatric  flu  deaths  were  reported  to  the  CDC  last  week,  according  to  the  report.  One  was  associated  with  the  H1N1  virus;  another  was  associated  with  an  influenza  A  strain.  Six  pediatric  flu  deaths  have  been  reported  since  September  29,  according  to  the  CDC.  The  agency  does  not  track  adult  deaths  related  to  the  flu,  although  some  states  do,  and  deaths  have  been  reported.The  exact  number  of  flu-related  adult  deaths  is  hard  to  track  and  varies  from  year  to  year.  The  CDC  has  estimated  that  from  1976  through  2007,  between  3,000  and  49,000  people  died  of  flu-related  causes."It  depends  on  the  season;  it  depends  on  the  virus,"  Jhung  said.Last  year,  381,000  people  were  hospitalized  and  171  children  died  in  what's  being  called  a  relatively  severe  season.However,  the  CDC  estimates  that  flu  vaccination  prevented  6.6  million  illnesses  last  year,  3.2  million  doctor  visits  and  at  least  79,000  hospitalizations.Flu  vaccines  are  recommended  for  everyone  6  months  and  older,  especially  pregnant  women  and  those  at  high  risk  of  complications,  including  the  elderly,  children  younger  than  5  years  and  those  with  underlying  medical  conditions  such  as  asthma  or  diabetes.Antiviral  medications  are  a  good  treatment  if  you  do  get  sick,  Jhung  said,  particularly  those  at  high  risk  for  complications.  Ideally,  antivirals  should  be  started  within  two  days  of  when  symptoms  appear.CNN's  Caleb  Hellerman  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Rukhsar,  4,  is  the  final  documented  case  of  polio  in  India.Her  face  has  appeared  in  newspapers  and  on  television.  She's  been  invited  to  national  events  by  Rotary  International,  the  organization  that  led  the  effort  to  rid  India  of  polio.  She  is  a  literal  poster  child,  an  inspiration,  a  symbol  of  a  feat  that  no  doctor  or  health  official  thought  possible  even  a  few  years  ago.Apart  from  the  publicity,  though,  Rukhsar's  life  has  hardly  changed,  her  future  still  a  question  mark.She  is  used  to  seeing  health  officials  and  reporters  arrive  on  foot  at  her  home  in  Shahpara,  a  village  in  the  Indian  state  of  West  Bengal.  On  the  day  we  visited,  she  dressed  herself  in  a  long  green  printed  dress,  marred  only  by  a  tear  at  the  shoulder.  She  oiled  her  hair  and  pulled  it  back  with  plastic  barrettes.  She  did  it  all  herself  when  she  learned  we  were  on  our  way.Her  parents,  Abdul  Shah,  32,  and  Shobejan  Begum,  30,  blame  themselves  for  their  child's  suffering.  They  had  their  other  children  vaccinated,  but  not  Rukhsar.  She  was  a  sickly  child,  in  and  out  of  hospital  with  liver  infections  and  diarrhea.  They  thought  it  safer  not  to  subject  her  to  more  medication.It  wasn't  until  little  Rukhsar's  right  foot  swelled  and  twisted  in  early  2011  that  her  parents  took  her  to  a  hospital  in  nearby  Beleghata  for  tests.  She  was  just  18  months  old  when  doctors  confirmed  the  worst:  Rukhsar  had  polio.Polio  is  caused  by  a  virus  that  attacks  the  brain  and  spinal  cord  cells  that  move  joints  and  muscles.  About  one-third  of  those  who  contract  polio  in  India  are  left  paralyzed  --  as  was  Rukhsar."Everything  was  our  fault,"  explains  her  father.  "I  thought  she  would  never  walk  again."'Hell  of  a  big  deal'When  a  global  effort  to  end  polio  was  launched  in  1988,  the  disease  crippled  more  than  200,000  children  every  year  in  India.  Almost  two  decades  later,  in  2009,  India  still  reported  half  of  the  world's  new  cases  --  741  out  of  1,604.India  has  millions  of  poor  and  uneducated  people.  The  population  is  booming.  Large  areas  lack  hygiene  and  good  sanitation,  and  polio  spreads  through  contaminated  water.  Many  health  experts  predicted  India  would  be  the  last  country  in  the  world  to  get  rid  of  polio.They  were  wrong.Since  Rukhsar's  diagnosis  three  years  ago,  India  has  not  seen  another  new  case  of  polio.  On  March  27,  the  World  Health  Organization  will  formally  announce  the  end  of  polio  in  India  and  proclaim  another  one  of  its  global  regions  --  Southeast  Asia  --  free  of  the  disease.  Afghanistan,  Pakistan  and  Nigeria  are  the  only  three  countries  that  have  not  eradicated  polio,  leaving  the  Eastern  Mediterranean  and  Africa  the  last  two  WHO  regions  with  the  disease.The  last  time  WHO  made  a  similar  announcement  was  in  2002,  when  the  European  region  was  declared  polio-free.Rotary  International  says  the  upcoming  declaration  will  be  a  milestone  for  a  nation  that  was  once  the  epicenter  of  the  disease.India's  journey  from  200,000  to  zero  has  not  been  easy,  says  Deepak  Kapur,  a  businessman  who  heads  Rotary's  polio  campaign  in  India."It's  a  tremendous  achievement,"  he  says.  "India  is  a  hell  of  a  big  deal."Kapur  has  been  at  the  helm  of  India's  campaign  since  2001.  When  he  started,  he  was  told  India  was  holding  the  world  hostage,  that  the  planet  could  not  be  polio-free  until  its  second  most  populous  nation  had  eliminated  the  disease.The  western  part  of  Uttar  Pradesh  state  was  the  worst,  Kapur  says.  At  one  time,  scientists  documented  that  the  single  worst  pocket  of  polio,  the  city  of  Moradabad,  had  exported  the  virus  to  every  continent.Now,  Kapur  says,  the  three  remaining  nations  where  polio  still  exists  can  learn  from  India.Three  keys  to  successWestern  nations  conquered  polio  so  long  ago  that  its  name  is  unknown  to  younger  generations.America  experienced  the  height  of  polio  in  the  1940s  and  '50s,  when  about  35,000  people  became  disabled  every  year.  Fear  and  panic  spread  and  parents  were  known  to  warn  their  children  to  not  drink  from  public  water  fountains,  avoid  swimming  pools  and  stay  away  from  crowded  public  places  like  movie  theaters.  Perhaps  the  most  famous  case  of  polio  in  America  was  Franklin  Delano  Roosevelt,  the  first  president  with  a  significant  physical  disability.The  development  of  the  Salk  and  Sabine  vaccines  helped  lead  to  eradication  of  polio  in  the  United  States  in  1979.  In  India,  too,  vaccination  was  critical."There  were  three  keys  to  our  success,"  Kapur  says.  "Immunize,  immunize  and  immunize."But  the  challenges  in  India  went  way  beyond  getting  170  million  children  vaccinated  each  year  and  needing  2  million  health  workers  on  the  case.  They  went  beyond  securing  $2.3  billion  in  government  funding.The  oral  vaccine  must  be  kept  cold,  and  many  places  in  India  do  not  have  electricity  --  and  even  those  that  do  experience  frequent  power  cuts.  Each  vaccine  costs  only  12  cents,  but  refrigerating  them  was  a  major  problem,  says  Dr.  Mathew  Varghese,  an  orthopedic  surgeon  who  runs  India's  last  dedicated  polio  ward  at  St.  Stephen's  Hospital  in  New  Delhi.India  was  able  to  come  up  with  innovative  ideas  --  like  refrigerators  powered  by  kerosene  --  to  get  vaccinations  to  remote  villages  not  unlike  the  one  where  Rukhsar  lives.And  then  there  was  the  campaign  to  educate.  Rumors  had  spread  in  Muslim  communities  about  the  polio  vaccine.  Some  Muslims  believed  it  made  women  infertile  and  that  the  Indian  government  was  using  it  to  curb  a  minority  population.To  combat  such  false  beliefs,  health  workers  began  a  dialog  with  clerics.  They  were  able  to  build  trust  and  persuade  the  clerics  to  put  drops  of  the  vaccine  in  their  own  grandchildren's  mouths  so  their  followers  could  see  nothing  bad  would  happen.For  Varghese,  all  this  means  that  the  makeup  of  his  polio  ward  has  changed.  The  patients  tend  to  be  older  now  since  there  have  been  no  new  cases  reported  since  2011.Varghese  has  operated  on  thousands  of  twisted  and  mangled  bodies,  on  patients  who  are  forced  to  crawl  on  all  fours.  Polio,  he  says,  robs  a  person  of  dignity."It's  terrible  to  have  a  childhood  ruined,"  he  says,  inspecting  the  progress  of  Haseen  Jahan.  She's  lived  with  polio  23  of  her  25  years.  She  used  to  press  her  hand  to  her  thigh  when  she  walked,  to  keep  her  left  leg  down.  Her  left  foot  used  to  point  outwards.In  her  dreams  she  walked  upright.  In  her  dreams,  she  danced,  even  wore  pants,  something  she  was  not  able  to  do  before  because  of  the  way  her  limbs  were  bent.Varghese  straightened  her  leg  with  his  orthopedic  surgical  skills."I'll  be  able  to  walk  straight,"  she  says,  laughing,  "just  like  you."Varghese  moves  on  to  the  other  polio  patients  occupying  the  16  beds  reserved  for  them  at  the  missionary-run  hospital.  Some  had  knees  that  had  twisted  upward  to  their  hips.  Others  could  not  even  stand.  When  they  leave  here,  they  will  embark  on  lives  that  were  previously  unimaginable."I  would  be  happy  to  go  out  of  business  --  this  kind  of  business,"  he  says,  though  he  knows  he  will  be  seeing  polio  patients  until  the  day  he  retires.  Half  of  India's  21  million  physically  disabled  people  are  that  way  because  of  polio.Varghese  has  never  met  Rukhsar.  But  he  is  relieved  to  know  she  is  the  last.Poster  childIn  Shahpara,  Rukhsar  plays  with  her  brothers  and  sisters  and  other  children  on  the  bone-dry  earth,  the  dirt  forming  clouds  beneath  their  feet.  The  effects  of  polio  were  not  severe  as  they  could  have  been,  and  after  exhaustive  therapy,  Rukhsar  is  able  to  use  her  legs.She  is  not  unlike  the  other  barefoot  children  in  this  village  of  palms  and  ponds  except  that  she  has  a  limp.  Her  right  leg  is  shorter  than  her  left,  a  condition  that  is  common  with  polio  patients.  She  complains  that  her  right  foot  hurts  when  she  runs  and  jumps.Learning  from  their  own  mistake,  Rukhsar's  parents  have  become  advocates  for  polio  vaccinations  in  their  part  of  the  world.  Shah  is  thankful  his  daughter  was  not  left  immobile,  but  still,  he  worries  for  her  future.He  is  a  poor  man,  and  like  most  men  and  women  in  this  village,  he  makes  about  $40  a  month  embroidering  saris  --  far  less  than  the  brocaded  and  beaded  garments  sell  for.  He  knows  he  must  save  money  for  future  health  care  needs  and  do  all  he  can  to  make  sure  Rukhsar  is  educated.  He  is  certain  he  will  face  obstacles  in  finding  a  groom  for  a  daughter  with  a  disability.America,  too,  had  poster  children  for  polio  at  a  time  when  the  country  was  racing  to  stamp  out  the  disease.  In  the  1950s,  two  girls  in  matching  gingham  jumpers  appeared  in  an  anti-polio  campaign.  Pam  was  shown  loosening  her  sister  Patricia's  leg  brace.They  were  faces,  just  like  Rukhsar,  of  a  disease  that  now  is  on  the  brink  of  global  eradication.  There  is  no  cure  for  polio,  but  the  two  American  sisters  were  able  to  overcome  the  crippling  nature  of  the  disease.Now  it's  Rukhsar's  turn  to  lead  a  full  life.  Without  the  interference  of  polio.Follow  Moni  Basu  on  Twitter.</TEXT></DOC>

Not  everyone  who  has  selected  a  health  plan  has  paid  for  it  yet,  officials  said.Nevertheless,  Obama  claimed  victory  at  a  White  House  ceremony,  saying  the  program  approved  by  Congress  in  2010  --  with  no  Republican  support  and  vilified  relentlessly  by  the  GOP  as  government  overreach  --  has  been  a  force  for  good.He  said  it  wasn't  perfect,  acknowledging  the  early  difficulties  in  selecting  a  policy  on  HealthCare.gov,  and  he  predicted  more  hurdles  in  carrying  it  out.But  the  overall  goal  of  starting  to  narrow  the  gap  between  those  with  health  coverage  and  those  without  it  has  begun,  and  millions  of  Americans  are  embracing  it,  Obama  said."That's  what  the  (law)  is  all  about,  making  sure  all  of  us  and  all  our  fellow  citizens  can  count  on  the  security  of  health  care  when  we  get  sick,"  he  said,  noting  that  the  "law  is  doing  what  it's  supposed  to  do.  It's  working."The  numbersThe  nonpartisan  Congressional  Budget  Office  originally  projected  the  7  million  enrollment  target  for  the  October  through  March  period,  which  was  adopted  by  the  administration.Expectations  plummeted  throughout  the  fall  and  into  this  year  after  the  early  website  problems,  which  Obama  called  "several  lost  weeks."But  signs  of  a  pickup  began  in  late  January  and  continued  into  February  and  early  March  despite  a  fierce  campaign  by  Republicans  to  demonize  the  law  as  unworkable.Administration  officials  said  an  absolute  crush  of  people  pushed  the  program  --  Obama's  chief  domestic  accomplishment  --  over  the  finish  line  at  the  11th  hour.  More  than  4.8  million  visits  were  made  to  HealthCare.gov  on  Monday  alone.Officials  stressed  that  the  7.1  million  figure  represents  only  those  who  signed  up  for  coverage.  Those  who  came  in  late  and  encountered  technical  problems  have  until  mid-April  to  complete  the  process.  Private  insurers  are  providing  the  coverage.Health  of  Human  Services  Secretary  Kathleen  Sebelius  told  an  Oklahoma  TV  station  on  Monday  that  insurers  were  reporting  that  80%  to  90%  had  paid  so  far.The  law  also  includes  expanded  Medicaid  insurance  for  the  poor  in  many  states,  but  those  participants  are  not  part  of  the  sign-up  total.The  politicsRepublicans,  especially  in  the  House,  have  waged  a  nonstop  campaign  to  repeal  or  roll  back  the  Affordable  Care  Act,  saying  it  was  rammed  through  Congress  without  their  input  and  now  is  another  illustration  of  big  government  at  its  worst.They  have  made  it  a  rallying  cry  of  their  fall  campaign  to  expand  their  majority  in  the  House  and  reclaim  the  Senate.  It  has  energized  the  base,  and  the  issue  informs  the  commentary  of  potential  GOP  candidates  for  president  as  well.Michael  Steel,  a  spokesman  for  House  Speaker  John  Boehner,  an  Ohio  Republican,  said  in  a  statement  that  the  law  "continues  to  harm  the  American  people"  despite  Obama's  "victory  lap."  He  said  costs  are  not  going  down,  as  Obama  contends,  and  people  are  losing  insurance  plans  they  preferred  and  small  businesses  are  chafing  under  the  law's  requirements."That's  why  we  must  replace  this  fundamentally  flawed  law  with  patient-centered  solutions  that  will  actually  lower  health  care  costs  and  help  create  jobs,"  Steel  said.Democrats  on  the  stump,  especially  those  who  voted  for  it  and  now  find  themselves  in  tight  races,  have  recalibrated  their  position  with  Obama's  presidency  not  much  help  to  them  with  voters  overall  in  their  states.But  Obama  said  at  the  White  House  that  the  law  is  good  for  the  country,  regardless  of  politics,  and  that  the  numbers  show  Americans  want  it  and  that  it's  "here  to  stay.""I  don't  get  it.  Why  are  folks  working  so  hard  for  people  not  to  have  health  insurance?  Why  are  they  so  mad  about  the  idea  of  people  having  health  insurance?"  he  asked.What  people  thinkAmericans  are  divided  over  how  they  view  the  law.  Last  month,  46%  said  they  viewed  it  unfavorably,  down  4  points  since  January,  and  38%  said  they  viewed  it  favorably,  up  4  points  over  the  same  time  period,  according  to  a  Kaiser  Family  Foundation  poll.Those  who  held  unfavorable  views  cited  concerns  about  costs  (23%),  opposition  to  the  individual  mandate  (17%),  and  concerns  about  government  intrusion  (10%).Those  with  favorable  views  cited  expanded  access  to  health  care  and  health  insurance  (61%),  followed  by  the  perception  that  it  will  control  health  care  costs  and  make  it  more  affordable  (10%)  and  that  it  will  be  good  for  the  country  (7%).The  telephone  survey  of  1,504  adults  was  conducted  March  11  to  17  and  had  a  sampling  error  of  plus  or  minus  3  points.Professor  Uwe  Reinhardt,  a  health  economist  at  Princeton  University,  said  he  was  not  surprised  at  the  last-minute  rush  to  sign  up."I  think  the  prayer  of  the  conservatives  that  this  would  collapse  just  didn't  get  answered,"  he  told  CNN.  "It  fills  a  need."He  predicted  conservatives  would  chip  away  at  whatever  the  number  proves  to  be."It's  all  just,  some  people  hate  Obama  and  anything  he  does,"  he  said.The  detailsThe  administration  did  not  release  details  about  the  numbers,  including  the  number  of  younger  Americans  who  signed  up.  That  metric  is  crucial  for  making  the  program  work  economically  because  premiums  from  younger,  healthier  participants  are  needed  to  make  the  program  work  for  older  people  who  use  the  health  care  system  more.An  official  briefing  reporters  on  the  condition  of  anonymity  said  insurance  companies  were  confident  the  percentage  of  young  people  was  sufficient  for  the  insurance  marketplaces  to  function  properly.Obamacare's  primary  goal  is  to  reduce  the  ranks  of  the  45  million  uninsured.Until  now,  many  Americans  with  pre-existing  conditions  had  to  pay  sky-high  prices  for  insurance,  if  they  could  get  any  at  all.  Often,  insurers  branded  them  "uninsurable."The  surgeThe  administration  pulled  out  all  the  stops  in  the  final  weeks  of  the  enrollment  period  --  an  effort  one  official  equated  to  a  "get  out  the  vote"  campaign  before  an  election.Administration  officials  took  to  the  radio  airwaves  by  participating  in  400  interviews,  enlisted  celebrities  and  athletes  to  promote  the  law,  and  engaged  people  on  social  media.  And  Obama's  interview  on  the  online  comedycast  "Between  Two  Ferns"  resulted  in  the  so-called  Zach  Galifianakis  effect,  resulting  in  33  million  views  of  his  mock  interview  with  the  comedian.The  interview  with  Galifianakis,  along  with  a  promotional  push  from  Miami  Heat  forward  LeBron  James,  were  cited  by  administration  officials  as  two  of  the  most  effective  components  in  the  push  to  enroll  young  Americans  on  the  health  care  exchanges.  The  overall  effort,  the  White  House  said,  surpassed  their  expectations  in  terms  of  last-minute  sign-ups.By  the  numbers:  The  final  Obamacare  pushRepublicans  hit  a  nerve  when  it  comes  to  Obamacare5  things  the  polls  tell  us  about  ObamacareThis  article  was  based  on  reporting  by  Jim  Acosta  in  Washington  and  was  written  by  Kevin  Liptak  and  Tom  Watkins.

The  bulk  collection  of  telephone  records  was  criticized  as  a  major  breach  of  Americans'  privacy,  and  Obama  vowed  to  make  changes  to  the  program  while  maintaining  the  ability  to  keep  the  country  safe  from  terrorist  attacks."I  have  decided  that  the  best  path  forward  is  that  the  government  should  not  collect  or  hold  this  data  in  bulk,"  Obama  said  in  a  written  statement.  "Instead,  the  data  should  remain  at  the  telephone  companies  for  the  length  of  time  it  currently  does  today."A  months-long  review  led  to  the  decision,  which  Obama  announced  while  on  an  overseas  tour  of  Europe  and  Saudi  Arabia.  Congress  would  have  to  approve  the  plan;  this  week,  the  House  Intelligence  Committee  introduced  similar  legislation  that  would  end  government  collection  of  phone  data.Officials  said  the  White  House-proposed  changes  would  require  a  federal  court  to  grant  its  approval  before  the  government  could  obtain  phone  records  from  carriers.  Those  records  contain  information  about  calls  made  to  individual  phone  numbers  but  do  not  include  the  content  of  the  calls.Among  the  provisions  included  in  the  White  House's  suggested  law  is  an  "emergency"  clause  allowing  the  government  to  collect  phone  data  without  court  approval.  A  senior  administration  official,  speaking  anonymously,  said  high-level  government  officials  would  determine  what  situations  amount  to  national  security  emergencies,  though  the  official  didn't  offer  a  definition  of  what  might  constitute  such  an  occasion.Obama,  Congress  working  on  changes  to  NSAUnder  the  new  rules,  phone  companies  would  be  compelled  to  provide  technical  assistance  to  the  government  during  the  collection  process.  That  includes  making  sure  the  information  is  produced  quickly  and  in  a  usable  format.A  U.S.  official  said  the  White  House  had  "fairly  high-level  discussions  with  some  of  the  providers"  to  discuss  the  changes  and  how  they'd  affect  individual  businesses.Initial  industry  reaction  to  the  proposed  changes  was  largely  lukewarm.  A  spokesman  for  Sprint  said  the  company  was  reviewing  the  proposal,  while  AT&T  declined  to  comment.Randal  Milch,  general  counsel  and  executive  vice  president  at  Verizon,  said  the  telecom  giant  supported  the  plan  to  end  government  collection  of  data  but  added  that  the  new  rules  "should  not  require  companies  to  store  data  for  longer  than,  or  in  formats  that  differ  from,  what  they  already  do  for  business  purposes.""If  Verizon  receives  a  valid  request  for  business  records,  we  will  respond  in  a  timely  way,  but  companies  should  not  be  required  to  create,  analyze  or  retain  records  for  reasons  other  than  business  purposes,"  he  wrote.Because  the  current  authorization  for  the  government  phone  data  collection  program  expires  this  week,  officials  said  the  government  would  seek  an  additional  90-day  approval  period  while  the  proposed  legislation  makes  its  way  through  Congress.On  Tuesday,  Reps.  Mike  Rogers  of  Michigan  and  Dutch  Ruppersberger  of  Maryland  --  the  top  Republican  and  Democrat  on  the  House  Intelligence  Committee  --  unveiled  their  own  plan  for  ending  the  automatic  NSA  collection  of  phone  metadata.The  issue  touches  on  deep  political  and  ideological  fissures  between  Republicans  and  Democrats,  promising  an  extended  battle  in  Congress  over  the  necessary  legislation,  especially  in  an  election  year.On  Thursday,  Republican  Sen.  Rand  Paul  took  harsh  aim  at  Obama's  record  on  privacy  as  the  President  was  meeting  with  Pope  Francis  in  Rome."@BarackObama  to  @Pontifex:  Forgive  me  father  for  I  have  spied.  #NSA,"  tweeted  Paul,  who's  been  one  of  the  fiercest  critics  of  the  NSA  spying  programs  that  Snowden  helped  reveal.Those  leaks  unleashed  a  political  firestorm,  with  privacy  advocates  and  others  calling  the  NSA  surveillance  programs  a  violation  of  constitutional  rights.  In  particular,  many  Americans  feared  inevitable  abuse  of  a  system  in  which  the  government  collected  billions  of  phone  records  for  possible  review  in  terrorism  investigations.Snowden,  now  living  in  Russia  while  seeking  asylum  from  U.S.  prosecution,  has  repeatedly  described  the  surveillance  programs  illuminated  by  his  leaks  as  unconstitutional.Several  legal  challenges  have  been  mounted  against  the  NSA  programs,  and  some  of  those  cases  could  reach  the  Supreme  Court  in  coming  years  to  set  up  a  judicial  review  of  the  constitutional  limits  of  government  surveillance  in  the  post-9/11  era.Opinion:  Get  the  government  out  of  your  phone  recordsCNN's  Tom  Cohen  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Travis  the  chimp,  which  had  appeared  in  television  commercials  for  Coca-Cola  and  Old  Navy,  jumped  on  Nash,  biting  and  mauling  her.Police  later  fatally  shot  Travis  to  stop  the  attack,  which  left  Nash  without  hands,  a  nose,  lips  or  eyelids."I  remember  laying  in  the  room,  and  I  remember  sometimes  I  would  try  to  scratch  my  leg,  and  then  I  wasn't  feeling  it,"  she  said."It's  a  different  world  to  not  be  able  to  see  again  or  to  use  your  hands  and  do  things  for  yourself  that  you  have  to  depend  on  other  people  for  help  now,"  Nash  said.The  seven-minute  video,  released  to  Connecticut  state  legislators,  features  an  interview  with  Nash  and  footage  of  her  walking  around  the  private  medical  facility  where  she  lives  and  receives  daily  assistance  for  her  injuries.Representatives  for  Nash  will  present  her  case  to  the  Connecticut  State  Judiciary  Committee  on  Friday  in  hopes  that  legislators  will  allow  her  to  proceed  with  a  $150  million  lawsuit  against  the  state.  By  law,  anyone  seeking  to  sue  the  state  of  Connecticut  must  seek  permission  to  do  so.Since  the  attack  five  years  ago,  Nash  has  had  numerous  surgeries,  including  a  face  transplant.  She  sued  Sandra  Herold,  the  owner  of  the  chimp,  and  received  $4  million  for  her  injuries,  but  according  to  spokesman  Shelly  Sindland,  that  settlement  doesn't  even  begin  to  cover  the  expenses  for  her  treatment.Part  of  the  $150  million  she's  seeking  would  fund  a  hand  transplant,  which  doctors  unsuccessfully  attempted  at  the  time  of  her  face  transplant.  Nash  hopes  they  will  be  able  to  try  again."I  want  ...  to  be  able  to  do  more  on  my  own,"  Nash  said.Nash  is  still  waiting  for  an  opportunity  to  square  off  against  the  state  for  injuries  she  contends  could've  been  prevented.Sindland  said  authorities  at  the  Department  of  Energy  and  Environmental  Protection  ignored  a  memo  sent  in  October  2008,  four  months  before  the  attack,  from  Connecticut  state  biologist  Elaine  Hinsch  that  said  Travis  the  chimp  was  "an  accident  waiting  to  happen."The  state,  Sindland  alleges,  "knew  that  the  chimp  was  a  danger"  but  didn't  do  anything  to  remove  it  from  the  home.Dennis  Schain,  director  of  communications  for  the  Department  of  Energy  and  Environmental  Protection,  told  CNN  he  is  aware  of  the  memo,  but  he  said  all  statements  from  the  case  must  come  from  the  state  Attorney  General's  Office.In  a  statement  to  CNN,  Connecticut  attorney  general  spokeswoman  Jaclyn  Falkowski  said,  "The  legal  question  in  this  case  is:  Did  the  state  owe  a  legal  duty  to  protect  Ms.  Nash  from  attack  by  a  privately  owned  chimp  on  private  property?  Under  well-settled  law,  it  did  not.""While  we  have  the  utmost  sympathy  for  Charla  Nash,  we  do  not  believe  that  the  state  is  liable  for  Ms.  Nash's  injuries.  To  decide  otherwise  would  set  a  very  dangerous  precedent,  exposing  the  state  and  its  taxpayers  to  unlimited  liability  and  costly  litigation."In  June,  the  Office  of  the  Claims  Commissioner  denied  Nash  her  request  to  sue  the  state  for  $150  million.Friday's  appeal  is  the  last  opportunity  for  her  to  get  permission  to  move  forward  with  a  lawsuit,  and  even  if  it  makes  it  through  committee,  it  would  then  have  to  be  voted  through  both  the  state's  House  and  Senate  before  moving  forward."I'm  hoping  the  legislation  will  allow  me  to  have  my  day  in  court,"  Nash  said.Face  transplant  patients:  Where  are  they  now?CNN's  Haimy  Assefa  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

"I  would  be  surprised  if  that  happened  again."Moments  after  Beyonce  finished  her  performance  last  year,  the  New  Orleans  Superdome  went  dark  for  35  minutes."Not  guilty,"  says  Hamilton,  a  native  of  Blackpool,  England,  who  began  his  career  with  the  BBC."The  only  thing  I  can  say  with  certainty  was  that  the  electricity  going  out  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  halftime  show  because  we  were  on  generator  power,"  said  Hamilton,  who  also  directed  last  year's  show.  "It  was  a  conscious  decision,  and  it  was  an  excellent  decision."The  funniest  tweets  of  the  #Blackout  ...  er  ...  Super  BowlMore  than  110.5  million  people  worldwide  watched  the  halftime  show  last  year.  Only  2012's  performance  by  Madonna  drew  more  viewers,  and  Beyonce's  performance  --  and  the  blackout  that  followed  --  generated  229,000  tweets  per  minute  on  Twitter,  its  second  most-tweeted  moment  ever.The  production  is  something  of  a  technological  marvel  in  and  of  itself.Last  year,  700  people  transformed  the  field  at  the  Superdome  into  a  concert  stage  incorporating  lasers,  strobes,  pyrotechnics  and  a  preprogrammed  stage  floor  that  rose  to  become  a  24-foot  by  32-foot  video  wall.Hamilton  is  no  stranger  to  such  on-the-fly  productions.In  addition  to  several  Super  Bowl  halftimes,  he's  directed  the  Academy  Awards,  the  MTV  Video  Music  Awards  and  live  concert  films  for  artists  such  as  the  Rolling  Stones  and  U2.  In  2012,  he  worked  with  movie  director  Danny  Boyle,  heading  up  the  televised  versions  of  the  Olympic  opening  and  closing  ceremonies.This  year's  Bruno  Mars  production  will  be  no  less  complex  than  last  year's,  said  Hamilton.  But  don't  be  surprised  if  the  high-tech  nature  of  the  show  isn't  in  your  face  the  whole  time."With  the  kind  of  stuff  that  I  do,  technology  is  amazing.  But  at  the  end  of  the  day,  stories  are  way  more  powerful,"  he  said.  "So,  if  you've  got  somebody  on  a  stage  crying  because  an  award  means  so  much  to  them,  or  an  artist  on  stage  singing  an  incredibly  powerful  song  to  an  audience  that's  with  them  --  sometimes  you  just  need  one  shot,  one  light  and  an  amazing  performer.""Technology's  massively  important,"  Hamiltion  continued.  "You  rely  on  it."  But  even  as  the  technology  at  his  disposal  has  improved,  Hamilton  says  he's  come  to  look  at  it  differently."Back  in  the  day,  I  let  the  technology  lead  me,"  he  said.  "Now,  I  always  prefer  the  story  or  the  music  or  the  show  to  lead  me.  Now,  in  my  own  head,  it's  the  story  first,  the  concept  first,  and  the  technology  is  second."Technology  allows  you  to  do  things  now  you  could  have  never  done  before.  So  there's  definitely  a  yin  and  a  yang  to  it."In  some  ways,  what  Hamilton  does  is  simultaneously  the  same  and  the  exact  opposite  of  what  a  movie  director  does.For  a  movie,  a  shoot  can  last  for  weeks,  or  months,  with  weeks  more  of  post-production  after  that.  On  the  flip  side,  directing  a  live  event  means  months  of  preparation,  followed  by  a  shoot  that  lasts  for  just  a  brief  time.  In  the  case  of  the  Super  Bowl  show,  that's  about  12  minutes.It  might  seem  like  that  would  be  a  chaotic  12  minutes.  But  Hamilton  said  that  with  enough  preparation,  the  opposite  can  be  the  case."When  I  was  shooting  the  (2013)  show,  I  actually  said  very  little,"  he  said.  "Because  what  we  were  doing  was  shooting  a  show  that  we  all  knew  precisely  what  we  were  doing."We  knew  where  Beyonce  was  going  to  be  at  all  points.  We  knew  when  the  crowd  was  going  to  go  crazy.  We  knew  almost  exactly  the  show  we  were  going  to  get."But  Hamilton,  who  is  also  working  on  a  Peter  Gabriel  concert  film  he  shot  at  several  concerts  last  year,  will  have  one  new  X-factor  to  deal  with  this  Sunday.This  year's  game  will  be  at  MetLife  Stadium  at  the  New  Jersey  Meadowlands  --  an  outdoor  venue.  The  Northeast  U.S.  already  has  been  clobbered  this  winter  by  storms  that  have  dumped  more  than  a  foot  of  snow  in  places  and  brought  temperatures  in  the  single  digits  --  a  full  15  to  25  degrees  below  normal  before  what  was  already  predicted  to  be  the  coldest  Super  Bowl  in  the  game's  history.Last  week,  10  inches  of  snow  fell  on  MetLife  Stadium.  The  early  forecast  for  Sunday  in  Northern  New  Jersey  is  for  clear  skies  and  milder  temperatures,  but  you  never  know."The  weather's  an  enormous  factor,"  Hamilton  said.  "But,  in  every  Super  Bowl,  it  has  its  unique  challenges.  And  from  those  unique  challenges,  you  create  something  great.  If  every  situation  were  the  same,  the  shows  may  not  be  as  diverse  as  they  are."Hamilton  hinted  heavily  that  the  open  stadium  will  be  somehow  utilized  in  Sunday's  halftime  show."I  guess  what  I'm  trying  to  say  is,  in  each  set  of  circumstances  ...  we  find  creative  solutions,"  he  said.  "We're  tested  and  pushed  in  this  direction,  as  opposed  to  another,  and  that's  kind  of  exciting."</TEXT></DOC>

Most  of  the  time  humans  are  barely  aware  they're  smelling  anything  at  all.But  in  reality,  our  noses  are  incredibly  sensitive  --  and  a  new  study  published  in  Science  provides  evidence  of  just  how  amazing  our  sniffers  are.Researchers  at  Rockefeller  University  and  the  Howard  Hughes  Medical  Institute  (HHMI)  tested  volunteers'  sense  of  smell  using  precisely  crafted  mixtures  of  odor  molecules.  After  extrapolating  the  results,  the  researchers  estimated  that  the  average  human  being  can  distinguish  between  1  trillion  different  odors,  if  not  more,  which  makes  our  noses  far  more  sensitive  than  any  other  organ  in  the  body."The  message  here  is  that  we  have  more  sensitivity  in  our  sense  of  smell  than  for  which  we  give  ourselves  credit,"  said  Andreas  Keller,  a  research  associate  at  Rockefeller's  Laboratory  of  Neurogenetics  and  Behavior  and  the  lead  author  on  the  Science  study,  in  a  statement.  "We  just  don't  pay  attention  to  it  and  we  don't  use  it  in  everyday  life."The  idea  that  human  beings  could  only  distinguish  between  10,000  smells  has  been  around  since  a  1927  study  that  posited  four  elementary  odors  that  people  are  able  to  distinguish  on  a  nine-point  scale.  Do  the  math  and  you  get  6,651  discernible  olfactory  sensations,  a  number  that  was  later  rounded  up  to  10,000.Although  that  value  was  widely  cited,  most  scientists  were  skeptical  --  after  all,  the  human  eye  uses  just  three  light  receptors  to  see  millions  of  colors,  while  the  typical  nose  has  400  different  olfactory  receptors.  But  as  Leslie  Vosshall  of  HHMI  and  another  study  co-author  noted:  "For  smell,  nobody  ever  took  the  time  to  test."Obviously  the  researchers  weren't  going  to  try  to  test  each  smell  individually  --  that  would  take  forever.  Instead,  they  used  128  different  odorant  molecules  to  create  smell  mixtures,  using  10,  20  and  30  different  components.  The  molecules  themselves  evoked  familiar  smells  like  cut  grass,  but  when  combined  in  random  mixtures  of  as  many  as  30  different  types,  the  smells  became  unfamiliar.That  didn't  matter  --  the  study  subjects  weren't  supposed  to  identify  the  smells.  Instead,  the  researchers  would  present  them  with  three  vials  of  scents  --  two  that  were  identical,  and  one  that  was  unique  --  and  asked  them  to  indicate  which  scent  was  different  than  the  others.  Each  of  the  26  subjects  made  264  comparisons.Can  you  smell  obesity?Keller  and  his  colleagues  found  that  their  study  subjects  could  generally  tell  the  difference  between  mixtures  containing  as  much  as  51.17%  of  the  same  components.  Much  higher  than  that,  and  they  were  unable  to  distinguish  the  smells  --  though  it's  worth  noting  that  some  subjects  could  distinguish  between  smell  mixtures  that  were  as  much  as  90%  similar.The  researchers  then  extrapolated  the  total  number  of  mixtures  possible  in  each  of  their  three  categories.  Since  the  majority  of  their  study  subjects  could  distinguish  between  mixtures  that  were  51.17%  similar  or  less,  they  estimate  that  the  average  human  can  discriminate  more  than  1  trillion  separate  smells.That  is  a  vast  number  of  scents,  and  it's  almost  certainly  too  low,  because  there  are  many  more  odor  molecules  in  the  real  world  that  could  be  mixed  in  nearly  uncountable  ways.So  it's  not  just  that  human  beings  have  sensitive  olfactory  systems  --  though  not  that  sensitive,  otherwise  more  people  would  be  able  to  distinguish  smells  that  were  more  than  50%  similar.  It's  that  the  world  offers  a  near  infinite  variety  of  smells.If  human  beings  think  their  sense  of  smell  isn't  that  important,  it  has  more  to  do  with  the  fact  that  we've  done  our  best  to  eliminate  smells  through  refrigeration,  air  filtration,  and  yes,  daily  showers.  As  Vosshall  put  it:"The  world  is  always  changing.  Plants  are  evolving  new  smells.  Perfume  companies  are  making  new  scents.  You  might  move  to  some  part  of  the  world  where  you've  never  encountered  the  fruits  and  vegetables  and  flowers  that  grow  there.  But  your  nose  is  ready.  With  a  sensory  system  that  is  that  complex,  we  are  fully  ready  for  anything."The  nose,  as  it  turns  out,  really  does  know.Forget  text  messaging,  the  'oPhone'  lets  you  send  smells©  2012  TIME,  Inc.

He  is  the  author  of  eight  books,  including  a  new  novel,  "Patriots,"  and  a  post-election  e-book,  "Why  Romney  Lost."  Frum  was  a  special  assistant  to  President  George  W.  Bush  from  2001  to  2002.  The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  the  author.(CNN)  --  The  expensive  casinos  of  Las  Vegas  look  crowded.  Tickets  to  the  popular  shows  sell  out.  To  the  tourist,  things  look  back  to  normal.Yet  as  the  state's  junior  U.S.  senator  lamented  in  February,  "I  can  tell  you  right  now  Nevada  is  nowhere  close  to  a  normal  economy."  Nevada's  unemployment  remains  the  second-highest  in  the  nation,  nearly  9%.  The  housing  market  there  still  languishes.  New  Federal  Reserve  Chair  Janet  Yellen  acknowledged  to  Nevada  Republican  Sen.  Dean  Heller  that  full  recovery  for  Nevada  glimmers  "years  away."Nevada's  troubles  are  more  than  a  local  concern.  They  reveal  something  important  about  the  condition  of  the  whole  U.S.  economy.Nevada  makes  its  living  from  tourism,  the  state's  most  important  industry,  and  the  tourists  come  --  or  came  --  for  the  casinos.  Before  1990,  the  state  of  Nevada  and  Atlantic  City,  New  Jersey,  enjoyed  something  close  to  a  monopoly  on  the  casino  industry.As  more  states  legalized  casinos,  the  Nevada  casino  industry  --  and  especially  the  Las  Vegas  industry  --  responded  by  moving  up-market.  Dazzling  theme  hotels  housed  lavish  theatrical  shows  and  outstanding  restaurants.  Las  Vegas,  once  a  rather  seedy  place,  repositioned  itself  as  a  center  of  glamorous  entertainment.Building  the  new  hotels  generated  jobs.  The  people  who  worked  in  the  hotels  needed  places  to  live,  and  building  those  homes  generated  more  jobs.  All  that  construction  shaped  an  unusual  local  economy:  Here  was  a  state  with  low  average  educational  attainments  (only  about  22%  of  Nevadans  have  a  college  degree,  45th  in  the  nation),  yet  a  median  income  higher  than  the  national  average.Nevada's  blue-collar  prosperity  was  built  on  a  faulty  premise.  All  those  glitzy  Las  Vegas  hotels  and  resorts,  containing  typically  up  to  5,000  rooms  each,  depended  on  a  huge  influx  of  high-spending  visitors.So  long  as  homeowners  could  pay  for  vacations  with  some  of  the  proceeds  of  their  home  refinancings,  all  was  well.  But  when  the  refi  boom  stopped,  Las  Vegas  suddenly  discovered  it  had  built  a  destination  too  expensive  for  its  customer  base.  Everything  else  going  on  in  the  city  --  the  jobs  in  the  hotels,  the  homes  for  the  people  who  worked  in  the  hotels,  the  malls  where  those  people  shopped,  the  homes  for  the  people  who  worked  in  the  malls  --  all  that  crashed  around  Las  Vegas'  ears.And  now,  six  years  after  the  crash,  it's  hard  to  see  a  way  forward  from  the  disaster.Nationwide,  the  casino  industry  has  more  or  less  recovered  from  the  recession.  Americans  left  behind  $37.34  billion  in  casinos  in  2012,  only  a  shade  below  the  2007  peak  of  $37.52  billion.  But  they  are  spending  that  money  in  casinos  closer  to  home.  Gross  revenues  of  Nevada  casinos  languish  20%  below  their  2007  peaks.  Because  of  the  higher  cost  of  Las  Vegas-style  amenities,  a  20%  drop  in  revenues  translates  into  a  50%  drop  in  profitability.So  even  as  the  industry  nears  recovery,  the  promise  of  a  middle-class  economy  supported  by  gambling  revenues  has  proven  a  mirage.  Casino  employment  dropped  in  Nevada  between  2012  and  2013.  These  were  the  best  casino  jobs  in  the  country,  which  explains  why  total  national  casino  wages  lag  7%  behind  the  2007  peak  even  as  industry  revenues  have  nearly  caught  up  to  the  2007  level.Nor  is  there  much  likelihood  of  any  early  return  to  the  old  ways.  Americans  have  grown  cautious  about  gambling.  While  only  about  14%  of  Americans  express  a  consistent  moral  disapproval  of  gambling,  according  to  industry  surveys,  there  has  been  a  sharp  increase  in  the  proportion  who  reject  gambling  for  themselves  personally:  27%  in  2004,  38%  today.  Unsurprisingly,  2008  was  the  year  of  the  biggest  change  of  national  mind  on  this  subject.Meanwhile,  those  who  do  gamble  are  gambling  in  new  ways  that  don't  support  the  style  of  industry  for  which  Las  Vegas  is  famous.  Younger  gamblers  are  attracted  to  online  forms  of  gambling,  which  create  jobs  only  for  computer  programmers.  Older  gamblers  increasingly  prefer  bare-bones  casinos  that  offer  free  transportation  and  cheaper  meals.Las  Vegas'  opulent  palaces  for  the  affluent  gambler  seem  increasingly  unsupportable  in  a  country  where  more  and  more  people  have  less  and  less  disposable  income.  That's  a  social  trend  that  should  concern  us  all,  however  we  feel  about  this  particular  pastime.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinionJoin  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinion</TEXT></DOC>

Two  gut-wrenching,  frustrating,  mysterious  weeks.That's  how  long  it's  been  since  227  passengers  and  12  crew  members  boarded  Malaysia  Airlines  Flight  370,  destined  for  Beijing.  A  routine  trip,  it  seemed,  to  catch  up  relatives  in  time  for  the  weekend,  start  on  a  work  assignment  or  just  get  away.Where  they  got  to,  still  unknown.  An  exhaustive  search  --  covering  a  mind-boggling  2.97  million  square  miles,  which  is  nearly  the  size  of  the  continental  United  States  --  has  yielded  some  clues,  but  no  proof  of  where  the  Boeing  777  is  or  definitively  what  happened  to  it.The  latest,  most  notable  lead  revolved  around  two  large  objects  detected  by  satellite  Sunday  floating  on  waters  over  1,400  miles  off  of  Australia's  west  coast.Military  surveillance  planes,  a  commercial  jet  and  two  merchant  ships  combing  the  area  failed  to  find  any  trace  of  the  objects  over  the  past  few  days,  amid  some  skepticism  that  they  ever  will  and,  if  they  do,  that  it'll  be  related  to  the  missing  aircraft.Australian  Prime  Minister  Tony  Abbott  on  Friday  defended  the  decision  to  announce  the  find,  saying  Australia  owes  it  to  families  of  those  missing  "to  give  them  information  as  soon  as  it's  to  hand."  But  he  didn't  make  any  promises."It  could  just  be  a  container  that  has  fallen  off  a  ship,"  Abbott  said  during  a  visit  to  Papua  New  Guinea.  "We  just  don't  know."On  Friday,  Hishammuddin  Hussein,  Malaysia's  interim  transportation  minister,  tried  to  reset  expectations  for  a  quick  resolution  to  the  mystery  after  the  satellite  discovery."This  is  going  to  be  a  long  haul,"  he  said.Search  intensifiesAfter  tough  weather  Thursday,  conditions  improved  Friday  to  allow  flight  crews  to  look  with  their  eyes  rather  than  relying  all  on  radar,  said  John  Young,  the  Australian  Maritime  Safety  Authority's  emergency  response  manager."That's  encouraging,"  he  said.  "But  we  have  no  sightings  yet."Patrol  aircraft  --  including  three  Australian  and  one  New  Zealand  Orion  surveillance  planes  to  be  involved  in  Saturday's  search,  in  addition  to  two  civilian  long-range  planes  --  may  have  to  repeat  flights  like  those  taken  Thursday  and  Friday  "a  few  times"  before  authorities  area  confident  they've  covered  the  whole  area,  Young  said.The  United  Kingdom  was  sending  the  HMS  Echo  to  aid  a  growing  international  flotilla  searching  the  southern  Indian  Ocean.  Australia  is  sending  a  ship,  the  HMAS  Success,  while  Chinese  and  Malaysian  vessels  are  also  steaming  to  join  a  massive  Norwegian  cargo  ship  diverted  there  Thursday  at  Australia's  request  plus  a  motley  collection  of  merchant  ships  heading  to  the  search  area.The  window  for  finding  the  objects  could  be  narrow.  Another  round  of  bad  weather  like  the  one  that  hampered  the  initial  day  of  searching  Thursday  could  rake  the  area,  according  to  CNN  meteorologists.Locator  beacons  are  also  an  issue.  They  are  designed  to  sound  for  at  least  16  more  days  and  could  continue  to  go  off  for  a  few  more  after  that,  according  to  the  company  that  believes  it  made  the  device  installed  on  the  missing  plane.But  the  depths  of  the  search  area  could  make  finding  them  very  difficult,  experts  say.U.S.  Defense  Secretary  Chuck  Hagel  --  who  talked  Friday  with  Hishammuddin,  who  is  also  Malaysia's  defense  minister  --  has  ordered  the  Navy  and  policy  experts  to  look  at  the  availability  and  usefulness  of  U.S.  military  undersea  technology  to  try  to  find  the  plane's  wreckage  and  its  data  recorders,  a  U.S.  military  official  said.Hishammuddin  has  put  out  a  call  for  underwater  listening  devices  called  hydrophones  to  aid  the  search.Search  continues  elsewhereThe  United  States,  which  has  had  a  P-8  aircraft  working  out  of  Perth,  Australia,  and  Navy  ships  involved  in  the  search,  has  so  far  spent  $2.5  million  on  the  entire  effort,  Pentagon  spokesman  Col.  Steven  Warren  said  Friday.The  Defense  Department  has  allocated  $4  million  for  the  search,  funding  that  could  last  through  early  April,  Warren  said.Countries  from  central  Asia  to  Australia  are  also  engaged  in  the  search  along  an  arc  drawn  by  authorities  based  on  satellite  pings  received  from  the  plane  for  hours  after  it  vanished.  One  arc  tracks  the  southern  Indian  Ocean  zone  that's  the  focus  of  current  attention.The  other  tracks  over  parts  of  Cambodia,  Laos,  China  and  into  Kazakhstan.  Hishammuddin  said  Friday  that  Malaysian  authorities  were  awaiting  permission  from  Kazakhstan's  government  to  use  the  country  as  a  staging  area  for  the  northern  corridor  search.That  clearly  signals  that  Malaysian  authorities  are  not  giving  up  on  the  possibility  the  plane  could  still  be  found  far  from  the  focus  of  current  search  efforts."Obviously,  the  search  now  has  taken  a  global  perspective,"  Hishammuddin  said.More  details  emergeAt  Friday's  daily  news  briefing,  Hishammuddin  said  authorities  knew  of  news  reports  that  Flight  370's  pilot,  Capt.  Zaharie  Ahmad  Shah,  placed  a  cell  phone  call  shortly  before  his  plane  departed.He  said  they  had  passed  the  information  to  investigators.  The  significance  of  the  call  was  unclear.As  to  other  communications,  The  Telegraph  reported  Friday  it  had  a  transcript  documenting  54  minutes  of  back-and-forth  between  the  cockpit  and  ground  control  from  taxiing  in  Kuala  Lumpur  to  the  final  message  of  "All  right,  good  night."  CNN  hasn't  confirmed  that  this  reported  transcript  it  genuine,  and  The  Telegraph  said  Malaysia's  prime  minister  said  the  transcript  wouldn't  be  officially  released.The  alleged  transcript  reported  by  the  Telegraph  contains  seemingly  routine  conversations  about  which  runway  to  use  and  what  altitude  to  fly  at.One  unexplained  element,  according  to  the  British  newspaper,  is  a  call  in  which  someone  in  the  cockpit  stated  the  aircraft  was  at  a  cruising  altitude  of  35,000  feet  --  something  that  had  been  done  just  six  minutes  earlier.  Twelve  minutes  after  that  comes  the  "good  night"  message,  at  a  point  Flight  370  was  being  transferred  to  Vietnam's  control.Another  wrinkle:  Malaysia  Airlines  CEO  Ahmad  Jauhari  Yahya  acknowledged  the  plane  was  carrying  a  cargo  of  lithium-ion  batteries,  although  he  didn't  specify  the  volume  of  the  shipment.Lithium-ion  batteries  are  commonly  used  in  laptops  and  cell  phones  and  have  been  known  to  explode,  although  that  occurs  rarely.They  were  implicated  in  the  fatal  crash  of  a  UPS  cargo  plane  in  Dubai  in  2010,  and  lithium-ion  batteries  used  to  power  components  on  Boeing  787s  were  blamed  for  fires  in  those  planes.There's  no  evidence  the  batteries  played  a  role  in  the  plane's  disappearance,  and  Yahya  said  they  are  routine  cargo  aboard  aircraft."They  are  not  declared  dangerous  goods"  he  said,  adding  that  they  were  "some  small  batteries,  not  big  batteries."Deleted  files  soughtMalaysian  authorities  say  they  believe  the  missing  plane  was  deliberately  flown  off  course  on  its  scheduled  flight  from  Kuala  Lumpur  to  Beijing.  But  they  haven't  so  far  found  clear  evidence  to  indicate  who  might  have  changed  the  plane's  path  and  why.The  pilot  and  first  officer  have  come  under  scrutiny,  especially  in  light  of  information  suggesting  a  sharp  turn  had  been  programmed  into  the  plane's  flight  management  system  before  one  of  the  pilots  gave  a  routine  sign-off  to  Malaysian  air  traffic  controllers.Plus,  question  marks  remain  over  data  authorities  say  was  deleted  from  the  hard  drive  of  a  flight  simulator  found  at  Zaharie's  home.A  U.S.  official  familiar  with  the  investigation  told  CNN  on  Thursday  that  an  FBI  team  is  confident  it  can  retrieve  at  least  some  of  the  deleted  files.On  Friday,  U.S.  law  enforcement  officials  told  CNN  files  were  removed  closer  to  the  flight's  departure  than  was  previously  indicated.  Malaysia's  Hishammuddin  had  said  items  were  deleted  before  February  3,  but  American  investigators  now  say  such  deletions  happened  after  that  date.Law  enforcement  officials  aren't  drawing  any  conclusions  about  the  subsequent  deletions  --  or  the  earlier  ones  --  just  two  days  into  reviewing  the  hard  drive  substantial  contents.  It  is  still  not  clear,  for  example,  who  erased  the  files,  why  they  did  and  what  was  in  them.Investigators  are  also  analyzing  websites  that  Zaharie  and  the  first  officer,  Fariq  Ab  Hamid,  may  have  visited  recently,  the  official  said  on  the  condition  of  anonymity.Passengers  also  continue  to  be  investigated.  On  Friday,  Hishammuddin  said  Ukraine  told  Malaysia  that  background  checks  on  its  citizens  aboard  the  plane  had  come  back  clear.Families  frustratedThe  length  of  the  search  and  the  lack  of  concrete  information  has  angered  many  family  members.  Some  have  accused  Malaysian  officials  of  withholding  details,  or  at  the  very  least  failing  to  update  them.For  the  first  time  since  the  plane  disappeared,  Malaysia  sent  a  high-level  delegation  to  Beijing  to  brief  relatives  who  had  opted  not  to  travel  to  Malaysia  to  wait  out  the  search.Hishammuddin  said  the  3½-hour  meeting  went  as  well  as  could  be  expected,  given  the  little  known  about  what  happened  to  the  plane."Although  we  answered  most  of  the  questions  they  raised,  we  could  not  answer  them  all,"  he  said."The  one  question  that  they  really  want  to  know  is  the  answer  to  which  we  do  not  have,"  he  said,  "which  is:  'Where  are  their  loved  ones,  and  where  is  the  airplane?'"Selamat  Omar,  whose  son  was  on  board  the  plane,  told  CNN's  Kate  Bolduan  the  wait  for  answers  has  been  agonizing."I  do  feel  sad,  it's  been  14  days,"  he  said.  "I'm  still  waiting  for  answers  from  the  government.  The  sadness  is  still  there,  but  I'm  just  going  to  stay  strong."Omar's  son,  Khairul  Amri,  has  attracted  the  attention  of  authorities  because  of  his  experience  as  a  flight  engineer.  Omar  said  authorities  have  not  contacted  him  and  he  is  confident  his  son  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  plane's  disappearance.What  can  we  tell  from  fresh  leads?If  this  is  the  debris  of  Malaysia  Airlines  Flight  370,  what  happens  next?The  search  for  Malaysia  Airlines  Flight  370:  Explore  mapsOpinion:  Search  for  MH370  highlights  need  for  trust,  unity  in  AsiaMichael  Pearson  reported  and  wrote  from  Atlanta.

His  partner  at  the  time  told  caseworkers  that  he  was  working."We  were  told  that  the  father  was  working,  and  was  working  very  long  hours,  16  hours  a  day,  and  that's  why  he  wasn't  available,"  Gladys  Carrion,  the  head  of  ACS,  said  at  the  news  conference  with  de  Blasio  on  Friday.She  added,  "Should  we  have  done  something  differently?  Yes,  we  should  have."The  review  revealed  that  the  agency  charged  with  protecting  children  missed  signs  that  the  boy  was  at  risk."We  can't  look  at  a  situation  like  this  and  say  that  business  as  usual  is  acceptable,"  de  Blasio  said.Dobson  died  January  8  after  his  father  was  jailed  again  on  another  case  and  left  the  boy  in  the  care  of  a  Manhattan  woman  who,  according  to  a  criminal  complaint,  told  investigators  she  starved,  beat  and  burned  him.He  was  found  unconscious  and  unresponsive  on  the  floor  of  a  bathroom  at  the  woman's  apartment  at  the  Ritz  Plaza,  a  luxury  high-rise  in  the  Hell's  Kitchen  section.  Myls  was  later  pronounced  dead  at  a  hospital.2011  abuse  allegationMyls'  family  first  came  into  contact  with  the  ACS  in  January  2011,  when  the  agency  received  an  allegation  of  abuse  against  his  mother,  Ashlee  Dobson.The  review  found  that  caseworkers  failed  to  learn  that  Wade  was  in  jail  from  September  2012  to  February  2013,  despite  visiting  his  home.  At  the  time,  Wade  had  custody  of  Myls  and  a  family  court  judge  has  ordered  ACS  to  monitor  the  child's  well-being.Carrion  said  that  caseworkers  reported  that  Myls  appeared  safe  and  healthy  during  the  visits.De  Blasio  ordered  a  review  of  all  cases  involving  court-ordered  supervision  at  the  agency  and  said  custodians  must  now  get  a  family  court  judge's  approval  before  supervision  ends."It  is  very,  very  painful  to  know  that  this  child  went  through  such  agony,"  the  mayor  said.The  review  of  the  case  found  that  the  ACS  "did  not  explore  in  detail"  the  allegations  of  abuse  and  did  not  seek  an  emergency  removal  of  the  child  from  the  home.Wade  pleaded  guilty  in  New  Jersey  on  Thursday  to  a  charge  of  second-degree  racketeering  in  connection  with  an  elaborate  bank  fraud  scheme  unrelated  to  the  case  that  landed  him  in  jail  when  caseworkers  visited  his  home  in  2012.A  judge  ordered  him  released  on  his  own  recognizance  last  week  until  February  6  to  attend  his  son's  funeral,  according  to  the  state  attorney  general's  office.Wade  had  left  Myls  with  a  woman  in  Manhattan  days  before  he  was  arrested,  police  said.The  woman,  Kryzie  King,  27,  was  indicted  in  connection  with  the  boy's  death  in  Manhattan  criminal  court  Wednesday.She  has  been  charged  with  first-degree  assault,  first-degree  reckless  endangerment,  endangering  the  welfare  of  a  child  and  unlawful  imprisonment.  A  prosecutor  told  the  court  that  King  also  was  being  investigated  on  suspicion  of  murder  and  faced  additional  charges.  The  indictment  will  be  unsealed  on  February  5.In  a  statement  after  her  arrest,  King's  attorney,  Bryan  Konoski,  said:  "My  client  is  not  charged  with  homicide  at  this  time,  and  she  is  presumed  to  be  innocent  of  allegations  against  her.  I  would  tell  everyone  not  to  jump  to  any  conclusions  at  this  time."Myls'  mother,  Ashlee  Dobson,  faced  abuse  and  neglect  charges  in  South  Carolina  and  New  York  City  before  ultimately  losing  custody  of  the  boy.  Myls'  parents  are  expected  at  attend  his  memorial  service  Tuesday  night  at  First  Corinthian  Baptist  Church  in  Harlem.  De  Blasio  has  been  invited.Myls'  body  was  claimed  from  the  morgue  in  New  York  on  Wednesday,  one  week  after  his  death.In  the  final  weeks  of  his  brief  life,  Myls  suffered  unspeakable  acts  of  neglect  and  violence,  according  to  a  criminal  complaint.The  boy  had  burn  marks  and  abrasions  on  his  head,  neck,  face  and  testicles,  court  papers  said.  There  were  bruises  and  numerous  marks  made  by  an  object  on  his  abdomen  and  legs  and  wrists  --  bruises  consistent  with  being  restrained  --  lacerations  to  his  fingers,  abrasions  to  his  armpit,  and  bruises  and  scars  on  his  back.  The  child  appeared  to  be  malnourished,  the  complaint  said.King  told  police  that  Myls'  father  dropped  the  child  off  for  her  to  watch  on  December  17  and  that  she  was  the  "child's  primary  and  sole  caretaker"  until  the  time  of  his  death,  the  complaint  said."We  lost  a  child  in  a  horrible  manner,"  De  Blasio  said.  "We  want  to  learn  from  this  tragedy  and  make  changes  as  a  result."</TEXT></DOC>

Really?!</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Kelly  Wallace  is  CNN's  digital  correspondent  and  editor-at-large  covering  family,  career  and  life.  She  is  a  mom  of  two.  Read  her  other  columns  and  follow  her  reports  at  CNN  Parents  and  on  Twitter.(CNN)  --  I  really  am  speechless,  which  makes  it  that  much  harder  to  write  this  column.  After  everything  I've  seen  covering  modern  parenting  over  the  past  several  years,  I  kind  of  feel  like  nothing  can  really  surprise  me  anymore.Oh  how  wrong  I  was,  because  when  I  heard  about  comments  from  Boomer  Esiason,  the  former  football  star  and  now  CBS  NFL  analyst  and  radio  host,  I  thought  he  had  to  be  joking.Did  he  really  suggest  that  New  York  Mets  second  baseman  Daniel  Murphy  should  have  encouraged  his  wife  to  have  a  C-section,  which  is  major  surgery,  so  that  he  wouldn't  have  to  miss  Opening  Day?Murphy's  wife  went  into  labor,  so  he  flew  to  be  with  her,  missing  the  season's  first  two  games.  Major  League  Baseball  allows  a  player  to  miss  up  to  three  games  for  paternity  leave.During  a  conversation  on  his  radio  show  with  co-host  Craig  Carton,  Esiason,  a  father  of  two,  said  he  would  never  have  done  what  Murphy  did."Quite  frankly,  I  would  have  said  C-section  before  the  season  starts,"  Esiason  said.  "I  need  to  be  at  Opening  Day.  I'm  sorry.  This  is  what  makes  our  money.  This  is  how  we're  going  to  live  our  life.  This  is  going  to  give  my  child  every  opportunity  to  be  a  success  in  life.  I'll  be  able  to  afford  any  college  I  want  to  send  my  kid  to  because  I'm  a  baseball  player."What  about  family,  Esiason?  What  about  not  scheduling  a  major  surgery  that  takes  up  to  four  weeks  or  longer  to  recover  from?  (I  should  know.  I  had  two  unplanned  C-sections!)  All  that,  just  to  avoid  missing  the  first  two  games  of  a  160-plus  game  season?After  being  widely  criticized  for  his  remarks,  Esiason  offered  a  lengthy  apology  on  his  radio  show  on  Friday."I  want  to  say  again  on  this  radio  show  that  in  no  way,  shape  or  form  was  I  advocating  anything  for  anybody  to  do.  I  was  not  telling  women  what  to  do  with  their  bodies  ...  I  would  never  do  that.  That's  their  decision,"  said  Esiason."And  the  other  thing,  too,  that  I  really  felt  bad  about  is  that  Daniel  Murphy  and  Tori  Murphy  were  dragged  into  a  conversation,  and  their  whole  life  was  exposed.  And  it  shouldn't  have  been.  And  that  is  my  fault."I  apologize  for  putting  him  and  his  wife  in  the  midst  of  a  public  discussion  that  I  basically  started  by  uttering  insensitive  comments  that  came  off  very  insensitive.  And  for  that  I  apologize."Esiason  said  he  tried  to  reach  out  to  Murphy  to  apologize  personally,  but  it  does  not  appear  that  they  connected.  He  said  he  was  in  touch  with  the  owner  of  the  New  York  Mets  and  the  team's  public  relations  chief.'The  choice  of  parents'For  his  part,  Murphy,  whose  wife  ended  up  having  a  C-section,  is  shrugging  off  any  criticism  of  his  decision."That's  the  choice  of  parents  that  they  get  to  make,"  Murphy  said  on  Thursday,  before  Esiason's  public  apology.  "That's  the  greatness  of  it.  You  discuss  it  with  your  spouse,  and  you  find  out  what  you  think  works  best  for  your  family."Not  surprisingly,  outrage  in  social  media  over  Esiason's  original  remarks  was  pointed  solidly  in  one  direction."There  are  so  many  reasons  this  is  so  wrong,"  a  mother  said  on  my  Facebook  page.  She  had  three  C-sections,  none  of  them  by  choice."He  has  no  idea  what  in  the  world  he  is  talking  about,"  she  added.  "(A  C-section)  is  no  walk  in  the  park  for  mom  or  dad,  whether  you  are  a  baseball  player  or  not,  whether  you  are  in  the  off  season  or  not."Another  woman,  also  on  Facebook,  cited  what  she  called  "the  lack  of  sensitivity  and  sophistication"  around  these  issues  of  gender  and  reproduction.  "I  also  think  (despite  what  he  says),  if  it  were  (his)  wife,  he  would  not  feel  the  same  way."Don't  show  me  the  money,  parenting  advocate  and  author  Sue  Scheff  said  on  Facebook,  criticizing  Esiason  for  suggesting  that  money  should  be  more  important  than  family."Games  happen  a  lot.  How  often  is  the  birth  of  your  child?"  she  asked."Easy  for  him  to  say,  he'll  never  have  to  have  one,"  said  a  man,  who  did  not  want  to  be  identified,  referring  to  a  C-section.Esiason  made  his  comments  during  an  exchange  with  his  co-host,  who  thought  Murphy  should  have  gotten  back  to  work  once  the  baby  was  born  instead  of  taking  an  additional  day  of  paternity  leave.  (Another  WFAN  radio  host,  Mike  Francesa,  also  took  issue  with  Murphy  being  out  for  two  games.)In  Esiason's  defense,  his  first  comments  when  the  subject  came  up  were  that  Murphy  had  "legal  rights  to  be  there  if  he  wants  to  be  there."As  a  football  player,  he's  also  coming  from  the  mindset  of  his  sport  and  how  key  players  haven't  traditionally  missed  one  of  the  season's  games  for  a  birth,  noted  @heymatt  on  Twitter.  In  fact,  Baltimore  Ravens  quarterback  Joe  Flacco's  wife  gave  birth  one  hour  before  game  time  in  September,  and  Flacco  played  that  game  against  the  Cleveland  Browns.Elective  C-sections:  'That's  not  that  common'But  what  got  under  people's  skin,  more  than  anything,  was  the  idea  of  suggesting  that  a  wife  have  major  surgery  to  accommodate  her  husband's  schedule."Major  surgery  should  only  be  used  when  medically  advised,  not  for  convenience,"  said  @elia_eltringham,  also  on  Twitter.C-sections  may  be  scheduled  because  of  the  estimated  size  of  the  child  and  the  age  of  the  mother,  or  if  a  mother  had  a  prior  C-section,  doctors  say.  Some  women  have  chosen  to  have  them  because  of  fears  of  incontinence  after  a  vaginal  birth.Nearly  one-third  of  births  are  currently  done  by  C-section,  which  is  a  significant  jump  from  the  20%  of  deliveries  resulting  in  C-sections  in  1996,  according  to  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention.Dr.  Lillian  Schapiro  of  Atlanta  said  she  has  seen  a  movement  away  from  scheduled  C-sections  in  her  practice."I  would  say  a  few  years  ago,  there  was  more  of  a  trend  to  have  scheduled  C-sections,  and  now  there  is  much  more  a  move  back  to  allowing  nature  to  run  its  course,  and  people  wanting  to  have  a  more  natural  experience,"  said  Schapiro,  an  ob/gyn  affiliated  with  Piedmont  Hospital  in  Atlanta.READ:  Fewer  moms  having  C-sections  before  39  weeksDr.  Lynn  Friedman,  an  ob/gyn  with  Mount  Sinai  Hospital  in  New  York  --  and  one  of  my  doctors  during  my  pregnancies  --  said  her  practice  also  hasn't  seen  a  rise  in  elective  C-sections."A  purely  elective  (C-section)  ...  someone  who  just  says  'I  don't  want  to  labor,'  I  mean,  that's  not  that  common,  and  that's  really  still  very  much  discouraged,"  Friedman  said."For  someone  to  say  'My  career  is  something  that  would  make  my  wife  schedule  a  section'  ...  I  think  in  the  21st  century  ...  that's  really  still  a  very  sexist  thing  to  say,  and  I  think  a  ball  team  should  understand  that  their  player  should  be  with  his  wife.  I  mean,  I  just  think  that's  grotesque."What  do  you  think  of  what  Boomer  Esiason  said  about  scheduling  a  C-section  to  suit  a  ballplayer's  schedule?

Motyl  is  professor  of  political  science  at  Rutgers  University-Newark.  He  was  associate  director  of  the  Harriman  Institute  at  Columbia  University  from  1992  through  1998.  A  specialist  on  Ukraine,  Russia  and  the  former  Soviet  Union,  Motyl  is  the  author  of  six  academic  books  and  several  novels,  including  "The  Jew  Who  Was  Ukrainian,"  "My  Orchidia"  and  "Sweet  Snow."  He  writes  a  weekly  blog  on  "Ukraine's  Orange  Blues"  for  World  Affairs  Journal.(CNN)  --  Vladimir  Putin's  gala  address  before  Russian  parliamentarians  and  officials  Tuesday  surprised  no  one  when  he  announced  Russia's  annexation  of  Crimea.  The  interesting  part  was  his  distorted  view  of  Russian  history,  and  his  proclamation  that  a  bizarre  kind  of  simultaneously  aggrieved  and  aggressive  hyper-nationalism  is  now  Russia's  official  ideology.In  discussing  Ukraine,  however,  Putin  seemed  to  go  out  of  his  way  to  suggest  he  had  no  aggressive  intentions  and  was  not  planning  to  divide  the  rest  of  the  country.Listening  to  Putin,  one  could  easily  forget  that  Russia  is  and  for  many  centuries  has  been  the  largest  country  in  the  world  and  that  it  acquired  its  territories  by  imperialist  expansion  often  accompanied  by  genocide  and  ethnic  cleansing.Instead,  Putin  prefers  to  see  Russia  as  having  been  permanently  on  the  defensive,  a  victim  of  both  Western  and  Communist  machinations:  "In  a  word,  we  have  all  the  reasons  to  believe  that  the  notorious  policy  of  containing  Russia,  which  was  pursued  in  the  18th,  19th  and  20th  centuries,  is  continuing  to  this  day."They  are  constantly  trying  to  drive  us  into  some  corner,  because  we  have  an  independent  position,  because  we  defend  it,  and  because  we  call  things  by  their  names  and  are  not  hypocrites,"  he  said.After  the  Russian  Revolution  of  1917,  according  to  Putin,  it  was  the  turn  of  the  Bolsheviks  to  aggrieve  Russia.  Putin  conveniently  ignores  that  the  vast  majority  of  Bolsheviks  were  Russian  and  that  the  party  Lenin  founded  was  institutionally  Russian  as  well.  No  matter.Putin  says:  "The  Bolsheviks,  for  a  number  of  reasons  --  may  God  judge  them  --  added  large  sections  of  the  historical  South  of  Russia  to  the  Republic  of  Ukraine.  This  was  done  with  no  consideration  for  the  ethnic  makeup  of  the  population,  and  today  these  areas  form  the  southeast  of  Ukraine.  Then,  in  1954,  a  decision  was  made  to  transfer  Crimean  Region  to  Ukraine.  ...  What  matters  now  is  that  this  decision  was  made  in  clear  violation  of  the  constitutional  norms  that  were  in  place  even  then."Once  again,  Putin's  historical  myopia  is  breathtaking:  Nikita  Khrushchev's  decision  to  grant  Crimea  to  Ukraine  was  as  constitutional  as  anything  any  Soviet  Communist  leader  did  in  the  entire  period  of  the  USSR's  existence.  The  Soviet  Union  rested  on  illegality  and  the  systemic  violation  of  human  and  civil  rights.  If  Khrushchev  was  wrong,  then  that's  only  because  the  USSR  was  wrong  and  should  never  have  been  created  in  the  first  place.Unsurprisingly,  there  is  no  room  in  this  narrative  for  the  nation  that  Russian  imperialism  almost  managed  to  annihilate  --  the  Crimean  Tatars.  Russia  conquered  the  Crimean  Tatar  khanate  in  1783.  Afterward,  the  Russian  authorities  forced  the  Tatars  out  of  their  ancestral  homeland  and  replaced  them  with  settlers  from  Russia.Tens  of  thousands  of  Tatars  died  or  were  killed;  some  two-thirds  had  to  leave  the  Crimea.  In  1944,  the  ethnic  cleansing  was  completed  when  Stalin  expelled  the  entire  Crimean  Tatar  population  --  about  200,000  people  --  to  Uzbekistan  and  some  other  Soviet  regions.  About  half  died  on  the  way.  It  was  only  in  the  late  1980s  that  they  began  returning  to  their  homeland  to  find  that  their  land  and  their  homes  had  been  occupied  by  Russian  settlers.Instead,  Putin  primarily  explains  why  Crimea  matters  to  Russia:  "The  graves  of  Russian  soldiers  whose  bravery  brought  Crimea  into  the  Russian  empire  are  also  in  Crimea.  This  is  also  Sevastopol  --  a  legendary  city  with  an  outstanding  history,  a  fortress  that  serves  as  the  birthplace  of  Russia's  Black  Sea  Fleet  ...  symbolizing  Russian  military  glory  and  outstanding  valor."And  what  of  the  Crimean  Tatars?  Here's  Putin:  "True,  there  was  a  time  when  Crimean  Tatars  were  treated  unfairly,  just  as  a  number  of  other  peoples  in  the  USSR.  There  is  only  one  thing  I  can  say  here:  Millions  of  people  of  various  ethnicities  suffered  during  those  repressions,  and  primarily  Russians."The  mendacity  is  astounding.  The  Crimean  Tatars  were  not  just  "treated  unfairly"  by  some  vague  force.  They  were  subjected  to  genocide  by  a  Russian  totalitarian  empire.  Russians  also  "suffered,"  but  the  brunt  of  the  suffering  fell,  as  Yale  historian  Timothy  Snyder  describes  in  "Bloodlands,"  on  Poles  and  Ukrainians.Despite  all  this  victimization,  Putin's  speech  loudly  asserts  that  Russia  is  back:  It's  mad  as  hell  and  it  won't  take  being  humiliated  anymore.  This  Russia,  the  new  Russia,  is  both  victim  and  bully:"Today  it  is  imperative  to  end  the  hysterics  and  to  renounce  the  rhetoric  of  the  'Cold  War,'  and  to  recognize  an  obvious  thing:  Russia  is  an  independent  and  active  participant  in  international  life,  and  it  has,  like  other  countries,  its  national  interests,  which  must  be  acknowledged  and  respected."And  then,  remarkably,  Putin  adopts  a  conciliatory  tone  with  respect  to  Ukraine.  Naturally,  he  first  denounces  the  new  democratic  government  as  illegitimate  and  in  the  thrall  of  imaginary  fascists  and  asserts  Russia's  obligation  to  help  defend  Russians  and  Russian  speakers  from  their  supposed  assaults  and  predations.Here's  the  soft  and  fuzzy  Putin:"I  appeal  to  the  people  of  Ukraine.  I  sincerely  want  you  to  understand  us:  Under  no  conditions  do  we  wish  to  bring  you  harm,  to  insult  your  national  feelings.  We  have  always  respected  the  territorial  integrity  of  the  Ukrainian  state.  ..."Don't  believe  those  who  terrify  you  with  Russia,  who  shout  that  other  regions  will  follow  Crimea.  ...  We  want  Ukraine  to  be  a  strong,  sovereign  and  self-sufficient  state.  ...  We  want  peace  and  amity  to  come  to  the  land  of  Ukraine,  and  together  with  other  countries  we  are  ready  to  provide  full  cooperation  and  support  to  that  end.  But  I  repeat:  Only  the  citizens  of  Ukraine  are  able  to  bring  order  to  their  own  home."If  these  words  were  sincere,  then  they  may  mark  a  significant  departure  from  the  war-mongering  rhetoric  Putin  employed  at  his  March  4  press  conference,  where  he  stated  he  "wasn't  worried"  by  war  with  Ukraine.  Indeed,  if  sincere,  Putin  has  clearly  stated  that  he  will  not  invade  the  rest  of  Ukraine  and  attempt  to  annex  some  of  its  southeastern  provinces.Is  Putin  being  truthful,  or  is  the  speech  a  smoke  screen  for  further  aggression?  We  don't  know,  of  course,  but  now  that  Putin  has  gone  on  record  as  having  nothing  but  peaceful  intentions  toward  Ukraine,  the  international  community  would  do  well  to  remind  him  of  that  whenever  the  temptation  to  rattle  sabers  on  Ukraine's  borders  and  foment  trouble  in  Ukraine's  southeast  proves  too  strong  for  him  to  resist.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Alexander  J.

When  Oliver  Reed  died  before  filming  key  scenes  in  "Gladiator,"  Ridley  Scott  pasted  Reed's  head  onto  a  body  double  using  digital  effects.  It's  a  tricky  thing,  morbid  and  money-grubbing  but  also  well-intentioned  and  even  a  little  sacred.  You  want  to  honor  the  dead  actor's  final  work;  but  you  also  want  to  finish  your  movie.  River  Phoenix  and  Marilyn  Monroe  died  too  early  to  salvage  "Dark  Blood"  or  "Something's  Got  to  Give;"  a  tragedy  for  many  reasons,  not  least  because  they  both  looked  much  better  than  "The  Imaginarium  of  Doctor  Parnassus."Coroner:  Car  carrying  Walker  going  100-plus  mphSo:  "Fast  &  Furious  7."  Paul  Walker  died  in  November  with  filming  only  half-finished,  although  given  the  age  we  live  in  fans  had  already  seen  Walker  on  set  and  in  character.  Cutting  Walker  out  of  the  film  entirely  would  have  been  a  costly  endeavor.  Less  cynically,  you  could  argue  that  keeping  Walker  in  the  film  was  the  right  move.  It  would  provide  closure.  And  after  all,  the  "Fast"  franchise  was  something  like  Walker's  life's  work.  But  that  opened  up  all  kinds  of  creative  problems  for  the  Fast  filmmakers  —  particularly  since  everyone  attached  to  the  film  been  proclaiming  that  "Fast  7"  is  an  attempt  at  world-building  towards  a  new  trilogy.  (Translation:  They  probably  already  had  half-sketched  plans  for  Brian  O'Conner  in  Fast  10.)According  to  the  Hollywood  Reporter,  the  crew  behind  "Fast  7"  has  opted  to  "retire"  Brian  O'Conner.  He  will  specifically  not  be  killed  off,  according  to  the  Reporter's  sources.  Universal  had  no  comment  on  the  report,  but  the  rumor  smells  true.  Given  the  high-speed  nature  of  Paul  Walker's  death,  it  probably  felt  like  bad  taste  to  kill  a  character  played  by  Walker  in  a  movie  about  cars  driving  very  fast.  Still,  it's  difficult  to  imagine  how  O'Conner  will  leave  the  series.  The  franchise  has  a  well-stated  commitment  to  Family,  and  "Furious  6"  reaffirmed  the  central  tenet  —  sentimental,  but  full-hearted  —  that  the  characters  will  die  for  each  other,  even  after  they've  ridden  into  several  different  last-big-score  sunsets.  We'll  find  out  O'Conner's  happy  fate  in  April  2015.See  the  original  story  at  EW.com.CLICK  HERE  to  Try  2  RISK  FREE  issues  of  Entertainment  Weekly©  2011  Entertainment  Weekly  and  Time  Inc.

At  one  point,  more  than  90%  of  the  world's  largest  surface  freshwater  system  was  frozen  over,  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  said.  That  figure  for  the  Great  Lakes  fell  to  84%  as  of  Wednesday.The  massive  freeze,  however,  has  created  natural  wonders.Bob  Krumenaker,  the  National  Park  Service's  superintendent  at  Lakeshore,  said  there  have  been  thousands  of  additional  visitors  flocking  to  ice  caves."The  caves  form  almost  the  same  kind  of  features  that  you'd  find  in  an  underground  limestone  cave  --  the  soda  straws,  the  curtains,  the  stalactites  --  but  they're  all  forming  out  of  ice  in  just  days  and  weeks  instead  of  something  that  would  form  underground  in  limestone  over  hundreds  of  thousands  of  years,"  he  said.This  season  has  easily  been  the  busiest  in  terms  of  visitors:  In  the  past  two  months,  more  than  120,000  people  have  made  the  roughly  three-mile  round-trip  trek  by  foot  over  a  frozen  Lake  Superior  to  see  the  ice  formations  and  caves  that  will  melt  away  in  just  a  few  weeks.Debbie  Stumpf  was  one  of  the  intrepid  visitors  Wednesday.She  likened  the  experience  to  "walking  into  a  hall  of  gods.""How  many  chances  do  you  have  to  lay  on  your  back  and  look  up  at  icicles?"  she  said.The  journey  to  the  caves  is  a  big  part  of  the  experience."I  like  that  we  have  to  walk  so  far  out  to  get  here.  We've  seen  some  really  unique  people  out  here,"  she  said.Visitors  have  hailed  from  all  over  the  world  this  winter,  including  China,  Japan,  Australia  and  Hungary,  Krumenaker  said.  They  all  helped  make  this  year  the  busiest  in  the  history  of  the  park,  which  received  National  Lakeshore  status  under  the  U.S.  Department  of  the  Interior  in  1970.CNN's  Michael  Martinez  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

An  airplane  takes  off  from  Malaysia's  main  airport  and  disappears.  An  international  coalition  of  countries  has  been  searching  for  Malaysia  Airlines  Flight  370  for  more  than  a  week  without  success.  How  does  an  airplane  disappear?Closer  to  home,  a  U.S.  Airways  flight  blows  a  tire  on  takeoff  and  smartphone  pictures  show  the  plane's  nose  hitting  the  ground.  Fortunately,  the  pilot  manages  to  land  without  seriously  injuring  anyone.  A  Delta  Air  Lines  aircraft  loses  a  panel  on  one  of  its  wings  during  a  flight  from  Orlando,  Florida,  to  Atlanta.  It  also  lands  safely.  These  scary-sounding  mishaps  are  smaller  reminders  that  things  can  and  do  go  wrongDespite  how  rare  airline  accidents  are,  many  travelers  get  nervous  when  major  --  and  even  relatively  minor  --  incidents  occur.  It's  not  rational  thinking.  The  odds  of  dying  in  an  airplane  crash  are  really  low.There  were  35.1  million  commercial  flights  worldwide,  and  15  fatal  accidents  with  414  fatalities  in  2012,  the  last  full  year  for  which  the  International  Air  Transport  Association  has  Ascend  Flightglobal  data.And  the  odds  are  even  better  if  you  only  flew  within  the  United  States:  There  were  no  airline  fatalities  in  the  U.S.  in  2012,  according  to  the  National  Transportation  Safety  Board.You  know  you're  more  likely  to  die  in  a  car  crash.  More  than  33,000  people  died  in  motor  vehicle  crashes  in  2012  in  the  United  States  alone.  Also  specific  to  the  United  States,  the  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administration's  2012  Traffic  Safety  Facts  Data  reports  a  fatality  rate  of  1.14  fatalities  per  100  million  vehicle  miles  traveled.Over  the  course  of  your  lifetime,  you're  more  likely  to  die  by  killing  yourself  (1  in  106),  drowning  (1  in  1,112)  or  choking  on  your  food  (1  in  3,842),  according  to  the  National  Safety  Council.Now  that  we  know  all  that  data,  why  do  air  disasters  still  unnerve  us?The  mind  was  built  to  fleeFrom  an  evolutionary  perspective,  the  mind's  primary  objective  is  to  look  out  for  anything  that  might  harm  us  and  avoid  it  at  all  costs,  says  Julie  Pike,  a  psychologist  at  the  Anxiety  Disorders  Treatment  Center  in  Durham,  North  Carolina.  This  has  helped  people  live  longer  for  thousands  of  years,  she  says.This  discomfort  over  this  latest  airline  incident  reminds  us  how  little  control  we  have  over  many  aspects  of  our  lives."We  like  to  be  able  to  see,  hear  and  control  where  we're  going  and  what  we're  doing;  we  like  situations  in  which  we  believe  we  could  make  an  exit  if  necessary,  grab  the  wheel,  or  jump  out  of  the  way,"  says  Pike,  via  e-mail.  "With  flying,  that's  impossible."This  is  one  weird  airline  mysteryCommercial  airline  pilot  and  aviation  author  Patrick  Smith  says  the  intense  media  coverage  causes  people  to  lose  track  of  the  fact  that,  despite  occasional  tragedies,  commercial  flying  has  never  been  safer  than  it  is  right  now."Worldwide,  the  trend  over  the  past  several  years  has  been  one  of  steady  improvement,  to  the  point  where  last  year  was  the  safest  in  the  entire  history  of  commercial  aviation,"  says  Smith,  who  blogs  about  air  travel  at  askthepilot.com,  via  e-mail.  "Hopefully  their  number  continues  to  diminish,  but  a  certain  number  of  accidents  will  always  be  inevitable.""In  some  ways,  the  weirdness  of  the  Malaysia  Airlines  story  speaks  to  how  well  we  have  engineered  away  what  once  were  the  most  common  causes  of  crashes.  Those  that  still  occur  tend  to  be  more  mysterious  and  strange  than  in  decades  past."Airline  fatalities  are  rare,  but  the  possibility  is  still  scary.  What  can  we  do  about  it?Face  your  fearDon't  try  to  run  from  the  fear,  suggests  Pike.  "Rather  than  trying  to  control  the  plane,  work  on  accepting  the  desire  to  control  it,"  she  says."Thank  your  mind  for  trying  to  protect  you.  Focus  on  simply  noticing  the  thoughts,  feelings  and  sensations  without  attaching  to  them  or  trying  to  make  them  go  away."Tell  the  crew  you're  scared,  suggests  flight  attendant  Heather  Poole,  author  of  "Cruising  Attitude:  Tales  of  Crashpad,  Crew  Drama,  and  Crazy  Passengers  at  35,000  Feet.""If  we  know  you're  scared,  we'll  go  out  of  our  way  to  be  reassuring  if  the  airplane  does  encounter  a  few  bumps,"  says  Poole,  via  e-mail.  "We'll  update  you  on  whatever  information  the  captain  passes  along  to  us  regarding  delays,  mechanicals,  weather  or  turbulence.  I've  gone  as  far  as  to  sit  in  an  empty  seat  beside  someone  and  hold  their  hand."Poole,  who's  been  a  flight  attendant  for  18  years,  suggests  passengers  who  hate  turbulence  sit  close  to  the  cockpit  --  the  front  of  the  plane  isn't  as  bumpy  as  the  rear.  Passengers  can  also  download  the  MyRadar  app  to  track  the  bumpy  weather.Or  how  about  a  prayer?  Artist's  Way  author  Julia  Cameron  writes  out  prayers  for  her  specific  fears  of  flying:  takeoff,  turbulence  and  landing.  She  also  takes  a  nice  stack  of  gossip  magazines:  "Buy  tabloids.  Celebrity  gossip  is  engrossing.  Celebrity  cellulite  can  make  you  forget  turbulence."</TEXT></DOC>

It's  called  Cefaly  and  works  by  stimulating  nerves  beneath  the  forehead.Shaped  like  a  tiara,  the  battery-powered  device's  electrode  is  positioned  just  above  the  patients'  eyes.  It  delivers  an  electric  current,  creating  a  tingling  sensation.In  a  67-person  randomized  controlled  trial  published  in  the  journal  Neurology  last  month,  Cefaly  reduced  chronic  migraine  attacks  on  average  by  two  per  month,  and  38%  of  users  had  at  least  a  50%  reduction  in  their  number  of  migraine  episodes.  The  device  was  not  shown  to  reduce  the  severity  of  attacks  in  the  study.Patients  are  meant  to  wear  the  device  for  no  more  than  20  minutes  per  day.  In  contrast  to  migraine  medications,  Cefaly  has  no  known  side  effects  and  might  be  combined  with  other  drugs."New  therapies  are  needed  in  migraine,  and  further  studies  of  neurostimulation  using  innovative  study  designs  are  warranted  to  explore  the  optimum  way  to  create  an  acceptable  evidence  base  for  widespread  use  of  this  potentially  valuable  treatment,"  writes  Dr.  Eishi  Asano,  associate  professor  of  pediatrics  and  neurology  at  Wayne  State  University  in  Detroit.The  manufacturer  of  the  device  is  STX-Med,  which  is  based  in  Belgium.

Grigas,  who  consults  for  multinational  corporations  investing  in  emerging  markets,  is  the  author  of  "The  Politics  of  Energy  and  Memory  between  the  Baltic  States  and  Russia"  (Ashgate  2013).(CNN)  --  With  the  Russian  military  having  effectively  taken  control  of  Crimea,  a  permanent  division  of  Ukraine  is  becoming  increasingly  likely.  Russian  President  Vladimir  Putin's  request  to  the  Russian  Senate  to  approve  military  intervention  in  Ukraine  in  order  to  "protect  citizens  of  Russia"  highlights  how  once  seemingly  innocuous  "compatriot  policies"  are  being  used  by  Moscow  to  justify  military  efforts  to  regain  Crimea  for  Russia.Russia's  compatriot  policies  are  officially  meant  to  protect  ethnic  Russians  living  in  nearby  countries,  but  have  served  Russia's  territorial  expansionism  in  the  past.In  fact  these  compatriot  policies  can  be  viewed  as  part  of  Putin's  new  military  doctrine  that  seeks  territorial  gains  in  the  former  Soviet  republics,  particularly  where  there  is  a  receptive  population  of  Russian  speakers.The  compatriot  policies,  outlined  in  Russia's  "National  Security  Strategy  to  2020,"  were  introduced  in  2000  during  Putin's  first  presidential  term.  They  call  for  the  political,  economic  and,  potentially,  military  protection  of  the  rights  and  interests  of  Russian  citizens  and  ethnic  Russians  living  abroad.An  effective  tactic  associated  with  the  policies  is  to  give  Russian  citizenship  to  ethnic  Russians  in  foreign  states  so  as  to  better  protect  their  interests.  Tellingly,  Russia's  national  security  strategy  emphasizes  that  compatriots  are  an  important  tool  for  achieving  Russia's  foreign  policy  aims.Map:  A  divided  UkraineLooking  at  Russia's  neighborhood,  one  can  already  see  how  compatriot  policy  has  assisted  Russia's  foreign  policy  and  territorial  expansion.  Prior  to  the  Georgian-Russian  war  in  2008,  Georgia  was  seeking  closer  relations  with  the  West  and  distancing  itself  from  Russia  (in  a  very  similar  vein  to  Ukraine  today).Meanwhile  Moscow  was  handing  out  citizenship  to  the  inhabitants  of  the  separatist  Georgian  territories  of  South  Ossetia  and  Abkhazia.  Thus  the  "protection  of  Russian  citizens"  became  one  of  Russia's  main  motives  for  going  to  war  with  Georgia  in  2008  and  securing  South  Ossetia  and  Abkhazia  as  Russian  protectorates.But  Ukraine  does  not  have  to  look  to  the  Caucasus  to  see  compatriot  policy  in  action.  On  Ukraine's  southwestern  border,  Transnistria  is  a  separatist  territory  of  Moldova  which  has  also  become  effectively  a  Russian  military-controlled  territory  as  the  Kremlin  sought  to  "protect"  the  Russian  speakers  and  eventually  Russian  citizens.Farther  afield,  Russia  has  also  taken  great  pains  to  cultivate  the  loyalty  of  its  compatriots  in  the  Baltic  states,  particularly  in  Estonia  and  Latvia.  Well  aware  of  Russia's  compatriot  tactics,  Lithuania,  which  currently  holds  the  rotating  presidency  of  the  U.N.  Security  Council,  called  an  urgent  meeting  and  also  invoked  the  NATO  treaty  on  Ukraine.For  Moscow,  Crimea  is  much  more  important  than  South  Ossetia,  Abkhazia  or  Transnistria.  First,  Crimea  became  Ukrainian  territory  only  in  1954  when  the  Soviet  Union's  leader  Nikita  Khrushchev  gave  it  to  Kiev  under  the  overall  authority  of  the  Soviet  Union.  Its  loss  after  the  disintegration  of  the  Soviet  Union  was  a  major  blow  to  leaders  in  Moscow.Second,  Sevastopol,  one  of  Crimea's  major  cities,  serves  as  the  naval  base  for  Russia's  Black  Sea  fleet.  It  is  a  prized  territory  that  allows  the  Russian  navy  direct  access  to  the  Mediterranean.Crimea  is  a  particularly  soft  target  for  Russia's  compatriot  policies.  Unlike  Western  Ukraine,  where  people  speak  Ukrainian,  or  even  Eastern  Ukraine,  which  is  Russian  speaking,  Crimea  is  predominantly  ethnically  Russian.With  Crimea's  Russians  protesting  the  turn  of  events  in  Kiev's  Independence  Square  and  expressing  their  solidarity  with  Moscow,  a  secessionist  movement  is  almost  inevitable.  Already,  the  Crimean  parliament  announced  that  it  would  hold  a  referendum  to  increase  the  peninsula's  autonomy  from  Ukraine  and  installed  a  pro-Russian  prime  minister.While  Crimea's  fate  seems  almost  certain  to  follow  those  of  South  Ossetia,  Abkhazia  or  Transnistria,  other  states  near  Russia  that  also  have  significant  populations  of  Russian  speakers  should  be  vigilant.Putin's  compatriot  doctrine  is  here  to  stay.  Thus  it  is  no  wonder  Georgia  will  likely  be  urgently  seeking  integration  with  NATO  and  the  EU.  Ukraine  should  stabilize  its  government  and  consider  following  suit.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Agnia  Grigas.</TEXT></DOC>

Of  those  infected,  about  75,000  died,  according  to  the  U.S.  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  --  although  the  study  did  not  investigate  how  often  an  infection  actually  caused  or  contributed  to  the  patient's  death.Pneumonia  and  surgical-site  infections  were  the  most  common  types  of  infection  --  each  accounting  for  about  22%  of  all  infections  --  followed  by  gastrointestinal  infections  such  as  Clostridium  difficile,  urinary  tract  infections  and  infections  of  the  bloodstream.While  highlighting  the  grim  reality  that  too  many  people  become  infected  when  seeking  medical  treatment  in  hospitals  and  other  health  care  facilities,  the  study  also  shows  progress  from  past  estimates.In  2002,  there  were  an  estimated  1.7  million  health  care-associated  infections  and  155,668  infected-patient  deaths.  In  98,987  of  those  deaths,  clinicians  said  the  patient's  infection  actually  caused  or  contributed  to  death.CDC:  Hospitals  contributing  to  rise  of  superbugsWhen  it  comes  to  reducing  infection  rates,  "there's  great  data  showing  that  we  can  actually  move  the  needle  significantly,"  says  Dr.  Michael  Bell,  director  of  the  CDC's  Division  of  Healthcare  Quality  Promotion.For  example,  bloodstream  infections  from  central  lines  (lines  inserted  in  the  chest  into  a  vein)  dropped  44%  between  2008  and  2012  --  a  result,  say  experts,  of  requiring  hospitals  to  follow  a  simple  checklist  of  best  practices."But  at  the  same  time,  we're  not  doing  a  perfect  job  of  doing  everything  we  should,  every  single  time,"  says  Bell,  "and  there's  some  things  which  we  haven't  figured  out  how  best  to  manage  --  yet."C.  difficile  infections,  for  example,  have  become  more  severe  in  the  past  decade,  and  more  bacteria  are  resistant  to  antibiotics.  Antibiotic-resistant  infections  account  for  at  least  23,000  deaths  each  year,  according  to  the  CDC.Still,  hospital  infection  rates  vary  significantly  between  states,  and  even  between  neighboring  hospitals."There  are  some  excellent  places  that  are  doing  a  bang-up  job,  and  I  would  love  to  receive  my  care  there,"  Bell  says."Also  within  every  facility  type  there  are  places  that  give  me  great  concern.  It  can  be  related  to  staffing  and  resources;  it  could  be  related  to  the  way  things  get  done."Dr.  Peter  Pronovost,  the  director  of  the  Armstrong  Institute  for  Patient  Safety  and  Quality  at  Johns  Hopkins,  recommends  patients  research  their  local  hospital's  infection  rates  on  the  Centers  for  Medicare  and  Medicaid  Services  hospital  comparison  website  ahead  of  time,  if  at  all  possible."These  ICU  bloodstream  infections  are  often  a  'canary  in  the  coal  mine'  measure,"  says  Pronovost.  "In  other  words,  if  a  hospital  gets  its  act  together  to  focus  on  safety  and  gets  these  down,  it's  a  good  marker  that  they're  working  collaboratively,  even  if  you're  not  in  the  ICU."Once  inside  a  facility,  Pronovost  says,  patients  can  hold  clinicians  accountable  to  best  practices  by  asking  doctors  and  nurses  to  wash  their  hands  when  they  enter  the  room  and  by  inquiring  about  the  appropriate  time  for  catheters  and  other  medical  devices  --  common  sources  of  infection  --  to  be  removed.10  shocking  medical  mistakes"Even  though  we've  had  great  success  nationally,  there  still  are  pockets  of  hospitals  that  have  rates  of  infection  that  are  several  times  the  national  average.  The  reality  is  that  oftentimes  there's  very  little  that's  being  done  about  it,"  says  Pronovost.  "There's  no  accountability  for  a  hospital  that  has  very  high  infection  rates,  and  my  sense  is,  there  absolutely  needs  to  be."The  study  included  183  hospitals  and  11,282  patients  surveyed  between  May  and  September  2011.</TEXT></DOC>

But  it  is  really  fast</TITLE><TIME>Tue,  04  Mar  2014  21:18:40  EST</TIME><ABSTRACT>It's  been  a  while  since  aerospace  dedicated  energy  to  flying  past  the  sound  barrier.  Now,  a  few  companies  are  looking  into  developing  supersonic  business  jets  --  one  of  which  is  throwing  windows  out  of  the  equation.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Concorde  is  a  thing  of  the  past,  but  a  number  of  companies  are  racing  to  release  the  first  supersonic  business  jet.Aerion  Corporation  is  working  on  a  jet  that  would  reach  Mach  1.6  and  would  possibly  be  ready  for  release  by  2020,  while  Spike  Aerospace  has  announced  plans  for  the  S-512,  a  business  jet  that  could  travel  at  speeds  of  Mach  1.8  and  would  be  available  by  2018.  So  why  has  it  taken  nearly  50  years  to  revisit  the  concept?According  to  Vik  Kachoria,  president  and  CEO  of  Spike  Aerospace,  one  of  the  main  issues  that  plagued  the  Concorde  was  the  sonic  boom  --  the  disruptive  noise  that  results  from  the  shockwaves  created  when  an  object  travels  faster  than  the  speed  of  sound."At  its  worst,  the  sonic  boom  would  sound  like  a  loud  thunder  clap  over  your  head.  It  would  rattle  windows  and  loosen  roof  tiles.  It  was  pretty  jarring.  If  you  lived  under  the  Concorde's  flight  path,  you  might  hear  it  several  times  a  day,"  he  says.The  effect  was  so  disturbing  that  most  countries  either  banned  supersonic  flights,  or  restricted  them  from  traveling  over  land.  Understandably,  this  is  an  issue  that  the  aerospace  industry  has  needed  to  address  in  order  to  make  supersonic  flight  viable.A  plane  without  windows?Kachoria  notes  that  currently,  it  makes  more  sense  to  develop  supersonic  business  jets  than  larger  commercial  aircraft,  because  the  plane's  diminutive  size  results  in  a  smaller  boom.While  he's  remained  tight-lipped  about  many  aspects  of  the  design  (some  are  still  awaiting  patent),  he  recently  announced  that  the  S-512  will  be  built  without  windows  (except  for  the  one  the  pilots  see  out  of),  a  feature  that  will  reduce  drag  and  overall  cost  of  the  unit."Even  at  subsonic  speeds,  windows  add  a  tremendous  cost  to  the  aircraft  because  the  fuselage  has  to  be  designed  to  support  those  windows.  If  you  eliminate  all  that,  you  create  piece  with  less  structural  issues,  less  manufacturing  costs,  and  less  parts  count,"  he  says.It  sounds  like  a  claustrophobe's  nightmare,  though  Kachoria  has  attempted  to  compensate  for  the  windowless  design  by  installing  flatscreens,  which  can  either  display  the  view  outside,  or  can  be  used  to  show  a  movie  or  PowerPoint  presentation  --  should  a  conference  need  to  take  place  in  the  air."It's  not  a  new  concept,  but  in  the  past  we  didn't  have  the  technology  --  the  flatscreens,  or  digital  cameras  to  capture  the  resolution,  or  the  ability  to  stitch  together  cameras  to  create  a  seamless  panoramic  view,"  he  says.Overall,  the  saving  in  manufacturing  means  each  unit  will  cost  between  $60  million  to  $80  million.It's  all  in  the  wingAccording  to  Aerion,  the  main  detriment  to  producing  a  supersonic  aircraft  in  the  near  future  isn't  the  boom  (an  issue  even  Kachoria  admits  is  still  another  15  years  or  so  from  being  fully  resolved),  but  the  cost."The  reasons  speeds  haven't  changed  much  since  the  1960s  has  more  to  do  with  economics  than  technology.  You  just  can't  have  supersonic  travel  at  the  rock-bottom  fares  most  passengers  prefer"  says  Jeff  Miller,  the  director  of  communications  for  Aerion."Those  constraints  don't  apply  to  business  jets,  so  it's  most  likely  supersonic  technology  will  be  applied  there  first.  Even  so,  economy  of  operation  is  important,  mainly  in  terms  of  fuel  efficiency.  If  you  can't  find  a  way  to  reduce  fuel  consumption,  you  won't  have  a  supersonic  jet  that  will  get  you  very  far,"  he  adds.When  the  Concorde  slowed  down  to  below  Mach  1,  it  burned  though  more  fuel.  Aerion  has  been  researching  ways  to  compensate  this  with  the  development  of  the  supersonic  natural  laminar  flow  (SNLF)  wing,  which  it  has  been  testing  in  conjunction  with  NASA.The  wing,  which  is  thinner  and  shorter  than  typical  plane  wings,  has  been  proven  to  reduce  friction  drag  by  80%,  and  overall  airframe  drag  by  20%."The  more  drag,  the  more  power  required  to  push  a  wing  through  the  air,"  explains  Miller.A  resolution?While  work  is  being  done  on  the  sonic  boom  issue,  neither  Aerion  nor  Spike  expect  to  release  a  jet  before  it's  resolved  completely.  The  early  models  will  likely  only  be  able  to  reach  high  speeds  when  traveling  over  seas."We  don't  have  the  sonic  boom  issue  resolved  yet,"  admits  Kachoria,  "you  wouldn't  be  able  to  fly  above  Mach  1  between  New  York  and  Los  Angeles,  for  instance.

But  with  a  special  needs  child  at  home,  the  site  is  a  savior.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  The  popular  scrapbooking  site  Pinterest  can  give  parents  tools  to  be  creative  with  their  kids;  it  can  also  overwhelm  them  and  perpetuate  the  competition  and  judgment  that  especially  mothers  tend  to  feel.  Two  moms  shared  their  unique  experiences  with  the  site  on  CNN  iReport.  Katherine  Linzey  first  wrote  a  version  of  this  story  for  her  blog,  Our  New  Life.  Read  the  other  essay  here:  I'm  not  a  Pinterest  mom  --  and  learning  to  be  OK  with  that.(CNN)  --  I  get  it.  I  get  all  the  Pinterest  jokes.  I  totally  agree  it  is  causing  many  of  us  already  stressed-out  moms  to  feel  like  we  are  in  constant  competition  to  throw  the  perfect  birthday  party,  make  the  perfect  school  snack  and  take  the  perfect  family  photo.And  yet,  I  will  totally  own  the  fact  that  I  am  a  Pinterest  mom.  I'm  that  lady.  I  threw  my  daughter,  Elyse,  a  superhero  party  for  her  6th  birthday  and  made  everything  by  hand.  I  create  whimsical  Halloween  costumes.  I  make  occasion-appropriate  snacks.I  do  not  do  this  to  bolster  my  flagging  ego  or  to  one-up  my  fellow  moms.  I  do  this  because,  as  a  special-needs  mom,  there  are  a  lot  of  "mom"  things  I  am  NOT.My  second  daughter,  Anabelle,  was  born  with  the  neurological  disorders  lissencephaly  and  microcephaly.  Lissencephaly  means  "smooth  brain"  and  microcephaly  means  "small  head."  What  this  means  is  that  while  she  was  in  utero,  her  brain  stopped  developing,  due  to  a  random  miswriting  of  her  genetic  code.  Now  almost  4,  she  is  cognitively  still  a  newborn.  She  cannot  hold  up  her  own  head,  she  eats  through  a  gastronomy  tube  in  her  stomach,  she  requires  oxygen  support  when  she  sleeps  and  she  cannot  control  her  own  body  temperature.  She  has  quadripalegic  cerebral  palsy,  is  legally  blind  and  has  severe  epilepsy.It  is  unsafe  to  have  her  outside  in  all  but  the  most  optimum  weather  conditions,  and  it's  risky  to  bring  her  around  crowds  of  people  and  all  their  germs.Because  of  this,  my  older  daughter,  6-year-old  Elyse,  spends  a  lot  more  time  at  home  than  many  of  her  peers.  There  are  a  lot  of  things  Elyse  doesn't  get  to  do.  I  am  not  a  "Let's  join  the  traveling  soccer  team  and  spend  hours  every  week  on  the  road"  mom.  I'm  not  a  "Do  every  activity  you  want  as  long  as  you  get  your  schoolwork  done"  mom.  I  am  not  a  "playdates  every  weekend"  mom,  a  "spectator  at  every  event"  mom  or  a  "spontaneous  family  trip"  mom."  (Hell,  I'm  not  even  a  "well-planned  vacation"  mom.)  Depending  on  Anabelle's  health,  I'm  not  even  a  "tuck  you  into  bed  every  night"  mom.I  have  forgotten  to  send  my  daughter  to  school  in  a  jersey  on  sports  day,  I  have  missed  sign-ups  for  things,  and  I  have  said  no  to  classes  Elyse  wants  to  take  because  I  cannot  possibly  get  her  there  every  week.When  Anabelle  was  6  months  old  and  Elyse  was  3,  a  friend  sent  me  an  "invitation"  to  join  Pinterest.  It  was  like  opening  the  golden  gates  to  never-ending  possibilities  for  the  trapped-at-home  mom  I  so  often  was!While  I  have  always  considered  myself  passably  crafty,  what  I  am  not  is  wildly  creative.  And  there  it  was:  The  ultimate  guide  to  the  perfect  childhood!  OK,  I  admit  that's  overstating  it  a  little  bit,  but  I  was  a  desperate,  terrified,  newly  inducted  special-needs  mom  with  a  bored,  over-active  toddler  on  my  hands.  Armed  with  endless  ideas  and  step-by-step  instructions,  I  could  create  wonderful  memories  with  Elyse  despite  rarely  leaving  home.The  thing  many  people  don't  realize  about  being  the  parent  of  a  special-needs  child  is  that,  for  those  of  us  who  also  have  kids  without  disabilities,  it  is  usually  their  well-being  and  future  that  cause  us  the  greatest  heartache.  Anabelle  has  never  wanted  for  a  thing  in  her  short  life.  It  is  Elyse  who  never  has  two  parents  at  her  side  on  outings,  or  may  never  get  that  trip  to  Disney  World  she  so  desperately  wants.Elyse  knows  that  only  one  parent  will  be  there  for  her  school  events.  We  are  the  family  with  only  one  parent  in  the  stands  at  sporting  events  and  one  parent  in  the  audience  for  dance  recitals.  In  Anabelle's  case,  she  is  so  susceptible  to  getting  ill  that  it  just  isn't  safe  for  her  to  be  in  a  crowd.  Elyse's  father  and  sister  were  not  at  her  last  birthday  party  because  it  was  outside  in  the  July  heat,  which  Anabelle  cannot  manage.Elyse  does  have  to  pay  the  price  for  having  a  special-needs  sibling.My  typical  child  breaks  my  heart  much  more  frequently  than  my  special-needs  child.  The  needs  of  my  second  child  restrict  the  movement  most  parents  of  young  children  are  used  to  in  their  lifestyle,  and  that  affects  both  my  children.  It  is  for  Elyse  that  I  have  to  get  creative  in  the  ways  I  create  memories.It  can  be  really  hard  not  having  the  time  to  be  the  mom  I  would  like  to  be.  But  the  one  thing  I  DO  do?  I  spend  a  lot  of  time  at  home.Anabelle's  fragile  health  means  she  lives  in  a  virtual  bubble  a  lot  of  the  time.  I  might  not  be  able  to  run  Elyse  around  doing  fun  activities  and  having  experiences  outside  the  home,  but  I  can  create  fun  and  memories  inside  the  home.Elyse  helps  me  with  most  of  my  Pinterest-inspired  activities.  It  allows  us  to  bond  and  express  our  creative  energy.  It  allows  me  to  contribute  something  meaningful  to  her  childhood  beyond  hospitals  and  therapists  and  holding  the  suction  wand  for  her  sister.So  please,  don't  take  it  as  a  challenge  when  my  daughter  and  I  make  her  teacher's  end-of-the-year  gift.  I'm  just  using  what  I  have  so  my  daughter  has  one  thing  about  which  she  can  say,  "Hey,  MY  mom  does  that!"Do  you  use  Pinterest  as  a  parenting  tool?

But  the  president  of  the  Pokémon  Company  said  the  new  games  stay  true  to  their  roots  of  bringing  people  together  to  play  while  offering  a  new  blueprint  for  the  universe  of  pocket  monsters."From  the  beginning,  communication  between  players  has  been  the  primary  goal  for  the  Pokémon  brand,"  Tsunekazu  Ishihara  told  CNN.  "Today,  the  ability  to  connect  millions  of  people  around  the  world  via  Wi-Fi  is  why  launching  'Pokémon  X'  and  'Pokémon  Y'  simultaneously  worldwide  was  an  ambitious  yet  important  goal."Since  debuting  in  video  and  card  games,  Pokemon  has  become  a  cultural  phenomenon  across  the  globe.  There  have  been  cartoons,  cereals  and  a  feature-length  film,  not  to  mention  the  national  and  global  tournaments  that  draw  thousands  of  players."Gotta  catch  'em  all"  is  the  franchise's  catch  phrase,  referring  to  the  player's  goal  of  catching  and  training  the  tiny  monsters  to  compete  against  other  players.  That's  gotten  significantly  harder,  though,  with  the  expansion  to  more  than  700  different  known  creatures  in  the  universe.Unlike  previous  titles  that  were  named  after  colors,  "Pokémon  X"  and  "Pokémon  Y"  represent  a  more  analytical  way  of  developing  the  games  for  The  Pokémon  Company  and  Nintendo.  Ishihara  said  it  required  designers  to  understand  that  not  all  Pokémon  gamers  play  for  the  same  reasons."X  and  Y  represent  the  X-axis  and  the  Y-axis,  but  not  in  a  scientific  sense,"  he  said.  "Each  person's  thought  process,  though  different,  tends  to  intersect  somewhere.  I'd  like  to  think  this  commonality  or  intersection  occurs  when  people  of  diverse  backgrounds  play  'Pokémon  X'  and  'Pokémon  Y'  together."Developers  also  included  a  new  transformation  ability  called  Mega  Evolution.  As  Pokémon  battle  and  gain  experience,  they  evolve  into  stronger  forms  of  themselves  with  improved  skills  and  stats.  Mega  Evolution  allows  the  creature  to  temporarily  become  stronger  in  battle.Here's  the  catch:  not  all  Pokémon  can  Mega  Evolve."(This)  requires  players  to  use  new  strategies  while  they  play,  taking  the  brand  to  a  new  dimension,"  Ishihara  said.  "This  is  yet  another  reason  we  chose  titles  that  were  theoretical  instead  of  names  based  on  colors  or  precious  stones."Keeping  the  franchise  fresh  for  fans  while  making  it  accessible  to  a  new  audience  is  important  to  Ishihara.  Pokémon  is  the  second-best-selling  gaming  franchise  in  the  world,  trailing  only  the  "Mario"  series.Recognizing  that  its  place  in  video  game  history  is  assured,  Ishihara  said  new  technology  allows  designers  to  do  things  with  Pokemon  they  couldn't  do  in  previous  titles."Maintaining  a  balance  of  familiarity  and  innovation  is  important,"  he  said.  "Ever-evolving  technology  helps  maintain  that  balance,  because  we  can  progress  aspects  of  the  game  that  people  enjoy  already  and  add  things  like  new  communication  features  that  could  only  be  imagined  five,  ten  years  ago.""We  feel  this  balance  is  key  to  the  franchise's  success  and  longevity.  In  'Pokémon  X'  and  'Pokémon  Y,'  I  think  we  do  an  excellent  job  of  introducing  the  basics  of  the  game  to  the  player  in  a  natural  way,  building  their  understanding  step  after  step,  all  while  ensuring  the  pacing  allows  the  longtime  fan  to  jump  in  and  progress  quickly  to  the  more  challenging  portions  of  the  gameplay."The  two  new  titles  represent  the  franchise's  first  foray  onto  the  Nintendo  3DS  handheld  console.  The  visual  enhancements  give  players  the  opportunity  to  see  their  favorites  move  and  interact  in  ways  they  never  could  before.The  technical  abilities  of  the  3DS  let  players  see  their  favorite  moves  and  interactions  in  new  ways,  as  well  as  play  with  other  gamers  around  the  world.Ishihara  said  in  late  December  that  a  new  cloud  service  called  Pokémon  Bank  would  let  players  move  their  creatures  back  and  forth  between  games  --  a  service  fans  have  been  asking  for  for  many  years."We  have  to  stick  to  the  core  of  the  franchise  --  the  collecting,  battling  and  trading  --  while  at  the  same  time  we  have  to  take  advantage  of  the  new  technology  and  the  evolution  of  the  hardware  to  expand  on  the  aspect  of  communication,"  he  said.  "We  also  need  to  make  sure  that  it's  fun  and  rewarding  to  do  each  of  these  things.  It's  not  an  easy  task."Despite  the  advancements  in  technology,  improvements  to  the  look  and  intense  level  of  fan  interest,  Ishihara  believes  that  the  franchise's  simple,  original  goal  --  to  bring  people  together  --  works  as  well  today  as  it  did  17  years  ago."The  Pokémon  universe  is  incredibly  fun  and  diverse,  and  like  the  world  we  all  live  in,  continues  to  surprise  and  excite  us,"  he  said.  "I'm  really  excited  to  continue  working  to  connect  people  in  ways  we  only  dreamed  about  when  we  first  started.  There  is  still  so  much  to  discover,  so  many  Pokémon  to  find."Gotta  catch  'em  all  indeed.</TEXT></DOC>

Authors  found  significant  differences  in  the  rates  of  disorders  like  major  depression,  intermittent  explosive  disorder  and  post-traumatic  stress,  said  Harvard  epidemiologist  Ronald  Kessler,  the  lead  author  on  one  of  the  studies.Almost  25%  of  nearly  5,500  active-duty,  non-deployed  Army  soldiers  surveyed  tested  positive  for  a  mental  disorder  of  some  kind,  and  11%  within  that  subgroup  also  tested  positive  for  more  than  one  illness.  Some  of  those  conditions  are  related  to  the  hard  experience  of  a  wartime  Army,  but  Kessler  said  nearly  half  of  the  soldiers  who  were  diagnosed  with  a  mental  disorder  had  it  when  they  enlisted."Obviously,  the  kind  of  person  who  joins  the  Army  is  not  the  random  person  in  America.  You're  patriotic  and  adventurous  and  maybe  a  little  more  aggressive,"  he  said.  But  the  rates  of  conditions  like  attention  deficit-hyperactivity  disorder  and  intermittent  explosive  disorder  in  the  study  matched  a  pattern  researchers  also  found  in  the  newest  recruits."We've  gone  back  to  some  new  soldiers  the  very  first  day  they're  in  the  Army,"  said  Kessler,  the  McNeil  Family  professor  of  health  care  policy  at  Harvard  Medical  School.  "They  get  their  hair  cut,  they  get  their  blood  tested  and  they  sit  down  and  talk  to  us  --  and  they  have  the  same  high  rates."At  the  Pentagon,  Lt.  Col.  Cathy  Wilkinson  said  the  Defense  Department  is  reviewing  the  results  and  would  work  to  include  them  into  the  military's  mental  health  procedures."Our  most  valuable  resource  within  the  department  is  our  people,"  Wilkinson  said  in  a  statement  issued  to  CNN.  "We  are  committed  to  taking  care  of  them,  and  that  includes  doing  everything  possible  to  prevent  suicides  in  the  military."The  rate  of  major  depression  is  five  times  as  high  among  soldiers  as  civilians;  intermittent  explosive  disorder,  which  results  in  episodes  of  extreme  anger,  is  six  times  as  high;  and  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  was  nearly  15  times  higher  than  among  civilians,  the  study  found.Much  of  the  data  used  in  the  reports  was  taken  from  the  Army's  STARRS  (Study  to  Assess  Risk  and  Resilience  in  Servicemembers)  survey  of  almost  5,500  soldiers.  The  project  was  collaboration  between  the  U.S.  Army  and  the  U.S.  National  Institute  of  Mental  Health.  The  survey  looked  at  disorders  that  included  clinical  depression,  bipolar  disorder,  panic  disorder  and  PTSD.  Authors  also  noted  that  alcohol  and  drug  use  were  common.When  it  came  to  suicidal  thoughts,  one  study  found  about  14%  of  soldiers  had  thought  about  taking  their  lives,  while  5.3%  had  planned  a  suicide  and  2.4%  had  actually  made  one  or  more  attempts.  Most  suicides  occurred  back  home,  not  in  Afghanistan  or  Iraq,  and  the  rate  has  increased  among  troops  who  have  never  been  deployed  overseas,  Kessler  said.Despite  concerns  about  the  effects  of  multiple  combat  tours  and  shorter  stints  at  home  during  more  than  a  decade  of  war,  Kessler  said  veterans  appear  to  fare  better  than  younger  soldiers.  Those  who  suffer  from  mental  health  problems  are  "substantially  less  likely"  to  re-enlist,  while  troops  on  their  second  or  third  hitch  are  more  likely  to  enjoy  Army  life."If  you  can  get  them  through  the  first  tour,  if  they  deploy,  they  come  back  and  they  decide  they  want  to  sign  up  again,  those  are  the  people  who  have  lower  rates,"  he  said.  The  problems  are  largely  among  "the  young  guys  who  are  in  their  first  tour,  who  don't  know  what  they're  getting  into."But  overall,  the  three  papers  painted  a  disturbing  picture  of  the  military  and  mental  illnesses.  Although  the  causes  for  the  rise  in  Army  suicides  still  remain  unknown  the  authors  hoped  their  data  might  be  useful  to  the  military  to  help  develop  outreach  programs  for  new  soldiers  as  well  as  those  who  are  already  in  the  service."These  studies  provide  knowledge  on  suicide  risk  and  potentially  protective  factors  in  a  military  population  that  can  also  help  us  better  understand  how  to  prevent  suicide  in  the  public  at  large,"  said  National  Institute  of  Mental  Health  Director  Dr.  Thomas  R.  Insel.Kessler  said  the  Army  "does  a  very  good  job"  of  making  mental  health  services  available  to  its  soldiers  and  encourages  them  to  step  forward  when  they  have  a  problem.  But  he  said  the  study  shows  how  many  people  are  coming  into  the  service  "with  emotional  problems  that  need  to  be  addressed  in  the  United  States.""We've  got  to  figure  out  some  ways  to  get  people  early  in  the  process,  as  part  of  the  process,  saying,  'Look,  you're  making  yourself  the  most  complete  soldier,  the  most  effective  person.  You've  got  to  prepare  yourself  mentally,  as  well,  and  be  willing  to  admit  that  everybody  has  problems,'  "  he  said.At  last,  suicides  among  military  family  members  could  be  trackedWhy  suicide  rate  among  veterans  may  be  more  than  22  a  dayWebsites  become  tool  for  helping  veteransCNN's  Matt  Smith  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

The  vehicle  was  recovered  at  Hernandez'  uncle's  home  in  Bristol,  Connecticut.The  search  warrant  also  granted  permission  to  seize  a  bag  of  clothing  with  Hernandez's  name  on  it  that  was  found  at  that  home.It's  unclear  what  was  found  in  the  bag  and  no  document  detailing  what  was  removed  from  the  house  has  been  released.Police  are  looking  for  clothing  and  jewelry  worn  by  Hernandez  the  night  of  the  double  homicide,  including  a  baseball  hat,  a  T-shirt,  sneakers  and  a  beaded  necklace.Hernandez  is  seen  on  a  nightclub  video  surveillance  camera  wearing  those  same  items,  according  to  the  search  warrant,  which  is  partially  redacted.No  charges  have  been  filed  and  authorities  have  not  commented  publicly  on  the  investigation.But  as  as  CNN  has  previously  reported,  a  grand  jury  has  been  looking  into  whether  Hernandez  played  a  role  in  the  drive-by  shooting,  according  to  law  enforcement  sources.That  2012  shooting  is  separate  from  a  2013  killing  in  which  Hernandez  is  charged  and  awaiting  trial.Hernandez,  24,  was  indicted  for  first-degree  murder  and  weapons  charges  by  a  different  grand  jury  in  August  2013,  in  the  shooting  death  of  his  friend  Odin  Lloyd.  Hernandez  has  pleaded  not  guilty.</TEXT></DOC>

The  results  are  haunting  photographs  that  look  like  they  were  smuggled  out  of  a  dream.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(Wired)  --  Like  a  professional  location  scout  for  Grimm  fairy  tale  movies,  photographer  Kilian  Schönberger  seeks  out  and  explores  the  less-traveled  regions  of  Europe,  searching  for  places  that  test  the  boundaries  of  fantasy  and  reality.  The  results  are  haunting  photographs  that  look  like  they  were  smuggled  out  of  a  dream."Tolkien's  books,  like  Lord  of  the  Rings  and  The  Hobbit,  were  inspired  by  the  old  European  myths,  legends  and  fairy  tales,"  says  Schönberger.  "The  movies  featured  the  wild  landscapes  of  New  Zealand  --  but  I  wanted  to  find  out  if  there  are  similar  wild  landscapes  left  in  the  populous  region  of  Middle  Europe,  too.  Therefore,  I  visited  places  in  Germany,  Czech  Republic,  Luxembourg  and  Austria."The  resulting  series  is  called  Brothers  Grimm  Homeland,  for  which  Schönberger  expertly  uses  framing,  fog  and  lighting  to  subtly  suggest  the  fairy  tales  of  The  Brothers  Grimm.  He  lets  our  imaginations  do  the  rest.Read:  Haunting  Photos  of  a  Crumbling  Post-Communist  WorldBeginning  with  Children's  and  Household  Tales,  published  in  1812,  Jacob  Ludwig  Carl  Grimm  and  Wilhelm  Carl  Grimm  collected  and  published  folklore;  specifically  the  stories  that  they  believed  reflected  and  preserved  aspects  of  their  own  Germanic  culture  and  faith.  Stories  such  as  Little  Red  Riding  Hood,  Hansel  and  Gretel,  Snow  White,  and  Sleeping  Beauty  all  originated  in  European  folk  tales.  Thanks  to  their  research,  these  fables  held  enough  appeal  to  survive  the  centuries."As  a  kid  I  was  deeply  fascinated  by  the  magic  of  those  stories,"  says  Schönberger.  "Now  --  grown  up  and  living  in  a  rather  big  city  (Cologne)  --  this  magic  has  disappeared  in  my  everyday  life  ...  I  try  to  restore  this  world  in  my  pictures."Schönberger  is  a  geographer  as  well  as  a  photographer,  and  he  combines  both  disciplines  to  communicate  more  than  just  the  scenic  beauty  of  a  landscape.  He  does  a  considerable  amount  of  research  both  ahead  of  time  and  in  the  field,  taking  into  account  landscape  genesis,  culture,  and  history.  The  locations  he  seeks  are  often  rural  and  remote,  and  he  uses  fables  and  local  fairy  tales  as  a  source  when  searching  for  new  and  lesser-known  photo  locations  in  Europe.  Once  he's  finally  found  the  right  spot,  the  weather  conditions  have  to  match  up  perfectly."Fog  is  an  essential  ingredient  for  the  otherworldly  look  I  am  searching  for,"  Schönberger  says.  "I  would  say  I  have  'mastered'  my  personal  'fog  forecast'  abilities,  but  it's  still  more  often  than  not  a  game  of  pure  chance  whether  the  fog  has  the  right  density  or  not.  Sometimes  it  lasts  years  until  you'll  get  the  desired  conditions."Schönberger  actively  began  pursuing  photography  in  2003,  starting  with  a  compact  Ricoh  Caplio  RR30.  The  following  year,  he  spent  his  alternative  service  (Germany's  version  of  mandatory  military  service)  near  the  Alps,  which  took  him  to  some  amazing  landscapes."This  was  the  time  I  started  to  reflect  on  composition  and  light  control,"  he  says.  "One  year  later  I  unfortunately  dropped  the  Ricoh  camera  down  a  waterfall  --  seems  like  my  photographic  passion  for  landscapes  was  present  from  the  beginning."Read:  What  Happens  When  You  Zap  Instant  Film  With  15,000  VoltsThe  sudden  loss  of  his  only  camera  eventually  pushed  him  to  purchase  a  DSLR  in  2006,  but  his  work  didn't  become  what  he  considers  truly  ambitious  for  another  three  years.  While  on  a  six-month  trip  in  Norway,  he  became  drawn  to  scenes  that  characterize  what  he  now  describes  as  the  "melancholic  and  harsh  beauty"  of  his  remote  surroundings."In  technology-driven  urban  environments,  it's  principally  hard  to  find  resting  places  untouched  by  disturbing  visual,  olfactory,  or  audible  noise,"  Schönberger  says.  "These  kinds  of  places  are  endangered  in  today's  world."Along  with  the  long  hikes  and  inclement  weather,  Schönberger  has  the  added  challenge  of  being  colorblind.  The  blindness  affects  several  tones,  rendering  him  incapable  of  distinguishing  green  from  red,  magenta  from  grey,  or  violet  from  blue.  Rather  than  be  detrimental  to  his  work,  over  the  years  he's  learned  to  transform  it  into  a  source  of  strength.  By  ignoring  color,  he's  free  to  focus  more  on  the  composition,  which  can  be  difficult  to  tame  in  chaotic  forest  environments.Ultimately  it's  Schönberger's  instincts,  vision  and  editing  that  infuse  his  photos  with  fantasy  and  elevate  them  above  simply  beautiful  landscapes."I  don't  want  to  show  just  portrayals  of  natural  scenes,"  Schönberger  says.  "I  want  to  create  visually  accessible  places  where  the  visitor  can  put  his  mind  at  rest  and  make  up  his  own  stories."Read  more  from  WIRED:A  Room  That  Wrecks  Your  PerspectiveCreepy  Portraits  of  Ventriloquist  DummiesSubscribe  to  WIRED  magazine  for  less  than  $1  an  issue  and  get  a  FREE  GIFT!

Chris  Christie  is,  to  put  it  politely,  a  woman  of  contradictions.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  The  Democratic  mayor  at  the  center  of  one  of  the  controversies  swirling  around  Republican  Gov.  Chris  Christie  is,  to  put  it  politely,  a  woman  of  contradictions.Hoboken  Mayor  Dawn  Zimmer  says  the  New  Jersey  governor  threatened  to  withhold  Superstorm  Sandy  relief  funds  unless  she  got  behind  a  redevelopment  project  he  favors.  It's  a  story  that  has  changed  with  the  telling.The  inconsistencies  don't  stop  there.  Hundreds  of  pages  of  court  documents  reviewed  by  CNN  raise  questions  about  her  allegations  against  Christie  and  whether  she  deals  in  the  same  pay-to-play  politics  she's  alleging  against  him.Who  is  Dawn  Zimmer?Zimmer's  allegations  against  Christie  have  evolved  over  time.  Early  on,  she  said  she  had  no  reason  to  think  Christie  had  retaliated  against  her.  About  a  week  later,  she  had  implicated  four  senior  administration  officials,  including  Christie,  in  a  pressure  campaign.On  Thursday,  January  9,  Christie  held  a  marathon  news  conference  and  announced  that  he  had  dismissed  two  top  advisers  for  their  suggested  roles  in  tying  up  traffic  on  the  George  Washington  Bridge  in  what  may  have  been  an  act  of  political  retaliation.The  next  day,  Zimmer  was  quoted  by  a  local  public  radio  station  saying  she  was  disappointed  with  how  much  flood  mitigation  money  she  received  from  the  state.  But  she  said  she  hoped  it  wasn't  retribution  for  not  endorsing  the  governor  during  last  year's  re-election  race."With  20/20  hindsight,  in  the  context  we're  in  right  now,  you  can  always  look  back  and  say,  'OK,  was  it  retribution?'  "  Zimmer  told  WNYC  on  that  Friday.  "I  think  probably  all  mayors  are  reflecting  right  now  and  thinking  about  it,  but  I  really  hope  that  that's  not  the  case."On  Saturday,  Zimmer  went  even  farther,  telling  CNN,  "I  don't  think  it  was  retaliation  and  I  don't  have  any  reason  to  think  it's  retaliation,  but  I'm  not  satisfied  with  the  amount  of  money  I've  gotten  so  far."Hoboken  mayor:  Claims  about  Christie  and  Sandy  funds  trueTurns  out,  that  wasn't  exactly  true.Zimmer  did,  in  fact,  have  some  reason  to  believe  it  was  retaliation,  a  case  she  laid  out  a  week  later  on  MSNBC.On  Saturday,  January  18,  she  told  MSNBC's  Steve  Kornacki  that  New  Jersey  Lt.  Gov.  Kim  Guadagno  "pulled  me  aside"  at  an  event  in  Hoboken  and  told  her  that  getting  Sandy  relief  funds  hinged  on  supporting  the  redevelopment  project  on  land  owned  by  The  Rockefeller  Group.Questions  about  Zimmer's  diaryZimmer  said  the  conversation  was  recorded  in  her  diary  in  which  she  wrote:"She  pulls  me  aside  with  no  one  else  around  and  says  that  I  need  to  move  forward  with  the  Rockefeller  project.  It  is  very  important  to  the  governor.  The  word  is  that  you  are  against  it  and  you  need  to  move  it  forward  or  we  are  not  going  to  be  able  to  help  you.  I  know  it`s  not  right.  These  things  should  not  be  connected,  but  they  are.  And  if  you  tell  anyone  I  said  that,  I  will  deny  it."See  the  pages  from  Zimmer's  journalAlso  in  the  diary,  Zimmer's  allegation  that  state  Community  Affairs  Commissioner  Richard  Constable  also  conditioned  Sandy  relief  funds  on  moving  the  development  forward.The  day  after  the  MSNBC  interview,  Zimmer  directly  implicated  Christie,  telling  CNN's  Candy  Crowley  that  when  Guadagno  spoke  to  her  last  May  she  was  relaying  "a  direct  message  from  the  governor."When  Crowley  asked  why  she  was  coming  forward  now,  Zimmer  said  she  didn't  think  anyone  would  have  believed  her  last  May.  And  she  worried  that  if  she  didn't  say  something  before  the  next  round  of  Sandy  funding  was  released,  Hoboken  would  be  hurt."I  was  really  concerned  that  if  I  came  forward,  no  one  believed  me,  that  we  would  really  be  cut  out  of  the  Sandy  funding.  But  as  I  watched  the  coverage  with  'Bridgegate,'  you  do  see  parallels,"  she  said  that  Sunday.  "I  just  felt  I  had  an  obligation  to  come  forward  and  as  I  look  for  the  second  tranche  of  funding  (to)  come  through,  I'm  concerned  we're  going  to  be  cut  out."The  next  day,  January  20,  Zimmer  told  CNN's  Anderson  Cooper  that  another  state  official  had  tied  Sandy  recovery  money  to  development;  she  said  she  felt  pressured  by  Marc  Ferzan,  who  heads  up  New  Jersey's  storm  recovery.Each  time  she  told  the  story,  the  number  of  people  she  implicated  in  the  pressure  campaign  grew.Spokesman:  Information  came  out  in  stagesZimmer  spokesman  Juan  Melli  said,  "The  information  came  out  in  stages  because  Mayor  Zimmer  was  asked  different  questions  in  each  interview  by  various  reporters.  She  was  not  presenting  a  legal  case,  but  was  simply  answering  the  questions  that  she  was  asked.  The  U.S.  attorney  has  asked  considerably  more  questions  and  she  will  continue  to  provide  them  with  all  the  information  that  they  believe  is  relevant  to  their  investigation."Melli  didn't  answer  the  question  of  why  Zimmer  originally  said  she  had  no  reason  to  believe  Christie  had  retaliated  against  her.Christie's  office  responded  to  Zimmer's  claims  by  saying  Hoboken  has  gotten  millions  in  federal  aid  and  called  the  charges  "partisan  politics."  A  spokeswoman  for  Constable  said  they  were  "categorically  false"  --  the  same  language  a  Christie  spokesman  used  to  describe  the  allegation  against  Ferzan.  And  Guadagno  called  Zimmer's  version  of  events  "not  only  false  but  ...  illogical."CNN  has  obtained  documents  that  contradict  Zimmer's  story  about  her  meeting  with  Ferzan,  the  governor's  point  man  for  Sandy  recovery.Zimmer  said  on  "Anderson  Cooper  360˚"  that  when  she  asked  for  the  administration's  support  of  a  flood  mitigation  project,  Ferzan  told  her,  "'Well,  mayor,  you  need  to  let  me  know  how  much  development  you're  willing  to  do.'  That  was  the  answer  that  I  got  back.  So,  I  mean,  that  pressure  is  there."But,  according  to  notes  from  the  November  25  meeting  taken  by  a  source  in  the  room,  Zimmer  spoke  twice  during  the  Sandy  recovery  briefing  that  included  about  20  state  and  local  officials.  And  neither  time  Ferzan  addressed  Zimmer's  concerns  did  it  appear  he  was  pressuring  her,  according  to  the  notes.The  mayor's  spokesman  said  Zimmer,  "stands  by  her  statement  regarding  the  conversation."Much  of  Zimmer's  allegations  are  based  on  a  diary  in  which  she  says  she  took  contemporaneous  notes  of  her  conversations  with  Guadagno  and  Constable.Note-taking  habits  in  questionBut  court  records  reviewed  by  CNN  show  that,  in  some  cases,  Zimmer  doesn't  take  notes  when  talking  about  city  business.In  a  successful  wrongful  termination  lawsuit  brought  by  a  former  Hoboken  public  safety  director,  Zimmer  was  asked  by  the  former  director's  attorney,  Louis  Zayas,  if  she  took  notes  during  her  meeting  with  city  department  heads."Generally,  when  I  meet  with  directors,  they  know  what  they  need  to  follow  up  on  and  they're  writing  it  down  and  so  I  look  to  the  directors  to  be  writing  those  things  down,"  Zimmer  said  according  to  court  documents."But  you  don't,"  Zayas  asked  Zimmer."No,  I  don't,"  Zimmer  answered,  according  to  the  deposition  taken  in  July,  just  a  few  months  after  the  conversation  with  the  lieutenant  governor  she  said  she  recorded  in  her  diary.In  a  set  of  written  questions,  Zimmer  was  asked,  "Do  you  keep  a  diary,  calendar  or  other  means  of  keeping  appointments  and  notes?  If  yes,  identify  the  method  by  which  you  maintain  your  calendar."The  mayor  answered,  "My  calendar  is  kept  in  a  Google  account.  The  Google  account  as  preceded  by  an  Outlook  calendar,"  according  to  court  documents.Zayas  said  that  Zimmer  lied."I  don't  believe  she  was  truthful  in  her  deposition  that  she  didn't  have  a  diary.  My  client  observed  her  on  numerous  occasions  writing  things  down  in  a  diary,"  Zayas  told  CNN.Indeed,  Zayas'  client,  Angel  Alicea,  told  CNN  that  Zimmer  took  notes  at  every  meeting.Zayas  added,  "If  she  lied  about  something  like  that  why  would  you  believe  that  she  wrote  something  contemporaneously  at  a  future  occasion.  So  my  question  would  be,  if  she  lied  then,  why  would  you  believe  her  now?"Zimmer's  attorney,  Gerald  Krovatin,  said  in  a  statement  to  CNN  that  "the  plain  language  of  the  deposition  makes  clear  that  (Zayas)  was  referring  to  calendars  and  scheduling  and  appointments  for  the  mayor  and  whether  she  takes  notes  at  meetings.  Those  things  bear  no  relationship  to  a  personal  diary  or  journal.""This  mischaracterization  is  not  surprising  coming  from  Mr.  Zayas,  who  has  four  pending  lawsuits  against  the  city  and/or  the  mayor  in  which  he  has  demonstrated  a  clear  personal  animosity  towards  the  mayor,"  he  said.Zayas  also  accused  Zimmer  of  perjury,  charging  that  she  lied  about  how  she  prepared  for  her  testimony,  but  the  judge  in  the  case  ignored  his  claim.  In  an  interview,  Krovatin  called  it  a  "stunt  by  Zayas  to  generate  a  headline."A  jury  found  that  the  city's  decision  to  terminate  Alicea  was  "especially  egregious"  and  that  "upper  management"  either  participated  in  or  was  indifferent  to  the  wrongdoing.  They  awarded  Alicea  more  than  $1  million  in  back  pay  and  punitive  damages.  They  city  is  appealing.A  bit  of  a  Jersey  twistAnother  lawsuit  featured  a  bit  of  a  Jersey  twist.  It  essentially  accused  Zimmer  of  making  the  same  kinds  of  threats  that  she  has  alleged  against  Christie.In  this  case,  the  executive  director  of  the  Hoboken  Housing  Authority  sued  Zimmer,  arguing  she  created  "an  unwritten  policy  of  political  patronage  or  'pay  to  play'  to  reward  ...  political  supporters,"  according  to  court  documents.The  director,  Carmelo  Garcia,  accused  a  Zimmer  ally  of  threatening  his  job  unless  he  appointed  Zimmer's  choice  for  general  counsel."Unless  Director  Garcia  awarded  the  government  contract  to  the  Law  Firm,  in  particular,  and  implement  (sic)  Mayor  Zimmer's  policies,  in  general,  there  would  be  efforts  to  make  his  job  difficult  to  perform  and,  in  effect,  his  job  was  at  risk,"  according  to  court  documents.Garcia  told  CNN,  "I've  been  subjected  to  political  bullying,  I  have  been  harassed,  intimidated  and  retaliated  against,  simply  because  I  had  blown  the  whistle  and  I  did  not  want  to  partake  in  a  scheme  that  would  require  the  mayor  using  the  housing  authority,  which  is  supposed  to  be  an  autonomous  entity,  to  basically  give  out  contracts  to  politically  connected  law  firms."He  called  Zimmer's  claims  against  Christie  "ironic  ...  almost  like  the  pot  calling  the  kettle  black."Zimmer's  spokesman  did  not  speak  to  the  charge  that  she  or  her  allies  threatened  Garcia's  job  unless  he  hired  her  choice  of  attorney.  Instead,  he  said  that  one  of  the  suit's  other  charges,  namely  that  Zimmer  was  engaged  in  an  "ethnic  cleansing"  initiative,  called  into  question  Garcia's  credibility.A  judge  essentially  dismissed  Garcia's  case,  but  allowed  him  to  amend  and  refile  it.</TEXT></DOC>

Chris  Christie's  aides  ordered  lane  closures.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  The  Democratic  New  Jersey  legislator  leading  an  investigation  into  Republican  Gov.  Chris  Christie's  administration  says  he  believes  laws  were  broken  when  the  governor's  aides  ordered  lane  closures  at  the  nation's  busiest  bridge."I  do  think  laws  have  been  broken,"  said  State  Assemblyman  John  Wisniewski,  who's  also  deputy  speaker.  "Public  resources  --  the  bridge,  police  officers  --  all  were  used  for  a  political  purpose,  for  some  type  of  retribution,  and  that  violates  the  law."Legislators  need  to  "make  sure  any  violations  of  law  are  addressed,"  Wisniewski  told  CNN  on  Saturday.Christie,  who  had  no  public  activities  scheduled  for  Saturday,  and  his  spokesman  couldn't  be  immediately  reached  for  comment.Meanwhile,  New  Jersey  Assembly  Speaker-elect  Vincent  Prieto,  a  Democrat,  will  call  a  special  session  Thursday  so  lawmakers  can  vote  on  extending  the  subpoena  power  of  the  investigation  led  by  Wisniewski,  Prieto  said.The  past  week's  revelations  "clearly  show  the  need  for  a  continued  thorough  investigation  by  the  New  Jersey  General  Assembly,"  Prieto  said.  "Many  questions  remain  unanswered  about  this  threat  to  public  safety  and  abuse  of  power."Even  while  Democrats  call  to  expand  the  investigation,  Florida  Republicans  confirmed  Saturday  that  Christie  will  visit  that  state  next  week  to  raise  money  for  the  re-election  effort  of  Gov.  Rick  Scott.Documents:  Christie  appointees  stonewalled  queries  into  lane  closures"Yes,  Christie  will  be  here  next  weekend,  and  we  are  looking  forward  to  it,"  Florida  GOP  spokesperson  Susan  Hepworth  said.In  New  Jersey,  Wisniewski  said  the  legislative  committee's  investigation  into  the  scandal  "would  be  made  immeasurably  simpler  if  the  governor's  office  said,  'Please  tell  us  what  you'd  like.  We'll  turn  over  all  those  documents.'""If  the  governor  really  meant  what  he  said,  that  he  wants  to  get  to  the  bottom  of  it  ...  it  would  only  be  fair  for  him  to  make  those  documents  available,"  Wisniewski  said.On  Friday,  the  New  Jersey  State  Assembly  committee  investigating  the  George  Washington  Bridge  scandal  released  more  than  2,000  pages  of  documents  suggesting  politics  was  behind  the  lane  closures  and  showing  top  Christie  aides  tried  to  stonewall  media  inquiries  into  the  matter.Read  the  documentsChristie,  a  potential  presidential  candidate  in  2016,  has  strongly  denied  involvement  in  how  his  aides  ordered  the  lane  closures  at  the  bridge  as  revenge  against  a  neighboring  Democrat  mayor  who  refused  to  endorse  Christie  in  his  successful  gubernatorial  campaign  last  November.The  state  legislative  committee  has  yet  to  find  any  documents  indicating  Christie  was  involved  in  the  lane  closures,  Wisniewski  said  Saturday.But  Wisniewski  charged  that  it  "just  strains  believability"  that  Christie  had  no  knowledge  of  how  his  staff  orchestrated  the  lane  closures,  which  created  public  safety  hazards  in  Fort  Lee,  New  Jersey,  where  Mayor  Mark  Sokolich  had  opposed  Christie's  re-election  effort.Wisniewski  also  suggested  that  retribution  against  the  Fort  Lee  mayor  was  the  motive  behind  the  lane  closures  to  the  bridge,  which  connects  New  Jersey  and  New  York,  from  September  9  to  September  13."I  think  anything's  possible,"  Wisniewski  said.  "One  thing's  clear:  The  anger  that  was  displayed  [...]  by  people  in  the  governor's  circle  after  the  lane  closure  was  terminated."Why  are  they  so  angry?  Why  are  they  so  mad  at  this  process  being  shut  down,"  Wisniewski  asked.Plenty  in  his  own  party  happy  to  see  Christie  get  comeuppanceChristie  this  week  fired  his  deputy  chief  of  staff,  Bridget  Anne  Kelly,  for  her  role  in  the  lane  closure,  which  was  captured  in  e-mail  correspondence  that  was  subpoenaed  by  Democrats  investigating  the  matter.The  e-mail  exchanges  are  among  the  most  damaging  evidence  so  far  supporting  their  assertions  the  lane  closures  were  politically  motivated.  The  correspondence  began  three  weeks  before  access  lanes  to  the  bridge  were  closed."Time  for  some  traffic  problems  in  Fort  Lee,"  Kelly  said  in  an  e-mail  to  David  Wildstein,  then  the  highest-level  appointee  representing  the  state  at  the  Port  Authority  of  New  York  and  New  Jersey,  which  operates  the  bridge  connecting  the  two  states."Got  it,"  Wildstein  replied.Wildstein  resigned  last  month  from  the  port  authority,  where  he  was  the  director  of  interstate  capital  projects.Wildstein  asserted  the  lane  closures  were  part  of  a  traffic  study.Legal  woes  lurk  for  Christie  over  scandalCNN's  Chris  Kokenes  and  Conor  Finnegan  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

In  response,  the  former  child  star  quoted  French  soccer  player  Eric  Cantona:  "When  the  seagulls  follow  the  trawler,  it  is  because  they  think  sardines  will  be  thrown  into  the  sea."As  the  room  tried  to  make  sense  of  his  answer,  LaBeouf  made  his  exit.  And  that  was  just  the  prelude.Later  on  at  the  "Nymphomaniac"  premiere,  LaBeouf  showed  up  on  the  red  carpet  wearing  a  tuxedo  and  a  paper  bag  over  his  head.  As  if  that  wasn't  eye-catching  enough,  the  mask,  which  was  outfitted  with  two  holes  for  his  eyes,  had  "I  AM  NOT  FAMOUS  ANYMORE"  scrawled  on  it  in  black  marker.To  LaBeouf's  fans,  that  line  is  all  too  familiar.  He's  tweeted  the  phrase,  in  all  caps,  every  day  since  January  20.Making  this  situation  even  more  curious  are  the  series  of  events  that  led  up  to  his  "NOT  FAMOUS"  proclamation.  In  December,  LaBeouf  was  hit  with  allegations  that  he  plagiarized  author  Daniel  Clowes'  work  for  his  short  film,  "HowardCantour.com,"  and  the  actor  soon  copped  to  using  Clowes'  art  without  proper  credit."I  f****d  up,"  he  said  at  the  time  in  a  tweeted  statement.  "In  my  excitement  and  naiveté  as  an  amateur  filmmaker,  I  got  lost  in  the  creative  process  and  neglected  to  follow  proper  accreditation  ...  I'm  embarrassed  that  I  failed  to  credit  @danielclowes  for  his  original  graphic  novella  Justin  M.  Damiano,  which  served  as  my  inspiration  ...  I  was  truly  moved  by  his  piece  of  work  &  I  knew  that  it  would  make  a  poignant  &  relevant  short.  I  apologize  to  all  who  assumed  I  wrote  it."A  few  days  after  that  statement,  however,  LaBeouf  started  taking  the  concept  to  extremes.  He  began  responding  to  the  vitriol  online  with  more  plagiarism,  borrowing  from  mea  culpas  by  Facebook's  Mark  Zuckerberg,  UK  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Nick  Clegg  and  even  "Nymphomaniac"  director  von  Trier.In  January,  LaBeouf  literally  took  his  apologies  to  a  higher  level,  hiring  an  airplane  to  sky  write  "I  am  sorry  Daniel  Clowes"  in  Los  Angeles.Before  anyone  could  figure  out  what  LaBeouf  was  really  up  to  --  there  were  rumors  that  his  strangeness  was  actually  performance  art  --  he  announced  that  he  was  retiring."In  light  of  the  recent  attacks  against  my  artistic  integrity,  I  am  retiring  from  all  public  life,"  he  said  on  January  10.  "My  love  goes  out  to  those  who  have  supported  me."Of  course,  it  appears  that  LaBeouf  has  a  very  different  definition  of  what  it  means  to  be  retired.  Not  only  is  the  actor  still  as  publicly  visible  as  ever,  but  he's  also  still  accepting  movie  roles.  The  former  "Transformers"  actor  has  been  cast  alongside  Bill  Murray  in  "Rock  the  Kasbah."</TEXT></DOC>

Logan  asked  his  mom.  The  question  broke  her  heart  --  and  pushed  her  to  change.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Do  you  have  a  weight-loss  success  story  to  share?  Tell  us  how  you  did  it  and  you  could  be  featured  on  CNN.com.(CNN)  --  With  the  one-track  mind  of  a  6-year-old,  Logan  interrogated  his  mother,  Jenny  Spencer.Why  are  the  other  moms  skinnier  than  you?  he  asked  at  the  park.If  you  took  weight  loss  pills,  would  you  be  skinny?  he  wondered  during  a  TV  infomercial.Spencer  brushed  off  his  questions.  He  was  6  and  curious  about  the  world  around  him.  She  was  exhausted,  trying  to  care  for  two  young  boys  and  her  husband,  who  had  chronic  health  issues.  Her  own  health  had  fallen  to  the  bottom  of  the  to-do  list.But  Logan's  last  question  hit  her  like,  well,  the  elephant  in  the  room.If  you  got  skinny,  would  you  be  able  to  play  with  me?"My  heart  broke,"  Spencer  wrote  on  iReport.  "And  from  that  moment  forward,  I  began  the  transformation  into  a  healthier  lifestyle  for  my  children."When  Spencer  stepped  on  the  scale  in  June  2012,  the  number  200  came  as  no  surprise.  More  than  a  dozen  people  had  asked  her  over  the  past  few  years  whether  she  was  pregnant.  Two  had  rubbed  her  belly  when  there  was  no  baby  at  all.The  extra  weight  caused  pain  in  Spencer's  hips  when  she  walked,  and  the  doctor  warned  that  she  was  on  the  verge  of  type  2  diabetes.She  had  tried  dieting  after  her  second  son,  Brody,  was  born.  Weight  Watchers  helped  her  drop  10  pounds,  but  she  quickly  gained  20  back.  Her  sister,  "a  health  nut,"  encouraged  her  to  try  different  cleanses.  All  left  her  feeling  like  a  failure.She  was  depressed,  anxious  and  overwhelmed."You  know,  I  started  every  Monday  dreaming  I  could  change  my  life,"  Spencer  remembered.  "It  was  nearly  a  decade  of  that."Logan's  question  made  her  realize  she  was  missing  her  sons'  lives  --  and  her  own.Spencer  started  counting  calories,  keeping  her  daily  total  under  1,500.  She  also  began  going  on  short  walks  around  the  block  and  parked  her  car  in  the  farthest  spot  from  the  grocery  store  door.A  few  months  later,  Spencer  and  her  husband  separated.  But  instead  of  using  food  to  cope  with  the  rush  of  emotions  as  she  once  would  have,  Spencer  turned  to  exercise."I  used  that  as  more  motivation  to  stay  healthy  for  the  boys,"  she  said.  "My  goodness,  if  I'm  going  to  have  to  do  this  on  my  own  and  be  an  example  for  them,  I  have  to  be  strong."Working  out  was  difficult  at  first;  the  pain  in  her  hips  prevented  her  from  moving  very  far,  very  fast.  But  over  time  she  joined  a  walking  club  at  work  and  started  strength  training  one  or  two  days  a  week.She  focused  on  losing  just  5  pounds  at  a  time,  because  the  thought  of  losing  60  pounds  to  reach  a  healthy  BMI  was  intimidating.  Reaching  each  smaller  goal  inspired  her  to  keep  going.By  March  2013,  she  had  lost  64  pounds."When  you're  that  heavy,  you  feel  like  you've  lost  hope,"  Spencer  said.  "When  you  finally  reach  your  goal,  it's  the  most  amazing  thing."Every  Sunday,  the  Spencer  family  goes  on  a  10-mile  bike  ride  near  their  home  in  Aurora,  Colorado.  They  eat  no-sugar  cereal  and  skim  milk  for  breakfast,  Lean  Cuisine  meals  or  veggie  smoothies  for  lunch,  and  lean  protein  with  vegetables  and  brown  rice  for  dinner.  Water  is  Spencer's  "secret  weapon."Her  diet  has  become  a  lifestyle.  She's  careful  about  what  she  eats  but  allows  herself  treats  in  moderation.  Deprivation  is  not  the  way  to  keep  the  weight  off,  she  knows.Spencer's  energy  is  up,  and  her  pain  is  gone.  But  the  happiness  she  feels  can't  compare  to  the  joy  on  her  sons'  faces  when  she  joins  them  on  the  playground."I  am  able  to  take  my  kiddos  to  the  park  and  actually  play  with  them  instead  of  sitting  on  the  sidelines."</TEXT></DOC>

Berk  has  said  that  she  is  "hopeful  that  before  the  case  is  concluded  that  Mr.  Sharper  will  be  exonerated."Leonard  Levine,  another  of  Sharper's  attorneys,  indicated  his  client  would  post  his  residence  and  his  father's  residence  for  the  $1  million  bail.The  five-time  Pro  Bowl  player,  who  became  an  NFL  Network  analyst,  is  charged  with  two  counts  of  rape  by  use  of  drugs,  four  counts  of  furnishing  a  controlled  substance  and  one  count  of  possession  of  a  controlled  substance,  all  felonies,  according  to  Los  Angeles  County  prosecutors.The  alleged  rapes  occurred  in  October  and  last  month,  authorities  said.Sharper  also  is  under  investigation  in  Arizona,  Louisiana  and  Nevada  in  connection  with  a  total  of  five  alleged  rape  cases  in  those  states,  according  to  Los  Angeles  authorities.Los  Angeles  County  Deputy  District  Attorney  Stacy  Okun-Wiese  said  in  court  that  Sharper  is  also  being  investigated  in  sexual  battery  case  in  a  fifth  state,  in  Miami  Beach,  Florida.But  in  court,  a  Sharper  lawyer  disputed  all  the  rape  allegations."It  was  all  consensual  contact  with  women  who  wanted  to  be  in  his  company,"  Levine  said.In  unsuccessfully  seeking  a  $10  million  bail,  the  prosecutor  argued  that  "Sharper  is  a  danger  to  women.""He  hangs  out  with  them  in  clubs.  Takes  them  back.  It's  the  same  story,"  Okun-Wiese  told  the  court.  "He  gives  them  a  shot.  They  black  out."The  next  day  they  have  no  idea  of  what  happened  the  previous  night,"  she  said.In  the  Los  Angeles  cases,  Sharper  is  accused  of  using  morphine  and  zolpidem  --  another  name  for  the  prescription  sleep  aid  Ambien  --  on  his  two  alleged  victims,  who  said  they  blacked  after  Sharper  served  them  a  shot  of  alcohol,  according  to  authorities.Okun-Wiese  said  authorities  took  count  of  Sharper's  Ambien  pills."I  counted  it  up  and  Mr.  Sharper  has  gone  through  70  pills  in  65  days,"  the  prosecutor  said.When  Los  Angeles  County  authorities  filed  the  rape  charges  last  month,  they  weren't  aware  of  the  Nevada  and  Arizona  investigations,  Okun-Wiese  said."The  circumstances  have  changed  tremendously  since  the  January  17  arrest"  of  Sharper  in  California,  Okun-Wiese  said.Defense  attorney  Levine,  however,  said  "there  is  no  probable  cause"  against  Sharper  in  those  other  states'  cases.In  the  latest  accusation,  a  Florida  woman  last  month  filed  a  sexual  battery  complaint  in  Miami  Beach  against  Sharper  relating  to  a  2012  incident,  a  police  report  said.The  alleged  victim  filed  the  complaint  shortly  after  an  acquaintance  told  her  last  month  that  Sharper  was  arrested  in  California  on  rape  charges,  the  Miami  Beach  police  report  says.  The  alleged  Florida  victim  filed  the  report  because  "she  felt  she  needed  to  clear  her  conscious,"  the  report  said.According  to  the  police  report,  in  September  or  October  2012,  the  woman  was  with  two  friends  at  a  Miami  Beach  club  when  she  met  Sharper,  and  when  she,  her  friends,  and  another  person  went  to  Sharper's  condo,  the  woman  was  "extremely  intoxicated."The  woman's  two  friends  later  told  her  she  went  with  Sharper  into  his  bedroom,  and  the  friends  heard  her  telling  Sharper,  "No,  no,  stop.  I  don't  want  to,"  the  report  said.The  two  friends  knocked  on  the  bedroom  door,  entered  the  room  and  tried  to  take  the  woman  home,  but  because  "she  was  so  intoxicated,  she  can't  remember  what  she  said  to  (the  two  friends)  because  her  speech  was  slurred  and  she  wanted  to  sleep,"  the  report  said.Everyone  subsequently  left  Sharper's  Miami  Beach  condo,  except  for  Sharper  and  the  woman,  according  to  the  report.The  woman  awoke  the  following  morning,  the  report  said,  with  Sharper  allegedly  sexually  assaulting  her  without  a  condom.  The  woman  was  treated  by  a  doctor  a  week  after  the  incident,  the  report  said.Miami  Beach  police  are  investigating  the  case,  Miami  Beach  Detective  Vivian  Hernandez  said  Thursday.</TEXT></DOC>

Locals  don't  call  it  Chinese  New  YearIn  China,  the  festivities  are  known  as  spring  festival  (春節)  or  Lunar  New  Year  (農曆新年)  --  the  new  year  is  determined  by  the  lunar  calendar.And  the  Chinese  aren't  the  only  ones  who  observe  it.From  late  January  to  mid-February,  Korea,  Vietnam,  Japan  and  other  countries  celebrate  Lunar  New  Year.MORE:  H7N9  bird  flu  resurges  in  China  ahead  of  Lunar  New  Year2.  Traffic  is  chaosLunar  New  Year  is  basically  like  having  an  entire  country  throw  a  family  reunion  --  all  at  once.Traffic  Armageddon  inevitably  strikes.In  China,  the  Spring  Festival  travel  rush  period  (chunyun)  is  the  country's,  if  not  the  world's,  biggest  season  of  human  migration.Whether  pushing  their  way  into  packed  buses,  buying  black-market  tickets  from  scalpers  or  standing  for  hours  on  a  crowded  train,  travelers  do  whatever  it  takes  to  see  loved  ones.With  commuters  and  migrant  workers  returning  home,  the  government  expects  3.62  billion  journeys  to  take  place  this  year,  according  to  Xinhua  news.In  Korea  last  year,  nearly  30  million  people  visited  their  hometowns  by  car,  bus,  train  or  plane,  according  to  the  Korea  Expressway  Corporation.MORE:  Moving  map  shows  Chinese  New  Year  travel  rush  in  real  time3.  It's  not  just  one  dayLunar  New  Year  lasts  15  days,  starting  from  January  31,  2014.This  year  its  last  day  falls  on  Valentine's  Day.It's  an  action-packed  holiday  --  you  can  bet  on  horse  races,  watch  parades,  bargain  in  bazaars  and  fight  for  prime  worship  spot  at  the  temple.4.  It's  a  season  of  superstitionsDuring  LNY,  you  live  like  a  college  student  on  the  first  day  --  which  means  no  showers,  laundry  or  cleaning.Above  all,  there's  no  taking  out  the  trash  --  doing  so  is  said  to  wash  away  your  luck  and  prosperity.You  hang  out  with  family  (especially  in-laws)  on  the  second  day,  which  is  considered  the  beginning  of  the  year.On  the  third  day,  visiting  friends  and  family  is  frowned  upon,  because  it's  a  day  prone  to  arguments.On  the  seventh  day,  it's  time  to  party  in  celebration  of  everyone's  birthday.MORE:  Understanding  the  Chinese  lion  dance5.  You  can  rent  a  boyfriendLunar  New  Year  can  be  rough  for  singles,  especially  females.Many  family  reunions  are  highlighted  by  dreaded  interrogations  of  singles  who  haven't  settled  down.Now  there's  a  solution  --  boyfriend  rentals.China's  largest  online  retailer,  Taobao,  has  a  section  for  fake  boyfriend  rentals,  so  parents  and  relatives  can  finally  stop  nagging.Renting  a  bogus  marriage  prospect  ranges  from  RMB  500  ($82)  to  8,000  ($1,321)  per  day.The  package  comes  with  "a  free  embrace,  hand  holding  and  a  goodbye  kiss  on  the  cheek,"  as  well  as  a  list  of  additional  specific  service  charges.According  to  People's  Daily,  dinner  costs  RMB  50  ($8)  an  hour  and  a  trip  to  the  movies  is  RMB  30  ($5)  --  double  if  it's  a  thriller.MORE:  'Evil  spirits':  The  truth  about  Chinese  New  Year6.  Odd  linguistic  customs  are  observedIn  Parts  of  China,  there  are  a  few  things  you  can  and  can't  do  over  the  Lunar  New  Year  holiday  --  simply  because  of  how  they  sound.Footwear  purchases  are  off  limits  for  the  entire  lunar  month,  as  the  term  for  shoes  (haai)  sounds  like  losing  and  sighing  in  Cantonese.You  can  however,  turn  the  Chinese  character  for  luck  (fu)  upside  down  to  make  "dao"  (which  sounds  like  arrival)  and  put  it  on  your  door  to  bring  in  good  fortune  for  the  new  year.MORE:  Why  I  dread  Chinese  New  Year7.  Firecrackers  are  for  scaring  away  monstersLegend  says  the  half-dragon,  half-lion  monster  "Nian"  comes  out  of  hiding  and  attacks  people  (especially  children)  during  the  Lunar  New  Year.His  weakness?  Sensitive  ears.In  the  old  days,  people  would  light  bamboo  stalks  on  fire  to  frighten  the  monster.Nowadays,  you  can  watch  spectacular  fireworks  display  along  the  Hong  Kong  waterfront  or  play  with  firecrackers  in  a  Beijing  hutong.8.  Red  undies  are  critical  for  someRed  is  associated  with  luck  and  prosperity,  but  it's  used  mainly  for  protective  purposes.In  addition  to  being  spooked  by  loud  noises,  "Nian"  is  frightened  by  the  color  red,  which  explains  all  the  red  you  see  on  Lunar  New  Year  decorations.For  those  born  in  the  Year  of  the  Horse  --  turning  12,  24,  36,  48,  60,  72,  84  and  96  this  year  --  red  undergarments  are  a  must.Not  because  that  pesky  LNY  monster  has  X-ray  vision,  but  because  red  undies  supposedly  fend  off  misfortune  in  this  unlucky  year.Interestingly,  the  Cantonese  term  for  pants  (fu)  sounds  exactly  like  the  word  for  wealth.MORE:  Praying  for  good  fortune  over  Lunar  New  Year9.

Similar  to  Christmas  movies,  really.Holiday  favorites  include  the  "All's  Well,  Ends  Well"  series  (the  1992  classic  stars  Stephen  Chow  and  Maggie  Cheung),  "Fat  Choi  Spirit"  and  "It's  a  Mad  Mad  World."11.  Customs  are  flexibleCustoms  and  superstitions  aren't  set  in  stone.There's  room  for  flexibility  in  interpretation  and  application.Banning  shoes  for  the  entire  lunar  month?That  depends  on  how  you  read  the  rules  --  the  word  for  shoe  might  sound  like  sighing,  but  it  also  sounds  like  harmony  (hexie).Not  showering  for  the  sake  of  Lunar  New  Year?Many  pass  on  that  for  obvious  hygienic  reasons.In  the  end,  Lunar  New  Year  is  really  about  having  a  great  time  with  family  and  friends,  so  many  opt  not  to  sweat  the  details.MORE:  Ultimate  Hong  Kong  shopping  guide</TEXT></DOC>

Here's  what  one  school  discovered.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  It  was  just  after  lunchtime,  and  17  kindergartners  huddled  around  a  table  marked  with  paint.  Teacher  Lindy  Shoemaker  held  a  vase  covered  in  small  objects:  an  "I  <3  Tennis"  keychain,  a  LEGO  flag  and  other  goodies  the  students  brought  from  home.It  might  seem  like  any  art  class,  but  the  students'  piece  was  inspired  by  the  work  of  folk  artist  Howard  Finster.  The  children  knew  about  his  colorful,  eclectic  art  because  they'd  seen  them  up  close  that  day  at  the  High  Museum  of  Art  in  Atlanta.This,  their  teachers  said,  is  the  kind  of  learning  that  happens  only  when  schools  cut  out  the  classroom  and  take  learning  on  the  road.In  late  February,  students  from  the  independent,  private  Galloway  School  in  Atlanta  spent  the  entire  school  day  inside  the  museum.  It  was  closed  to  the  public  but  wide  open  to  Galloway's  750  students,  ages  3  to  18,  for  a  day  of  "school  without  walls."This  was  no  ordinary  field  trip,  school  leaders  said.  A  museum  visit  typically  means  a  bus  ride,  a  few  hours  for  students  to  observe  the  same  exhibit,  and  a  lot  of  reminders  to  stay  quiet  and  not  touch  anything.On  this  day,  hundreds  of  students,  teachers  and  staff  members  flooded  the  museum,  wearing  white  T-shirts  with  red  logos  that  read  "HIGH  Energy."  Movement  and  noise  filled  the  wings  as  teachers  and  students  explored  lessons  in  art,  music,  history,  geometry,  physics  --  all  of  them  designed  by  teachers  in  collaboration  with  the  museum's  education  department.The  experience  pushed  the  boundaries  of  the  usual  field  trip,  Galloway  Head  of  School  Suzanna  Jemsby  said,  even  in  an  era  when  many  schools  are  cutting  trips  entirely.The  school  was  "rethinking  about  it  as  a  carnival  of  learning,"  Jemsby  said.  "There  will  be  chaos,  and  that  belongs  to  experiential  learning,  and  that  is  what  we're  looking  for.  We're  looking  for  a  hubbub  of  activity  and  student  inquiry."Teaching  from  realityThe  idea  for  the  "school  without  walls"  started  simply,  with  a  meeting  of  the  Galloway  School  leader  and  the  museum  director.  By  allowing  students  to  visit  on  a  Monday,  when  the  museum  is  typically  closed,  they  could  assure  more  freedom  and  security  for  students  while  still  relying  on  the  education  and  catering  staff,  they  decided.Teachers  visited  during  a  professional  development  day  and  worked  with  the  museum's  education  department  to  design  courses  that  paired  existing  exhibits  with  lessons  their  students  would  need  even  in  their  regular  classrooms.The  final  schedule  spanned  87  sessions  for  students  in  pre-K  through  high  school,  far  more  than  could  be  offered  during  a  standard  school  day,  sometimes  allowing  teachers  to  break  out  of  their  typical  subject  matter.At  the  museum,  Galloway  health  and  physical  education  teacher  Denny  Beatty  led  a  session  about  the  civil  rights  movement  called  "Walking  in  Someone  Else's  Shoes."  Bayless  Fleming's  students  searched  for  shapes  in  the  museum  and  wrote  riddles  that  incorporated  math  vocabulary.  Jemsby,  the  school  leader,  explored  the  color  blue  with  young  students.Museum  workers  pitched  in,  too:  Director  Michael  Shapiro  analyzed  work  by  Western  bronze  artist  Frederic  Remington  while  Rhonda  Matheison  explained  the  business  model  for  museums."Teachers  had  to  think  outside  the  box,  teach  from  real  things,  teach  in  different  ways  than  they  have  before,  so  it's  a  big  growth  experience  for  them,"  said  Virginia  Shearer,  director  of  education  at  the  High  Museum.  "The  difference  is  that  students  get  to  see  the  real  thing  up  close  and  personal,  and  they  get  to  connect  all  of  that  background  learning  to  the  real  thing."READ:  Students,  say  goodbye  to  snow  daysIt  didn't  take  long  for  teachers  to  zero  in  on  unique  learning  opportunities  or  for  students  to  break  out  of  a  desk-and-classroom  mindset."They're  much  more  excited  by  the  learning,  so  it'll  stick  with  them  more,"  teacher  Susan  O'Shields  said.The  hardest  part,  some  teachers  said,  was  to  remember  what  to  pack:  Without  their  usual  classroom  supplies  available,  they  had  to  plan  ahead."We  kept  being  like,  'Oh,  we  need  to  get  this.  Oh,  we  need  to  pack  that,'  "  Fleming  said.The  value  of  a  field  tripGas  costs,  budget  cuts  and  jam-packed  school  days  loaded  with  tests  have  all  cut  back  on  field  trips  that  used  to  dot  educational  calendars.  But  if  schools  find  a  willing  partner,  they  could  easily  replicate  the  idea  behind  the  "school  with  no  walls,"  Shearer  said.Some  schools  are  turning  to  technology,  using  Google  Glass  or  Skype  to  take  students  to  faraway  places  they  couldn't  otherwise  go.  But  even  visits  to  local  cultural  institutions  can  hold  tangible  educational  value,  said  Brian  Kisida,  an  education  reform  researcher  at  the  University  of  Arkansas'  College  of  Education  and  Health  Professions.In  a  recent  study  involving  nearly  11,000  students  from  123  schools,  he  found  that  students  who  visited  the  Crystal  Bridges  Museum  of  American  Art  in  Bentonville,  Arkansas,  demonstrated  stronger  critical  thinking  skills,  higher  levels  of  social  tolerance  and  greater  historical  empathy  than  those  who  didn't.  They  also  developed  a  taste  for  art  museums  and  cultural  institutions.He  found  that  benefits  were  even  greater  for  students  who  came  from  high  poverty  or  rural  schools,  minority  students  and  those  who  had  never  before  visited  a  museum.  Those  students  are  especially  reliant  on  their  schools  to  provide  those  experiences,  he  said.Some  have  come  to  see  field  trips  and  time  in  cultural  institutions  as  "unnecessary  thrills,"  Kisida  said,  that  slice  away  at  time  needed  to  maximize  test  scores.  He  says  they're  not."Schools  certainly  have  to  deal  with  tight  budgets,  but  they  also  have  to  prioritize  different  ways  of  spending  their  resources,"  Kisida  said.  "If  school  leaders  are  able  to  see  the  benefits  of  these  types  of  trips,  they  might  be  able  to  prioritize  them."Kisida  hadn't  heard  of  other  schools  hosting  entire  days  of  school  at  museums,  but  some  programs  are  trying  to  emphasize  learning  outside  the  classroom,  like  the  Isabella  Stewart  Gardner  Museum  School  Partnership  Program  in  Boston  and  Embarc  in  Chicago,  he  said."It's  a  great  thing  that  should  be  replicated  and  serve  as  a  model  for  other  institutions  and  schools  looking  to  expand  the  types  of  learning  that  they're  doing  for  their  students,"  he  said.READ:  Would  you  want  Google  Glass  in  your  child's  school?Sherri  Breunig,  a  former  public  school  teacher  who's  now  the  director  of  communications  for  the  Galloway  School,  said  she  can  understand  why  some  schools  would  be  reluctant  to  try  an  entire  school  day  away  from  the  classroom:  Worry  about  "what-ifs"  can  get  in  the  way  of  experiments,  she  said."There's  an  element  of  fear,  whether  it's  an  independent  or  a  public  school,  that  they  have  to  stay  within  the  lines  when  working  with  kids,"  she  said.  "You  don't  have  to  be  bound  by  these  artificial  lines  when  it  comes  to  educating  kids."Nourishing  the  learning  processThroughout  the  day,  the  museum  was  busy  not  with  the  usual  crowds  but  with  fifth-graders  stretching  in  their  movement  class,  sixth-graders  pounding  drums  and  first-graders  painting  polygons  on  T-shirts.Cutting  out  the  classroom  took  some  getting  used  to  for  some  students.First-grader  Jake  Isenberg  commented  that  he  liked  the  size  and  variety  of  shapes  inside  the  museum,  while  his  classmate  Nate  Oertell  said  he  preferred  their  regular  classroom  because  it  "feels  like  more  time  at  school."Sixth-graders  Vivi  Malkonian  and  Lily  Siegel,  who  went  to  sessions  about  African-American  art,  music  and  photography,  agreed  that  the  museum  took  them  outside  their  comfort  zones."At  school,  we've  been  there  forever,  and  we  know  it  like  the  back  of  our  hand,  but  here  you  get  to  explore  and  see  new  things  you've  never  seen  before,"  Malkonian  said."I  got  to  see  a  lot  of  new  students  I  haven't  worked  with  and  their  outlooks  on  the  art,"  Siegel  said.READ:  How  one  teacher  is  innovating  his  classroomSome  high  school  students  enjoyed  the  environment,  but  with  their  minds  already  geared  toward  college,  a  day  in  the  museum  didn't  always  help  much.High  school  freshman  Alexander  Nieves  said  he  saw  some  limitations  to  the  event.  He  and  his  classmates  are  used  to  to  the  speed  of  laptops  and  other  technology  to  move  them  efficiently  through  material,  and  with  some  students  minds'  already  on  college,  they  struggled  to  connect  with  the  offerings.  Personally,  he  enjoyed  the  challenge."In  school,  you're  really  just  sitting  down  in  a  chair  getting  exercises  drilled  into  your  head,  but  this  really  allowed  creative  flow,"  said  Nieves,  15."The  main  idea  of  school  is  to  prepare  someone  for  life,  and  the  best  way  to  do  that  is  to  not  have  the  same  environment.  Experimenting  with  different  environments  gives  students  a  sense  of  a  new  area  and  working  and  learning  in  different  ways.""Variety,"  he  said,  "nourishes  the  learning  process."Has  your  school  cut  back  on  field  trips,  or  found  new  ways  to  give  students  hands-on  experiences?

And  Thursday's  indictment  opened  with  a  primer  on  the  hierarchical  structure  of  the  mob  or  "La  Cosa  Nostra"  and  one  of  its  most  notorious  families,  the  Bonnanos,  with  explanations  of  the  roles  of  its  boss,  "consigliere"  or  underboss,  administrations,  crews,  captains,  soldiers,  associates  and  "goodfellas.""As  alleged,  Vincent  Asaro  devoted  his  adult  life  to  the  Bonanno  crime  family,  with  a  criminal  career  that  spanned  decades,"  Loretta  Lynch,  U.S.  Attorney  for  the  Eastern  District  of  New  York,  said  in  a  statement.  "Far  from  a  code  of  honor,  theirs  was  a  code  of  violence  and  brute  force.  Those  suspected  of  cooperating  with  law  enforcement  paid  with  their  lives."She  added,  "Neither  age  nor  time  dimmed  Asaro's  ruthless  ways,  as  he  continued  to  order  violence  to  carry  out  mob  business  in  recent  months."Also  charged  in  the  indictment  were  fellow  Bonanno  family  members  or  associates:  Asaro's  son,  Jerome,  Jack  Bonventre,  Thomas  "Tommy  D"  Di  Fiore  and  John  "Bazoo"  Ragano.Four  of  the  five  defendants  pleaded  not  guilty  Thursday  before  U.S.  Magistrate  Marilyn  Go,  who  said  that  no  bail  would  be  set  now  because  of  the  violent  nature  of  the  charges.Bonventre,  who  was  not  arraigned  Thursday  because  his  lawyer  was  unavailable,  will  be  arraigned  Friday.  The  defendant  did  not  appear  in  court.Vincent  Asaro's  lawyer,  Gerald  McMahon,  arrived  in  the  crowded  courtroom  with  a  large  plastic  bag  filled  with  prescription  drugs  for  his  client,  who,  he  said,  had  triple  bypass  surgery  in  March.  The  courtroom  was  filled  with  Asaro  family  members  and  federal  agents."Vincent  Asaro  said  that  we  are  going  to  trial  on  this  case  --  there  will  be  no  plea,"  said  McMahon,  who  joked  that  the  indictment  was  giving  Scorsese  the  basis  for  a  sequel  to  "Goodfellas."  "Short  of  a  dismissal,  there  will  be  a  trial.McMahon  said  his  client  has  high  blood  pressure  in  addition  to  the  recent  triple  bypass."We're  gonna  try  to  put  together  a  sufficient  bail  package  so  he  can  get  bail,"  he  said.  "But  he's  not  a  very  wealthy  man,  unfortunately  ...  My  client  isn't  in  the  position  to  put  $10  million  on  the  government's  table,  either  for  bail  or  for  some  sort  of  a  special  deal."Of  his  client's  alleged  involvement  in  the  fabled  heist,  McMahon  said:  "Innocence.  Pure,  actual  innocence.  He  didn't  do  it,  had  nothing  to  do  with  it.  Pretty  much  all  the  people  that  did  it  got  murdered  ...  So,  the  fact  that  my  client  didn't  get  murdered  would  suggest  that  he  didn't  have  anything  to  do  with  it,  so  I'll  start  right  there."Vincent  Asaro  is  the  first  accused  mobster  to  face  charges  in  the  Lufthansa  heist.Ed  McDonald,  a  former  federal  prosecutor  who  investigated  the  Lufthansa  heist,  told  CNN  that  authorities  were  able  to  confirm  at  least  eight  killings  reportedly  connected  to  the  robbery."You  know  at  the  time  it  was  an  extraordinarily  big  deal,"  said  McDonald,  who  played  himself  in  the  film.  "It  was  the  largest  robbery  in  the  history  of  the  United  states.  For  whatever  reason,  the  tabloids  in  New  York  took  a  fancy  to  this  case.  They  were  fascinated  by  it,  and  what  was  happening  was  that  a  lot  of  the  people  who  were  allegedly  involved  in  the  robbery  in  some  form  ...  were  turning  up  dead."The  only  person  convicted  in  connection  with  the  JFK  heist  was  Louis  Werner,  a  Lufthansa  cargo  agent,  McDonald  said.  Werner,  who  was  arrested  a  few  months  after  the  robbery,  was  convicted  of  being  the  "inside  man"  who  provided  information  that  helped  the  robbers  carry  out  the  heist,  McDonald  said.Other  crimes  described  in  the  indictment  also  sound  similar  to  events  portrayed  in  the  film  --  a  1969  murder,  burning  a  New  York  building  and  a  racketeering  operation  that  used  threats  of  violence  to  extort  money  from  victims."These  'goodfellas'  thought  they  had  a  license  to  steal,  a  license  to  kill,  and  a  license  to  do  whatever  they  wanted,"  George  Venizelos,  assistant  director-in-charge  of  the  FBI's  New  York  office.  "However,  today's  arrests  of  the  five  members  of  the  Bonanno  crime  family  brings  an  end  to  their  violent  and  ruthless  ways."CNN's  Haley  Draznin,  Adam  Reiss  andJason  Carroll  contributed  to  this  report</TEXT></DOC>

About  700  of  those  become  daily  smokers.Those  are  two  reasons,  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration  says,  why  it  has  launched  a  national  education  campaign  aimed  at  preventing  those  between  the  ages  of  12  and  17  from  trying  cigarettes  or  --  for  those  already  experimenting  --  from  becoming  regular  smokers."The  Real  Cost"  campaign  seeks  to  educate  these  "at-risk"  teenagers  by  spotlighting  the  health  hazards  of  smoking  in  a  series  of  television,  radio,  print  and  online  ads.  These  ads  show  the  costs  of  smoking,  from  skin  damage  to  gum  disease  and  from  tooth  loss  to  a  loss  of  control  over  their  lives  because  of  from  addiction.About  nine  of  10  regular  smokers  had  their  first  cigarettes  by  the  time  they  were  18,  said  FDA  Commissioner  Dr.  Margaret  Hamburg.Because  teenage  brains  are  still  developing,  they  are  more  susceptible  to  nicotine  addiction,  the  FDA  said."We  know  from  research  that  there  is  a  group  of  of  youth  --  12  to  17  --  who  are  more  vulnerable,  partly  because  of  the  nature  of  their  lives  --  you  know,  chaotic  lives,  lots  of  stress,  lack  of  control,"  Hamburg  said.Some  live  with  smokers,  "which  dramatically  increases  the  risk,  and  so  we're  hoping  that  we  can  potentially  interrupt  a  deadly  cycle,"  she  said."We  can  help  these  teens  understand  the  real  consequences  of  smoking,  the  real  costs  of  smoking  to  them,  so  that  they  won't  take  up  smoking  if  they're  on  the  cusp  and  will  stop  smoking  if  they've  already  started."E-cigarettes:  Healthy  tool  or  gateway  device?Smoking  as  an  adolescent  can  stunt  growth,  stain  teeth  and  cause  premature  wrinkles,  health  officials  say,  and  smokeless  tobacco  can  cause  mouth,  esophagus  and  pancreas  cancers.  Studies  have  estimated  that  every  cigarette  smoked  shaves  11  minutes  off  your  life.In  2009,  the  Tobacco  Control  Act  became  law,  giving  the  FDA  the  authority  to  regulate  tobacco  products  to  protect  public  health,  including  manufacturing,  distribution  and  marketing.The  law  looks  to  prevent  and  reduce  smoking  by  kids  under  18,  the  legal  age  to  buy  tobacco  products.  These  new  ads  are  the  first  of  several  planned  education  campaigns,  but  it's  not  the  only  effort.The  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  is  continuing  its  "Tips  From  Former  Smokers"  campaign  with  a  new  set  of  anti-smoking  ads.One  of  the  more  striking  ads  features  Terrie  Hall,  who  had  her  larynx  (commonly  called  the  voice  box)  removed  as  a  result  of  the  ravages  of  oral  and  throat  cancers.  Hall,  who  had  started  smoking  as  a  teen,  died  in  September  at  53  from  complications  of  smoking.Doctors  support  raising  the  smoking  ageRJ  Reynolds,  the  second-largest  tobacco  company  in  the  U.S.,  runs  a  youth  tobacco  prevention  program  called  Right  Decisions  Right  Now:  Be  Tobacco  Free.Company  spokeswoman  Jane  Seccombe  said  she  could  not  comment  on  on  the  FDA's  new  campaign  until  she  saw  the  ads.  But  she  says  Right  Decisions  Right  Now  has  been  up  and  running  for  more  than  20  years  and  is  used  by  more  than  20,000  middle  schools  and  community  groups  like  the  Boy  Scouts  of  America  and  Big  Brothers  Big  Sisters."RDRN  is  part  of  our  company's  long-term  initiative  to  transform  the  tobacco  industry,"  said  Laura  Leigh  Oyler,  a  public  policy  director  at  the  company.  "Over  the  past  20  years,  youth  tobacco  prevention  efforts  and  programs  have  had  a  big  impact  on  reducing  teen  smoking,  now  at  a  historic  low,  and  we  are  actively  working  on  ways  to  accelerate  the  decline  in  youth  tobacco  use."But  "the  tobacco  industry  has  very  aggressively  been  advertising  for  years,  for  decades,  including  to  youth,"  Hamburg  said.  "We  think  we  can  make  a  difference,  because  we  have  targeted  messages  that  will  resonate."The  initial  response  from  teens  who  participated  in  focus  groups  to  evaluate  the  ads  for  effectiveness,  she  says,  has  been  positive.  The  agency  plans  to  conduct  a  study  following  8,000  kids  between  the  ages  of  11  and  16  and  will  do  face-to-face  interviews  gathering  data  on  adolescents'  awareness,  attitudes  and  beliefs  about  smoking  tobacco.Will  your  children  buy  candy,  gum  or  little  cigars?Over  the  next  two  years,  the  FDA  will  launch  additional  campaigns  targeting  specific  groups  including  multicultural,  rural  and  LGBT  (lesbian,  gay,  bisexual  and  transgender)  youths.  Its  goal  is  to  reduce  the  number  of  teenage  cigarette  smokers  by  300,000  over  the  next  three  years."We  will  make  an  important  contribution  to  reducing  the  toll  of  preventable  death,  disease  and  disability  from  cigarettes  and  tobacco  use.  It  is  astounding  how  the  burden  of  tobacco  continues  to  take  a  toll  on  the  American  people."  Hamburg  said."Every  year,  some  480,000  people  die  an  early,  premature  death  because  of  tobacco  use.  It  costs  the  health  care  system  over  $289  billion  and  also  lost  productivity  costs,  according  to  a  recent  estimate.  And  our  youth  are  at  risk.  ...  So  if  we  can  reach  them  and  stop  them,  we  can  prevent  a  life-long  addiction  and  all  of  the  concomitant  disability  and  disease  and  early  death."</TEXT></DOC>

Parents  were  questioning  it  Wednesday  when  New  York  schools  canceled  all  field  trips,  but  didn't  cancel  classes,  even  as  New  York  Gov.  Andrew  Cuomo  declared  a  weather  emergency."Parents,  as  always,  should  exercise  their  own  judgment  with  regard  to  their  children,"  a  statement  from  the  New  York  City  Department  of  Education  read.  "Safety  is  a  top  priority."  School  officials  did  not  respond  to  a  phone  call  and  e-mail  seeking  comment.Closing  school  is  a  tough  call,  school  superintendents  from  around  the  country  said.  The  decision  often  requires  hours  of  preparation  and  discussion  among  administrators,  local  officials,  road  crews  and  meteorologists.  Most  school  leaders  said  they  take  a  better-safe-than-sorry  approach,  but  it  can  be  hard  to  do  as  the  number  of  days  off  climbs."We  lose  a  lot  of  sleep  over  it,"  said  Gregory  Hutchings,  superintendent  of  Shaker  Heights  schools  in  Ohio.So  why  wouldn't  schools  call  off  classes  when  weather  seems  like  it  could  be  dangerous?  Here  are  a  few  reasons.1.  Forecasts  can  be  wrongWith  every  winter  storm  threat,  superintendents  wake  in  the  wee  hours  to  consider  the  latest  weather  maps  or  drive  their  local  roads.  On  Wednesday,  Stratford,  Connecticut,  schools  superintendent  Janet  Robinson  was  on  a  forecasting  conference  call  at  4:15  a.m.  Within  30  minutes,  and  with  the  help  of  the  schools'  facilities  manager,  she  decided  to  cancel  classes  for  the  sixth  time  this  year.But  the  choice  isn't  always  that  easy.  After  all,  weather  forecasts  aren't  guarantees."There's  no  snow  yet  at  4  o'clock,  it's  forecast  to  come  in  and  you  decide  to  cancel  --  and  then  it  doesn't  come,"  Robinson  said.  "We  joke  that  no  matter  what  we  say,  someone  is  going  to  disagree  with  it."Of  course,  there  are  worse  ways  to  be  wrong,  she  said:  Watching  a  snowstorm  roll  in  once  you've  brought  children  to  school,  calling  buses  back  while  kids  shiver  at  their  bus  stops  or  sending  young  drivers  out  on  dangerously  slick  roads.2.  Parents  hate  snow  days,  tooWhen  the  windchill  hit  -35  degrees  earlier  this  month,  the  decision  was  easy  for  Hutchings,  the  Ohio  superintendent:  School  was  canceled.To  his  surprise,  "I  still  received  phone  calls  and  e-mails  from  parents,"  he  said.  "It's  a  no-win  situation."As  a  father  of  a  3-year-old  and  an  8-year-old,  he  can  commiserate.  He  understands  parents'  concerns  about  child  care  and  time  off  from  work.  Parents  really  hate  it  when  he  spoils  vacation  by  adding  makeup  days  to  the  end  of  the  school  year,  he  said.But  his  decisions  are  based  on  what's  safest  for  all  students  and  staff  members,  he  said.Last  week,  many  schools  around  Atlanta  remained  open  for  a  few  hours  on  Tuesday,  before  snow  began  to  fall.  When  they  released  early,  some  students  ended  up  stuck  on  icy,  gridlocked  roads  or  stranded  at  school  overnight.Clayton  County  schools  --  a  district  just  outside  Atlanta  with  about  52,000  students  and  6,200  faculty  and  staff  --  closed  before  the  snow  arrived,  and  initially  heard  some  negative  responses  from  parents,  said  Vicki  Gavalas,  the  district's  director  of  communications.Within  a  few  hours,  the  tone  changed.So  far,  the  superintendent's  office  has  received  more  than  100  thank-you  messages  from  parents  and  community  members,  she  said,  and  a  batch  of  handwritten  letters  from  kindergartners,  who  wrote,  "You  made  the  right  decision,"  and  "Thank  you  for  keeping  my  family  safe.""The  e-mails  we  got  in  support  were  so  gratifying  and  affirming,"  Gavalas  said.  "Sometimes,  people  are  very  quick  to  criticize  and  not  as  quick  to  praise."3.  Closures  can  be  costlyWild  weather  almost  always  means  extra  costs  for  schools,  from  storm  cleanup  to  snow  removal  to  staff  overtime.  But  school  closures  can  hurt  the  budget  in  deeper  ways,  especially  if  the  days  off  begin  to  pile  up."We  do  have  an  obligation  to  the  taxpayer  that  we  are  good  stewards,  financially,"  Clayton  County's  Gavalas  said.Day-to-day  school  attendance  won't  typically  affect  a  school's  finances,  said  Dick  Flanary,  deputy  executive  director  for  programs  and  services  for  the  National  Association  of  Secondary  School  Principals.  But  it  can  lead  to  cuts  if  test  scores  sink,  if  students  or  teachers'  miss  a  chance  to  shine  or  if  schools  can't  fulfill  a  grant  obligation  based  on  instructional  time."There's  a  very  competitive  environment  for  grant  money,  foundation  money,  because  of  this  economy,"  Flanary  said.  "It  could  jeopardize  a  potential  funding  source."4.  Students  could  go  hungryOr  be  left  alone.  Or  get  into  trouble.  Educators  know  that  school  might  be  the  only  place  where  some  students  eat  a  healthy  meal  or  experience  a  safe,  supervised,  warm  environment."You  think  about  those  kids,  that  this  is  the  only  wholesome  meal  those  children  get  during  the  day,"  said  Flanary,  who  was  a  middle  school  principal  in  Virginia  for  12  years.  "When  they  miss  that,  what's  the  result?"But  if  the  roads  aren't  safe,  the  power  is  out  or  a  natural  disaster  has  damaged  the  building,  educators  say,  school  isn't  a  safe  place  to  be,  either.5.  Closing  school  means  less  time  to  learnIt's  simple,  educators  said:  If  students  are  snowed  out  of  school,  they  won't  learn  as  much.  Educators  said  it's  especially  tough  on  students  gearing  up  for  standardized  tests  or  Advanced  Placement  exams,  and  for  new  teachers  who  haven't  mastered  the  art  of  the  strong  comeback."What  concerns  us  most  is  the  lack  of  continuity  in  the  kids'  education,"  said  Robinson,  the  Stratford,  Connecticut,  superintendent.  "There's  something  about  the  energy  of  being  in  school  every  day  that  you  miss."A  snow  day  here  or  there  won't  hurt  student  learning,  said  Joshua  Goodman,  an  assistant  professor  of  public  policy  at  Harvard's  Kennedy  School  of  Government.  He  recently  studied  eight  years  of  school  closures  in  Massachusetts,  and  found  that  snow  days  caused  no  harm.  Most  teachers  there  understood  how  to  adjust  their  lesson  plans,  and  prioritize  must-learn  material,  he  said.What  did  affect  academic  achievement,  he  found,  were  lousy  weather  days  when  schools  remained  open.  On  those  days,  higher  numbers  of  students  missed  class,  perhaps  because  of  parental  discretion  or  transportation  issues,  and  entire  classes  suffered  as  teachers  moved  some  students  on  and  caught  other  students  up.But  in  Massachusetts,  where  snow  days  are  no  surprise,  it  was  rare  for  schools  to  close  for  several  days  at  a  time,  Goodman  said.  The  results  might  be  different  in  states  that  rarely  encounter  extreme  weather,  or  for  schools  that  face  a  major,  one-time  disruption."The  fact  that  snow  days  are  not  harmful  is  because  schools  and  teachers  know  how  to  deal  with  them,"  Goodman  said.  "What  just  happened  in  Atlanta  could  be  a  different  story."Not  all  learning  is  lost  when  school  is  out,  though.  Educators  around  the  country  said  they're  urging  students  to  check  out  Khan  Academy  and  other  online  learning  tools.  Some  said  teachers  now  assign  homework  in  advance  so  students  can  stay  on  task.Hutchings,  the  Shaker  Heights,  Ohio,  superintendent,  said  they  assign  "blizzard  bags"  of  schoolwork  for  students  to  dip  into  whenever  they're  out  of  class,  and  they're  considering  online  programs  that  would  allow  students  to  interact  with  teachers  from  home  --  at  least,  between  snowball  fights  and  trips  down  the  sledding  hill."The  first  couple  (snow  days)  are  OK,"  Hutchings  said.  "When  you  get  into  five,  six,  enough  is  enough.  I  have  a  plea  with  Mother  Nature  to  ease  up  a  little  bit."How  does  your  family  and  school  handle  closings  due  to  weather?

Less  than  4  months  old,  Yik  Yak  has  "a  couple  hundred  thousand  users,  mainly  in  Southeast/East  coast  campuses,"  its  co-founder  Brooks  Buffington  said.Users  are  limited  to  200  characters,  and  no  pictures  are  allowed.  If  a  post  is  "down  voted"  enough  times  by  other  users  on  the  forum,  the  comment  disappears.  Tech  experts  are  comparing  the  new  Atlanta-based  app  to  a  cross  between  SnapChat  and  Twitter."The  app  was  made  for  college-age  users  or  above,  for  college  campuses  and  to  act  as  a  virtual  bulletin  board,  so  it  acts  as  local  Twitter  for  their  campus,"  Buffington  told  CNN.Although  the  app  is  meant  for  users  age  17  and  older,  younger  users  can  still  sign  up,  and  that's  where  the  issues  have  sprouted.School  administrators  in  Chicago  said  teens  in  some  of  their  schools  have  used  the  free  app  for  cyberbullying.  Others  have  made  anonymous  bomb  threats  that  have  led  to  school  lockdowns."Students  were  actually  coming  downstairs  to  talk  to  administration,  and  they  were  mentioning  remarks  posted  and  student  names  that  were  obvious,  so  of  course  that  is  going  to  impact  you,"  Melvin  Soto,  assistant  vice  principal  at  Whitney  Young  High  School,  told  CNN  affiliate  WLS.Some  students  have  compared  it  to  a  virtual  bathroom  wall  where  users  post  vitriol  and  hate."They  ripped  on  someone  for  getting  raped,  and  that's  just  so  wrong.  They  said  a  whole  lot  of  bad  things  about  this  girl,"  Whitney  Young  student  Rachel  Brown  told  WLS.In  southern  California,  a  San  Clemente  High  School  resource  officer  told  CNN  a  threatening  Yik  Yak  post  caused  a  bomb  scare  on  campus."The  school  was  placed  on  lockdown,  we  conducted  a  sweep  utilizing  our  bomb  squad  and  bomb-sniffing  dogs  and  nothing  suspicious  was  located  on  or  near  the  campus,"  Orange  County  Sheriff's  spokesman  Jeff  Hallock  told  CNN.He  added  that  the  app  is  so  new  that  some  students  hadn't  even  heard  about  it  yet.In  Georgia,  the  principal  of  Webb  Bridge  Middle  School  in  Fulton  County  wrote  a  cautionary  letter  to  parents  warning  them  about  the  "inflammatory  [Yik  Yak]  app,"  encouraging  them  to  talk  to  their  children  about  the  "dangers  of  social  media."  The  school  district  has  blocked  the  app  from  its  network,  but  Principal  Susan  Opferman  writes,  students  have  found  ways  around  that  too."If  used  inappropriately,  Yik  Yak  posts  can  be  especially  vicious  and  hurtful,  since  there  is  no  way  to  trace  their  source,  and  can  be  disseminated  widely,"  Opferman  said  in  the  letter.These  types  of  incidents  have  caused  the  app's  developers  to  disable  it  in  some  areas.  Buffington  told  CNN  he  doesn't  want  high  school  students  using  the  app."One  of  the  things  we  were  planning  to  do  is  to  essentially  geo-sense  every  high  school  and  middle  school  in  America,  so  if  they  try  to  open  the  app  in  their  school,  it  will  say  something  like  'no,  no  no,  looks  like  you  are  trying  to  open  the  app  on  a  high  school  or  middle  school  and  this  is  only  for  college  kids,'  and  it  will  disable  it  and  the  app  won't  work,"  Buffington  told  CNN."That  will  completely  eliminate  the  problem  we  have  been  seeing,  so  we  geo-sensed  the  entire  city  of  Chicago  until  we  get  this  fix  up.  We  are  working  on  getting  third-party  help  to  get  the  fix  in  place  as  soon  as  possible."But  cyberbullying  expert  Justin  W.  Patchin  says  that's  just  a  short-term  solution.  He  says  teens  will  figure  out  a  way  around  it."It  is  pretty  impossible  to  limit  it  to  the  ages  that  the  founders  have  intended,"  said  Patchin,  who  is  the  co-director  at  the  Cyberbullying  Research  Center  at  the  University  of  Wisconsin-Eau  Claire.  "When  I  signed  up  for  the  app,  it  said  that  you  have  to  be  17  or  above  to  sign  in,  and  of  course,  there  wasn't  any  way  of  them  checking  my  age  so  anybody  could  sign  up."The  app's  developers  defended  their  technology,  saying  it  is  used  for  good."With  anonymity  comes  a  lot  of  responsibility,  and  college  kids  have  the  maturity  that  it  takes  to  handle  those  responsibilities,"  Buffington  said.  "One  of  my  favorite  use  case  stories  is  a  freshman  missed  his  flight  for  Christmas  break,  and  he  came  back  to  campus  and  he  posted  on  Yik  Yak  that  the  freshman  dorms  were  closed,  and  so  an  upperclassman  let  him  crash  on  his  couch,"  Buffington  said."Anonymity  can  be  a  really  beautiful  thing,  and  one  of  the  reasons  we  made  it  anonymous  is  it  gives  people  a  blank  slate  to  work  from,  so  you're  not  judged  on  your  race  or  sexuality  or  gender.  On  Yik  Yak  you  are  purely  judged  on  content  you  create."  Buffington  said.He  added,  "The  longer  that  we  are  around  on  college  campuses,  the  better  it  gets."As  more  applications  pop  up  and  the  environments  of  social  networking  sites  change,  Patchin  says  the  emphasis  should  be  on  teaching  younger  generations  about  respect  in  online  communities."It  is  more  important  to  talk  to  the  students  about  how  to  treat  each  other  respectfully.  Whether  it  is  happening  in  an  application  like  this  or  Facebook  or  on  e-mail,  the  emphasis  for  us  has  always  been  on  those  behaviors  because  it  is  easier  to  teach  that  than  to  restrict  that  to  particular  technology."CNN's  Devon  Sayers  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Meanwhile,  Frozen's  worldwide  total  has  reached  $639.9  million.Much  like  the  first  snow,  the  first  shameless  sequel  of  the  year  is  a  milestone  that  came  early  in  2014.  But  Paranormal  Activity:  The  Marked  Ones,  the  Latino-marketed  spin-off  and  fifth  film  in  the  popular  horror  franchise,  couldn't  quite  possess  the  top  spot  with  its  shaky-cam  scares.  The  movie  took  in  $18.2  million  in  its  opening  weekend,  which  is  a  whopping  38  percent  less  than  its  predecessor  Paranormal  Activity  4  made  in  its  first  few  days  out  and  the  lowest  ever  debut  for  a  Paranormal  Activity  film  in  wide  release.  For  the  last  half-decade,  Paramount  has  been  wringing  this  series  for  all  its  worth—Paranormal  Activity  5  hits  theaters  this  October—and  the  returns  appear  to  be  diminishing.  Moviegoers  also  seem  to  be  growing  a  bit  tired  of  the  movies'  limited  bag  of  tricks:  Despite  receiving  generally  better  reviews  than  PA4,  The  Marked  Ones  rated  a  step  down  with  Cinemascore,  from  C  to  C-.  Still,  this  is  a  cheap  goose  and  even  if  it  switches  from  laying  golden  eggs  to  silver  ones,  it's  fine  for  the  studio.After  three  weeks  at  No.  1,  The  Hobbit:  The  Desolation  of  Smaug  tumbles  like  a  dwarf  in  a  barrel  to  third  place  with  $16.3  million.  So  far,  the  second  episode  of  Peter  Jackson's  trilogy  isn't  reaping  quite  as  big  a  pile  of  gold  as  the  first:  Smaug  comes  out  of  its  fourth  weekend  with  a  healthy  $229.6  million,  but  that's  still  $34.2  million  less  than  An  Unexpected  Journey  had  at  this  same  point  last  year.  The  first  Hobbit  took  in  a  grand  total  of  $303  million  domestically,  which  means  the  second  one  most  likely  won't  make  it  past  that  three-double-zero  mark.  If  that  ends  up  being  the  case,  it  would  be  the  first  of  Peter  Jackson's  Middle  Earth  films  not  to  do  so.Martin  Scorsese's  The  Wolf  of  Wall  Street  takes  a  decent  bite  out  of  the  box  office  with  $13.4  million,  bringing  the  total  for  Martin  Scorsese's  coke-fueled  tale  of  stock-pushing  sybarites  to  $63.3  million.  There's  a  very  good  chance  Marty's  latest  will  surpass  Hugo's  disappointing  total  domestic  take  of  $73.9  million,  showing  Americans  prefer  their  Scorsese  to  be  decidedly  un-family  friendly.  Meanwhile,  David  O.  Russell's  American  Hustle,  which  features  more  than  a  wink  to  Marty's  signature  aesthetic,  is  nipping  at  The  Wolf's  back  paws.  It  rounds  out  the  list  with  $13.2  million,  as  Sony's  critically  acclaimed  ensemble  dissembles  its  way  to  $88.7  million.1.  Frozen  -  $20.7  million2.

At  least  three  of  the  victims  were  children."In  Guinea,  a  country  with  a  weak  medical  infrastructure,  an  outbreak  like  this  can  be  devastating,"  the  UNICEF  representative  in  Guinea,  Dr.  Mohamed  Ag  Ayoya,  said  in  the  statement.UNICEF  has  prepositioned  supplies  and  stepped  up  communication  on  the  ground  to  sensitize  medical  staff  and  local  populations  on  how  to  avoid  contracting  the  illness,  Agoya  added.Isolation  unitsThe  Guinean  Health  Ministry  warned  that  the  disease  is  mainly  spread  from  infected  people,  from  objects  belonging  to  ill  or  dead  people,  and  by  the  consumption  of  meat  from  animals  in  the  bush.So  far,  most  of  the  cases  have  been  in  the  forest  area  of  southern  Guinea,  and  health  officials  say  they  are  offering  free  treatment  for  all  patients.They've  urged  people  to  stay  calm,  wash  their  hands  and  report  all  cases  to  authorities.The  international  medical  charity  Medecins  Sans  Frontieres  announced  on  Saturday  it  was  reinforcing  its  medical  and  logistics  teams  in  Guinea  in  response  to  the  epidemic.It  is  also  flying  in  33  tons  of  medicines  and  equipment  and  setting  up  isolation  units  in  the  three  affected  areas  in  the  country."Isolation  units  are  essential  to  prevent  the  spread  of  the  disease,  which  is  highly  contagious,"  Dr.  Esther  Sterk,  MSF  tropical  medicine  adviser,  said  in  a  written  statement.

It  was  painful  and  swollen  but  I  figured  it  would  be  okay  without  any  medical  intervention.  Maybe  a  little  bit  of  denial?"  O'Brien  wrote.His  arm  seemed  sore  and  swollen  the  next  day,  but  didn't  appear  worse.  That  night,  though,  he  experienced  greater  pain  and  swelling,  and  the  next  day  asked  the  hotel  where  he  was  to  refer  him  to  a  doctor.The  doctor  told  O'Brien  he  may  be  experiencing  acute  compartment  syndrome.  This  condition  involves  increased  pressure  in  a  muscle  compartment,  according  to  the  National  Institutes  of  Health.Muscles  in  the  arms  and  legs  are  separated  from  each  other  by  thick  layers  of  tissue  called  fascia,  and  each  fascia  has  space  in  it,  called  a  compartment,  with  muscle  tissue,  nerves  and  blood  vessels.When  there  is  swelling  in  a  compartment,  pressure  in  that  area  will  increase  and  press  on  the  muscles,  blood  vessels  and  nerves."If  this  pressure  is  high  enough,  blood  flow  to  the  compartment  will  be  blocked,"  according  to  the  NIH's  MedlinePlus  resource.  "This  can  lead  to  permanent  injury  to  the  muscle  and  nerves.  If  the  pressure  lasts  long  enough,  the  muscles  may  die  and  the  arm  or  leg  will  not  work  any  more.  It  may  need  to  be  amputated."Symptoms  of  severe  cases  of  compartment  syndrome  include  skin  paleness,  numbness,  tingling,  decreased  sensation,  weakness  and  severe  worsening  pain.  Early  diagnosis  and  treatment  are  key  for  a  good  recovery.Patients  need  immediate  surgery,  which  involves  making  long  cuts  through  the  muscle  tissue  to  relieve  pressure.  O'Brien's  doctor  recommended  this  procedure,  also  known  as  a  fasciotomy.After  entering  surgery,  O'Brien  woke  up  to  learn  that  his  blood  pressure  had  dropped  during  the  procedure.  To  save  him,  the  doctor  had  made  the  decision  to  amputate  just  above  the  elbow."He  later  told  me  it  all  boiled  down  to  a  choice...between  a  life  and  a  limb,"  O'Brien  wrote.Since  then,  O'Brien  has  dealt  with  "phantom  pain,  the  vicissitudes  of  daily  life  with  one  hand  and  the  worries  about  what  lies  ahead,"  he  wrote.But  he  says  he  is  grateful  to  be  alive  and  urged  readers  not  to  worry.O'Brien,  who  covered  the  U.S.  space  program  for  CNN,  currently  lives  in  Washington  and  focuses  on  science,  technology  and  aerospace  in  his  journalistic  work,  which  includes  being  the  science  correspondent  for  PBS  NewsHour.  His  website  says  he  frequently  pilots  his  own  airplane  to  assignments.He  ended  his  blog  post  poignantly:  "Life  is  all  about  playing  the  hand  that  is  dealt  you.  Actually,  I  would  love  somebody  to  deal  me  another  hand  right  about  now  --  in  more  ways  than  one."Artificial  hand  lets  amputee  feel  objects</TEXT></DOC>

One  of  Washington's  most  popular  sites,  the  monument  was  closed  on  August  23,  2011,  after  a  5.8  magnitude  earthquake  caused  more  than  150  cracks  in  the  structure.The  $15  million  restoration  project  took  nearly  three  years  to  complete.  The  National  Park  Service  and  the  Trust  for  the  National  Mall  are  planning  to  host  a  reopening  ceremony  at  10  a.m.  ET  On  May  12.Public  tours  will  begin  that  day  at  1  p.m.,  and  tickets  will  be  made  available  on  a  first-come,  first-served  basis  that  morning  at  the  Washington  Monument  Lodge.Photos:  Cherry  blossom  time  in  DCStarting  April  16,  tickets  for  tours  on  future  dates  will  be  available  at  the  park  service's  reservation  page,  www.recreation.gov.  The  park  service  will  offer  extended  operating  hours,  9  a.m.-10  p.m.,  through  the  end  of  summer."We  are  delighted  to  be  in  the  homestretch  with  the  repairs  to  the  Washington  Monument  almost  complete,  and  we  look  forward  to  the  re-opening  on  May  12  so  we  can  once  again  welcome  visitors  to  this  iconic  monument  to  our  nation's  first  President,"  said  National  Park  Service  Director  Jonathan  B.

Tom  Lorenz  of  the  Glendale  Police  Department.The  spelling  of  that  name  in  the  police  records  is  different  from  a  Nerses  Kilajyan  that  a  Middle  East  news  research  group  found  on  his  Facebook  page,  but  phonetically,  it  is  similar.The  other  man  in  the  video  is  Sarou  Madarian,  who  was  deported  to  Syria  in  2010,  Lorenz  said  Thursday.In  the  video,  Madarian  identifies  himself  only  as  "Creeper"  of  the  Sun  Valley  GW-13  gang  and  leaves  the  false  impression  that  he's  a  Latino  gang  member  because  he  sprinkles  Spanish  words  in  his  fluent  English.Lorenz  said  Madarian  is  a  member  of  the  Grumpy  Winos  gang  from  Sun  Valley.Their  YouTube  video  showed  them  firing  rifles  in  Syria's  civil  war,  apparently  fighting  on  behalf  of  President  Bashar  al-Assad's  regime.  Some  Armenians  side  with  al-Assad  because  he  has  protected  the  minority  group  in  Syria.Never  do  the  two  men  face  return  fire  in  the  video,  however.In  the  profanity-laced  video,  the  two  men  fire  rifles  from  behind  a  cinder-block  wall  at  "enemigos"  --  enemies  --  though  the  camera  never  shows  an  enemy  in  the  distance.The  two  men  often  refer  to  "gang-banging"  and  their  "homies,"  and  Madarian  displays  gang  hand  gestures  and  tattoos.The  video  was  publicized  this  week  by  the  Middle  East  Media  Research  Institute,  a  Washington-based  organization  that  studies  and  translates  news  accounts  and  social-media  postings."This  is  very  unique  because  these  guys  are  over  there,  and  they  are  with  the  pro-Syria  forces  and  pro-Hezbollah  forces,"  said  Steven  Stalinsky,  executive  director  of  the  institute.  "We  have  been  monitoring  foreign  fighters  over  the  years,  and  there  has  been  a  handful  of  Americans  going  to  fight,  but  they  have  been  going  to  fight  against  Assad."The  FBI's  Joint  Terrorism  Task  Forces  is  investigating  the  video."The  JTTF  is  aware  of  the  video  and  is  investigating  to  determine  any  potential  threat  to  Americans  or  to  U.S.  interests,"  FBI  spokeswoman  Ari  Dekofsky  said  in  a  statement.  "We  are  not  in  a  position  to  provide  further  comment  at  this  time."In  the  video,  Kilajian  identifies  himself  in  the  video  as  "Wino"  from  the  Westside  Armenian  Power  gang.  Wino  uploaded  the  video  and  photographs  to  his  Facebook  page,  where  he  is  identified  as  "Wino  Ayee  Peeyakan"  and  by  his  real  name,  Nerses  Kilajyan,  according  to  MEMRI.

Cupp  says  Scott  Walker  gets  it  --  Republicans  can't  win  just  by  opposing  Democrats,  they  need  a  plan  of  their  own</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  S.E.  Cupp  is  co-host  of  the  new  "Crossfire,"  which  airs  at  6:30  p.m.  ET  weekdays  on  CNN.  She  is  also  the  author  of  "Losing  Our  Religion:  The  Liberal  Media's  Attack  on  Christianity,"  co-author  of  "Why  You're  Wrong  About  the  Right,"  a  columnist  at  the  New  York  Daily  News  and  a  political  commentator  for  Glenn  Beck's  "The  Blaze."(CNN)  --  "The  reason  why  Republicans  I  think  sometimes  get  in  trouble  is  ...  they  talk  about  cutting  things.  Too  many  people  in  our  party  talk  about  austerity  and  not  about  reform.  There's  a  difference."That  was  what  Wisconsin's  Republican  Gov.  Scott  Walker  told  me  this  past  weekend  when  I  sat  down  with  him  at  a  Washington  hotel  restaurant  to  discuss  a  broad  range  of  topics,  including  the  path  forward  for  the  GOP.  Whether  talking  about  entitlement  reform,  food  stamps,  unemployment  benefits  or  social  programs,  his  one  word  mantra?  Emphasize  "reform.""The  mistake  I  think  we  often  make  is,"  he  continued,  "if  we're  the  party  of  no,  and  we're  the  party  of  austerity,  the  people  of  this  country  want  more.  The  difference  is,  the  left  offers  them  more  government,  more  benefits,  more  assistance.  We  should  offer  them  more  freedom,  more  opportunity,  more  prosperity."Over  the  course  of  our  interview,  the  word  "reform"  came  up  dozens  of  times  --  in  his  assessment  of  Mitt  Romney,  his  support  for  Chris  Christie,  his  praise  for  Paul  Ryan  and  his  advice  to  Republican  2016  contenders.  In  fact,  the  advice  was  free-flowing  all  around.  And  why  not?Walker's  frequently  discussed  in  conservative  circles  as  a  2016  contender  himself,  and  after  winning  a  bruising  collective  bargaining  dispute  and  surviving  a  vicious  recall  effort  in  2012,  he's  earned  a  reputation  as  a  fighter  --  and  the  political  capital  that  comes  along  with  it.According  to  the  most  recent  polling,  51%  approve  of  his  job  as  governor,  in  a  blue  state  that  hasn't  voted  for  a  Republican  presidential  candidate  since  1984."We  are,  like  most  Midwestern  battleground  states,  very  evenly  divided  among  parties.  I  won  with  7.5%  of  the  vote  in  the  recall  election.  A  few  months  later,  Barack  Obama  carried  the  state  by  about  the  same  margin,  about  7  points."What  he  calls  the  "Walker/Obama"  voter  might  sound  like  a  creature  out  of  political  mythology,  but  he  believes  it's  the  key  to  a  Republican  winning  in  2016."What  we  found  is,  to  win  the  center,  which  is  the  key  to  winning  states  like  Wisconsin,  you  don't  have  to  move  to  the  center.  That's  the  misnomer  [in  Washington]  that  suddenly  you've  got  to  change  your  core  principles  and  move  more  to  the  center.  It's  just  the  opposite  with  voters  who  are  independents  or  swing  voters  or  undecided,  persuadable  voters."They  want  leadership.  We've  shown  that  the  same  people  who  voted  for  me,  there's  a  significant  number  of  those  middle-of-the-road  voters  who  then  turned  around  and  voted  for  Obama."  (President  Obama  is  visiting  Wisconsin  on  Thursday  as  part  of  his  post-State  of  the  Union  tour.)And  even  though  he  disagrees  with  almost  all  of  Obama's  policies,  he  believes  Republicans  could  stand  to  take  a  page  from  his  book."The  one  thing  I'll  give  him  his  due  on,  he's  a  committed  liberal.  He's  leading,  he's  got  big,  bold  ideas,  Obamacare  being  a  prime  example.  I  think  that's  bad  policy,  but  at  least  I  won't  fault  him  for  leading."After  inheriting  a  $3.6  billion  budget  deficit  in  2011,  Walker  now  sits  comfortably  on  a  gross  general  fund  balance  of  more  than  $1  billion,  with  $279  million  in  a  rainy  day  fund.  He's  helped  lower  the  unemployment  rate  to  6.2%  from  7%  in  2011,  and  this  year  he  is  proposing  to  give  Wisconsinites  $800  million  back  in  income  and  property  tax  cuts  and  withholding  changes.  Personal  income  grew  4.4%  over  the  past  year."If  you  put  more  money  back  in  the  hands  of  the  people,  the  hard-working  taxpayers  of  your  state,  they  will  fuel  the  economy.  If  you  put  more  and  more  of  it  in  the  hands  of  government,  they'll  take  it  in  the  opposite  direction."Despite  his  reputation  among  progressives  as  a  union-busting  "bully,"  who  was  often  greeted  by  signs  comparing  him  to  Hitler  during  recall  protests  in  Madison,  Scott  Walker  is  soft-spoken  and  unassuming.In  a  crowded  room,  you  might  not  notice  the  47-year-old  sitting  governor,  sipping  hot  tea  as  he  was  on  Saturday.  He's  wonky  and  fluent  with  figures  but  speaks  affably  and  quickly  with  a  wide  Wisconsin  accent.  "Get  me  going  on  the  Packers  or  motorcycles  and  I  can  go  all  day,"  he  says.But  when  he  believes  a  policy  is  deleterious,  he  doesn't  labor  to  couch  his  rhetoric  in  polite  Midwestern  niceties.On  raising  the  minimum  wage:  "It  is  a  cheap  political  stunt  that  may  be  well-intentioned  by  some,  but  it  has  an  incredibly  buzz  saw  type  effect  on  the  economy.  And  it's  nothing  more  than  a  photo-op  to  pretend  that  people  are  doing  something  about  creating  jobs."On  Obamacare:  "It's  been  a  huge  wet  blanket  that  the  federal  government's  thrown  on  employers  who  should  otherwise  be  starting  to  hire  more  people."On  food  stamps:  "Last  year,  I  proposed  and  have  since  done  a  program  that  says  if  you're  an  adult  in  my  state  without  kids  and  you  want  to  get  food  stamps,  I'm  not  going  to  give  you  food  stamps  unless  you're  employed  part  time  or  enrolled  in  one  of  my  employment  training  programs."It's  this  straight-forward,  principled  approach  to  economic  issues  that  makes  Walker  a  darling  in  many  right-wing  circles  looking  for  a  conservative  candidate  for  2016  whose  vision  is  clear-eyed  and  concrete,  unlike  what  some  would  say  was  Romney's  confused  message.Walker  readily  admits  Romney  wasn't  clear  enough  on  his  principles."I'm  not  telling  tales  here  because  I  told  him  this  for  months.  ...  I  think  [Romney's]  a  good  man,  would  have  been  a  good  president.  But  you  can't  win  elections  just  by  being  against  the  other  guy.  You  can't  win  elections  with  the  premise  that  it's  a  referendum  on  your  opposition."You've  got  to  tell  people  why  the  country  would  be  better  under  your  leadership.  Both  my  [recall]  opponent  and  Mitt  Romney  said,  'My  opponent's  awful,  he's  a  bad  guy,  you  shouldn't  vote  for  him.'  The  winners  were  the  ones  who  actually  told  people  where  they  were  going."But  Walker  also  concedes  there's  a  fine  line  between  no-nonsense  straight  talk  and  the  kind  of  undisciplined  and  undernuanced  rhetoric  that's  gotten  some  other  Republicans  in  trouble,  especially  when  it  comes  to  social  issues.Walker  says  he  "obsesses"  on  fiscal  issues  because  that's  what  voters  elected  him  to  do.  He's  principled  and  conservative  on  abortion  and  marriage,  but  hey  says  social  issues  simply  aren't  the  centerpiece  of  his  agenda.  And  he  blames  the  media  and  Democrats  for  trying  to  make  them  the  centerpiece  of  every  Republican's  agenda."The  reason  the  left  wants  to  talk  about  those  other  issues  and  obsess  about  those  issues  is  because  they  can't  cut  it  when  it  comes  to  the  economy  and  fiscal  issues.  They  want  any  sort  of  distraction  to  get  off-topic,  off-message  to  go  on  some  tangent  out  there  to  have  people  be  distracted  from  what  the  real  issues  are."His  advice  to  fellow  conservatives  is  to  talk  less  about  social  issues  and,  if  forced  to,  "it's  just  a  simple  answer  and  move  on.""What  I  try  to  tell  Republicans  is,  don't  take  the  bait.  Don't  change  your  positions  --  nobody  in  the  center  wants  people  to  flip-flop  just  based  on  whatever  they  think  conventional  wisdom  is  at  the  time.  They  respect  people  who  have  deeply  held  convictions.  But  what  they  don't  want  is  people  going  off  on  tangents  on  things  that  don't  relate  to  what  concerns  them."As  for  2016,  he  not  surprisingly  prefers  two  governors  on  the  Republican  ticket.  What  might  be  surprising  is  the  model  for  success  he  thinks  Republicans  can  channel."Kind  of  like  Bill  Clinton  and  Al  Gore  were  a  little  unconventional  in  '92,  but  what  they  said  that  worked  was,  we're  young,  we're  dynamic,  we're  the  next  generation  and  we're  ready  to  go.  And  in  this  case  why  not  send  two  proven  reformers  to  Washington  to  shake  things  up  and  take  on  the  establishment  that  Hillary  Clinton's  been  a  part  of  almost  her  entire  adult  life?"One  nongovernor  he  does  like?  He's  partial  to  a  young  congressman  from  Janesville,  Wisconsin."Paul  Ryan  to  me  is  one  of  the  few  exceptions  out  there.  I  think  here  in  D.C.,  he's  someone  that  thinks  like  a  governor.  He  pushes  reform,  he's  bold  and  aggressive."If  Republicans  looking  to  run  in  2014  or  2016  need  advice,  they  may  want  to  listen  to  Walker,  whose  message  of  "reform"  certainly  has  a  nicer,  smarter  ring  to  it  than  "blame  Obama."  And  they  might  want  to  obsess  a  little  more  over  fiscal  issues,  despite  the  desire  of  the  liberal  media  to  make  abortion  and  same-sex  marriage  a  24-hour  news  story.Similarly,  if  voters  are  looking  for  a  candidate  in  2016  with  proven  executive  experience,  principled  leadership  and  a  simple  mission  to  reform  unruly  and  broken  bureaucracy,  they  may  just  want  to  pay  attention  to  Walker,  too.+++Here  is  Walker  on  some  other  key  issues  that  have  been  making  news:On  whether  Chris  Christie  should  step  down  from  heading  the  Republican  Governors  Association:"No,  I  think  in  the  end,  he'll  be  fine.  He's  going  to  have  his  hands  full  in  the  next  few  months.  But  I  talked  to  him  the  day  that  he  had  his  press  conference,  what  two  hours  almost?  Everything  that  was  reported  there  he  had  told  me  privately.  So  I  don't  hear  a  different  message."And  assuming,  obviously  a  qualifier,  but  I  have  every  reason  to  believe  what  he's  telling  me  is  accurate,  assuming  that  continues,  any  of  us,  not  just  in  a  situation  like  this,  but  any  of  us  who  are  pushing  big,  bold  reform,  are  going  to  be  under  attack.  I  get  attacked  all  the  time.  Other  governors  get  attacked.  I  think  Chris  is  perfectly  capable  of  handling  that."On  whether  Republicans  need  a  woman  on  the  2016  ticket:"Susana  Martinez  has  done  a  wonderful  job  in  a  state  that's  clearly  a  blue  state.  Nikki  Haley's  doing  a  great  job  in  South  Carolina.  Mary  Fallin  is  doing  a  super  job  out  there  [in  Oklahoma].  So  I  don't  think  you  have  to,  but  the  beauty  of  any  of  those  three  names  is  that  none  of  them  would  be  token.  They'd  be  three  proven  reformers  and  governors."On  legalizing  marijuana:"From  my  standpoint,  I  still  have  concerns  about  making  it  legal.  I  understand  from  the  libertarian  standpoint,  the  argument  out  there.  I  still  have  concerns.  I'm  not,  unlike  the  President,  I  still  have  difficulty  visualizing  marijuana  and  alcohol  in  the  same  vein."I've  never  experienced  this,  but  I  can't  imagine  people  socially  smoking  the  way  people  have  a  beer  or  two  at  a  wedding  reception.  There's  a  huge  difference  out  there.  So  in  the  end,  I  understand  why  people  make  that  argument,  but  in  our  state,  I  don't  think  we're  ready  for  that."On  an  Obamacare  alternative:"The  better  answer  to  me  is  go  the  reverse  direction,  to  a  patient-centered  concept,  where  it's  market-driven  and  patients  are  the  ones  in  charge  and  the  tax  incentives  offered  by  states  and  the  federal  government  don't  discriminate  between  those  who  have  employer-paid  insurance  or  people  who  choose  to  buy  it  individually  or  choose  to  use  it  for  things  like  health  savings  accounts."Make  it  the  same  tax  incentive  across  the  board.  And  in  the  end,  you  can  make  this  about  controlling  cost  by  people  making  decisions  based  on  their  own  health  and  wellness  and  not  about  the  mechanical  bureaucratic  system  and  trying  to  reign  in  costs."On  raising  the  minimum  wage:"What  it  really  is  is  dumping  a  so-called  fresh  idea  off  of  the  heap  of  20  or  30  years  of  bad  ideas  of  the  past.  And  sometimes  because  a  poll  here  shows  people  are  for  it  a  lot  of  politicians  are  afraid  to  take  it  on.  I  say,  if  you  explain  it  to  people  it's  not  hard  for  people  to  get.  It's  not  enough  to  just  say  'No,  I'm  not  for  the  minimum  wage.'"The  better  answer  is  to  say  we  should  be  promoting  pro-growth  policies  that  make  it  easier  for  employers  to  not  only  create  more  jobs  but  grow  income."Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinion.</TEXT></DOC>

There  is  no  option  for  the  status  quo  --  remaining  a  part  of  Ukraine.Results  are  expected  Monday  and  U.S.  officials  have  made  clear  they  expect  Crimean  voters  to  choose  to  become  part  of  Russia.The  referendum  follows  the  lightning  chain  of  events  in  Ukraine  in  recent  months  that  included  increasingly  violent  protests  against  the  government,  the  country's  pro-Russian  President  fleeing  across  the  border,  and  then  Russian  troops  seizing  what  amounts  to  military  control  of  Crimea  --  where  Russia's  Black  Sea  fleet  is  based.By  unanimously  backing  the  referendum,  the  Crimean  parliament  signaled  the  intentions  of  regional  leaders  as  well  as  Russia  to  restore  the  territory  to  Moscow's  control.Ukraine's  interim  government  insists  Crimea  is  part  of  the  country,  a  stance  supported  by  the  United  States  and  its  European  allies.Disturbing  tales  emerge  from  Crimea2)  Is  it  legal?Depends  on  who  you  ask.In  Ukraine,  the  interim  government  rejects  the  referendum  as  unconstitutional,  while  many  in  the  pro-Russian  Crimea  region  desire  the  chance  to  again  align  with  Moscow.Russia  says  the  political  upheaval  in  Ukraine  that  forced  out  President  Viktor  Yanukovych  ended  the  Kiev  government's  constitutional  authority.Russian  President  Vladimir  Putin  calls  the  ousting  of  Yanukovych  an  anti-constitutional  coup,  and  he  argues  the  people  of  Crimea  should  have  the  right  to  decide  their  future  in  the  same  way  as  other  autonomous  regions,  such  as  Kosovo's  breakaway  from  Serbia.However,  Obama  and  European  leaders  insist  the  Crimean  referendum  would  violate  the  Ukrainian  constitution  and  international  law.Samantha  Power,  the  U.S.  ambassador  to  the  United  Nations,  told  CNN  last  week  that  the  Ukrainian  constitution  requires  territorial  referendums  to  be  held  "across  the  entirety  of  Ukraine  and  not  just  in  a  sub-region  like  this."She  argued  that  Yanukovych  fled  on  his  own  volition,  and  that  constitutional  authority  agreed  to  in  a  February  21  deal  he  reached  with  opposition  leaders  and  European  envoys  remained  in  effect.Under  that  agreement,  Ukraine  will  elect  a  new  government  on  May  25  for  the  entire  country,  including  Crimea.Russian  Parliament  backs  Crimea  vote,  brushes  off  sanctions  threat3)  What  would  it  mean?Obama's  quick  condemnation  of  a  Crimean  referendum  showed  the  United  States  expects  the  outcome  to  favor  realigning  with  Russia.The  autonomous  region  has  a  60%  ethnic  Russian  population,  having  been  part  of  Russia  until  it  was  ceded  to  Ukraine  in  1954  by  the  Soviet  Union.Power  said  that  if  the  referendum  goes  forward,  the  result  would  get  little  recognition  beyond  Russia.That  didn't  matter  in  2008  when  Russia  under  Putin  sent  troops  into  neighboring  Georgia,  another  former  Soviet  territory,  to  back  autonomy  for  the  pro-Russian  regions  of  Abkhazia  and  South  Ossetia.More  than  five  years  later,  both  territories  effectively  annexed  with  Russian  forces  still  present.Asked  if  Crimea  and  perhaps  other  parts  of  eastern  and  southern  Ukraine  that  favor  Russia  might  end  up  the  same,  Power  said:  "I  think  it's  maybe  not  helpful  to  talk  about  precedents.""We  are  seeking  to  create  a  future  where  the  past  is  not  replicated  here  in  Ukraine,"  she  added.Cyberwar  hits  Ukraine4)  Potential  fallout?For  Russia,  a  major  motivation  is  ensuring  control  of  its  Black  Sea  fleet  based  in  Sevastopol,  as  well  as  its  economic  influence  in  Ukraine  and  other  former  Soviet  territories  and  satellites.The  Crimean  referendum  would  provide  an  electoral  justification  for  what  amounts  to  a  land  grab  amid  Ukraine's  political  upheaval.Obama  acknowledged  Russia  had  legitimate  concerns  that  needed  to  be  part  of  a  solution,  such  as  guarantees  it  could  maintain  the  Sevastopol-based  naval  fleet  in  Ukraine.However,  his  call  for  Russian  troops  in  Crimea  to  return  to  their  barracks  and  negotiations  between  Russia  and  Ukraine  on  a  solution  has  so  far  yielded  little  progress.Both  the  United  States  and  European  Union  have  threatened  sanctions  if  no  significant  progress  occurs  soon,  but  major  economic  ties  between  Russia  and  European  powers,  such  as  Germany,  raise  questions  about  the  strength  of  any  EU  steps.Secretary  of  State  John  Kerry  said  Thursday  that  if  the  Crimean  referendum  proceeds  with  no  sign  of  movement  by  Russia  on  negotiating  with  Ukraine  on  the  crisis,  "there  will  be  a  very  serious  series  of  steps  Monday  in  Europe  and  here."To  CNN's  Fareed  Zakaria,  Putin  may  get  his  wish  with  Crimea,  but  at  a  cost."They  got  Crimea,  but  they've  scared  off  Ukraine,"  he  said.  "And,  most  importantly,  the  people  of  Ukraine  are  now  deeply  suspicious  of  Russia.  The  people  in  Poland  and  Hungary  and  the  Czech  Republic,  or  probably  in  places  like  Kazakhstan,  are  all  now  fearful."CNN's  Mariano  Castillo  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

That  number  has  remained  fairly  constant  since  2003-2004,  dropping  just  0.2%.More  than  a  third  of  adults  over  20  were  obese  that  same  year,  a  number  that  held  steady  over  the  study's  time  period.  The  prevalence  is  often  higher  in  women  and  in  Hispanic  and  non-Hispanic  black  populations.Four  years  ago  this  month,  Obama  announced  that  she  was  taking  on  childhood  obesity  with  a  new  initiative  called  Let's  Move!  The  comprehensive  program  was  part  parental  education,  part  government  reform  --  with  a  bit  of  celebrity  encouragement  thrown  in."About  one-third  of  our  children  are  overweight  or  obese.  None  of  us  want  that  for  our  country,"  Obama  said  at  the  time.  "It's  time  to  get  moving."Let's  Move!  had  several  objectives  under  its  broader  ambition  of  "solving  the  challenge  of  childhood  obesity  within  a  generation."  Obama  wanted  to  increase  physical  activity  and  improve  nutrition  in  schools,  overhaul  nutrition  labels  to  make  healthy  choices  easier  for  families,  decrease  the  number  of  calories  in  restaurant  meals  and  eliminate  food  deserts  --  areas  without  access  to  fresh,  healthy  foods  --  in  cities  across  America.First  Lady:  Childhood  obesity  is  about  fitness,  not  looksIn  December  2010,  President  Barack  Obama  signed  the  Healthy,  Hunger-Free  Kids  Act  into  law,  which  was  designed  to  encourage  better  eating  habits  in  schools  by  giving  the  federal  government  more  authority  to  set  standard  for  food  sold  on  school  grounds.  The  $4.5  billion  act  provided  more  money  to  subsidize  free  meals  and  help  administrators  offset  the  higher  costs  of  including  more  fruits  and  vegetables  in  school  lunches.Then  in  June  2011,  the  USDA  dismantled  the  traditional  food  pyramid  and  replaced  it  with  a  new  icon  called  MyPlate.  The  plate  emphasizes  fruits  and  vegetables,  telling  Americans  to  fill  half  of  every  plate  they  eat  with  produce.  Another  quarter  of  the  plate  should  be  lean  protein;  the  last  quarter  should  be  whole  grains.  A  small  portion  of  dairy  --  perhaps  a  glass  of  low-fat  milk  --  can  be  added  on  the  side.The  first  lady  also  tackled  nutrition  and  physical  education  in  childcare  facilities  around  the  country.  Let's  Move!  offers  guidelines  for  childcare  providers:  one  to  two  hours  of  physical  activity  a  day;  limited  screen  time;  more  fruits  and  vegetables  at  meals  served  family-style  when  possible;  no  fried  foods  and  no  sugary  drinks.And  that's  not  all."Food  manufacturers  have  pledged  to  cut  1.5  trillion  calories  from  the  products  they  sell.  Local  grocers  and  national  chains  such  as  Walgreens  and  SuperValu  are  building  new  supermarkets  and  expanding  existing  stores  to  sell  fresh  food  in  1,500  underserved  communities,"  Obama  wrote  in  an  op-ed  for  CNN  in  2012."Restaurants  are  transforming  their  kids'  menus,  packing  them  with  healthier  options.  Mayors  are  planting  gardens  and  refurbishing  parks.  Congregations  are  sponsoring  summer  nutrition  programs  for  kids  and  exercise  ministries  for  families."Even  Disney  and  the  Department  of  Defense  are  jumping  on  board.In  January  2012,  the  USDA  issued  its  new  rules  for  school  meals,  which  are  being  phased  in  over  a  three-year  period.  Cafeterias  must  offer  fruits  and  vegetables  at  every  meal,  reduce  sodium  and  some  types  of  fat  and  keep  to  calorie  minimums  and  maximums.  The  government  agency  followed  up  six  months  later  with  new  rules  for  snack  foods.  The  regulations  set  limits  for  fat,  salt  and  sugar  sold  in  school  vending  machines  and  snack  bars.The  USDA  has  faced  opposition  over  the  new  rules  --  from  student  athletes  who  say  they're  not  getting  enough  calories  to  administrators  who  say  kids  just  aren't  buying  the  healthier  options.Which  raises  the  question:  With  all  these  new  guidelines  and  regulations,  are  kids  really  getting  any  healthier?It's  a  difficult  question  to  answer,  as  the  most  comprehensive  data  collections  about  obesity  are  still  a  few  years  behind.  But  there  have  been  signs  of  progress.Steven  Hanus,  a  elementary  physical  education  teacher  in  the  Chicago  suburbs,  says  he's  noticed  a  change  in  his  students  --  and  their  parents  --  over  the  past  five  years.Overall,  the  kids  are  in  better  shape,  he  says.  Parents  are  asking  Hanus  more  questions  as  well,  about  how  to  keep  their  kids  moving  at  home.  And  he's  received  strong  support  from  administrators  in  his  quest  to  find  new  ways  to  interest  students  in  fitness.  Recently,  his  first-graders  were  given  pedometers  for  the  first  time.Related:  Not  your  mama's  gym  class"From  our  top  level  down,  the  initiative  to  keep  kids  moving  and  active  has  definitely  been  a  big  part  of  the  district,"  Hanus  says.  "It's  made  us  all  a  little  more  aware  of  how  active  we  are."Another  study  published  in  August  2013  that  analyzed  data  from  preschool  children  in  low-income  families  showed  a  small  but  significant  decline  in  the  group's  obesity  rates  between  2008  and  2011."It's  a  bright  spot  for  our  nation's  young  kids,  but  the  fight  is  very  far  from  over,"  CDC  Director  Dr.  Tom  Frieden  said  at  the  time.Obama  agrees."While  childhood  obesity  rates  are  beginning  to  fall,  we  still  have  a  long  way  to  go  before  we  solve  this  problem  once  and  for  all,"  the  first  lady  said  Tuesday.  "We  can't  slow  down  and  we  can't  turn  back  now."Let's  Move!  recommends  children  engage  in  physical  activity  for  a  total  of  60  minutes  every  day,  and  adults  should  move  for  30  minutes  daily.Show  the  White  House  how  you  move  on  Twitter,  Facebook,  Instagram  and  Vine  using  the  hashtag  #LetsMove.CNN's  Kevin  Liptak,  Madison  Park  and  William  Hudson  contributed  to  this  story.</TEXT></DOC>

As  the  liquids  mix,  he  observes:  "And  that  is  congealing  nicely  ...  whew  ...  okay,"  before  knocking  back  the  potion.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>London  (CNN)  --  "Thanks  for  the  nomination  Luke,"  jokes  a  young  man  in  a  YouTube  clip  pouring  what  he  says  is  a  new,  unopened  bottle  of  Sambuca  spirits  into  a  pint  glass  along  with  another,  unidentified  drink.  As  the  liquids  mix,  he  observes:  "And  that  is  congealing  nicely  ...  whew  ...  okay,"  before  knocking  back  the  potion.After  a  brief  pause  he  declares:  "I  nominate  [he  names  some  friends].  You've  got  24  hours  lads.  Get  it  done."The  game,  known  as  Neknominate,  is  thought  to  have  originated  in  Australia  and  is  now  sweeping  the  world.  It  involves  you  filming  yourself  downing  a  drink  --  often  alcoholic  and  of  large  quantities  --  and  then  nominating  a  friend  to  outdo  you.  All  this  is  posted  on  social  media  --  be  it  Facebook  or  YouTube.But  what  started  for  some  as  fun  has  turned  deadly;  at  least  five  men  aged  under  30  have  died  after  drinking  deadly  cocktails.  Now  health  professionals  are  warning  young  people  of  the  risks  of  consuming  large  amounts  of  alcohol  in  a  short  time."This  is  a  lethal  game,"  Dr.  Sarah  Jarvis,  medical  adviser  for  the  UK-based  charity  Drinkaware,  told  CNN.  "The  point  about  alcohol  is  that  it  affects  your  ability  to  recognize  that  you're  in  danger,  and  it  absolutely  affects  your  ability  to  react  to  danger.  So  we  have  a  double  whammy."There  appears  to  be  no  limit  to  the  type  of  drinks  that  are  consumed,  and  in  what  matter.  Each  nomination  becomes  more  and  more  daring  and  outlandish.It  started  as  exhibitionism  with  this  woman  stripping  in  the  supermarket  and  downing  a  drink,  but  the  bravado  has  escalated  into  extreme  cocktails:  One  mixes  spirits  with  a  dead  mouse,  in  another  a  man  drinks  out  of  a  toilet,  and  the  craze  has  seen  players  consume  alcohol  with  goldfish,  insects,  engine  oil  and  dog  food.Unsurprisingly  the  trend  has  prompted  politicians  to  demand  that  schools  play  a  bigger  role."The  Facebook  drinking  game  Neknomination  has  gone  viral,  and  very  sadly  young  people  have  died  as  a  result,"  said  UK  opposition  spokesman  Diana  Johnson.  "What  role  do  schools  have  in  building  resilience  in  our  young  people  to  resist  peer  pressure?"The  role  of  social  media  giants  like  Facebook  is  also  coming  under  scrutiny.  Brian  Viner,  whose  own  son  has  played  the  game,  demanded  that  those  companies  face  up  to  their  responsibilities.His  son  was  nominated  and  pressured  to  play  the  game  but  drank  water  instead  of  vodka  so  as  not  to  harm  himself."I  was  cross  with  him  but  more  cross  with  the  social  media  involved  and  the  way  this  game  has  just  spread,"  Viner  said.  "The  whole  thing  is  madness  and  it  needs  some  kind  of  sharp  and  swift  action  on  the  part  of  these  social  networks  to  stop  it."Facebook  said  in  a  statement:  "We  do  not  tolerate  content  which  is  directly  harmful,  for  example  bullying,  but  behavior  which  some  people  may  find  offensive  or  controversial  is  not  always  necessarily  against  our  rules."We  encourage  people  to  report  things  to  us  which  they  feel  breaks  our  rules  so  we  can  review  and  take  action  on  a  case  by  case  basis."But  Dr.  Jarvis  rejected  this  defense,  saying  Facebook  must  recognize  its  own  role  in  the  game."It's  very  difficult  in  this  day  of  personal  liberties  to  say  that  Facebook  shouldn't  be  condoning  this  or  taking  these  videos  offline."Personally,  I  would  like  to  see  that  happening.  Frankly,  if  the  thrill  wasn't  there,  your  mates  weren't  seeing  you,  I  expect  it  would  very  rapidly  fizzle  out."</TEXT></DOC>

Breathless  media  chronicling  his  every  move.  And  an  affluent  Atlanta  neighborhood  up  in  arms  over  a  possible  new  neighbor.Well,  two  out  of  three  ain't  bad.Amid  rumors  that  pop  star  Justin  Bieber  was  considering  a  move  to  Atlanta,  the  Regular  Guys,  a  morning  show  on  Atlanta  radio  station  Rock  100.5,  put  together  a  fake  neighborhood  group  and  pulled  the  wool  over  the  eyes  of  the  world's  news  organizations.They  convinced  the  media  that  the  newly  formed  Buckhead  Neighborhood  Coalition  wanted  no  part  of  Bieber  setting  up  his  new  digs  in  the  midst  of  their  old-money  mansions."The  Buckhead  Neighborhood  Coalition  is  an  organization  put  together  by  'the  Regular  Guys  Show,'  "  host  Larry  Wachs  admitted  Monday  after  the  show's  cast  completed  its  "protest"  in  front  of  an  on-the-market  mansion.The  Regular  Guys'  Tim  Andrews  played  the  role  of  Harold  White,  becoming  the  face  of  the  fictitious  protest,  doing  interviews  with  CNN,  the  BBC  and  a  host  of  other  news  outlets."@theregularguys  show  got  33  international  media  outlets  including  TMZ  to  generate  45,000  plus  news  stories,"  Wachs  claimed  on  air.Andrews,  as  White,  claimed  to  be  a  retiree  and  long-time  resident  in  his  interview  with  CNN."We're  concerned  he'll  bring  the  wrong  type  of  element  into  a  quiet,  residential  area,"  he  said  over  the  weekend.  "It  is  our  position  that  a  person  with  his  means  could  certainly  find  a  neighborhood  more  suited  to  his  eclectic  lifestyle."The  ploy  also  included  a  fake  wife  he  said  started  a  Facebook  page  to  organize  the  protest.It  warned  that  "Justin  Bieber's  relocation  to  Atlanta  can  be  nothing  but  bad  for  our  children,  as  well  as  the  community.  Some  can't  even  let  their  children  play  in  the  driveway  without  fear;  he  has  raced  vehicles  under  the  influence,  before.  What's  to  say  he  won't  do  it  again?"After  the  mock  disgust,  the  Regular  Guys  were  all  smiles  on  Monday."That's  a  big  win,"  Wachs  said  of  the  prank.  "That's  a  huge  win."They  marveled  at  how  eager  news  organizations  were  to  report  the  story,  missing  the  potential  warning  signs  of  new  Twitter  and  Facebook  accounts."And  the  great  thing  was,  only  one  outlet  kind  of  thought  it  was  a  troll,  and  that  was  Creative  Loafing,"  Wachs  said.As  the  prank  swirled,  no  one  in  Bieber's  camp  commented  on  the  rumored  move,  which  began  with  a  TMZ  report.  Still,  the  very  idea  of  Bieber  deciding  to  make  the  Georgia  capital  another  home  was  too  good  to  ignore.There  had  been  numerous  Bieber  sightings  across  the  Atlanta  area:  skating  rinks,  a  fast-food  restaurant  and  a  nightclub.Add  to  that,  Bieber  has  had  several  encounters  with  law  enforcement  authorities  in  recent  months.  He  was  recently  arrested  in  Toronto,  accused  of  assaulting  his  limousine  driver  in  December.He  also  faces  charges  of  drunken  driving,  resisting  arrest  and  driving  on  an  expired  license  after  being  stopped  by  police  in  Miami  Beach,  Florida,  last  month.The  Los  Angeles  County  district  attorney  is  considering  whether  to  charge  Bieber  with  felony  vandalism  in  the  alleged  egging  of  a  neighbor's  house  on  January  9.CNN's  Susanna  Capelouto  and  Janet  DiGiacomo  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

As  in:  Nixonian  shenanigans  eventually  gave  rise  to  Jimmy  Carter's  self-righteousness.  Clintonesque  parsing  gave  way  to  George  W.  Bush's  plain  speaking.  Bush's  plain  speaking  begat  Barack  Obama's  lofty  speechifying.Oversimplified?  Yes.  But  true  nonetheless.And  so  we  head  into  2016  (yes,  already)  and  Chris  Christie's  ready-made  narrative:  If  Obama  is  lofty,  Christie  is  down  to  earth.  If  Obama  wasn't  tough  enough,  he's  hard-hitting.  If  Obama  couldn't  run  his  complex  health  care  rollout,  he's  a  strong  manager.  If  Obama  was  partisan,  he's  worked  across  party  lines.In  sum:  Christie  can  lead  in  the  precise  ways  that  Obama  disappointed.Until  a  traffic  jam  on  the  George  Washington  Bridge.  Then  came  another  stark  contrast:  the  vindictive  --  and  more  important,  petty  --  Christie  culture  as  opposed  to  the  stature  the  presidency  demands.So  far,  the  New  Jersey  melodrama  looks  like  the  worst  side  of  the  Christie  ethos.  The  apparent  reprisals  against  Democratic  mayors.  The  vanity  of  featuring  the  Christie  family  in  taxpayer-funded  commercials.  The  environment  in  which  retribution  reigned  when  Christie  did  not  get  what  he  wanted.  The  arrogance  of  believing  he  was  deserving  of  it  all,  and  to  hell  with  the  rest  of  'em.The  grand  storyline  behind  all  of  this,  of  course,  is  the  design  on  the  presidency:  Christie  wanted  to  be  re-elected  by  such  an  overwhelming  margin  that  it  would  launch  his  national  aspirations  into  the  stratosphere.  The  plan  was  to  get  bipartisan  support  to  show  his  viability  as  a  national  candidate.  All  who  stood  in  the  way  were  official  enemies.This  is  not  to  say  that  presidents  don't  have  enemies.  Of  course  they  do.  You  don't  get  elected  to  any  office  in  this  country,  much  less  president  of  the  United  States,  without  accumulating  political  enemies.  But  the  real  question  is  WHY  you  consider  someone  an  enemy,  and  then,  how  you  deal  with  it.As  president,  LBJ  had  always  had  a  bunch,  but  the  enmity  --  and  payback  --  generally  came  over  issues,  not  self-aggrandizement.  It's  Politics  101:  If  you  want  to  pass  a  civil  rights  bill  and  you  don't  get  a  "yes"  vote  from  an  opponent  who  wants  a  bridge  in  his  state,  no  bridge.That's  very  different  from  saying  if  you  don't  endorse  my  candidacy  I  will  shut  down  your  bridge.  That's  not  politics;  it's  puny  payback.  And,  worse,  the  impact  is  felt  not  only  by  the  opponent,  but  by  his  --  and  your  --  constituents.  A  bridge  way  too  far.Then  consider  Bill  Clinton,  who  had  plenty  of  enemies.  A  former  senior  Clinton  adviser  reminds  me  that  "it  became  a  joke  that  the  best  thing  to  be  was  Clinton's  enemy.  If  99  people  in  a  room  were  for  him,  and  one  was  against  him,  he  would  spend  all  his  time  trying  to  persuade  that  one  guy  he  was  wrong.  And  he  was  always  willing  to  argue  the  substance.  Always.  In  fact,  he  enjoyed  it."This  is  not  to  turn  Clinton  and  LBJ  into  saintly  role  models  and  Christie  into  the  devil.  But  it  is  to  say  that  Christie's  staff  shenanigans  --  which  he  says  he  did  not  know  about  --  have  raised  enormous  questions  about  his  temperament  and  how  he  would  run  a  White  House.  In  fact,  a  Monmouth  University  poll  released  this  week  shows  that  only  44%  of  New  Jersey  voters  believe  that  their  governor  has  the  right  temperament  for  the  Oval  Office.The  characterization  of  Christie  and  Obama  as  opposite  numbers  is  accurate  in  many  ways.  There's  this:  When  then-Sen.  Joe  Lieberman,  the  Democrat-turned-independent,  endorsed  Republican  Sen.  John  McCain  for  the  presidency  in  2008  --  and  became  his  outspoken  travel  buddy  --  there  were  calls  for  retribution  after  Obama  won.So  what  did  Obama  do?  He  kept  Lieberman  on  as  chairman  of  an  important  committee.  It  kept  an  enemy  close,  not  a  bad  strategy.Obama  is  cool  and  Christie  is  all  drama.  And  now  a  line  of  argument  against  him  as  petty  and  vindictive  has  been  opened  up  that  will  become  the  default  narrative.  But  Christie  will  be  defined  as  much  by  how  he  deals  with  this  episode  as  the  episode  itself.No  one  expects  --  or  really  wants  --  Chris  Christie  to  morph  into  a  false  version  of  himself.But  how  about  some  elevation  --  and  some  perspective  --  that  flies  way  above  the  traffic  jam  on  the  George  Washington  Bridge?Follow  @CNNOpinion  on  Twitter.Join  us  at  Facebook/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Gloria  Borger.</TEXT></DOC>

Hillary  Clinton  made  a  forceful  appeal  for  the  United  States  to  back  Israel  as  the  Jewish  nation's  forces  squared  off  against  Hezbollah  during  the  2006  Lebanon  War."We  will  stand  with  Israel  because  Israel  is  standing  for  American  values  as  well  as  Israeli  ones,"  said  Clinton.Clinton  was  an  outspoken  defender  of  Israel  and  representative  for  American  Jews  for  eight  years  in  the  Senate.  But  it  wasn't  always  that  way.  She  had  to  work  hard  for  Jewish  support  in  2000  as  the  New  York  Jewish  community  was  skeptical  of  her  support  for  Israel  and  publicly  wondered  whether  the  former  first  lady  was  too  sympathetic  with  the  Palestinians.But  by  the  time  she  ran  for  president  in  2008,  a  number  of  Jewish  Democrats  said  her  record  with  the  community  was  unprecedented.  Touting  her  foreign  policy  credentials  and  defense  of  Israel,  Jewish  leaders  flocked  to  Clinton  as  she  ran  against  Barack  Obama  in  the  Democratic  primaries.But  after  losing  to  Obama,  Clinton  signed  on  to  be  the  new  President's  secretary  of  state  and  the  face  of  his  foreign  policy.  Over  the  next  four  years,  some  Jewish  leaders  said  Clinton's  once-consistent,  outspoken  leadership  on  Israel  was  hamstrung  by  her  role  as  Obama's  top  diplomat.Obama  and  Abbas:  Time  running  out  for  even  a  framework  for  Middle  East  talksMany  applauded  when  she  talked  tough  on  Iran,  like  in  2010  when  she  labeled  the  country  as  one  with  an  "anti-Semitic  president  and  hostile  nuclear  ambitions"  or  when  she  said  in  Qatar  that  "Iran  is  moving  toward  a  military  dictatorship."But  many  also  winced  quietly  when  she  floated  trial  balloons  about  a  nuclear  deal  with  Iran,  like  in  a  2010  interview  with  the  BBC  in  which  Clinton  said  Iran  could  enrich  uranium  for  civilian  purposes  if  it  came  into  compliance  with  international  norms.As  Clinton  mulls  another  run  for  the  presidency  in  2016,  there  are  questions  in  the  Jewish  community  about  whether  her  time  at  State  has  shifted  her  standing  on  issues  important  to  American  Jews.To  some,  the  foreign  policy  experience  she  developed  will  just  further  endear  her  to  a  bloc  of  voters  one  leader  described  as  "extraordinarily  cosmopolitan  on  foreign  affairs."But  to  others,  including  a  number  of  Democrats,  Clinton's  ties  to  the  Obama  administration  --  a  presidency  that  some  Jewish  leaders  say  is  not  strong  enough  on  Israel  and  too  focused  on  working  out  a  nuclear  deal  with  Iran  --  has  not  helped  her  standing  with  American  Jews."On  the  amorphous  level,  that  she  was  part  of  the  administration,  there  may  be  some  residual  weakening,"  said  one  Jewish  leader  in  Washington  who  asked  for  anonymity  to  speak  more  candidly.Other  Jewish  leaders  see  it  as  a  mixed  bag  that  Clinton  will  have  to  define  before  she  decides  about  her  political  future."At  a  minimum,  her  four  years  in  the  secretary's  office  did  not  hurt  her  in  the  community,  even  as  the  President  got  beat  up  in  some  corners  of  the  community,"  said  another  Jewish  leader  with  ties  to  Clinton.  "I  don't  know  it  especially  helped  her  among  Jews,  but  it  didn't  hurt  her."Tapping  into  the  Clinton  mystiqueJewish  leaders  questioning  Clinton's  standing  is  particularly  interesting  when  the  Clinton  family's  longstanding  ties  with  the  community  is  considered.Those  ties  are  so  great  that  Bill  Clinton  --  a  Southern  Baptist  born  in  Arkansas  --  is  jokingly  considered  and  honorary  Jew  to  some  leaders."Her  husband  was  like  the  first  Jewish  president,"  joked  one  Jewish  Democrat.  Others  said  the  Clintons'  understanding  of  the  community  was  better  than  any  other  American  politicians.Clinton  is  also  helped  by  history.  Despite  the  fact  that  conservatives  have  long  hypothesized  that  Americans  Jews  would  begin  to  vote  more  Republican  because  of  party's  positions  on  taxes  and  Israel,  the  past  two  decades  have  shown  the  opposite.According  to  a  2012  report  by  The  Solomon  Project,  a  nonpartisan  public  policy  organization,  Jewish  support  for  Democrats  has  grown  since  the  1990s.  When  Republican  Ronald  Reagan  won  the  presidency  in  1980  and  1984,  he  garnered  between  31%  and  37%  of  the  Jewish  votes.  But  starting  in  1992,  when  Bill  Clinton  was  first  elected  to  the  White  House,  American  Jews  began  to  gravitate  to  the  Democratic  Party.In  fact,  at  no  point  between  1990  to  2008  has  a  Democratic  candidate  for  the  presidency  won  less  than  70%  of  the  Jewish  vote.  In  2008,  Obama  won  nearly  three-quarters  of  the  Jewish  vote.But  history  is  also  changing.In  2012,  Obama  became  the  first  Democratic  presidential  candidate  since  Jimmy  Carter  in  1976  to  win  less  than  70%  of  the  Jewish  vote  when  69%  of  the  community  supported  the  president."The  majority  of  American  Jews  are  liberal  Democrats,"  said  Nathan  Diament,  executive  director  of  the  Orthodox  Union  Advocacy  Center.  "But  in  the  Orthodox  segment  of  the  community,  President  Obama  is  less  popular.  I  think  it  remains  to  be  seen  whether,  for  the  Orthodox  community,  that  translates  into  some  baggage  for  Hillary  Clinton."Since  leaving  the  State  Department,  Clinton  has  appeared  at  a  number  of  fundraiser  for  Jewish  groups  where  she  has  been  well-received.In  October  2013,  Clinton  was  the  keynote  speaker  at  the  $5,000-a-plate  Jewish  United  Fund  of  Metropolitan  Chicago  Vanguard  fundraising  luncheon.In  January  2014,  Clinton  was  one  of  a  few  speakers  at  the  memorial  service  for  Samuel  Bronfman,  a  longtime  Clinton  supporter  and  stalwart  in  the  Jewish  community.  A  Jewish  leader  in  New  York  who  attended  the  event  told  CNN  that  speaking  at  the  memorial  was  a  "huge  coup"  for  Clinton  because  "everyone  who  is  anyone  in  the  Jewish  community  will  be  there."Clinton  documents  show  'West  Wing'  mindsetSome  explaining  to  do  on  IranClinton  will  have  a  chance  to  tout  her  bona  fides  with  Jewish-Americans  on  Wednesday  when  she  is  honored  by  Jack  Rosen,  the  head  of  American  Jewish  Congress,  at  an  event  in  New  York  City.According  to  Rosen,  a  Jewish  leader  with  extensive  ties  to  the  Clintons,  the  event  is  an  opportunity  for  Clinton  to  talk  about  issues  that  are  important  to  the  Jewish  American  community.  Rosen  specifically  pointed  out  that  "the  community"  would  like  to  know  where  Clinton  stands  on  the  deal  the  U.S.  and  five  other  Western  nations  struck  with  Iran  over  its  nuclear  program."We  now  have  this  deal  with  Iran  brewing,"  Rosen  said.  "The  community  would  like  to  know  where  she  would  come  out  on  these  Iranian  discussion  taking  place.  How  does  she  see  the  future  outcome  out  if?"While  the  agreement  struck  in  November  was  preliminary,  it  dials  back  Iran's  ability  to  work  toward  a  nuclear  weapon  and  at  the  same  time  loosens  the  chokehold  of  international  sanctions  on  Iran's  economy.Some  American  Jews  have  been  critical  of  the  deal,  and  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Benjamin  Netanyahu  has  labeled  the  deal  a  "historic  mistake"  that  "has  made  the  world  a  much  more  dangerous  place."Rosen  was  quick  to  correctly  point  out  that  Clinton  wasn't  in  office  when  the  deal  with  Iran  was  struck.  This  distance,  he  said,  gave  the  former  secretary  of  state  a  "sort  of  the  restart  button  here  on  Iranian  policy  because  Iranian  policy  has  changed."But  the  former  first  lady  has  already  publicly  helped  Obama  by  rebuffing  congressional  attempts  to  impose  more  sanctions  on  Iran  as  negotiations  play  out.In  a  letter  to  Senate  Armed  Services  Chairman  Carl  Levin  in  February,  Clinton  wrote  that  while  she  was  "a  long-time  advocate  for  crippling  sanctions  against  Iran,"  now  was  the  time  to  "do  everything  we  can  to  test  whether  they  can  advance  a  permanent  solution."For  some  American  Jewish  leaders,  that  letter  was  a  troubling  sign."Having  thrown  her  support  to  the  President's  approach  on  the  Iran  issue,  she  is  now  really  tied  herself  to  his  policy,"  Diament  said.  "If  somehow  that  policy  does  not  succeed,  that  is  something  she  is  going  to  have  a  lot  of  explaining  to  do."Rosen  came  close  to  echoing  Diament's  sentiment."She  wasn't  part  of  (the  Iran  deal),"  Rosen  said,  but  "does  she  support  it?"  The  answer  to  that  question  "will  bring  up  some  questions  of  her  views  in  comparison  to  the  administration's."</TEXT></DOC>

It  was  one  of  the  standout  moments  of  the  season  two  finale,  and  we  would  soon  learn  that  this  person's  name  was  Michonne,  a  quiet  warrior  who  had  seemingly  mastered  how  to  survive  in  the  zombie  apocalypse  (one  bright  idea:  bring  along  a  couple  of  chained  walkers  with  no  hands  or  mouths  to  draw  away  the  others).Ever  since  that  moment,  Michonne,  played  by  Danai  Gurira,  has  been  rivaled  only  by  Daryl  Dixon  in  terms  of  rabid  fans.  At  times,  she  is  a  silent  force  of  nature,  but  has  opened  up  a  good  deal  to  the  rest  of  the  survivors  lately.The  season's  midway  point  having  ended  with  (spoiler  alert!)  a  brutal  attack  on  the  prison,  sending  the  group  off  in  different  directions,  not  to  mention  the  horrifying  death  of  Hershel.  CNN  spoke  with  Gurira  about  what  fans  can  expect  when  the  season  returns  on  Sunday.CNN:  Michonne  has  been  through  a  lot  already.  Where  is  her  head  after  the  attack  at  the  prison?Gurira:  It  was  deeply  trying  for  her  and  a  major  loss  for  her.  The  idea  of  finally  connecting  with  people  --  that's  not  easy  for  her  at  all.  She's  very  guarded  and  really  has  serious  armor  on.  She's  slowly  letting  that  armor  chip  away,  opening  up  to  people.  She  actually  spent  some  time  being  in  this  community  full  time,  so  to  have  this  happen  under  her  watch,  and  to  see  all  the  trauma  it  causes,  and  the  things  she  was  trying  to  avoid,  is  very  traumatic  to  her.  She's  still  just  starting  to  invest  again  in  people.She  has  suffered  great  loss  and  it's  a  question  of  how  she  responds  to  it.  There  are  a  couple  of  ways  it  could  go  down.  We'll  have  to  see  which  road  she  takes.CNN:  She  lost  a  good  friend  in  Andrea  last  year,  and  now  more  loss.  Does  she  still  feel  a  connection  to  this  group?  Would  you  describe  her  as  very  loyal?Gurira:  Even  in  the  first  episode  this  season,  you  see  how  she's  very  connected  to  Carl,  bringing  him  comic  books  and  candy.  There  are  tons  of  little  moments  between  her  and  Daryl  as  well.  In  terms  of  her  opening  up  to  the  group,  she's  become  very  connected.Yes,  she  was  very  loyal  to  Andrea,  very  loyal  to  the  people  with  whom  she  goes  outside  of  the  prison.  She  risks  her  life  for  them.  She  actually  really  wants  the  best  for  these  people.  Most  recently,  she  didn't  run  away,  she  went  back  to  make  sure  that  Rick  wasn't  killed  by  the  Governor.CNN:  Where  are  things  headed  for  the  rest  of  season  four?  Is  there  a  big  difference  from  the  first  half?Gurira:  It's  gonna  be  a  very  different  tone.  You  see  people  going  in  different  directions,  you  don't  know  who's  going  to  align  with  whom,  who's  going  to  make  it.  It's  going  to  be  a  whole  different  tone  from  what's  been  done  before  on  the  show.  It's  going  to  be  very  exciting  and  thrilling,  and  no  one  knows  what's  coming  next.  There  will  be  very  powerful  moments,  and  very  powerful  character  developments.CNN:  Did  you  have  to  learn  any  different  forms  of  fighting  or  different  stunts  this  season?Gurira:  I  always  like  trying  out  different  things.  There  are  always  ways  that  the  writers  will  write  something  that  will  allow  me  to  attack  it  in  a  different  way.  Absolutely  --  we  try  to  make  things  a  little  different  than  they  were  last  time.  There's  always  that  journey  I'm  taking  with  the  physical  demands  of  the  character  --  I  want  to  do  as  many  different  things  as  I  can!CNN:  This  show  has  a  very  passionate  fan  base,  and  there  is  certainly  a  big  fan  base  for  Michonne  in  particular.  Does  this  still  surprise  you?Gurira:  It's  a  worldwide  thing  now.  I  was  in  Zimbabwe  and  there  were  fans  there  who  would  stop  me  on  the  street.  It  does  still  take  me  aback  how  much  the  show  has  resonated  across  culture,  class  and  creed.CNN:  Any  interesting  fan  moments  lately?Gurira:  The  one  that  comes  to  mind  most  immediately  are  two  different  guys  who  have  me  tattooed  to  them,  so  that  was  a  little  shocking  and  unexpected.  I've  seen  about  three  now  like  that.CNN:  Do  you  think  Michonne  can  be  seen  as  someone  to  look  up  to,  or  do  you  try  to  play  her  that  way?Gurira:  What  you  have  to  do  as  an  artist  is  invest  your  character  with  as  much  life  and  dimension,  and  stick  to  what's  written.  You  stay  true  to  that  --  you  don't  think  "let  me  make  this  character  someone  to  look  up  to."  I  don't  know  how  to  play  that.  All  you  can  do  is  function  in  the  character  that's  been  crafted.  However  she  resonates,  I  just  have  to  go  with  that.  You  really  can't  bank  on  that.  The  beauty  of  the  show  is  that  --  and  I  share  this  with  her  --  we're  not  people  pleasers.And  the  writers  are  amazing,  so  they  know  exactly  how  to  give  her  a  story  that's  rich  --  we  have  wonderful  conversations  and  I'm  able  to  collaborate  with  them  in  terms  of  what  they're  going  for,  and  I  give  my  all  to  that  fiction.CNN:  What  has  been  the  toughest  scene  for  you  so  far?Gurira:  Shooting  the  Hershel  death  scene  was  very  difficult  emotionally  for  us.  It  was  very  tough.  That  was  definitely  way  up  there.CNN:  Do  you  own  an  action  figure  of  Michonne?Gurira:  I  get  given  them,  I  don't  go  out  and  buy  them.  There's  been  a  lot  of  stuff  lately,  so  I  don't  know  if  I've  kept  up  with  it!  The  initial  stuff  that  came  out,  I  definitely  have  most  of  it.  I've  given  away  some  of  it.CNN:  Was  it  interesting  to  see  yourself  as  an  action  figure?Gurira:  It  was,  it  was!  The  first  time  I  got  the  model  --  it  was  very  different  and  unexpected.  It  wasn't  something  I  thought  of  in  acting  school.  It  was  pretty  darn  cool!  "When  I  get  into  the  world,  I  want  to  have  an  action  figure!"  I  never  dreamed  that  dream,  but  to  see  it  was  very  cool.</TEXT></DOC>

Created  by  Carter  Bays  and  Craig  Thomas,  "HIMYM"  centers  on  Josh  Radnor's  Ted  and  his  friends  as  Ted  recounts  through  a  series  of  flashback  stories  how  he  met  his  future  wife.For  the  spinoff  pilot,  Bays  and  Thomas  are  collaborating  with  "Up  All  Night's"  Emily  Spivey  on  a  similar  concept,  but  one  with  a  gender  reversal.  This  time,  it'll  be  Gerwig's  Sally  who  retraces  how  she  met  her  partner.In  its  official  description,  CBS  describes  Gerwig's  character  as  "a  female  Peter  Pan  who  has  never  grown  up  and  has  no  idea  of  where  she's  going  in  life."  Faced  with  a  breakup  with  her  husband  of  less  than  a  year,  Sally  turns  to  her  friends  and  family  for  support,  even  though  they're  "often  too  willing  to  give  'good'  advice  that  can  backfire  badly."Before  signing  on  to  "How  I  Met  Your  Dad,"  Gerwig  was  building  a  career  mainly  in  indie  film,  including  standouts  such  as  "Lola  Versus,"  "To  Rome  With  Love"  and  2012's  "Frances  Ha,"  which  earned  the  actress  a  Golden  Globe  nomination.  According  to  Deadline  Hollywood,  the  creative  team  behind  "HIMYD"  was  so  intent  on  landing  Gerwig  that  "the  studio  is  willing  to  move  production  of  the  series  to  New  York  for  her  after  the  pilot,  which  will  be  shot  in  Los  Angeles."Gerwig  will  also  serve  as  a  producer  on  the  comedy  and  is  expected  to  pitch  in  with  writing  if  the  show  is  picked  up  as  a  series.CBS'  "How  I  Met  Your  Mother"  will  air  its  series  finale  on  March  31.</TEXT></DOC>

Though  doctors  had  pronounced  her  brain  dead  and  her  family  had  said  she  did  not  want  to  have  machines  keep  her  body  alive,  officials  at  John  Peter  Smith  Hospital  in  Fort  Worth  had  said  state  law  required  them  to  maintain  life-sustaining  treatment  for  a  pregnant  patient.Attorneys:  Fetus  was  'distinctly  abnormal'Sunday's  announcement  came  two  days  after  a  judge  in  Fort  Worth  ordered  the  hospital  to  remove  any  artificial  means  of  life  support  from  Munoz  by  5  p.m.  Monday.  Earlier  Sunday,  the  hospital  said  it  intended  to  comply  with  that  order."The  past  eight  weeks  have  been  difficult  for  the  Munoz  family,  the  caregivers  and  the  entire  Tarrant  County  community,  which  found  itself  involved  in  a  sad  situation,"  a  hospital  statement  said.  "JPS  Health  Network  has  followed  what  we  believed  were  the  demands  of  a  state  statute."The  hospital  acknowledged  Friday  that  Munoz,  33,  had  been  brain  dead  since  November  28  and  that  the  fetus  she  carried  was  not  viable.  Her  husband,  Erick  Munoz,  had  argued  that  sustaining  her  body  artificially  amounted  to  "the  cruel  and  obscene  mutilation  of  a  deceased  body"  against  her  wishes  and  those  of  her  family.Marlise  Munoz  didn't  leave  any  written  directives  regarding  end-of-life  care,  but  her  husband  and  other  family  members  said  she  had  told  them  she  didn't  want  machines  to  keep  her  blood  pumping.The  ethics  of  life  supportIn  an  affidavit  filed  Thursday  in  court,  Erick  Munoz  said  little  to  him  was  recognizable  about  his  wife.  Her  bones  crack  when  her  stiff  limbs  move.  Her  usual  scent  has  been  replaced  by  the  "smell  of  death."  And  her  once  lively  eyes  have  become  "soulless."The  hospital's  position  drew  support  from  demonstrators  outside  the  hospital,  some  of  whom  held  signs  last  week  that  read  "God  stands  for  life"  and  "Praying  for  Baby  Munoz  and  family."  But  others  countered  with  placards  bearing  messages  like  "Let  Marlise  rest  in  peace"  and  "Respect  Marlise's  wishes."What  no  one  wants  to  talk  about</TEXT></DOC>

A  Harvard  medical  student  offers  a  "wish  list"  for  our  next  top  doc.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Nathaniel  P.  Morris  is  a  student  at  Harvard  Medical  School.  Follow  him  on  Twitter.(CNN)  --  Dr.  Vivek  Murthy,  the  Obama  administration's  nominee  for  surgeon  general,  will  visit  the  U.S.  Capitol  on  Tuesday  for  his  Senate  confirmation  hearing.Many  may  not  even  know  we  need  to  appoint  someone  to  the  position,  but  they  shouldn't  fret.  They're  not  alone.  The  role  of  "America's  doctor"  has  declined  over  the  last  several  decades  to  near-irrelevance.At  a  time  when  Americans  have  fallen  behind  on  key  health  metrics  across  the  board,  the  nation's  leading  spokesman  for  public  health  has  less  influence  than  ever  before.  The  office  has  endured  everything  from  political  interference  to  undersized  budgets,  making  it  impossible  to  carry  out  the  job  effectively.Have  you  ever  heard  of  Boris  Lushniak?  How  about  Regina  Benjamin?  The  recent  surgeons  general  aren't  exactly  household  names.  But  with  each  changing  of  the  guard,  we  can  --  and  should  --  hope  for  a  leader  who  revitalizes  the  post.Perhaps  Murthy  might  do  just  that.  At  36  when  nominated,  he  stands  to  be  the  youngest  surgeon  general  ever  appointed.  He's  already  accomplished  quite  a  bit,  from  co-founding  a  clinical  trial  operations  company  to  helping  start  Doctors  for  America,  a  national  health  care  advocacy  group.Some  observers,  including  myself,  have  raised  concerns  about  his  partisan  ties  to  the  Obama  administration.  Still,  if  confirmed,  Murthy  should  do  everything  he  can  to  strengthen  the  impact  of  the  office.In  November,  right  after  Murthy's  nomination,  I  published  four  initiatives  in  JAMA  Internal  Medicine  for  the  next  surgeon  general  to  pursue.These  recommendations  do  not  come  close  to  addressing  all  of  our  health  needs,  but  they  have  the  potential  to  restore  the  profile  of  the  surgeon  general  and  improve  our  public  health:Help  Americans  understand  health  care  systemWe  haven't  stopped  arguing  about  the  Affordable  Care  Act.  Yet  countless  surveys  show  that  most  Americans  don't  understand  the  legislation,  let  alone  the  health  care  system  at  all.As  recently  as  last  month,  more  than  30%  of  Americans  surveyed  still  weren't  familiar  with  the  law.  "Jimmy  Kimmel  Live"  shamed  people  on  the  sidewalk  for  thinking  Obamacare  and  the  Affordable  Care  Act  were  different.  And,  whether  it's  insurance  terms  or  broader  trends  in  health  care  costs,  the  public  doesn't  seem  to  have  a  clue  what's  going  on.That's  where  the  surgeon  general  comes  in.  Americans  need  a  public  figure  who  can  transcend  the  partisan  fray  to  explain  the  intricacies  of  health  care.  A  national  tour  is  in  order.  Nonetheless,  whether  on  television  or  Facebook,  the  surgeon  general  could  spread  awareness  about  navigating  health  care:  a  system  that  functions  best  when  its  patients  are  informed.Surgeon  general  links  colon  cancer,  diabetes  to  smokingChange  the  way  we  look  at  obesityObesity  remains  one  of  the  greatest  threats  to  American  health,  but  our  attitudes  toward  this  issue  are  profoundly  lopsided.  In  our  culture,  being  overweight  represents  a  failure  of  will  power,  a  tendency  toward  sloth.  Public  health  campaigns  point  to  personal  responsibility  as  the  answer  to  this  crisis.  If  we  would  just  get  off  the  couch  and  eat  healthier,  everything  would  be  solved.It's  time  we  re-evaluate  how  we  look  at  and  tackle  obesity.  Rather  than  narrowly  concentrating  on  notions  such  as  individual  will  power,  we  must  address  the  systemic  causes  of  obesity  --  fast-food  advertising  to  children,  federal  legislation  that  subsidizes  processed  foods  and  undeveloped  food  tax  policies,  among  others.Organizations  such  as  the  Institute  of  Medicine  have  already  shifted  their  focus  toward  these  kinds  of  structural  determinants.  By  translating  the  message  to  the  public,  the  surgeon  general  can  lead  the  charge.Is  obesity  the  next  smoking?Stand  up  for  vaccinesEnough  is  enough.  Though  dozens  of  peer-reviewed  studies  have  refuted  the  extreme  claims  of  the  anti-vaccination  movement,  the  idea  that  vaccines  are  inherently  dangerous  somehow  persists.States  such  as  Oregon  and  Colorado  have  seen  thousands  of  parents  exempt  their  children  from  immunizations.  Katie  Couric  ran  a  national  television  program  stoking  fears  about  the  safety  of  human  papillomavirus  vaccines.  Last  year,  congressional  representatives  introduced  the  Vaccine  Safety  Study  Act  to  evaluate  whether  vaccines  cause  autism  --  apparently,  it's  a  bipartisan  issue  now.Americans  have  to  understand  the  science  is  clear.  Vaccines  are  among  the  most  powerful  public  health  tools  in  the  history  of  human  medicine.  Without  them,  we  expose  others  and  ourselves  to  terrible,  needless  suffering.  The  surgeon  general  should  release  a  report  defending  the  facts  and  get  the  message  out.Give  an  annual  'State  of  American  Health'  update  to  CongressOur  leaders  in  government  --  and  the  broader  public  --  need  to  keep  abreast  of  the  most  pressing  health  issues  of  the  day.  But  we  don't  have  a  unified  approach  to  fulfill  that  goal.  The  surgeon  general  should  introduce  an  annual  "State  of  American  Health"  report,  with  testimony  to  Congress.This  yearly  update  could  highlight  recent  scientific  findings  to  results  from  prior  initiatives,  specific  policy  proposals  to  expectations  for  the  months  ahead.  The  report  should  be  a  nonpartisan,  independent  analysis  of  the  nation's  health.  With  this  platform,  the  surgeon  general  should  remind  us  that  our  prosperity  depends  not  only  on  economic  policy  and  national  security  but  also  public  health.Whether  or  not  the  next  surgeon  general  follows  these  recommendations,  one  thing  is  obvious:  Americans  have  become  older,  fatter  and  sicker,  yet  the  nation's  doctor  has  disappeared.The  brand  of  the  surgeon  general  remains  intact,  and  Americans  trust  this  figure  for  guidance.  But  we  need  an  outspoken,  independent  leader  to  bring  public  health  to  the  forefront  of  our  national  conversation.Dr.  Murthy,  are  you  up  for  the  job?The  opinions  expressed  are  solely  those  of  Nathaniel  P.  Morris.</TEXT></DOC>

Darrell  Issa  was  justified  in  ending  an  acrimonious  hearing  on  IRS  targeting  of  conservative  groups  --  a  meeting  concluded  when  Issa  cut  the  hearing  room  microphones  with  his  harshest  critic  on  the  panel,  Rep.  Elijah  Cummings,  in  mid  sentence."From  what  I  understand,  I  think  Mr.  Issa  was  in  his  rights  to  adjourn  the  hearing,"  Boehner  told  reporters  on  Thursday.The  Congressional  Black  Caucus  wants  Issa  removed  as  House  Oversight  Committee  chairman  following  Wednesday's  uproar,  which  it  sees  as  the  latest  in  a  series  of  disrespectful  responses  to  pushback  from  Democrats  during  hearings  on  the  IRS  matter.The  group  offered  a  resolution  on  Thursday."Chairman  Issa's  abusive  behavior  on  March  5th  is  part  of  a  continuing  pattern  in  which  he  has  routinely  excluded  members  of  the  committee  from  investigative  meetings  and  has  routinely  provided  information  to  the  press  before  sharing  it  with  committee  members,"  Congressional  Black  Caucus  Chairman  Rep.  Marcia  Fudge  said.The  organization  also  sent  Boehner  a  letter."The  abuse  of  authority  and  misuse  of  the  congressional  privileges  afforded  them  are  an  affront  to  the  expectations  of  the  American  public.  Congressman  Darrell  Issa  of  California  abused  his  authority  and  therefore  must  be  reprimanded  to  ensure  the  dignity  of  the  House  of  Representatives  is  preserved,"  Fudge,  an  Ohio  Democrat,  wrote."We  urge  you  to  take  prompt  action  to  maintain  the  integrity  of  this  body  and  remove  Mr.  Issa  as  chair  of  the  Oversight  &  Government  Reform  Committee  immediately,"  the  letter  continued.Tensions  are  strained  between  Democrats  and  Republicans  as  the  two  sides  continue  to  probe  whether  the  IRS  intentionally  targeted  conservative  groups  seeking  tax  exempt  status.The  issue  flared  anew  this  week  following  a  series  of  hearings  last  year  around  the  oversight  panel's  investigation.Issa:  GOP-led  IRS  targeting  probe  may  be  at  'dead  end'Republicans  see  former  IRS  official  Lois  Lerner's  decision  to  invoke  her  constitutional  rights  not  to  testify  at  hearings  as  obstructionist.Democrats  believe  their  GOP  colleagues  are  trying  to  squeeze  any  kind  of  political  capital  they  can  out  of  an  embarrassing  episode  for  the  Obama  administration  in  a  midterm  election  year.Those  frustrations  boiled  over  on  Wednesday  when  Issa  refused  to  take  Cummings'  statement  and  muted  his  microphone  when  he  protested  an  early  end  to  the  hearing  during  which  Lerner  again  refused  to  testify.Cummings,  a  Maryland  Democrat,  says  he  knows  a  thing  or  two  about  respect."Let  me  tell  you  something.  I've  been  practicing  law  for  30,  40  years.  And,  so  you  see  these  kind  of  things,"  Cummings  said  after  the  hearing  Wednesday.  "But  the  thing  that  we  are  determined  is  not  to  be  detracted,  to  get  to  the  truth.  And  so  I  see  it  as  a  distraction.  I  don't  worry  about  disrespect,  okay?"On  Thursday,  Cummings  elaborated  on  why  he  felt  Issa's  actions  were  troubling."This  is  not  the  first  time  chairman  Issa  has  shut  mics  down.  You  can't  shut  out  the  minority  voice,"  Cummings  said.  "He  shut  me  down  because  he  didn't  want  to  hear  what  I  was  saying  or  what  he  thought  what  I  was  saying.  That's  un-American."Other  Democratic  lawmakers  were  similarly  upset."What  happened  was  so  outrageous,  so  demeaning,  so  unjudicial,  so  awful  in  every  respect,  that  we  just  absolutely  have  actually  reached  the  boiling  point,"  said  Rep.  Louis  Slaughter  or  New  York  and  the  top  Democrat  on  the  Rules  Committee.Issa  defended  his  actions."He  was  talking  into  a  mic  in  an  adjourned  meeting.  The  fact  is  Mr.  Cummings  came  to  make  a  point  of  his  objections  to  the  process  we'd  been  going  through.  He  was,  he  was  actually  slandering  me  at  the  moment  that  the  mics  did  go  off  by  claiming  that  this  had  not  been  a  real  investigation,"  Issa  said  Wednesday."This  had  been  a  bipartisan  investigation  by  multiple  committees  in  which  we  had  testimony  in  multiple  hearings  ...  in  which  it  was  very  clear  there  was  targeting  of  conservative  groups  in  which  there  were  people  who  were  acting  outside  the  norm.  We're  going  to  continue  our  investigation.  But  just  because  Mr.  Cummings  would  like  to  have  a  more  convenient  truth  doesn't  give  him  the  right  to  make  a  speech."Issa  has  also  indicated  that  the  probe  may  be  approaching  a  "dead  end"  after  nearly  a  year."It  may  well  be  that  we  have  gotten  to  the  bottom  of  it,"  Issa  said.Such  uncertainty  raises  questions  about  whether  Republicans  who  have  alleged  the  targeting  order  came  from  political  higher-ups,  even  the  White  House,  can  win  a  legal  battle  to  compel  Lerner  to  provide  testimony.Lisa  Desjardins  and  Tom  Cohen  contributed  to  this  report</TEXT></DOC>

But  they  drag  their  feet,  sometimes  for  years,  when  it  comes  to  purchasing  another  piece  of  technology  that  could  greatly  improve  their  lives:  hearing  aids.Hearing-aid  manufacturers  and  audiologists  hope  a  new  collaboration  between  them  and  Apple  will  help.Apple  and  Danish  hearing-aid  company  GN  ReSound  last  week  announced  a  new  hearing  aid  that's  compatible  with  the  iPhone,  iPad  and  iPod  Touch.  Called  LiNX,  the  device  syncs  wirelessly  with  the  newest  Apple  mobile  devices  and  takes  advantage  of  iOS  7's  new  accessibility  options  for  the  hearing-impaired.At  its  most  basic  level,  the  LiNX  acts  like  a  hybrid  of  hearing  aids  and  stereo  Bluetooth  headphones.  Phone  calls,  FaceTime  chats,  music,  movies,  turn-by-turn  navigation  or  other  audio  can  be  streamed  directly  to  a  small  earpiece.  When  they're  not  pulling  in  audio  from  a  smartphone  or  tablet,  the  hearing  aids  work  like  normal,  picking  up  in-person  conversations  and  surrounding  sounds.This  being  Apple,  there  are  plenty  of  bells  and  whistles  packed  in.  A  feature  called  Live  Listen  turns  an  iOS  device  into  microphone.  If  someone's  in  a  loud  environment  --  a  busy  meeting,  a  sporting  event,  a  noisy  car  --  and  wants  to  focus  on  one  person's  voice  and  cut  down  on  background  noise,  they  can  get  a  stream  directly  from  the  smartphone's  mic  to  their  ears.  (This  feature  has  the  potential  for  some  fun  eavesdropping  mischief.)Using  GPS,  you  can  save  custom  settings  for  a  specific  location,  say  a  movie  theater  or  your  cubicle  at  work,  and  get  a  pop-up  notification  on  your  mobile  device  asking  whether  you'd  like  to  switch  every  time  you  return  to  that  spot.  Don't  remember  where  you  left  your  hearing  aids?  Use  a  phone  or  tablet  to  locate  them.Apple  and  the  device's  makers  hope  it  will  encourage  more  people  with  hearing  loss  to  get  help  earlier."Right  now,  people  wait  about  eight  years  on  average  between  the  time  they  think  they  have  a  hearing  problem  and  when  they  see  someone  about  it,"  said  audiologist  Dr.  Ken  Smith.More  than  36  million  people  in  the  U.S.  have  some  hearing  loss,  according  to  the  National  Institute  on  Deafness  and  Other  Communication  Disorders,  but  only  one  out  of  five  people  who  need  a  hearing  aid  actually  have  one.Smith  attributes  this  gap  to  antiquated  stereotypes  of  hearing  aids.  People  still  picture  the  hardware  as  it  was  many  years  ago:  large  and  obvious,  making  embarrassing  whistling  and  beeping  sounds,  and  ineffective  at  filtering  out  background  noise.But  today's  models  are  quieter,  discreet  and  more  effective.  And  sprinkling  a  bit  of  Apple's  magic  on  the  devices  could  help  decrease  the  stigma  of  wearing  them."The  association  with  Apple  is  going  to  make  a  great  difference  in  getting  people  in  the  door  in  the  first  place,"  Smith  said.Even  the  most  advanced  current  hearing  aids  can  still  draw  unwanted  attention  when  wearers  must  reach  to  change  the  settings.  For  many  hearing-impaired  people,  the  biggest  advantage  of  Apple-ized  hearing  aids  is  being  able  to  control  the  devices'  settings  directly  from  a  phone.With  Apple  integration,  wearers  can  make  adjustments  as  easily  as  they  can  check  e-mail  or  watch  a  video.  Basic  settings  like  battery  life  and  volume  are  built  directly  into  the  iOS  7  operating  system.  More  advanced  settings  such  as  treble  and  bass  can  be  set  using  the  more  complicated  ReSound  app.It's  been  possible  for  people  to  operate  their  hearing  aids  via  custom  remote  controls  and  even  link  them  to  smartphones,  but  that  has  required  an  intermediary  piece  of  hardware,  most  often  a  small,  clunky  box  worn  around  the  neck.  Now,  using  a  combination  of  Bluetooth  and  a  proprietary  Apple  protocol,  the  LiNX  hearing  aids  can  communicate  directly  with  Apple  mobile  devices.Flashy  features  aside,  just  being  able  to  make  calls  on  a  smartphone  is  a  big  step."Cell  phone  calls  are  something  that  are  very  difficult  for  hearing  aids  to  do,"  said  Laurel  Christensen,  chief  audiologist  at  ReSound,  who  helped  develop  the  device.Smith,  who  is  hearing-impaired  himself  and  was  part  of  an  early  test  group  using  the  hearing  aids,  said  he  used  to  avoid  talking  on  his  smartphone.  When  he  did  take  a  call,  he  would  push  the  volume  up  on  his  phone  and  then  place  the  receiver  above  his  hearing  aid,  searching  for  the  elusive  sweet  spot  where  he  could  best  hear  the  caller.  Now,  he  says,  he  actually  prefers  that  people  call  him  on  his  cell.The  hearing  aids  are  still  specialized  medical  devices,  meaning  you  won't  find  them  on  the  shelves  of  your  local  Apple  store.  Customers  must  have  their  hearing  tested  and  get  fitted  for  the  devices  by  an  audiologist.And  they're  not  cheap:  A  single  LiNX  hearing  aid  can  cost  about  $3,000.Apple  added  support  for  the  new  technology  when  it  released  iOS  7  last  year,  but  these  are  the  first  hearing  aids  to  actually  work  with  many  of  the  system's  accessibility  features.  Because  of  the  specialized  technology,  a  third-party  hearing-aid  maker  can't  just  jump  in  and  create  devices  that  work  with  iOS  without  partnering  directly  with  Apple.ReSound  executives  have  not  revealed  whether  they  are  developing  hearing  aids  for  Android  devices  or  other  platforms.ReSound  worked  on  this  specific  technology  for  almost  two  years,  so  other  companies  might  have  some  catching  up  to  do.  However  long  it  takes,  this  marriage  of  medical  and  consumer  technology  is  the  first  step  into  a  welcome  future  for  hearing-impaired  people."This  is  the  first  generation,  but  there's  no  doubt  that  what  we  can  do  by  marrying  a  phone  and  a  hearing  aid  will  explode,"  Christensen  said.</TEXT></DOC>

One  day,  the  material  could  help  repair  all  types  of  human  tissue,  including  diseased  hearts  and  broken  spines.  Find  out  how.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Oxford,  UK  (CNN)  --  If  you  ever  try  your  hand  at  farming  spiders,  you'll  very  soon  discover  it's  no  easy  task.Penning  in  a  bunch  of  golden  orb  weavers  --  the  queens  of  the  web-spinning  world  --  will  earn  you  only  a  few  milligrams  of  ultra-tough  spider's  silk.That's  if  they  don't  eat  each  other  first,  explains  Dr.  Nick  Skaer.  And  they  will.Bug  catcherAs  a  boy,  Dr  Skaer  loved  hunting  for  creepy  crawlies  --  but  was  never  a  fan  of  spiders.Today,  Skaer's  day-job  involves  persuading  people  to  implant  the  creatures'  silky  secretions  under  their  skin  --  with  the  promise  that  the  fiber  will  weave  together  damaged  tissue.It's  a  "quantum  leap,"  admits  Dr  Skaer,  but  his  creation  could  one  day  relieve  agony  for  millions.Watch  the  video  above  to  see  how  the  Dr  Skaer  created  the  FibroFix  implant.Thread  of  lifeSkaer,  now  the  CEO  of  biomaterials  producers  Orthox  explains  that  silk  produced  by  spiders  is  not  just  naturally  tough  --  25  times  the  strength  of  steel  --  it  is  also  "biocompatible."The  close  similarity  between  molecules  in  the  spider  silk  and  proteins  in  the  human  body  means  human  cells  can  grow  into  the  fiber.When  implanted  in  the  human  body,  a  device  made  from  spiders  silk  would  encourage  the  surrounding  cells  to  "repopulate  the  device  with  actual  human  living  tissue,"  Skaer  says."If  you've  got  a  very  strong,  resilient  material  which  also  has  a  lot  of  similarities  to  tissues  in  the  human  body,  it's  a  great  place  to  start  for  trying  to  make  a  medical  implant."Watch:  'The  night  I  invented  3D  printing'Saved  by  the  silkwormInstead  of  fighting  the  spider's  cannibal  instinct,  and  meager  rate  of  production,  Skaer's  team  set  about  creating  fake  spider's  silk  --  made  from  the  same  fibers  that  go  into  high  class  scarves.The  team  took  silkworms,  which  produce  1000  times  as  much  silk  as  a  spider,  and  broke  it  down  to  the  basic  molecules.Re-spinning  this  so  that  all  the  proteins  are  closely  aligned  --  just  how  a  spider  does  --  creates  a  far  stronger  fiber  than  the  silkworm  can.Or  --  when  Skaer  presents  their  finished  product  --  a  rubber-looking  crescent-shaped  implant.Friends  in  kneesThe  FibroFix  implant  is  soon  destined  for  knee  joints,  where  Skaer  believes  it  can  help  people  with  damaged  cartilage  to  regrow  the  shock-absorbing  tissue.Without  this  implant,  millions  of  people  have  no  option  but  to  resort  to  total  knee  replacement  surgery.As  of  2010,  over  600,000  total  knee  replacements  are  performed  annually  in  the  United  States  alone,  and  estimates  suggest  that  this  figure  will  increase  6-fold  by  2030.This  marks  a  $13  billion-per-year  cost  for  Americans,  which  is  set  to  rise  as  the  ageing  Baby  Boomer  generation  battle  age-related  conditions  such  as  osteoarthritis,  but  demand  to  stay  active.The  first  round  of  trialists  are  set  to  start  receiving  FibroFix  implants  this  year,  and  Skaer  hopes  they  will  pave  the  way  for  others  to  avoid  knee  replacement:"If  the  clinical  trials  go  well,  we  hope  to  have  this  available  for  patients  within  the  next  two  to  three  years."Read:  The  coolest  things  technology  has  up  its  sleeve  in  2014Beyond  the  kneeSkaer  sees  future  applications  in  other  joints  --  "the  hip,  the  shoulder,  ankle,  all  of  these  suffer  osteoarthritis"  --  as  well  as  in  the  cartilage  discs  between  the  bones  in  the  spine.It  doesn't  stop  there,  either:"If  you've  got  a  technology  that  integrates  very  well  with  the  body  --  which  allows  cells  to  grow  down  into  it  --  then  bones  and  joints  certainly  aren't  the  only  tissues  in  the  body  that  you  could  look  to  address."In  the  long  term,  Skaer  imagines  silk  platforms  being  used  to  patch  up  intestines,  hernias,  and  muscles  --  including  in  the  heart.There's  even  the  suggestion  that  --  one  day  --  it  could  fix  a  severed  spine:"Is  there  the  potential  for  nerve  repair?  Well,  the  chaps  [research  scientists]  at  Oxford  University  have  certainly  started  looking  at  nerve  repair  as  an  interesting  further  application  of  this  technology.

We  take  a  look  through  some  of  the  most  ground-breaking  developments  of  the  year  ahead.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  From  wearable  technology  to  space  tourism,  2014  will  be  a  year  of  significant  technological  leaps.  We  take  a  look  through  some  of  the  most  ground-breaking  developments  of  the  year  ahead.Electric  cars  take  to  the  trackAs  the  name  suggests,  Formula  E  is  all  about  electric  power.  The  arrival  of  this  new  petrol-free  motor  racing  competition  is  a  significant  step  for  both  the  car  and  the  environment.  Two  years  ago  motorsport's  international  governing  body,  the  Federation  Internationale  de  l'Automobile  (FIA),  announced  its  ambitious  plan  for  an  electric  car  race  that  would  mimic  the  hugely  popular  F1  series.  As  the  arrival  of  Formula  E  looms,  experts  predict  that  it  could  have  a  big  impact  on  the  future  of  car  manufacturing.Initially,  the  cars  in  the  competition  will  be  powered  by  enormous  battery  engines.  Each  battery  weighs  200  kilograms,  producing  around  200  kilowatts  of  power.  Depending  on  the  speed,  the  electric  engines  will  last  anywhere  from  a  few  hours  to  just  25  minutes  and  the  cars  can  reach  speeds  of  up  to  220  kilometers  per  hour."If  you  look  in  the  past,  a  lot  of  development  in  the  car  industry  has  come  from  racing,"  said  Formula  E  CEO  Alejandro  Agag.  "The  transfer  of  technology  is  potentially  very  big."Space  tourism  blasts  offAfter  a  number  of  false  starts  and  delays,  Virgin  Galactic  is  finally  poised  to  lift  off  in  2014.  Billionaire  Richard  Branson's  planned  commercial  spacecraft  underwent  a  successful  test  flight  last  year  over  California,  making  a  commercial  launch  this  year  a  distinct  possibility.In  September  2013,  Branson's  Virgin  Galactic  said  SpaceShipTwo  completed  an  important  test,  breaking  the  sound  barrier  as  it  climbed  from  42,000  feet  to  69,000  feet  over  the  Mojave  Desert  before  descended  using  its  tilt-wing  "feathering"  maneuver.  It  was  the  second  successful  powered  flight  for  SpaceShipTwo  --  a  craft  designed  to  carry  up  to  six  passengers.Initially,  Virgin  Galactic  flights  are  scheduled  to  be  suborbital,  but  the  hope  is  to  take  passengers  further  into  space  as  the  technology  is  refined.  Already,  a  host  of  famous  names  have  signed  up  to  head  into  near  orbit  including  Katy  Perry,  Stephen  Hawking  and  Ashton  Kutcher."We  couldn't  be  more  delighted  to  have  another  major  supersonic  milestone  under  our  belts  as  we  move  toward  a  2014  start  of  commercial  service,"  said  Branson  after  the  test  flight  last  year.Wind  power  blows  strongerAs  scientists  look  to  find  alternatives  to  traditional  fossil  fuels,  a  number  of  major  projects,  including  Cape  Wind  (in  Massachusetts'  Nantucket  Sound)  and  Deepwater  Wind  (near  Block  Island,  Rhode  Island),  are  vying  to  become  the  first  offshore  windfarm  in  the  U.S.Alongside  power  from  volcanoes,  waves,  biomass  and  the  sun,  wind  power  is  set  to  become  a  significant  alternative  energy  source  in  2014.Are  we  finally  heading  to  Mars?A  new  type  of  engine,  called  the  VASIMR  (or  Variable  Specific  Impulse  Magnetoplasma  Rocket)  will  be  tested  in  space  in  March.  If  successful  it  is  estimated  that  it  could  reduce  the  time  it  takes  to  get  to  Mars  from  nine  months  to  just  three  months.  The  technology  --  an  "advanced  plasma  space  propulsion  system"  --  will  be  tested  by  NASA  on  the  International  Space  Station,  taking  the  prospect  of  interplanetary  exploration  one  step  closer.Synthetic  biology  begins  to  growMarcus  Fairs,  the  editor  of  dezeen.com,  a  highly  influential  online  design  magazine,  says  that  in  his  view  2014's  most  significant  emerging  technologies  will  be  in  the  field  of  synthetic  biology."This  emerging  field  started  to  hit  the  headlines  at  the  end  of  last  year  and  will  be  huge  in  2014,"  Fairs  say.  "It  involves  the  creation  of  new  types  of  artificial  life  forms  that  perform  useful  functions.  At  the  smallest  scale  it  could  mean  man-made  microbes  that  live  inside  your  body  and  detect  illness;  at  the  largest  scale  it  could  mean  synthetic  creatures  that  are  released  into  the  wild  to  clean  up  pollution  or  attack  parasitic  species."Wearable  technology  is  on  trendWearable  technology  fired  some  preliminary  warning  shots  in  2013  with  the  release  of  the  Samsung  Galaxy  Gear  and  Pebble  smartwatches,  but  this  year  will  see  the  arrival  of  a  selection  of  truly  innovative  wearable  devices.  Most  notably,  Google  Glass  is  expected  to  launch  this  year,  offering  head-mounted  computing  that  could,  ultimately,  make  smartwatches  and  mobile  phones  a  thing  of  the  past.Alongside  Google's  new  high-tech  glasses,  Fairs  says  that  in  2014  "technology  will  migrate  onto  the  body  as  digital  services  are  miniaturized  and  embedded  in  our  clothing  or  worn  against  our  skin.  We  already  have  Google  Glass  and  wearable  fitness  trackers,  but  a  vast  array  of  services  --  from  health  monitoring  to  augmented  information  (telling  you  what's  around  you  and  helping  you  navigate)  will  become  commonplace."Fairs  points  to  clothing  with  in-built  solar  panels,  devices  that  scan  your  body  for  disease,  and  self-repairing  trainers  as  some  of  the  more  exciting  wearable  technologies  on  the  near  horizon.Tim  Meyer,  Head  of  Strategic  Planning  and  Communications  at  TRIUMF,  Canada's  national  laboratory  for  particle  and  nuclear  physics,  agrees.  "This  year's  Las  Vegas  CES  show  is  revealing  new  wearable  technology,  but  what  we're  going  to  see  this  year  is  the  development  and  test-marketing  of  smart  clothing,  not  just  smart  gadgets,"  Meyer  says.  "New  fibers,  new  micro-sensors,  and  new  communications  protocols  will  allow  your  clothes  to  actually  work  for  you  and  collect  and  process  information.  I  suspect  we'll  see  some  fashion  statements  first:  clothes  that  change  shape  or  color.  Then  we'll  see  clothes  that  do  computing;  first  step  will  be  storing  information.  My  socks  will  store  today's  to-do  list."Dark  matterMeyer  also  believes  that  2014  will  be  a  significant  year  for  physics,  particularly  in  the  search  for  dark  matter:  "Dark  matter  is  being  searched  for  in  everyone's  sock  drawer  as  well  as  deep  underground  and  with  satellites.  The  underground  experiments  are  likely  to  find  something  before  the  Large  Hadron  Collider  turns  back  on  to  try  "making"  it.  We  could  see  a  conclusive  discovery  of  weakly  interacting,  massive  dark  matter  particles  this  year.  That  will  blow  your  mind."Crowd-funding  comes  of  ageMid-way  through  2014  new  laws  (known  as  the  JOBS  act)  will  allow  anybody  to  buy  equity  in  start-ups  through  new  online  crowd-funding  marketplaces.  This  will  make  it  almost  as  easy  for  individuals  to  fund  new  technology  ventures  as  it  currently  is  to  support  a  Kickstarter  project,  bringing  a  flood  of  new  capital  to  fledgling  tech  companies.  "The  ability  to  aggregate  a  bunch  of  individuals  around  a  common  funding  goal  is  absolutely  game  changing,"  Vince  Molinari,  founder  and  chief  executive  of  GATE  Technologies,  an  online  trading  company  said.With  these  new  laws  in  place,  the  rapid  technology  developments  of  2014  may  be  dwarfed  by  innovations  in  2015  and  beyond.

It's  her  18-year-old  daughter,  Daniela  Lakosilova,  who  has  battled  acute  lymphoblastic  leukemia  for  seven  years.Radka  and  her  husband,  Petr  Lakosil,  who  donated  his  stem  cells  for  Daniela's  2009  transplant,  have  been  there  for  every  doctor's  appointment,  surgery  and  treatment.They  were  there  when  she  relapsed  and  her  boyfriend  broke  up  with  her  because  it  was  too  much  for  him  to  handle.  They  were  there  to  make  sure  her  dress  fit  perfectly  for  the  homecoming  dance,  despite  her  fluctuating  weight."Being  a  cancer  caregiver  to  someone  you  love  so  much  is  the  hardest  thing,"  Radka  said.  "Not  being  able  to  make  the  pain  go  away  --  the  nausea,  the  emotions,  the  stress.  ..."Radka  said  she  does  her  best  to  wear  a  brave  face  for  Daniela  and  Petr,  the  "softy"  of  the  family,  but  in  at  least  two  places,  she's  only  human."I  cry  in  the  shower  or  when  I'm  driving  alone,"  she  said.  "One  parent  has  to  be  the  tough  one."  Though,  she  added,  tough  is  relative  when  your  daughter  is  a  fighter.Young  caregivers  put  life  on  holdFor  some  patients,  support  groups  are  an  important  addition  to  treatment,  creating  an  environment  where  they  can  talk  about  their  shared  concerns,  receive  emotional  support  and  learn  coping  skills.  The  same  is  true  for  caregivers.Radka  is  among  the  estimated  65  million  unpaid  caregivers  in  the  United  States  who  assist  a  chronically  ill,  disabled  or  aging  loved  one,  according  to  a  2009  study  conducted  by  the  National  Alliance  for  Caregiving  and  AARP.Being  a  caregiver  can  take  a  physical  and  emotional  toll  whether  someone  considers  it  a  personal  responsibility,  feels  pressure  to  assume  the  role,  or  can't  afford  to  pay  for  long-term  care.  Reports  also  state  that  caregivers,  the  majority  of  whom  are  women  in  their  late  40s,  are  more  likely  than  noncaregivers  to  live  in  poverty  and  experience  poor  mental  health.A  number  of  organizations,  such  as  AARP,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Veterans  and  the  American  Cancer  Society,  offer  support  programs  for  caregivers  of  all  kinds,  providing  tips  and  connecting  them  through  online  communities.Radka  found  an  outlet  on  Facebook,  frequenting  groups  created  by  and  for  parents  who  have  a  child  battling  cancer.  They've  given  her  a  place  to  ask  questions  and  share  what  she  learned  caring  for  Daniela,  like  the  fact  that  Jolly  Ranchers  mask  the  metallic  saline  taste  brought  on  by  chemotherapy.But  a  message  thread  on  social  media  doesn't  always  suffice.  When  Daniela  was  diagnosed  at  12,  her  parents  had  to  decide  whether  she  should  go  through  radiation  treatment.  It  frustrated  them  that  her  doctors  couldn't  share  specific  examples  of  how  other  children  her  age  reacted  to  the  treatment."I  wanted  to  talk  to  other  parents  whose  kids  were  like  Daniela,"  Radka  said.  "What  did  they  do?  How  are  their  kids  now?"Cancer's  caregiver  crisis  of  controlJackie  Herigodt  knows  firsthand  how  important  it  is  to  have  someone  like  that  on  speed  dial.She  was  28  when  she  started  caring  for  her  mom,  who  died  of  lung  cancer  in  2004.  Throughout  her  mom's  cancer,  she  and  her  sister  wondered  if  they  were  making  the  right  decisions.  Developing  relationships  with  doctors  offered  peace  of  mind,  but  she  wanted  someone  to  tell  her,  "This  is  what  I  did."That  experience  is  what  led  her  to  Imerman  Angels.  The  Chicago-based  nonprofit  organization  connects  cancer  fighters,  survivors  and  caregivers  with  one  another  so  they  don't  have  to  face  cancer  alone.Founder  Jonny  Imerman,  who  was  recognized  as  a  CNN  Hero  in  2012,  said  one-on-one  relationships  allow  people  to  get  the  support  they  need  from  someone  who  knows  exactly  what  they're  going  through.The  idea  came  to  him  when  he  was  fighting  testicular  cancer  in  the  early  2000s.  He  had  the  support  of  his  family  and  friends,  but  he  wanted  to  talk  to  someone  who  had  gone  through  it  --  someone  who  survived.Herigodt  works  for  the  organization  as  a  cancer  support  specialist  and  outreach  coordinator,  matching  people  based  on  factors  such  as  diagnosis,  location  and  family  structure.  She  has  matched  herself  as  a  caregiver  mentor  three  times.The  first  time  was  about  six  months  ago  when  a  woman  caring  for  her  mom  called  from  the  United  Kingdom  looking  for  support.  "How  do  I  fix  this?"  she  asked.  Herigodt  remembers  asking  the  same  question  when  she  was  caring  for  her  mom."I  wasn't  ready  (to  talk  about  my  experiences)  at  first,"  Herigodt  said.  "It  can  be  awkward  as  an  employee  to  do  it,  but  it's  also  important  to  practice  what  you  preach."Great  Grams  inspires  teen  to  hunt  for  Alzheimer's  cureShe  also  made  a  match  for  Radka  Lakosilova  and  Daniela,  who's  now  in  remission  and  attending  classes  at  Triton  College  in  River  Grove,  Illinois.  They  were  paired  with  a  caregiver  and  her  son,  who  also  has  acute  lymphoblastic  leukemia.Lakosilova  said  she's  always  happy  to  answer  a  quick  question  or  be  a  good  listener  during  the  really  tough  times.  She  said  it's  therapeutic  for  her,  too,  talking  to  another  caregiver  about  her  daughter's  journey  --  especially  knowing  she  has  the  opportunity  to  help.It's  not  that  talking  to  noncaregivers  about  what  her  family  has  been  through  doesn't  have  the  same  effect.  She's  just  careful  not  to  make  anyone  feel  uncomfortable  by  offering  too  much  information,  as  both  she  and  Daniela  have  lost  touch  with  old  friends  over  the  past  seven  years.  They've  also  made  new  friends  for  life  through  support  groups  and  camps  for  people  with  cancer."A  while  ago  my  neighbor  and  I  were  talking,"  Lakosilova  said.  "She  said,  'Do  you  think  one  day  you'll  be  able  to  not  talk  about  cancer?'  She  didn't  mean  it  in  that  way.  She  was  just  asking.  I  hope  that  day  comes,  but  for  now,  this  is  my  life."Caregiver  lives  rerouted  yet  enriched  by  aging  parents</TEXT></DOC>

Police  saw  Jeezy  walking  out  the  back  of  the  townhouse,  and  the  rapper  allegedly  said  the  townhouse  was  his  girlfriend's  home.The  Journal-Constitution  said  Jenkins  refused  to  show  his  identification  or  give  his  name  and  instead  cursed  at  officers,  who  then  arrested  him.All  this  comes  less  than  three  weeks  after  Jeezy,  36,  turned  himself  after  the  alleged  incident  with  his  teenage  son.His  son  told  police  the  ordeal  started  at  an  Atlanta  apartment  in  September  2012  after  he  sent  a  text  message  to  his  father.According  to  the  son,  Jeezy  "walked  into  the  bathroom  where  he  was  and  slammed  his  head  against  the  sliding  shower  door,"  then  "picked  him  up  and  threw  him  into  the  wall  in  the  bedroom,"  a  police  report  said.When  the  teen  tried  to  run  downstairs  and  away,  he  was  blocked  by  his  father's  bodyguard,  the  report  said.Jeezy  then  "pulled  him  back  into  the  room,  threw  him  on  the  bed,  choked  him  and  stated,  'I'll  kill  you,"  the  son  told  police.  He  allegedly  threw  him  against  a  wall  and  onto  the  floor  before  kicking  him  in  the  head."The  juvenile  stated  his  father  stated  to  him  'I'll  put  a  bullet  in  your  head  right  now,'"  the  report  said.The  boy's  mother  called  police  two  days  later  when  her  son  returned  to  her  and  she  noticed  bruising  and  scratches  on  his  face,  the  police  report  said.A  grand  jury  warrant  was  issued  for  the  rapper,  who  faces  charges  of  battery,  terroristic  threats  and  false  imprisonment.Jeezy  turned  himself  in  to  authorities  January  3  and  was  released  on  a  $45,000  bond,  the  Fulton  County  Sheriff's  Office  said.CNN's  Dave  Alsup  and  Jane  Caffrey  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Withers  also  founded  the  Street  Medicine  Institute  to  bring  his  model  of  care  to  cities  across  the  world.Pittsburgh  (CNN)  --  People  ask  me  why  a  doctor  would  dress  like  a  homeless  person  and  make  house  calls  under  bridges.  I  say  enthusiastically,  "Why  not!?"  That's  just  what  I  did  in  1992  in  an  effort  to  take  my  medical  teaching  career  beyond  the  walls  of  the  hospital.Dressing  like  a  homeless  person  seemed  the  best  way  to  initially  enter  the  street  community,  which  I  sincerely  wanted  to  do.  I  had  come  to  a  point  where  I  needed  a  new  "classroom"  in  which  medical  students  could  fully  experience  the  reality  of  those  who  did  not  make  it  into  effective  medical  care.  We  needed  to  understand  how  health  care  is  shaped  by  the  real  life  experiences  of  those  who  struggle  with  difficult  circumstances.If  there  were  any  people  who  could  teach  us  those  lessons,  I  believed  it  would  be  the  people  who  were  living  under  the  bridges  of  Pittsburgh.Initially,  I  didn't  tell  the  hospital  (or  my  malpractice  carrier)  what  I  was  doing.  My  guide  was  a  formerly  homeless  expert,  Mike  Sallows.  Together,  we  made  house  calls  under  the  bridges,  along  the  riverbanks  and  in  the  abandoned  buildings  of  Pittsburgh.A  whole  new  world  opened  to  me.  The  depth  of  medical  need  I  saw  was  exceeded  only  by  the  hopelessness  of  the  people  I  came  to  know.  Each  person  became  inconveniently  real  to  me,  and  going  home  to  my  warm  bed  became  increasingly  difficult.  But  what  I  also  discovered  was  the  profound  satisfaction  of  bringing  care  directly  to  those  who  would  otherwise  have  none.  I  was  becoming  part  of  the  street  world.Another  realityIn  the  homeless  camps  and  in  the  alleys,  I  found  people  who  had  suffered  extremes  of  weather,  violence  and  prejudice.  Many  were  older,  confused  people;  some  were  war  veterans  holding  on  to  the  last  shreds  of  their  dignity;  others  were  simply  people  who  had  fallen  on  hard  times  and  lost  hope.  I  saw  hideous  leg  ulcers  and  cancers  that  were  untreated.  But  mostly  I  saw  human  beings  who  had  minimal  access  to  loving,  effective  services.The  street  homeless  live  in  another  reality.  It  is  often  brutal  and  short.  Health  issues  are  secondary  to  immediate  survival,  but  according  to  the  National  Coalition  for  the  Homeless,  the  average  life  expectancy  among  that  population  is  estimated  between  42  and  52  years,  compared  with  78  years  in  the  general  population.  This  essentially  makes  street  homelessness  one  of  the  most  fatal  conditions  in  the  United  States.As  I  watched  more  and  more  people  die  out  there,  these  numbers  became  a  very  real  experience.  Looking  in  from  the  streets,  I  saw  my  community  as  a  largely  hostile,  unforgiving  place.The  reaction  of  the  non-homeless  to  those  sleeping  on  the  streets  is  often  negative.  I  know  this  is  born  from  frustration,  but  I  believe  that  as  long  as  ignorance  and  fear  dictate  how  we  perceive  others,  we  have  little  hope  of  building  effective,  inclusive  solutions.  We  must  get  close  enough  to  know  each  other.I  am  also  convinced  that  by  "going  to  the  people,"  health  care  can  learn  to  engage  people  on  their  terms,  holistically  building  health  solutions  grounded  in  their  reality.  This  will  potentially  make  health  care  delivery  more  cost  effective  and  efficient  as  the  principles  of  "street  medicine"  are  applied  to  other  populations.  How  much  we  can  learn  from  those  who  are  left  out!A  model  for  Street  MedicineAs  word  of  our  work  spread  beyond  the  streets,  other  volunteers  and  students  joined  the  effort.  Operation  Safety  Net  was  officially  founded  under  the  Pittsburgh  Mercy  Health  System  in  1993.  According  to  the  group's  records,  as  of  2014,  more  than  10,000  homeless  individuals  have  been  reached  with  more  than  68,000  visits  to  the  street  homeless  of  Pittsburgh.  More  than  900  chronically  homeless  persons  have  achieved  housing  directly  through  Operation  Safety  Net  efforts.Significantly,  for  the  first  time,  the  medical  care  of  the  street  homeless  is  coordinated  within  the  entire  city.  Students  from  all  over  the  world  now  come  to  Pittsburgh  to  work  with  Operation  Safety  Net,  many  starting  street  medicine  programs  of  their  own  in  cities  such  as  Rochester,  New  York;  Detroit;  Santa  Barbara,  California;  Prague;  and  Ibadan,  Nigeria.In  2005,  after  extensive  global  networking,  the  first  International  Street  Medicine  Symposium  was  held  in  Pittsburgh.  Each  year,  a  different  city  hosts  the  meeting,  which  is  the  only  forum  for  pioneers  of  the  street  medicine  movement  to  meet  and  develop  this  new  field  of  medicine.At  the  2013  meeting  in  Boston,  200  enthusiastic  professionals  and  students  gathered  from  five  continents.  In  2009,  the  Street  Medicine  Institute  was  established  with  two  visions:  Every  person  in  the  world  who  remains  on  the  streets  will  have  direct  access  to  health  care,  and  every  medical  school  will  have  a  "classroom"  in  its  own  streets.  The  Street  Medicine  Institute  provides  consulting  services  to  assist  communities  that  seek  to  establish  new  street  medicine  programs  and  improve  the  care  of  their  own  street  homeless  populations.Under  the  umbrella  of  the  Street  Medicine  Institute,  there  are  now  more  than  40  street  medicine  programs  in  the  U.S.  and  more  than  90  programs  worldwide.  Increasingly,  we  are  finding  that  by  first  addressing  the  immediate  medical  needs  of  those  on  the  streets,  pathways  to  housing,  financial  stability  and  recovery  are  being  realized.We  believe  that  by  taking  care  of  our  own  fallen  citizens,  but  by  doing  it  within  a  global  vision,  we  reclaim  the  true  spirit  of  health  care  and  build  better  communities  for  ourselves.Donate  to  Operation  Safety  NetDonate  to  the  Street  Medicine  Institute</TEXT></DOC>

More  than  1.7  million  people  have  checked  out  the  video.Both  Hansen  and  the  wolf  appeared  on  "Jimmy  Kimmel  Live!"  on  Thursday  night.Hansen  said  the  video  created  a  bit  of  a  stir  in  the  Olympic  Village."Security  started  freaking  out,  because  technically  it  was  a  breach.  You  know,  athlete  safety,"  Hansen  told  Kimmel  via  Skype  from  Sochi.  "It  kind  of  went  a  little  crazy  here."By  the  way,  the  wolf  is  named  Rugby  and  he's  an  American  timberwolf  mix,  according  to  his  trainer  in  Los  Angeles.  Folks  online  were  speculating  that  he  was  possibly  a  husky  or  German  Shepherd  mix.This  isn't  the  first  time  Kimmel  has  pulled  the  wolf  over  our  eyes.Remember  the  twerking  stunt  back  in  September,  right  after  Miley  Cyrus  showed  us  her  moves  on  the  VMAsA  woman  who  was  twerking  upside  down  in  what  appeared  to  be  her  living  room  takes  a  tumble  when  surprised  by  her  roommate.  She  crashes  into  a  coffee  table,  knocks  over  some  candles  and  sets  her  pants  on  fire.Yes,  Kimmel  did  that  one  too.For  her  help  with  his  latest  stunt,  Kimmel  awarded  Hansen  a  gold  medal  for  pranking.  No  word  yet  on  what  Russian  officials  have  in  mind  for  her.After  fooling  millions  of  folks  on  TV  and  the  Internet  again,  maybe  it's  Kimmel  who's  the  wolf  --  in  sheep's  clothing.</TEXT></DOC>

The  police  department's  Internal  Affairs  Bureau  Investigated  the  incident  but  eventually  cleared  both  officers  of  wrongdoing,  according  to  Halevy's  lawyer,  Norman  Siegel.The  settlement  ends  the  lawsuit  Halevy  filed  against  the  city  in  January  2013.  In  addition  to  the  $100,000,  the  city  will  also  pay  Halevy's  attorney's  fees,  which  are  still  being  negotiated,  Siegel  said."This  civil  rights  action  was  brought  in  response  to  the  violent  acts  of  police  abuse  against  Mr.  Halevy  and  a  violation  of  his  civil  rights,"  Siegel  told  CNN.  "Hopefully,  this  horrific  action  by  NYPD  officers  will  never  happen  to  anyone  again."The  graphic  video  shows  a  bare-chested,  bearded  Halevy  talking  with  two  officers  --  one  of  them  a  woman  --  in  what  appears  to  be  a  game  room  containing  a  pool  table  and  two  couches.The  video  shows  the  officers  approaching  Halevy,  who  is  on  one  of  the  couches,  and  talking  to  him.  Moments  later,  he  stands  and  talks  with  the  officers,  gesticulating  with  his  arms  but  making  no  apparent  threat  toward  either  officer.  The  video  has  no  sound.When  the  officers  attempt  to  grab  him  by  his  arms,  Halevy  pulls  free  of  their  grasp.The  male  officer  crouches  into  a  boxing  stance  and  hits  the  victim  more  than  a  dozen  times,  striking  him  in  the  face,  the  back  of  his  head  and  his  torso.  Halevy  falls  back  into  a  couch,  where  he  raises  his  arms  in  an  apparent  attempt  to  deflect  the  blows,  but  at  no  point  does  it  appear  that  he  is  seeking  to  strike  either  officer.Later  in  the  video,  the  female  officer  can  be  seen  striking  Halevy  repeatedly  with  a  truncheon.More  than  three  minutes  into  the  video,  about  10  more  officers  enter  the  room,  where  they  cuff  Halevy's  wrists  behind  his  back  and  lead  him  out.According  to  a  spokesman  from  the  city  law  department,  the  "settlement  was  in  the  best  interest  of  all  parties."</TEXT></DOC>

Fishman  is  also  looking  into  the  bridge  matter,  bringing  the  total  number  of  investigations  to  four,  including  an  internal  review  by  Christie's  office.Christie  has  promised  cooperation  with  "appropriate"  investigations  of  the  matter,  which  could  harm  the  presidential  ambitions  of  the  early  frontrunner  for  the  Republican  nomination  in  2016.Can  Christie  change  the  subject?He  appeared  to  refer  to  the  scandal  when  he  told  a  Thursday  morning  event  involving  Superstorm  Sandy  recovery  efforts  that  "no  one,  I  can  assure  you,  ever  told  me  or  anyone  on  my  team  that  it  was  going  to  be  easy.""Whatever  test  they  put  in  front  of  me,  I  will  meet  those  tests,"  Christie  said  to  applause.Separately,  a  source  close  to  Christie  said  the  governor  believes  the  investigations  into  the  scandal  will  be  a  long  process.Christie  does  not  intend  to  address  the  controversy  in  his  inaugural  address  after  he  gets  sworn  in  for  a  second  term  next  week,  the  source  told  CNN's  Dana  Bash  on  condition  of  not  being  identified.Documents  made  public  last  week  suggested  that  top  staffers  in  Christie's  administration  orchestrated  the  traffic  logjam  in  Fort  Lee  as  payback  for  the  failure  of  the  town's  Democratic  mayor  to  endorse  the  governor  for  re-election.The  eventual  subpoena  list  includes  Christie's  former  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff  Bridget  Kelly,  as  well  as  the  governor's  chief  spokesman,  Mike  Drewniak,  and  Bill  Stepien,  a  Christie  political  confidante  who  managed  both  his  successful  gubernatorial  runs,  according  to  two  sources  who  spoke  to  CNN  on  condition  of  not  being  identified.Christie  fired  Kelly  and  asked  Stepien  to  leave  his  political  operation  after  last  week's  release  of  explosive  e-mails  on  the  scandal.Asked  if  Kelly  and  Stepien  would  receive  subpoenas,  Wisnieswski  said  "I'm  not  going  to  confirm  any  names  right  now."Those  served  will  have  two  weeks  to  supply  the  requested  documents,  he  said,  adding  he  expected  his  committee  to  meet  again  in  mid-February  to  consider  what  it  had  received  and  possible  next  steps.Ad  firm  head:  We  were  asked  about  using  Christie  in  post-Sandy  campaignChristie  said  last  week  he  knew  nothing  about  any  decision  by  aides  to  close  highway  lanes  as  political  punishment,  but  Wisniewski  and  other  Democrats  label  such  a  scenario  as  implausible.The  traffic  gridlock  occurred  two  months  before  Christie  was  re-elected  to  a  second  term.In  a  document  made  public  Thursday  by  Democratic  Sen.  Jay  Rockefeller,  who  chairs  the  Senate  Commerce,  Science  and  Transportation  Committee,  the  Port  Authority  of  New  York  and  New  Jersey  said  a  traffic  study  initially  cited  as  the  reason  for  the  lane  closures  was  an  "aberrational"  event  conducted  outside  of  normal  protocol.The  authority's  response  to  questions  from  Rockefeller  also  said  Christie's  top  appointee  to  the  Port  Authority  leadership,  David  Wildstein,  ordered  the  lane  closures  and  suggested  that  he  failed  to  heed  warnings  about  their  impact.In  addition,  Wildstein  ordered  a  Port  Authority  manager  "not  to  communicate  information  about  the  lane  reduction"  to  officials  in  Fort  Lee  and  indicated  "he  would  control  the  communication  about  the  toll  lane  closures,"  according  to  the  response.Wildstein  resigned  from  the  Port  Authority  late  last  year  as  the  controversy  unfolded.Despite  polls  showing  Christie  as  the  early  favorite  for  the  Republican  presidential  nomination  two  years  from  now,  the  bridge  crisis  has  grabbed  national  attention  and  forced  the  normally  combative  governor  to  adopt  a  more  conciliatory  posture."Governor  Christie  made  clear  last  week  that  he  will  conduct  an  internal  review  to  uncover  the  facts  surrounding  the  lane  closures  in  Fort  Lee,"  his  office  said  Thursday.  "His  administration  is  fully  cooperating  with  the  U.S.  Attorney  inquiry  and  other  appropriate  inquiries  and  requests  for  information."The  Christie  administration  has  retained  Gibson,  Dunn  &  Crutcher  LLP  as  outside  counsel  in  a  move  the  administration  hopes  "will  bring  an  outside,  third  party  perspective  to  the  situation."Opinion:  Is  Christie  presidential?Randy  Mastro,  a  former  assistant  U.S.  attorney  for  the  Southern  District  of  New  York,  will  head  up  the  legal  team.Mastro  has  experience  in  organized  crime  cases  and  led  the  federal  racketeering  lawsuit  that  forced  the  International  Brotherhood  of  Teamsters  to  hold  democratic  elections  and  to  undergo  court  supervision.  Mastro  also  is  a  former  deputy  mayor  of  New  York  City.On  the  other  side,  the  Democratic-led  state  Assembly  panel  investigating  the  scandal  will  be  assisted  by  attorney  Reid  Schar,  a  key  figure  in  the  federal  prosecution  of  former  Illinois  Gov.  Rod  Blagojevich.On  Tuesday,  Christie  addressed  the  scandal  briefly  in  his  State  of  the  State  address,  saying  that  "mistakes  were  clearly  made."  He  also  tried  to  shift  the  focus  to  policy  initiatives,  repeatedly  imploring  Democrats  to  work  with  him.The  allegation  of  political  payback  first  made  by  Democrats  was  subsequently  magnified  by  emails  that  state  legislators  released  last  week.Kelly's  name  appeared  in  emails  with  Wildstein,  including  one  in  which  she  wrote:  "Time  for  some  traffic  problems  in  Fort  Lee."Other  exchanges  suggested  that  Stepien  was  aware  of  the  maneuvering  that  led  to  traffic  gridlock.While  the  emails  do  not  link  Drewniak,  the  governor's  spokesman,  to  the  traffic  jam  scandal  or  even  suggest  it,  they  indicate  that  he  had  dinner  with  Wildstein  two  days  before  the  transportation  official  resigned.  Wildstein  thanked  Drewniak  for  his  "sound  advice,"  and  the  two  men  later  emailed  back  and  forth  about  how  to  announce  his  departure  from  the  Port  Authority.Federal  officials  also  are  looking  at  New  Jersey's  use  of  $25  million  in  Superstorm  Sandy  relief  funds  for  a  marketing  campaign  promoting  the  Jersey  Shore's  recovery  that  featured  Christie  and  his  family.In  a  statement  Monday,  Christie's  office  said  the  "Stronger  than  the  Storm"  campaign  was  part  of  an  "action  plan"  approved  by  the  Obama  administration  and  developed  with  the  goal  of  showing  that  the  New  Jersey  Shore  was  open  for  business  several  months  after  the  storm  that  devastated  parts  of  the  mid  Atlantic  in  October  2012.The  campaign  took  place  the  same  year  that  Christie  was  running  for  re-election.On  Tuesday,  the  federal  Housing  and  Urban  Development  agency  described  the  probe  as  a  routine  audit  "and  not  an  investigation  of  the  procurement  process."Opinion:  Sure,  Christie's  team  did  wrong,  but  Jersey  Dems  are  just  as  badCNN's  Shimon  Prokupecz,  Ashley  Killough,  John  King  and  Laura  Koran  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

These  networks,  which  include  Whisper,  Secret,  Confide  and  the  forthcoming  Rumr,  make  it  possible  to  share  thoughts  anonymously  with  strangers,  friends  or  friends  of  friends.Unlike  Facebook,  Twitter  or  LinkedIn,  there's  no  need  to  worry  about  offending  your  friends,  harming  your  career  or  tarnishing  your  online  persona."Anonymity  can  help  people  be  themselves  and  share  what  they  really  feel  or  think,"  said  David  Byttow,  co-founder  of  Secret,  which  launched  in  January.Unburdened  by  the  consequences  that  come  with  posting  under  real  identities,  posters  on  these  apps  can  be  brutally  honest.  For  many  people,  anonymity  can  mean  a  freedom  from  maintaining  their  personal  brand,  the  "self"  they  carefully  edit  for  their  friends  and  family  on  Facebook  and  Twitter.If  Facebook  is  sipping  champagne  during  an  après-ski  selfie,  Secret  is  letting  it  all  hang  out  with  a  cheap  beer  and  no  makeup  in  your  parents'  basement.Secrets  among  friendsThese  startups  have  taken  cues  from  the  original  secret  sharing  service,  PostSecret.  That  blog  anonymously  publishes  select  postcards,  decorated  with  images  and  words,  that  people  mail  to  founder  Frank  Warren.  The  twin  barriers  of  needing  a  stamp  and  having  to  make  it  past  a  human  curator  has  kept  its  confessions  interesting  without  being  cruel.But  when  PostSecret  tried  branching  out  in  2011  with  an  iPhone  app  that  let  anyone  publish  their  own  secrets,  it  had  to  be  shut  down  less  than  three  months  later  due  to  abusive  and  malicious  content.Fast  forward  a  few  years,  and  social  apps  are  trying  again  --  this  time  with  a  few  variations  on  the  formula.Two-year-old  Whisper  is  a  popular  service  for  posting  anonymous  messages  that  anyone  can  read.  They  can  be  sorted  by  most  recent  or  nearby,  which  will  display  Whispers  from  anyone  within  a  certain  number  of  miles.Of  course,  as  with  all  these  apps,  there's  no  way  to  tell  what  posts  are  true.  Many  are  about  sex  or  love,  and  some  are  offensive.  Most  Whisper  users  are  young,  between  17  and  28.Secret  also  lets  people  post  a  sentence  or  two  on  top  of  an  image  or  colored  background.  But  in  an  interesting  twist,  Secret  only  shares  your  posts  --  anonymously,  of  course  --  within  your  circle  of  friends.  The  app  combs  through  your  contacts  to  determine  which  of  your  friends  are  also  on  the  service.  It  won't  tell  you  who  it  finds,  so  you  can  only  guess  who  in  your  circle  is  posting  to  the  app  or  commenting  on  your  confession.When  people  click  a  heart  indicating  that  they  "love"  a  post,  it  is  shared  with  their  circle,  and  so  on.  Only  people  within  two  degrees  of  separation  can  comment  on  posts.  Because  Secret  has  drawn  many  of  its  early  users  from  the  Silicon  Valley  and  New  York  tech  scenes,  many  posts  so  far  are  tech-industry  rumors  and  jokes.Secret  has  already  had  its  first  viral  falsehood.  In  early  February  a  user  claimed  that  Evernote,  the  popular  note-taking  app,  was  about  to  be  acquired.  The  post  gained  some  traction  in  social  media,  forcing  Evernote  CEO  Phil  Libin  to  deny  the  report.Fighting  the  trollsOne  big  challenge  for  these  services,  which  mix  social  networks  with  Internet  commenting,  is  to  strike  a  balance  between  juicy  gossip  and  cruel,  abusive  posts.  Anyone  who  has  glanced  at  an  Internet  commenting  section  knows  that  anonymous  chatter  can  turn  nasty,  fast.To  combat  this,  the  official  Secret  Twitter  feed  re-posts  many  of  positive  Secret  messages  about  friendship,  heartbreak  and  overcoming  adversity,  but  ignores  mean-spirited  ones.Because  Secret  posts  are  shared  with  people  in  the  same  networks,  there's  always  the  tantalizing  --  or  frightening  --  possibility  that  other  users  could  puzzle  out  who  you  are  based  on  your  writing  style,  image  choice  or  subject  matter."Secret  users  always  have  the  benefit  of  plausible  deniability,"  said  Byttow.  "Sometimes  guessing  who  a  secret  is  from  is  part  of  the  fun.  It  certainly  sparks  a  lot  of  entertaining  offline  conversations."To  fight  trolls,  these  apps  typically  include  features  that  let  users  report  bullying  or  flag  posts  as  inappropriate.  On  Whisper,  a  team  of  employees  scans  posts  for  offensive  content.  Whisper  has  also  launched  Your  Voice,  a  nonprofit  resource  for  college  students  struggling  with  mental  health  problems.Secret's  first  incarnation  was  as  a  web  app  for  sending  anonymous  messages  directly  to  people  over  text  or  e-mail."It  was  fun,  but  proved  to  be  something  that  could  be  used  for  evil  in  the  wrong  hands,"  said  Byttow.  "We  didn't  want  to  give  that  to  the  world.We  set  out  to  help  people  convey  thoughts  and  feelings  with  their  friends."These  anonymous  apps  seem  to  be  popular  for  now.  But  only  time  will  tell  if  they  flame  out,  like  the  much-hyped  "social  discovery"  apps  from  two  years  ago,  or  gain  traction  like  Snapchat,  the  popular  app  that  lets  users  exchange  self-destructing  photos  and  messages.Secret  isn't  sharing  any  user  numbers  yet,  but  Whisper  has  reported  some  impressive  statistics.  In  December,  the  company  said  it  was  nearing  3  billion  page  views  a  month.  In  September,  it  raised  $21  million  in  funding.</TEXT></DOC>

His  dad  inexplicably  started  adding  water  to  empty  beer  bottles  and  feeding  Andrew  the  rinse  when  the  boy  was  4.  Five  years  later,  he  was  hooked  on  his  mom's  prescription  pills.  Today,  at  age  19,  he  has  overdosed  twice  in  the  past  week  alone  --  not  on  prescription  pills,  but  heroin.A  friend's  death  from  a  heroin  overdose  scared  Andrew  back  into  rehab."It  really  made  me  feel  not  invincible  anymore,"  said  Andrew,  who  did  not  want  his  full  name  published,  referring  to  a  deadly  new  kind  of  heroin  being  peddled  on  the  streets  of  Pittsburgh  under  harmless  sounding  names  like  "Theraflu"  and  "Bud  Ice.""I  was  doing  probably  about  seven  or  eight  bags;  but  those  'Theraflu'  ones  when  I  first  overdosed,  I  only  did  about  two  or  three,"  he  said.He  is  fortunate  to  be  alive.  In  the  last  week,  22  people  have  died  in  six  counties  in  western  Pennsylvania  from  what  authorities  believe  are  Theraflu-  and  Bud  Ice-brand  heroin  overdoses.An  analysis  of  evidence  from  the  scenes  in  Allegheny  County,  where  Pittsburgh  is  located,  shows  that  the  white  powder  in  the  individually  wrapped  bags  contained  about  50%  Fentanyl,  a  powerful  narcotic  prescribed  to  cancer  patients  as  a  medication  of  last  resort.  Medical  experts  say  Fentanyl  is  10  to  100  times  stronger  than  morphine.A  Pennsylvania  man  identified  as  Tywon  Laniel  Newby,  39,  was  arrested  Thursday  on  drug  charges  this  week  as  part  of  an  investigation  into  the  spate  of  heroin  overdose  deaths  in  western  Pennsylvania,  state  Attorney  General  Kathleen  G.  Kane  announced.Authorities  seized  more  than  2,000  bags  of  suspected  heroin  from  Newby's  home,  including  a  shoebox  with  48  bricks  of  suspected  heroin  with  bags  stamped  with  the  name  "Sky  High,"  Kane  said  in  a  statement.  Investigators  believe  drug  dealers  are  "rebranding"  drug  packages  now  that  the  Theraflu  and  Bud  Ice  brands  have  been  widely  reported  to  be  dangerous."It  is  my  highest  priority  to  find  and  hold  accountable  those  involved  in  the  distribution  of  this  deadly  drug  mixture,"  Kane  said.In  Allegheny  County  alone,  15  people  have  died  from  overdoses  in  the  last  week.  The  medical  examiner,  Dr.  Karl  Williams,  said  the  victims  were  of  all  races,  male  and  female,  ranging  from  22  to  53  years  of  age.Williams,  who  has  been  the  medical  examiner  for  seven  years,  said  it  was  the  first  time  he's  seen  three  or  four  heroin  overdoses  back  to  back  on  consecutive  days."It  is  a  marked  increase  ...  at  least  three  or  four  times  what  we  would  expect,"  he  said.On  the  street,  word  of  a  new,  potent  drug  traveled  quickly.  Andrew  said  he  and  other  addicts  sought  it  out,  eager  for  an  ever-elusive  "better"  high."That's  the  sick  thing  about  addiction,"  he  said.  "When  someone  knows  there  are  heroin  bags  that  are  killing  people  or  making  them  overdose,  then  we  know  that  those  are  the  good  bags."Andrew's  habit  didn't  start  with  shooting  up  heroin.  He  started  with  his  mom's  prescription  pills  when  he  was  9,  heeding  the  advice  of  videos  he  said  his  mom  watched  about  how  good  drugs  made  users  feel."Then  one  day  I  was  with  my  dad  and  his  friends  and  I  didn't  have  pills  that  day,"  he  said.  "I  was  obviously  withdrawing,  and  a  guy  noticed  that  and  said,  'I'll  show  you  something  that  makes  you  feel  better.'  He  shot  me  up  with  heroin."He  was  13,  and  his  life  changed  forever.  Andrew  hit  the  streets  in  search  of  heroin.  At  one  point  he  shot  up  30  bags  a  day."I  would  lie  to  my  family,  steal  from  people,  manipulate,"  said  Andrew,  adding  that  in  the  past  year  alone  he  has  stolen  and  borrowed  about  $30,000  from  his  grandparents  to  feed  his  addiction.Two  overdoses  and  the  recent  Theraflu-brand  heroin  overdose  death  of  a  friend  landed  him  in  rehab.  Andrew  is  at  the  Greenbriar  Treatment  Center  near  Pittsburgh.Holly  Martin,  the  center's  chief  operating  officer,  said  that  since  Theraflu  appeared  on  the  street  market,  worried  parents  have  been  calling  about  their  addicted  children.  Some  addicts,  like  Andrew,  called  asking  for  help,  she  said.  Some  older  addicts  were  flat  out  scared  that  the  potent  new  drug  would  kill  them."We're  treating  professionals,"  said  Martin.  "We  treat  a  lot  of  nurses.  We  treat  a  lot  of  pharmacists.  But  we  also  treat  teachers,  mill  workers,  steel  workers.  We  treat  people  from  every  walk  of  life."Martin  said  new  detox  beds  and  a  round-the-clock  nurse  have  been  added  to  deal  with  the  surge  in  cases.One  nurse,  Beth  Vernau,  a  soft-spoken  woman  who  works  with  many  young  boys  seeking  treatment,  said  her  son  --  also  named  Andrew  --  died  from  a  heroin  overdose  in  October."Emotionally,  you  can  never  be  ready  ...  for  that  to  happen,"  she  said,  adding  that  his  death  could  have  been  prevented.  "The  word  came  back  that  the  people  he  was  with  drove  him  around  for  an  hour  and  a  half,  trying  to  wake  him  up  and  then  finally  decided  to  take  him  to  the  emergency  room."He  was  hospitalized  two  days  before  dying  from  an  addiction  that  started  when  he  was  13,  Vernau  said.  He  started  abusing  alcohol  and  pot,  then  prescription  drugs  and,  finally,  heroin."Most  people  who  do  become  addicted  to  the  opiates,  a  lot  of  them  do  start  out  with  the  legitimate  reason  --  a  back  injury,  a  sports  injury,"  she  said.  "Andrew's  was  actually  a  motor-cross  incident  in  which  he  broke  his  arm  and  had  to  have  pins  and  plates  put  in  it.  That  was  his  first  introduction  to  the  opiates."When  the  doctor  cut  his  prescription,  Vernau  said,  her  son  started  buying  $80  pills  on  the  street.  He  quickly  learned  he  could  score  heroin  for  just  $10  a  stamp  bag,  which  is  also  the  estimated  price  of  the  deadly  Theraflu  and  Bud  Ice  heroin  laced  with  Fentanyl."It  makes  me  very  angry  that  there  is  somebody  out  there  that  is  manufacturing  this  stuff  that  is  just  killing  people  daily,  multiple  people  every  day,"  Vernau  said.In  Homestead,  a  borough  on  outskirts  of  Pittsburgh,  police  detectives  earlier  this  week  executed  a  search  warrant  at  one  location  and  recovered  1,500  bags  of  Bud  Ice  with  a  street  value  of  about  $15,000,  police  said.Under  other  street  brand  names,  Fentanyl  has  killed  in  the  past.

His  feature  directorial  debut,  "Dear  White  People,"  won  an  award  at  the  2014  Sundance  Film  Festival.  Simien's  viral  concept  trailer  for  the  film  sparked  a  conversation  about  what  it  means  to  be  defined  as  black  in  America.(CNN)  --  There's  a  scene  in  my  satirical  film  "Dear  White  People"  in  which  social  misfit  Lionel  Higgins  is  asked  to  write  a  black  culture  piece  by  the  editor  of  a  campus  newspaper  staffed  with  mostly  white  people.Lionel  accepts  the  assignment  with  some  trepidation.  Despite  the  benefit  of  being  black,  large  Afro  and  all,  he  feels  underqualified,  because  he  has  yet  to  find  a  pocket  of  culture  he  identifies  with  at  the  fictional  Winchester  University.Lionel's  dilemma  is  one  many  black  Americans  share:  a  deep  desire  to  have  an  identity  rooted  in  black  culture  coupled  with  the  knowledge  that  what's  seen  as  "authentically  black"  in  popular  culture  doesn't  reflect  our  actual  experience.We're  left  in  a  sort  of  no-man's  land,  because  we  don't  often  see  ourselves  reflected  in  mainstream  culture,  nor  in  popular  "Black  Culture."In  making  the  film  and  engaging  in  debates  about  the  state  of  "black  film,"  here  are  five  things  I've  come  to  know  about  black  culture  now:1.  There  is  a  difference  between  black  culture  and  "Black  Culture"Black  culture,  sans  quotes,  is  the  sum  total  of  cultural  contributions  to  the  mainstream  by  the  black  subculture.  It's  a  fluid  and  a  multifaceted,  often  contradictory  thing.Meanwhile  "Black  Culture"  is  a  lifestyle  standard  made  of  assumptions  about  black  identity,  often  used  successfully  by  marketers,  studio  heads,  fashion  brands  and  music  labels  to  make  money.It  can  be  the  "cool  factor"  that  makes  kids  line  up  for  hours  to  spend  their  last  dime  on  brand  new  Michael  Jordan  sneakers.  Or  the  thing  that  makes  white  people  call  me  "brotha"  and  blast  2  Chainz  when  I  hop  in  the  car.It's  what  people  assume  about  black  people  and  how  they  should  sound,  live  and  act.Black  culture  may  have  been  born  in  black  communities,  or  created  by  black  Americans.  But  when  appropriated  for  commerce,  there  is  a  danger  of  mistaking  "Black  Culture"  for  actual  cultural  EXPERIENCE.  That's  where  the  myth  begins,  and  it  can  devalue  real  human  experiences.2.  "Black  Culture"  oftentimes  employs,  but  is  not  always  defined  by,  actual  black  peopleOften  by  the  time  "Black  Culture"  is  being  used  to  sell  a  product  or  idea,  it's  already  been  reinterpreted  by  white  people.This  isn't  necessarily  malicious,  but  it's  something  to  note.  We  are  often  told  what  being  black  is  by  people  who  aren't.  Up  and  coming  black  hip  hop  artists  are  molded  to  appeal  to  the  masses  by  white  label  executives.  Television  shows  with  black  characters  might  have  no  black  writers  or  directors.I'm  reminded  of  a  time  in  college  when  a  white  roommate  insisted  he  was  "blacker"  than  I  was,  by  showing  me  he  could  successfully  "crip  walk."  It  was  a  feat  I  could  not  do,  nor  cared  to  match.But  in  that  moment  I  was  made  to  wonder  if  I  was  indeed  "black"  enough,  despite  being  the  only  actual  black  person  present.  In  that  moment,  I  felt  alienated  by  a  culture  I  had  a  need  to  be  rooted  in.The  black  experience  can  sometimes  be  so  concretely  defined  in  the  mainstream  that  it  feels  suffocating.  The  reality  of  being  black  is  much  more  nuanced  and  fluid.3.  Black  culture  is  multiculturalBlack  culture  draws  from  a  variety  of  influences  born  both  in  and  outside  black  communities.Janelle  Monae's  album  "Electric  Lady"  demonstrates  this:  It  is  a  brilliant  amalgamation  of  artistic  references  as  disparate  as  Motown  and  Fritz  Lang's  Metropolis.Being  black  in  America  involves  a  process  of  moving  through  and  adopting  from  many  different  cultures.  To  define  what's  authentically  black  is  virtually  impossible,  as  there  are  as  many  ways  to  be  black  as  there  are  black  people.4.  Black  culture  is  not  proprietary  to  black  peopleMany  observers  had  a  tough  time  when  rapper  Macklemore  &  Ryan  Lewis  won  the  Grammy  for  best  rap  album  over  Kendrick  Lamar.There  is  similar  discontent  over  the  lack  of  black  artists  being  recognized  or  rotated  on  radio  in  categories  once  "owned"  by  black  musicians,  like  R&B  or  hip  hop.But  this  is  not  new.  Once  communities  of  black  artists  birth  something  to  the  mass  culture,  in  many  ways  it  is  no  longer  ours.  For  every  Dizzy  Gillespie  there  is  a  Dave  Brubeck.It  can  be  a  tough  pill  to  swallow.  Particularly  when  a  culture  we  feel  ownership  over  reaches  new  heights  of  success  in  more  mainstream,  i.e.  whiter,  hands.There  is  something  unsettling  about  the  fact  that  black  artists  doing  things  associated  with  "Black  Culture"  (rapping,  twerking,)  doesn't  seem  to  capture  the  mainstream's  attention  as  potently  as  when  white  artists  do  it.  (See:  Miley  Cyrus).Personally,  I  happen  to  enjoy  both  Kendrick  Lamar  and  Macklemore  --  Brubeck  and  Gillespie  --  and  even  a  couple  of  Hall  &  Oates  jams  from  time  to  time.  But  I  don't  define  my  black  experience  in  something  as  transient  as  music  or  fashion.I  get  much  more  infuriated  when  presented  with  an  overtly  defined  and  limited  depiction  of  what  being  black  represents.  Like  being  told  I  "talk  white"  in  school.  Or  McRibs  commercials.  Or,  more  egregiously,  seeing  white  kids  in  college  dress  as  black  stereotypes  and  post  pictures  of  it  on  Facebook  on  a  day  meant  to  honor  a  civil  rights  icon.5.  Black  culture  is  a  starting  pointCulture  of  any  kind  can  be  grounding  and  comforting,  creating  a  home  for  nourishment  and  rules  for  understanding  ourselves.But  at  a  certain  point  a  cultural  identity  too  tightly  defined  keeps  us  from  growing.I'm  grounded  in,  but  not  limited  by,  my  blackness.When  I  began  trying  to  get  my  film  made,  the  confines  of  "Black  Culture"  seemed  to  suggest  that  if  a  black  movie  wasn't  broadly  comedic,  a  historical  epic  tragedy  or  a  street  story,  there  would  be  no  audience  for  it.But  I  made  it  anyway.After  millions  of  YouTube  views  for  the  trailer,  and  several  sold-out  screenings  at  Sundance,  my  quirky  rumination  on  race  and  identity  has  been  warmly  received  by  audiences  and  critics  of  all  races.And  that  is  really  the  genesis  of  any  culture:  Ultimately,  it's  created  by  individuals  and  communities  with  the  courage  to  do  something  different  and  unexpected.Like  be  themselves.</TEXT></DOC>

He  is  being  held  on  $1  million  bail  and  awaiting  an  extradition  hearing.The  dog  walker  whose  golden  retriever,  Ollie,  discovered  the  head  near  a  trail  below  the  Hollywood  sign  said  she  at  first  thought  the  head  was  a  movie  prop."Our  assumption  was  that  there  was  always  people  filming  up  there,  and  it  was  a  prop,"  Lauren  Kornberg  said  in  2012.  "We  walked  down  the  ravine  and  got  closer  and  realized  it  was  a  freshly  severed  human  head."Cadaver  dogs  eventually  found  several  hands  and  feet  --  but  no  torso  --  in  the  wooded  area,  which  is  near  the  home  of  actor  Brad  Pitt.</TEXT></DOC>

When  we  lived  there,  my  preschooler  and  I  started  every  one  of  them  with  the  following  conversation:Me:  "Here's  your  fleece.  It'll  be  chilly  outside."Preschooler:  "No,  I  don't  want  it."Me:  "You'll  be  cold  without  it."Preschooler:  "No,  I'll  be  sweaty."  (Or  my  favorite,  "No,  I  don't  like  it  when  it  touches  my  hands.")"So  be  it,"  I'd  think  as  I  zipped  up  my  own  jacket.  Because  I  knew  what  was  coming.  And  sure  enough,  the  moment  we  stepped  outside,  one  of  us  (hint:  it  wasn't  me)  was  suddenly  shivering  and  screeching  about  being  "soooooo  cold."

Or  letting  him  quit  a  team?  Or  fight  with  a  friend?  At  what  point  does  it  make  sense  for  a  parent  to  step  in,  save  your  kid  some  pain  and  discomfort  and  give  them  a  bit  of  your  grown-up  know-how?The  verdict:  The  tactic  only  works  if  you  coach  your  kids  on  what  to  do  differently  next  timeChildren  do  need  to  practice  making  decisions  --  and  dealing  with  failure  --  before  the  consequences  are  too  great.  "If  kids  don't  have  the  space  to  experiment  and  periodically  make  mistakes,  they'll  never  learn  how  to  problem  solve  and  cope  on  their  own,"  says  Christine  Koh,  co-author  of  "Minimalist  Parenting:  Enjoy  Modern  Family  Life  More  By  Doing  Less."upwave:  A  guide  to  mindful  parentingBut  there's  a  right  way  to  do  it.  The  key?  Coaching  kids  without  being  critical,  says  Ann  Marie  Albano,  director  of  the  Columbia  University  Clinic  for  Anxiety  and  Related  Disorders.  "I  often  send  parents  and  children  off  to  do  something  on  purpose  that  will  go  wrong,  such  as  to  bake  cakes  together  and  to  substitute  baking  soda  for  baking  powder,  just  to  see  what  will  go  wrong  and  then  how  to  handle  the  situation,"  she  says.  "Parents  can  be  great  coaches  in  asking  the  child  questions:  'Tell  me  about  what  happened.  What  do  you  think  you  can  do  differently  next  time?  Can  you  brainstorm  with  me  some  ideas  of  what  to  do?'  Parents  can  act  as  guides,  leading  through  problem-solving  steps.  But  the  child  needs  to  be  encouraged  to  put  the  steps  into  place  on  their  own."Kids  need  practice  with  finances  in  particular.  According  to  Bruce  Feiler,  author  of  "The  Secrets  of  Happy  Families,"  80%  of  kids  entering  college  have  never  had  a  conversation  with  their  parents  about  money:  earning  it,  spending  it,  what  it  means  to  get  into  debt  and  so  on.  He  says  that  the  time  for  your  kids  to  experiment  with  money  is  now,  and  the  logic  is  this:  It's  better  to  have  your  sixth  grader  be  bummed  that  he  spent  five  weeks'  worth  of  allowance  on  what  turned  out  to  be  a  fake  snake  on  a  string  (like  a  certain  husband  of  mine  did  back  in  the  day)  than  to  have  said  kid  rack  up  50  grand  in  credit-card  debt  by  age  25.upwave:  6  tips  for  raising  money-wise  childrenThe  problem  is,  letting  our  kids  slip  and  fall  --  figuratively  and  literally  --  runs  counter  to  our  instincts  as  parents.  After  all,  our  job  is  to  keep  them  safe.  As  comedian  Louis  C.K.  told  David  Letterman,  "You  have  this  thing:  You're  supposed  to  raise  them  right.  It's  not  just,  'Make  them  not  die.'  You  make  them  good  people."I  think  we  can  all  agree  that  "making  kids  good  people"  does  not  mean  letting  them  fall  to  pieces  every  time  they  strike  out,  don't  earn  the  grade  they  wanted  or  get  hoodwinked  at  the  fair  (snake  buyers  be  warned).  Albano,  who  is  also  the  author  of  "You  and  Your  Anxious  Child:  Free  Your  Child  from  Fears  and  Worries  and  Create  a  Joyful  Family  Life,"  says  you  must  let  your  kids  make  their  own  moves  to  become  stable  adults.  Just  provide  the  framework.  "Your  child  isn't  sure  if  she  wants  to  join  a  group  at  school?  Encourage  her  to  ask  questions  of  the  kids  in  the  club  so  she  can  learn  more  about  it,"  she  says.

Tell  us  how  you  did  it  and  you  could  be  featured  in  our  weekly  weight-loss  story  on  CNN.com.(CNN)  --  Nina  Osegueda  was  19  years  old,  5  feet  tall  and  around  180  pounds  when  she  remembers  her  boyfriend  saying  the  thing  no  boyfriend  is  supposed  to  say:"You  know,  you'd  look  better  if  you  lost  weight.""No  duh,"  she  thought.Like  many  teenage  girls,  it  was  nothing  she  hadn't  thought  to  herself,  every  hour  of  every  day.  In  Osegueda's  case,  she  said  she  knew  she  was  overweight  and  just  figured  she'd  always  be  that  way."He  was  the  tall,  blonde,  skinny  type  of  guy  who  had  no  idea  what  it  was  like  to  be  a  short,  Latina,  chubby  teenage  girl,"  Osegueda  wrote  on  CNN  iReport.  "I  shopped  in  the  'missus'  section  of  Macy's  and  felt  like  an  old  lady  at  19,  trying  to  fit  into  'mom  jeans,'  thinking  that  crying  in  the  dressing  room  was  totally  normal  and  how  I  was  supposed  to  live."It  was  the  summer  of  2003.  It  wasn't  that  Osegueda,  who  wore  a  size  16  in  most  clothes,  ate  so  much  --  she  just  ate  all  the  wrong  things.  Convenience  store  junk  food,  meals  at  McDonald's,  big  family  dinners  heavy  on  pasta,  rice  and  bread,  and  doughnuts  on  Saturdays  before  soccer  games  or  swim  meets.It  was  how  all  her  friends  ate  too,  and  half  of  them  were  skinny."I'm  just  made  to  be  bigger,"  she  would  tell  herself.  "I'm  just  built  this  way."She  didn't  think  it  would  work,  but  when  that  tall,  skinny  boyfriend  of  hers  suggested  she  lose  weight,  she  felt  obligated  to  try."But  how?"  she  asked.He  told  her  his  mom  had  lost  a  bunch  of  weight  on  the  high-protein,  low-carbohydrate  Atkins  Diet.It  seemed  easy  enough.  She  cut  out  carbs  and  switched  to  meals  consisting  of  mostly  meat  and  vegetables;  cut  all  soda  and  juice,  and  drank  only  water  and  unsweetened  tea.Upwave:  Try  it  now!

She  sported  a  27-inch  waist,  an  hour-glass  figure  and  a  new  aura  of  self  confidence."I  might  never  be  the  skinny  Barbie-doll  figure  I  had  in  mind,  but  neither  would  I  allow  myself  to  fall  into  bad  habits  that  would  make  me  think  less  of  myself.  I  finally  could  shop  in  the  'normal'  sections  of  the  stores,  though  it  never  became  any  less  surprising  to  find  myself  looking  for  clothes  marked  Medium,"  Osegueda  wrote.  "Here  I  was,  in  college,  feeling  healthier  and  happier  than  I  ever  had  in  my  entire  life,  with  the  realization  that  I  had  the  power  to  do  whatever  I  put  my  mind  to."And  the  guy?"It  probably  won't  surprise  anyone  that  I  broke  up  with  the  boyfriend."She  reached  an  all-time  low  of  125  pounds  by  the  time  she  finished  college  in  2005;  she  currently  weighs  130  pounds  and  wears  a  6  or  8  dress  size.Osegueda,  30,  now  lives  in  Gaithersburg,  Maryland.  She  got  married,  became  a  graphic  designer  and  tours  as  a  heavy  metal  vocalist  with  the  band  A  Sound  of  Thunder.  Her  legal  name  is  Balvina  Austin,  but  she  kept  Nina  Osegueda,  the  name  she  grew  up  with,  as  her  stage  name.The  low-carbohydrate  diet  is  her  way  of  life.  A  typical  day  consists  of  two  scrambled  eggs  with  spinach  for  breakfast;  a  salad  with  tuna  and  oil  and  vinegar  for  lunch;  some  cheese,  pickles  or  cucumbers  for  snacks;  and  some  kind  of  protein  and  vegetable  for  dinner."I  know  that  to  sustain  my  weight  I  have  to  keep  foods  heavy  in  carbohydrates  like  cookies  and  cupcakes  to  'treat'  status.  ...  Sometimes  events  like  birthdays  and  holidays  crowd  each  other,  and  I  find  myself  eating  treats  more  often  than  I  should,"  she  said.  "It  can  be  difficult  when  all  of  my  friends  are  doing  it,  so  I  have  to  make  sure  to  work  out  extra  hard  to  make  up  for  the  extra  carbohydrates."Osegueda  works  out  three  to  four  times  a  week  to  make  sure  she's  fit  for  the  stage."Not  only  has  my  weight  improved,  but  so  has  my  stamina,"  she  said.  "My  dream  now  is  to  be  able  to  run  around  the  stage  with  the  energy  of  (Iron  Maiden  lead  singer)  Bruce  Dickinson  until  I'm  too  old  to  scream.

Chris  Christie  is  facing  questions  over  the  use  of  Superstorm  Sandy  relief  funds.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Washington  (CNN)  --  Just  days  after  dismissing  two  top  advisers  for  their  roles  in  the  George  Washington  Bridge  scandal,  New  Jersey  Gov.  Chris  Christie  faced  questions  over  the  use  of  Superstorm  Sandy  relief  funds.CNN  has  learned  that  federal  officials  are  investigating  whether  Christie  improperly  used  some  of  that  money  to  produce  tourism  ads  that  starred  him  and  his  family.The  news  couldn't  come  at  a  worse  time  for  the  embattled  Republican,  who  is  facing  two  probes  in  New  Jersey  of  whether  his  staff  orchestrated  traffic  gridlock  near  the  country's  busiest  bridge  to  punish  a  Democratic  mayor  who  refused  to  endorse  his  re-election.N.J.  Democratic  legislator:  'I  do  believe  laws  have  been  broken'If  the  Sandy  inquiry  by  a  watchdog  finds  any  wrongdoing,  it  could  prove  even  more  damaging  to  Christie's  national  ambitions.  He's  considered  a  possible  presidential  candidate  in  2016.His  performance  during  and  after  the  October  2012  storm  just  before  the  presidential  election  has  been  widely  praised  and  is  a  fundamental  illustration  of  his  straight-shooting  political  brand.Sandy,  a  historic  storm,  pummeled  coastal  areas  along  the  mid-Atlantic,  knocking  out  power  to  millions,  causing  massive  flooding  and  killing  more  than  100  people  in  the  United  States.Parts  of  the  New  Jersey  shore  were  devastated,  but  the  state  and  local  communities  in  many  hard-hit  areas  rebounded  surprisingly  quickly  and  reopened  their  beaches  last  summer.Christie  and  President  Barack  Obama  toured  one  community  in  May  to  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  recovery  efforts  helped  by  billions  in  federal  money  that  went  to  New  Jersey  and  other  states  affected  by  the  storm.In  the  new  investigation,  federal  auditors  will  examine  New  Jersey's  use  of  $25  million  in  Sandy  relief  funds  for  a  marketing  campaign  to  promote  tourism  at  the  Jersey  Shore,  New  Jersey  Democratic  Rep.  Frank  Pallone  told  CNNIn  an  August  letter,  Pallone  asked  the  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development  inspector  general  to  look  into  how  Christie  chose  to  spend  the  marketing  money  approved  by  the  department.The  inspector  general's  office  has  not  responded  to  CNN's  request  for  comment  on  the  investigation.Documents:  Christie  aides  stonewalled  queries  into  lane  closingsPallone  wrote  that  he  was  concerned  about  the  bidding  process  for  the  firm  awarded  the  marketing  plan;  the  winning  firm  is  charging  the  state  about  $2  million  more  than  the  next  lowest  bidder.The  winning  bid  of  $4.7  million  featured  Christie  and  his  family  in  the  advertisements  while  the  losing  $2.5  million  proposal  did  not  feature  the  Christies.On  Sunday,  Pallone  told  CNN  that  the  inspector  general  conducted  a  preliminary  review  and  concluded  there  was  enough  evidence  to  launch  a  full-scale  investigation  into  the  state's  use  of  federal  funds.The  audit  will  take  several  months  and  the  findings  will  be  issued  in  an  official  report,  he  said.Pallone,  a  27-year  veteran  of  the  House  and  vocal  Christie  critic,  said  this  is  not  about  politics."This  was  money  that  could  have  directly  been  used  for  Sandy  recovery.  And,  as  you  know,  many  of  my  constituents  still  haven't  gotten  the  money  that  is  owed  them  to  rebuild  their  homes  or  raise  their  homes  or  to  help,"  he  said.Legal  woes  lurk  for  Christie  over  bridge  traffic  jamDemocrats  slammed  Christie  over  the  summer  for  starring  in  taxpayer-funded  ads  as  he  was  running  for  re-election  in  November,  arguing  it  gave  him  an  unfair  advantage.Christie  aides  said  at  the  time  that  the  winning  bid  provided  more  value.In  a  statement  on  Monday,  Christie's  office  said  the  "Stronger  than  the  Storm"  campaign  was  part  of  an  "action  plan"  approved  by  the  Obama  administration  and  developed  with  the  goal  of  showing  that  the  New  Jersey  shore  was  open  for  business  just  several  months  after  the  storm."Federal  agency  reviews  are  routine  and  standard  operating  procedure  with  all  federally  allocated  resources  to  ensure  that  funds  are  distributed  fairly.  We're  confident  that  any  review  will  show  that  the  ads  were  a  key  part  in  helping  New  Jersey  get  back  on  its  feet  after  being  struck  by  the  worst  storm  in  state  history,"  according  to  the  statement  issued  in  response  to  questions  from  CNN.Last  week,  Christie  dismissed  two  top  aides  for  their  apparent  involvement  in  the  closure  of  access  lanes  to  the  George  Washington  Bridge,  which  caused  traffic  nightmares  for  days  in  and  around  Fort  Lee.New  Jersey  legislators  are  investigating  whether  the  aides  --  a  senior  Christie  staffer  and  a  high-level  appointee  at  the  Port  Authority  of  New  York  and  New  Jersey  --  ordered  the  lane  closures  as  political  retribution.  The  U.S.  Attorney  in  New  Jersey  also  is  looking  into  the  matter.Christie  has  said  he  didn't  know  about  the  alleged  scheme  and  was  "embarrassed  and  humiliated"  by  it.Democrats  in  New  Jersey  and  nationally  have  jumped  on  the  scandal,  saying  it  gives  the  nation  a  chance  to  see  what  they've  said  for  years  --  that  Christie  is  a  bully  who  governs  by  fear.  His  supporters  say  his  swagger  and  frank  nature  convey  confidence  and  have  helped  make  him  a  successful  governor.But  as  bad  as  the  bridge  scandal  is  for  Christie,  any  finding  that  he  improperly  spent  Sandy  aid  would  tarnish  the  signature  achievement  that  has  helped  elevate  his  legacy  and  made  him  a  serious  potential  challenger  for  the  White  House.CNN's  Scott  Bronstein  contributed  to  this  report.Watch  New  Day  weekdays  at  6am-9am  ET.

Is  weed  really  no  worse  than  alcohol  as  he  says?</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Looks  like  the  ongoing  debate  about  marijuana  legalization  in  the  United  States  has  reached  a  new  high:  President  Barack  Obama's  White  House."As  has  been  well-documented,  I  smoked  pot  as  a  kid,  and  I  view  it  as  a  bad  habit  and  a  vice,  not  very  different  from  the  cigarettes  that  I  smoked  as  a  young  person  up  through  a  big  chunk  of  my  adult  life,"  Obama  told  New  Yorker  Editor  David  Remnick.  "I  don't  think  it  is  more  dangerous  than  alcohol."Alcohol  is  the  most  commonly  used  addictive  substance  in  the  United  States,  according  to  the  National  Institute  on  Alcohol  Abuse  and  Alcoholism.  It's  legal  for  those  21  and  older.  Only  about  22%  of  adult  women  and  11%  of  adult  men  are  lifetime  alcohol  abstainers.Marijuana,  on  the  other  hand,  is  classified  by  the  Drug  Enforcement  Agency  as  a  Schedule  1  substance  --  the  same  category  as  heroin,  LSD  and  Ecstasy  --  and  is  illegal  in  almost  all  states  for  recreational  use.  As  such,  comprehensive  data  on  the  drug's  use  and  misuse  in  the  United  States  is  limited.Here's  what  we  do  know:AddictionAlcohol's  addictive  qualities  are  well-documented.  Approximately  17.6  million  people,  or  one  in  every  12  adults,  suffer  from  alcohol  abuse  or  dependence,  according  to  the  NIAAA.  Alcoholics  in  withdrawal  can  suffer  from  anxiety  and  depression,  headaches,  insomnia,  nausea,  fever  and  even  seizures.The  addictive  qualities  of  marijuana  are  not  yet  fully  understood.  The  National  Institute  on  Drug  Abuse  estimates  9%  of  people  who  use  marijuana  will  become  addicted  to  it.  For  comparison's  sake,  cocaine  hooks  about  20%  of  those  who  use  it."There  is  clear  evidence  that  in  some  people,  marijuana  use  can  lead  to  withdrawal  symptoms,  including  insomnia,  anxiety  and  nausea,"  CNN  Chief  Medical  Correspondent  Dr.  Sanjay  Gupta  wrote  in  his  story,  "Why  I  changed  my  mind  on  weed,"  referring  to  medical  marijuana."Even  considering  this,  it  is  hard  to  make  a  case  that  it  has  a  high  potential  for  abuse.  The  physical  symptoms  of  marijuana  addiction  are  nothing  like  those  of  the  other  drugs  I've  mentioned."Driving  under  the  influenceEvery  hour,  one  person  is  killed  and  20  are  injured  in  crashes  involving  a  drunken  driver,  according  to  the  National  Transportation  Safety  Board.A  new  study  found  that  even  slightly  "buzzed"  drivers  --  drivers  with  a  blood  alcohol  level  of  0.01%,  meaning  someone  who  has  had  even  one  drink  --  are  46%  more  likely  to  be  blamed  for  a  crash  when  they  collide  with  a  sober  driver.The  jury  is  still  out  on  the  impact  of  people  who  use  marijuana  and  drive.  Early  studies  showed  marijuana  had  a  slight  impact  on  the  psychomotor  skills  needed  to  drive,  but  these  studies  were  seen  as  limited  since  they  were  done  in  lab  situations.A  recent  study  review  published  in  the  British  Medical  Journal  found  people  who  used  marijuana  within  three  hours  of  driving  were  nearly  twice  as  likely  to  cause  a  crash  as  sober  drivers.  People  who  use  marijuana  in  combination  with  other  drugs  or  alcohol  also  pose  an  increased  crash  risk,  research  suggests.Munchies  and  beer  belliesIt  seems  logical  to  think  that  alcohol  would  make  you  gain  weight.  One  shot  of  liquor  has  about  100  calories;  a  beer  usually  contains  around  150.  Plus,  alcohol  lowers  your  inhibitions,  encouraging  you  to  binge  on  pizza  and  nachos.As  for  marijuana,  even  cops  know  it  gives  you  the  munchies.Yet  some  studies  on  whether  alcohol  or  marijuana  really  cause  weight  gain  have  been  contradictory.One  study  of  more  than  19,000  women  showed  those  who  drank  alcohol  in  moderation  actually  weighed  less  than  those  who  didn't  over  12  years.  Others  have  linked  obesity  and  alcoholism;  frequent  drinkers  seem  to  be  more  at  risk.Marijuana  smokers  seem  to  be  skinnier  than  those  who  don't  smoke.  A  study  published  in  the  American  Journal  of  Epidemiology  found  that  rates  of  obesity  are  lower  by  roughly  a  third  in  people  who  smoke  pot  at  least  three  times  a  week,  compared  with  those  who  don't  use  marijuana  at  all.The  desire's  there...Drinking  reduces  your  inhibitions  and  can  certainly  make  you  feel  more  relaxed  in  social  situations.  But  those  lower  inhibitions  can  also  lead  you  to  engage  in  risky  sexual  behavior,  studies  show.  Unprotected  sex  can  increase  your  risk  of  catching  a  sexually  transmitted  disease  or  infection  and  increase  your  chances  for  an  unplanned  pregnancy.And  while  serving  as  a  social  lubricant,  drinking  alcohol  actually  leaves  you  dehydrated.  The  body  needs  a  certain  level  of  hydration  and  blood  flow  for  sexual  arousal.  Drinking  too  much  makes  it  difficult  for  men  to  have  an  erection  and  for  women  to  feel  pleasure  from  natural  lubrication,  studies  have  shown.Marijuana  may  have  a  similar  impact  as  alcohol  in  lowering  your  inhibitions  and  reducing  your  anxiety,  but  some  studies  have  shown  men  have  a  harder  time  finding  pleasure  during  sex  under  the  influence.A  couple  of  studies  found  that  men  who  use  marijuana  regularly  had  more  problems  with  erectile  dysfunction  and  needed  medication  to  counteract  that  side  effect.  There  are  no  similar  studies  that  look  at  women's  sexual  satisfaction  under  the  influence  of  pot.Long-term  health  risksOver  time,  drinking  can  lead  to  liver  disease,  neurological  problems,  certain  psychiatric  issues  and  may  increase  your  risk  of  several  types  of  cancer.Smoking  marijuana  is  more  dangerous  than  smoking  cigarettes,  experts  say.  The  tar  in  joints  contains  a  much  higher  concentration  of  the  chemicals  linked  to  lung  cancer  compared  with  tobacco  tar.  And  smoking  marijuana  deposits  four  times  more  tar  in  the  lungs  than  smoking  an  equivalent  amount  of  tobacco,  according  to  the  National  Institute  on  Drug  Abuse.High  doses  of  marijuana  can  also  cause  temporary  psychotic  reactions,  such  as  hallucinations  and  paranoia  in  some  people.  Younger  people  with  a  family  history  of  schizophrenia  are  at  a  higher  risk  of  developing  the  disorder  after  using  marijuana,  seven  studies  showed.DeathAbout  88,000  Americans  die  each  year  because  of  excessive  alcohol  use,  according  to  the  CDC.  Nearly  half  of  those  deaths  are  from  chronic  alcohol  use  --  liver  failure,  for  example  --  while  the  other  half  are  attributable  to  acute  situations,  such  as  alcohol  poisoning  or  a  drunken  driving  accident.  There  are  an  average  of  1,600  alcohol  poisoning  deaths,  or  overdoses,  each  year.Weed  can  kill  you  too,  as  this  drug  dealer  showed.In  all  seriousness,  marijuana  affects  your  reflexes,  hindering  your  motor  skills.  So  marijuana-related  car  fatalities  are  not  unheard  of.And  one  study  found  marijuana  users  have  a  4.8-fold  increase  in  risk  of  a  heart  attack  during  the  first  hour  after  smoking  because  of  the  drug's  effect  on  your  heart  rate.That  said,  scientists  believe  that  a  marijuana  overdose  is  highly  unlikely.  One  study  found  it  was  safe  for  animals  to  consume  about  30%  of  their  body  weight  in  cannabis  without  overdosing;  that's  the  equivalent  of  a  160-pound  person  eating  48  pounds  of  weed  at  one  time.</TEXT></DOC>

They  point  to  predators,  parasites  and  parents  who  don't  act  like  parents  as  culprits.Parents  can't  be  palsJustin  Bieber  and  his  dad  seem  to  be  best  buddies.  They  even  have  matching  tattoos.  Jeremy  Bieber,  38,  was  with  his  son  during  several  of  the  incidents  that  have  brought  him  legal  trouble  in  the  past  weeks.Father  and  son  were  partying  together  in  Miami  Beach,  Florida,  before  the  younger  Bieber,  19,  was  arrested  on  a  drunken  driving  charge.  The  elder  Bieber  was  with  his  son  the  night  he  allegedly  assaulted  a  Toronto  limousine  driver.  A  U.S.  Customs  report  said  Jeremy  and  Justin  Bieber  were  both  flying  on  a  chartered  jet  when  the  pilots  had  to  put  on  oxygen  masks  after  marijuana  smoke  filled  the  cabin."You  have  the  parents  acting  as  a  child  with  them,"  said  Dr.  Damon  Raskin,  a  former  child  actor  who  helps  celebrities  detox  in  rehab.  "This  enables  their  addictions  and  contributes  to  their  spiral  downward,  as  with  Justin  Bieber  and  Lindsay  Lohan."Lindsay  Lohan's  father,  who  runs  an  addiction  treatment  facility  in  Florida,  said  he  would  never  party  with  his  daughter.  Michael  Lohan  has  been  publicly  critical  of  his  ex-wife  for  doing  that.  "You  can't  socialize  with  your  kids,"  Michael  Lohan  said.  "You  can't  attend  events  and  party  with  them."Lohan  missed  out  on  some  of  his  daughter's  childhood  when  he  served  prison  time  in  connection  with  a  Wall  Street  insider  trading  investigation.  He  also  had  his  own  substance  abuse  issues,  which  were  addressed  in  rehab.The  parent  of  another  successful  young  actress  --  who  at  age  20  has  never  been  in  trouble  --  replied  "Oh,  hell  no!"  when  asked  if  she  would  ever  party  with  her  daughter.  "You  can't  party  with  your  kid,"  she  said.  "You  have  to  keep  your  position  as  a  parent."  She  asked  to  remain  anonymous  so  as  not  to  embarrass  her  daughter.Richard  Taite  is  the  founder  and  CEO  of  Cliffside  Malibu,  the  rehab  facility  where  Lindsay  Lohan  was  treated  last  year.  He  cites  a  "truism  that  never  changes.""When  parents  raise  their  children  with  a  healthy  boundary  and  recognize  that  they  are  not  to  be  this  child's  friend,  but  to  be  their  parent,  what  happens  is,  these  children  grow  up  to  be  well-adjusted,"  Taite  said.  "We  look  at  them  as  stars,  but  the  reality  is  they  are  still  children,  and  children  crave  boundaries.  If  you're  going  to  be  their  friend  primarily,  and  you  just  happen  to  be  a  parent,  then  don't  be  shocked  when  your  children  grow  up  with  social  adjustment  issues."Unnatural  role  reversalParents  of  a  young  star  often  leave  their  own  jobs  to  travel  with  their  children  as  they  make  movies  or  perform  on  concert  tours.  "The  parent  can  no  longer  work  because  they  run  around  with  them,  and  sometimes  the  kids  realize  that  and  it's  unnatural,"  the  previously  quoted  mother  said.  "They  let  the  kid  turn  wild  because  they  feel  guilty,  because  they  are  not  working."A  mother  is  needed  to  do  things  the  manager  or  agent  won't  do,  such  as  helping  them  study  scripts  and  run  lines  with  them  between  scenes,  she  said.  "No  agent  does  that."But  even  if  parents  keep  their  own  careers,  their  child's  income  can  far  exceed  their  own.  This  role  reversal  can  leave  a  parent  powerless  to  enforce  rules."It's  hard  for  the  parent  to  have  control  when  the  kid  knows  they're  making  more  money  than  them,"  she  said.  "If  he  wants  to  go  to  a  party,  he's  going  to  use  that."This  mother  shared  the  story  of  another  parent  who  put  her  foot  down  when  her  16-year-old  actress  daughter  refused  to  clean  up  her  bedroom.  The  teen  suggested  the  maid  could  do  it.  The  mom  called  the  producer  of  her  hit  TV  series  and  told  him  the  actress  would  not  be  showing  that  day  until  she  cleaned  her  room.  The  producer  agreed  to  shoot  around  the  young  actress  that  day.  The  daughter  cleaned  the  room  after  that,  she  said.It's  a  move  many  parents  are  afraid  of  making,  out  of  fear  it  could  cost  their  child  work  in  the  future.  "Parents  afraid  to  upset  the  system,"  the  mother  said.No  one  to  say  'No'"These  kids  need  structure,"  Raskin  said.  "They  need  boundaries.  They  need  to  be  told  'no'.  Sometimes  the  parents  are  missing,  emotionally  abandoning  them,  being  too  involved  in  their  own  lives.  There  is  no  one  to  say  'no'  if  your  parent  can't  say  'no'  to  you."Justin  Bieber  needs  "someone  who  is  willing  to  piss  him  off,"  the  actress's  mother  said.  "A  good  parent  has  to  do  that."  It's  something  she  does  regularly  with  her  daughter,  even  though  she's  now  legally  an  adult.  "It's  no  secret  --  we  battle,"  she  said.Michael  Lohan  said  it  is  "important  to  steer  them  into  the  right  direction"  about  who  they  should  associate  with,  but  it  is  "hard  to  control  that."  It's  the  "parasites  that  come  around  them"  at  night  that  cause  problems,  he  said.  Another  problem  is  that  the  bodyguards  --  who  are  suppose  to  protect  them  --  party  with  them  and  help  to  cover  it  up,  Lohan  said.Momagers  and  predatorsWhen  a  performer  turns  18  in  California,  he  or  she  is  handed  the  checkbook  to  the  trust  fund  where  15%  of  their  earnings  have  been  deposited  under  the  state's  "Coogan  Act."  The  law  was  written  to  protect  them  from  the  fate  of  Jackie  Coogan,  who  made  a  fortune  as  a  child  actor  in  silent  films,  but  his  parents  spent  the  money  before  he  became  an  adult.These  18-year-olds  are  also  given  the  freedom  make  their  own  business  decisions.  It's  almost  a  ritual  for  managers,  agents,  lawyers  and  publicists  to  approach  them  with  the  advice  that  they  ditch  their  parents  as  advisers,  the  actress's  mother  said."When  they  are  almost  18,  they  have  secret  lunches  and  they  tell  your  kids  'You  need  to  leave  your  parents,'"  she  said.  "The  parents  have  no  power  then."  Her  own  daughter  only  told  her  a  year  later  that  her  manager  "took  her  to  lunch  and  said  she  needed  to  get  away  from  mom,"  she  said."The  agents  turned  because  I  was  putting  pressure  on  them,  because  they  didn't  have  a  plan  for  her  at  17  and  18,"  the  mother  said.  "When  you  make  them  do  their  job,  then  you  become  the  enemy."Michael  Lohan  told  a  similar  story  about  his  daughter  when  she  was  almost  18  and  making  the  movie  "Confessions  of  a  Teenage  Drama  Queen."Justin's  mom:  'He's  just  Justin  to  me'Justin  Bieber's  mother  Pattie  Mallette  told  CNN's  Anderson  Cooper  in  a  2012  interview  that  she  "didn't  want  him  even  to  know  it  was  an  option"  to  be  in  the  entertainment  industry.  However,  it  was  his  mother  who  first  put  his  videos  on  YouTube,  which  led  to  his  discovery  by  manager  Scooter  Braun.  She  moved  with  him  from  Canada  to  Atlanta  where  Braun  launched  Bieber's  remarkable  career."Parenting  him  is,  I  think,  like  anybody  parenting  a  child,"  Mallette  told  HLN  a  year  ago.  "We  just  have  a  different  set  of  circumstances.  It  doesn't  affect  me  at  all.  His  lifestyle  has  different  circumstances  that  we  have  to  work  around,  but  he's  just  Justin  to  me."Mallette  told  USAToday  that  she's  always  been  protective  of  her  son.  "You  hear  all  the  horror  stories  about  kids  and  teenagers  in  this  industry,  and  I  didn't  want  to  throw  my  son  to  the  wolves.  I've  done  my  best  to  protect  him  and  surround  him  with  good  people."Michelle  Obama:  'I'd  pull  him  close'First  lady  Michelle  Obama,  mother  of  two  girls,  was  asked  by  Univision  Radio  host  Enrique  Santos  on  Friday  what  she  would  do  if  Justin  Bieber  was  her  son."I'd  pull  him  close,"  Obama  said.  "I  don't  know  if  it  would  be  advice  as  much  as  action.  I  would  be  very  present  in  his  life  right  now  and  I  would  be  probably  with  him  a  good  chunk  of  the  time,  just  there  to  talk,  to  figure  out  what's  going  on  in  his  head,  to  figure  out  who's  in  his  life  and  who's  not."Her  daughters  "just  want  me  near,  they  want  that  advice  from  a  parent,"  she  said.  "They  want  to  see  you  on  a  daily  basis."Taite's  suggestion  for  Justin  Bieber  does  not  involve  his  parents.  He  should  have  a  talk  with  the  Justin  Bieber  of  15  years  from  now."What  he  has  to  do  is  have  a  moment  of  truth  and  sit  down  and  recognize  that  his  35-year-old  self  would  be  bitch-slapping  him  right  now,"  the  rehab  owner  said.Bieber  also  should  find  "the  best,  top  notch  therapist  he  humanely,  possibly  can  in  the  industry,  who  is  desensitized  to  who  he  is,"  Taite  said.</TEXT></DOC>

What's  next?</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Jeffrey  Toobin  is  CNN  senior  legal  analyst  and  author  of  "The  Oath:  The  Obama  White  House  and  the  Supreme  Court."  The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  the  author.(CNN)  --  In  a  5-4  decision,  Supreme  Court  on  Wednesday  struck  down  limits  on  the  total  amount  people  can  donate  to  various  political  campaigns  in  an  election  season,  a  blow  to  federal  election  laws  ahead  of  November's  congressional  midterm  elections.Jeffrey  Toobin,  CNN  senior  legal  analyst,  answers  some  questions  about  how  this  ruling  works  and  its  possible  consequences.What  exactly  does  this  ruling  do?  Are  some  limits  still  in  place?The  court  left  intact  the  law  that  sets  a  $5,200  limit  on  the  amount  individuals  can  give  to  any  single  candidate  in  a  campaign  cycle,  but  struck  down  the  $123,000  aggregate  limit  an  individual  can  give  to  candidates  in  that  time  period.  Wednesday's  ruling  declares  the  $123,200  limit  unconstitutional.  So  now  individuals  can  give  up  to  $5,200  to  as  many  candidates  as  they  like.Does  this  mean  money  will  influence  campaigns  more  than  ever?  Who  is  most  likely  to  gain?The  decision  gives  rich  people  more  power  to  influence  campaigns.  It  expands  the  influence  of  people  who  have  a  lot  of  money  to  give.  The  end  of  the  $123,200  overall  limit  means  that  people  who  have  even  more  money  to  spend  have  more  ways  to  spend  it.Is  this  a  First  Amendment  issue?  The  protection  of  political  speech?Chief  Justice  Roberts'  opinion  said  that  campaign  contributions  can  be  regulated  by  Congress,  but  only  under  narrow  circumstances.  The  only  permissible  laws  ban  what  the  court  calls  quid  pro  quo  corruption  --  in  other  words,  bribes  in  the  form  of  campaign  contributions.Because  spreading  the  money  around  to  lots  of  candidates  does  not  present  the  risk  of  bribes  to  any  individual  candidate,  according  to  the  court,  the  overall  limits  had  to  be  struck  down.How  does  this  compare  with  Citizens  United?This  decision  is  similar  to  Citizens  United,  with  a  similar  rationale.  Citizens  United  was  the  2010  Supreme  Court  ruling  that  paved  the  way  for  political  donations  from  corporations  and  special  interest  groups.  The  Roberts  court  believes  in  a  simple  idea  --  spending  money  in  political  campaigns  is  the  equivalent  of  political  speech.  Because  the  First  Amendment  prohibits  most  limits  on  speech,  most  limits  on  political  contributions  are  in  the  process  of  being  struck  down.What  does  this  means  for  the  future  of  campaign  finance?The  next  big  question  is  whether  the  court  will  also  strike  down  the  $5,200  limit  on  individual  contributions.  In  fact,  very  few  people  ran  up  against  the  $123,200  limit,  so  the  practical  effect  of  Wednesday's  decision  is  limited.  But  lots  of  people  give  up  to  $5,200.  Ending  that  limit  would  have  a  huge  impact  on  political  campaigns.What  are  the  chances  of  the  court  ending  the  $5,200  limit?Justice  Clarence  Thomas  said  in  a  separate  concurring  opinion  Wednesday  that  he  thought  the  court  should  get  rid  of  the  $5,200  limit,  but  no  other  justices  joined  him  --  yet.  The  decision  was  5-4,  so  the  four  dissenters  want  to  preserve  campaign  finance  limits.  The  real  question  is  whether  the  four  other  justices  in  the  majority  will  join  Thomas.  It's  hard  to  say.  What's  clear  is  that  the  court  is  looking  for  new  ways  to  stop  the  regulation  of  political  contributions  --  and  it's  already  stopped  a  lot  of  them.What's  behind  all  these  decisions?The  core  idea  of  the  five  justices  in  the  majority  is  that  spending  money  on  political  campaigns  is  a  form  of  speech.  The  First  Amendment  strictly  limits  regulation  of  speech.  Once  you  believe  that  money  is  speech,  most  campaign  finance  limits  become  unconstitutional.Follow  @CNNOpinion  on  Twitter.Join  us  at  Facebook/CNNOpinion.</TEXT></DOC>

She  designed  costumes  for  films  such  as  the  1996  remake  of  "Diabolique,"  2000's  "Mercy"  and  2007's  "Ocean's  Thirteen."  In  addition  to  her  haute  couture  creations,  she  designed  a  collection  for  Banana  Republic  that  was  introduced  late  last  year.Madonna,  Allison  Williams  and  Christina  Hendricks  were  among  her  celebrity  clients.But  she  was  most  closely  associated  with  Jagger,  70  --  not  just  for  designing  the  iconic  rocker's  duds  for  the  Rolling  Stones'  50th  anniversary  tour,  which  began  in  2012,  but  for  being  his  longtime  companion.

He  is  the  author  of  "Jimmy  Carter"  and  "Governing  America."(CNN)  --  Many  Americans,  including  President  Obama,  have  become  fans  of  the  Netflix  series  "House  of  Cards."The  show,  starting  Kevin  Spacey  and  Robin  Wright,  is  the  story  of  the  House  majority  whip  who,  through  many  devious  machinations,  becomes  vice  president  of  the  United  States.  The  show  presents  a  devastating  portrait  of  the  nation's  capital  in  which  the  major  players  care  only  about  advancing  their  careers.Public  policy  and  the  democratic  process  are  just  vehicles  for  the  fulfillment  of  Spacey's  career  ambitions.  He  is  willing  to  resort  to  any  tactic  --  even  murder  --  to  achieve  his  goals.Without  question,  the  show  is  riveting.  The  writing  is  impressive,  and  the  acting  is  phenomenal.  It  is  difficult  to  avoid  binge-watching  one  of  the  most  compelling  pieces  of  television  in  years.Yet  the  portrait  of  politics  that  "House  of  Cards"  provides  viewers  is  extremely  skewed,  a  vision  so  devious  and  so  cynical  that  it  neglects  the  great  things  that  our  democratic  process  and  our  leaders  have  produced  over  time.  "Even  in  a  landscape  newly  populated  with  cynical-to-downright-nihilistic  political  shows,"  wrote  an  editor  for  The  New  York  Times,  the  show  "stands  out  for  its  unblinking  commitment  to  a  singularly  dark  vision  of  politics."To  be  sure,  politicians  can  be  extraordinarily  cold  and  calculating,  ruthless  in  their  pursuit  of  power,  and  some  do  spend  almost  all  of  their  time  figuring  up  how  to  move  up  the  political  ladder.But  American  politics  has  been  much  more  than  the  world  depicted  in  "House  of  Cards."  Many  politicians  are  ruthless  and  calculating  but  use  those  traits  for  bigger  objectives  and  sometimes  will  risk  sacrificing  their  career  for  principle.While  serving  as  Senate  majority  leader,  Lyndon  Johnson  famously  relied  on  his  ambition  and  thirst  for  power  to  produce  some  rather  notable  legislative  accomplishments,  such  as  the  Interstate  Highway  Act  of  1956  and  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1957.Johnson  did  things  that  would  make  New  Jersey  Gov.  Chris  Christie  cringe,  but  the  results  were  often  impressive.President  Franklin  Roosevelt  could  be  ruthless  with  his  opponents,  isolating  them  from  his  inner  circle  and  castigating  them  in  public,  but  his  terms  in  office  produced  a  New  Deal  and  won  a  world  war  against  fascism.  (Even  Spacey's  character  was  responsible  for  education  reform  in  season  one  and  entitlement  reform  in  season  two.)Our  political  system,  with  these  kinds  of  power  brokers  at  their  helm,  has  produced  great  legislation.  During  the  1930s,  the  New  Deal  offered  a  federal  blanket  of  security  to  America's  workers  --  by  insuring  bank  accounts,  providing  old  age  pensions,  regulating  financial  markets,  legitimating  industrial  unions,  enacting  a  minimum  wage  and  more  --  that  have  remained  integral  to  the  nation's  landscape  and  were  a  foundation  for  the  middle  class.During  the  mid-1960s,  LBJ  and  the  89th  Congress  used  the  government  to  help  tackle  many  of  the  big  problems  that  faced  the  nation,  such  as  providing  health  insurance  to  the  elderly  through  Medicare  and  Medicaid  and  guaranteeing  that  African-Americans  would  not  have  to  live  in  racially  segregated  societies  through  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964.American  politics  is  also  filled  with  examples  of  great  leaders.  Not  everyone  is  as  despicable  as  Frank  Underwood.In  the  White  House,  the  nation's  first  president,  George  Washington,  set  the  bar  when  he  voluntarily  stepped  down  from  power  and  demonstrated  that  the  United  States  would  not  become  a  monarchy.Abraham  Lincoln  guided  the  nation  through  the  brutal  Civil  War  and  brought  end  to  the  horrendous  institution  of  slavery.  Franklin  Roosevelt  led  Americans  through  the  Great  Depression  and  a  major  world  war,  and  Dwight  Eisenhower,  as  Evan  Thomas  showed  in  his  recent  book,  worked  hard  to  calm  the  tension  of  the  Cold  War  and  find  peaceful  solutions  to  diplomatic  challenges.John  F.  Kennedy  carefully  negotiated  with  the  Soviets  through  the  Cuban  Missile  Crisis  in  1962,  avoiding  a  catastrophic  nuclear  war,  while  President  Ronald  Reagan  seized  an  opportunity  for  peace  over  an  arms  agreement  in  1987  after  the  emergence  of  Mikhail  Gorbachev,  who  wanted  to  change  the  course  of  world  history.There  have  also  been  great  legislative  leaders  whose  ambitions  made  important  contributions  to  Congress.Henry  Clay  set  the  bar  in  the  19th  century  for  how  a  legislative  leader  could  forge  compromise.New  York's  Robert  Wagner  promoted  many  of  the  ideas  that  ultimately  became  the  New  Deal.  His  colleague  Emanuel  Celler  spent  much  of  the  20th  century  fighting  from  his  seat  in  the  House  of  Representatives  to  champion  the  cause  of  immigrants,  workers  and  African-Americans.Michigan  Sen.  Arthur  Vandenberg,  a  one-time  isolationist,  changed  his  tune  and  worked  with  President  Harry  Truman  to  design  America's  Cold  War  policies  in  the  late  1940s.  In  1964,  Illinois  Sen.  Everett  Dirksen,  a  staunch  conservative,  convinced  a  large  bloc  of  fellow  Republicans  to  come  around  to  vote  in  favor  of  ending  the  filibuster  against  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964.  Rep.  John  Conyers  brought  the  energy  he  developed  during  the  civil  rights  movement  to  the  halls  of  Congress,  defending  the  Voting  Rights  Act  during  the  1980s  and  1990s.Great  ideas  have  also  come  out  of  Washington  rather  than  the  private  sector.  During  the  19th  century,  the  belief  in  public  investment,  the  idea  that  the  federal  government  should  help  create  a  national  infrastructure  to  connect  communities,  took  hold  as  public  funds  were  used  to  build  roads  and  create  a  mail  system.Between  the  1940s  and  1960s,  the  federal  government  championed  the  cause  of  computing  technology  and  space  exploration  at  a  time  when  neither  seemed  very  profitable  to  most  in  the  private  sector.  A  number  of  politicians,  such  as  Minnesota  Sen.  (and  future  Vice  President)  Hubert  Humphrey,  were  central  to  promoting  the  idea  of  racial  equality.So  although  "House  of  Cards"  is  a  great  show,  viewers  need  to  remember  that  politics  is  much  more  than  that.  We  have  become  so  cynical  in  this  day  and  age  that  we  can  no  longer  see  what  is  good  about  our  democratic  system.The  history  of  our  country  reveals  that  this  democratic  process  can  also  produce  great  things.  Washington  is  more  than  a  power  game:  It  is  a  town  where  those  in  power  have  the  potential  to  make  important  changes  and  contributions  to  our  history.  And  sometimes,  they  have  done  just  that.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Julian  Zelizer.</TEXT></DOC>

So  Nicole  was  delighted  the  two  were  headed  to  a  Wesley  Chapel,  Florida,  movie  theater  for  some  adult  time."I  was  just  looking  forward  to  spending  the  day  with  the  love  of  my  life,"  a  tearful  Nicole  Oulson  said  Wednesday.  "And  just  to  think  that,  in  the  blink  of  an  eye,  my  whole  world  just  got  shattered  into  a  million  pieces,  and  now  I'm  left  trying  to  pick  them  up  and  put  them  all  back  together.  And  It's  so  hard,  and  it's  so  unbearable."Nicole  Oulson,  speaking  for  the  first  time  since  her  husband  was  gunned  down  January  13,  wore  a  pink  cast  over  her  arm,  covering  a  gunshot  wound  that  police  say  she  suffered  while  trying  to  protect  her  husband  from  Curtis  Reeves  that  harrowing  afternoon.Flanked  by  her  attorneys,  she  spoke  for  only  a  minute,  thanking  those  who  have  offered  support  and  prayers  in  "this  horrible  time  of  grief  and  sadness."  Her  main  focus  right  now  is  taking  care  of  Alexis,  she  said."Right  now,  I'm  just  still  trying  to  recover  from  the  shock,"  she  said.Asked  how  Alexis  was  handling  the  loss  of  her  father,  attorney  TJ  Grimaldi  said  the  toddler  was  fortunate  to  be  so  young."I  think  we're  all  lucky  that  she's  as  young  as  she  really  is,"  he  said.  "She  doesn't  understand  everything  right  now,  so  all  she  knows,  I  think,  is  that  Daddy's  not  there.  And  in  my  opinion,  being  a  father,  that's  enough."Reeves,  a  71-year-old  retired  Tampa  police  officer,  got  into  an  altercation  with  Chad  Oulson  because  Oulson  was  texting  Alexis'  babysitter  during  the  previews  for  "Lone  Survivor,"  police  said.The  6-foot-1,  270-pound  Reeves,  who  was  also  with  his  wife  for  the  matinee  at  the  Grove  16  Theatre  in  suburban  Tampa,  left  the  auditorium,  apparently  to  complain  to  management,  police  said.  Reeves  returned  "irritated,"  a  witness  said.  The  argument  continued  and  popcorn  was  thrown."The  defendant  advised  that  the  victim  turned  and  stood  up,  striking  him  in  the  face  with  an  unknown  object,"  a  police  report  said.  "The  defendant  advised  that  he  removed  the  .380-semi-auto  handgun  from  his  pants  pocket,  firing  one  round,  striking  the  victim,  and  that  he  was  in  fear  of  being  attacked."The  witness  said  after  Reeves  shot  Oulson,  he  sat  down  and  put  the  gun  in  his  lap.Attorneys  Grimaldi  and  Stephen  Leal  would  not  discuss  many  details  of  the  case,  but  they  did  address  Reeves'  claim  of  self-defense  and  his  defense  team's  efforts  to  persuade  a  judge  to  grant  him  bail."You  can  claim  self-defense  or  you  can  claim  your  client  had  a  mental  health  issue,"  Leal  said,  explaining  his  opinion  that  Reeves'  attorneys  had  limited  options.  "It's  one  or  the  other."Grimaldi  added  that  Nicole  Oulson  "doesn't  understand  what  he  was  defending  himself  over."For  Reeves  to  be  eligible  for  bail  on  his  second-degree  murder  charge,  he  would  have  to  demonstrate  that  he  isn't  a  flight  risk  and  that  he  poses  no  danger  to  the  community.Defense  attorney  Richard  Escobar  told  a  judge  earlier  this  month,  to  no  avail,  that  Reeves  had  close  ties  to  the  community,  was  a  former  Hernando  County  Crime  Stoppers  president,  lived  with  his  wife  of  more  than  four  decades  in  a  neighboring  county,  and  had  two  children,  one  of  whom  is  a  Tampa  patrol  officer  with  more  than  a  decade  of  service.The  attorney  also  said  that  Reeves  was  the  victim  in  the  altercation  and  that  Chad  Oulson  was  the  "aggressor."Neighbors  and  family  friends  told  CNN  affiliates  that  Reeves  was  a  friendly  fellow,  completely  unlike  the  man  described  in  news  reports  about  the  shooting.Nicole  Oulson's  attorneys  did  not  discuss  whether  Reeves  was  a  flight  risk  Wednesday,  but  they  both  expressed  doubt  that  the  community  would  be  safe  if  he  was  released  before  trial.  Leal  said  he  doubts  anyone  could  "reasonably"  convince  a  judge  that  Reeves  posed  no  risk  to  the  public."Everyone  with  a  cell  phone  is  at  risk.  You  never  know  when  this  guy's  going  to  go  off  again,"  Grimaldi  added.The  attorneys  thanked  Westshore  Pizza  and  Sky  Powersports,  where  Chad  Oulson  worked,  for  arranging  fund-raisers  and  setting  up  a  memorial  fund  that  has  garnered  about  $20,000  for  the  Oulsons.  The  attorneys  said  they  will  manage  the  fund  and  dole  out  the  money  as  needed  to  Nicole  Oulson,  whose  hand  is  "getting  better."Couple  describes  encounter  with  Curtis  ReevesHeroes  responded  in  aftermath  of  shootingOne  piece  still  missing:  Why?</TEXT></DOC>

These  were  some  of  our  favorite  jokes  of  the  night:Tina  Fey,  introducing  "Gravity"  during  the  opening  monologue:  "  'Gravity'  is  nominated  for  best  film.

Right?upwave:  Why  do  we  misplace  things?The  verdict:  Friends  who  flake  out  too  often  are  disrespecting  your  time  --  and  sabotaging  themselvesWe  don't  want  to  think  that  flaky  friends  are  being  malicious  (even  on  a  subconscious  level),  but  the  truth  is,  the  spontaneous,  "free-spirit"  behavior  known  as  "flaking  out"  isn't  really  all  that  benign.  It  actually  reveals  a  serious  lack  of  conscientiousness  --  and  there  are  a  few  reasons  why  someone  could  be  acting  this  way."Some  people  just  can't  say  no,  so  they  say  yes  in  the  beginning,  then  back  out,"  says  Andrea  Bonior,  a  clinical  psychologist  at  Georgetown  University  in  Washington,  D.C.,  and  author  of  "The  Friendship  Fix."  "It's  a  classic:  They  feel  guilty  saying  no  and  they're  afraid  of  conflict,  so  they  just  agree  to  everything...  But  you  know  [that]  later  on,  they're  just  going  to  be  too  busy  or  too  stressed,  and  get  out  of  it  with  some  lame  excuse."upwave:  3  ways  to  master  the  art  of  saying  'no'In  most  cases,  flakes  have  poor  time-management  skills  and  think  they  can  do  everything  in  an  illogically  short  time  period.  "A  lot  of  people  overestimate  their  abilities,"  observes  Steven  Berglas,  a  psychotherapist  and  author  of  "Your  Own  Worst  Enemy:  Understanding  the  Paradox  of  Self-Defeating  Behavior."  "They  overburden  themselves  and  don't  leave  time  to  be  prepared  for  critical  tasks,  so  they  fail.  It's  self-handicapping  behavior."But  flaky  behavior  doesn't  just  hurt  the  flakes.  It  often  indicates  that  they  don't  respect  your  time  --  or  even  that  they  secretly  feel  their  time  is  more  important  than  yours.  "These  people  are  a  little  more  self-centered  and  rarely  put  themselves  in  the  shoes  of  the  host,"  notes  Bonior.upwave:  How  to  create  healthy  boundariesIgnoring  constant  flakiness  can  do  a  friendship  more  harm  than  good  in  the  long  run  (when  someone's  not  dependable,  it's  hard  to  trust  them).  But  before  you  confront  a  flaky  friend,  it's  important  to  figure  out  whether  he  or  she  is  an  unwitting  flake,  or  whether  something  darker  is  going  on.  "You  have  to  look  at  if  the  person  is  consistent,"  says  Berglas.  "If  a  person  is  always  late,  then  it's  not  noxious  or  intentional.  But  when  they're  only  sometimes  late  to  make  you  wait  for  them,  and  only  when  the  situation  doesn't  directly  benefit  them...  then  they're  trying  to  establish  power.  That's  being  manipulative  and  aggressive."It's  not  all  bad  news,  though:  Flaky  friends,  like  good  wine,  often  improve  with  time,  Berglas  says.  Age  teaches  them  that  if  they  don't  change  their  flaky  ways,  bad  things  will  happen  (e.g.,  their  friends  won't  include  them  in  future  plans).  The  key  is  for  the  flake  to  realize  they  need  to  invest  in  their  community  and  family  by  being  conscientious  and  keeping  to  their  commitments.upwave:  CHALLENGE:  Get  over  a  grudge  already!When  it  comes  to  perpetual  flakes  --  those  who  never  realize  they  have  a  problem  --  you  may  want  to  stage  an  intervention.  But  remember:  In  most  cases,  flakes  aren't  consciously  trying  to  disrespect  you.  So  take  care  when  setting  them  straight,  or  you  could  ruin  your  friendship.  Bonior  suggests  turning  the  conversation  inwards  and  focusing  on  how  their  lateness  disrupts  your  life  and  makes  you  feel  undervalued.  Then  heap  praise  on  them  when  they  do  show  up  on  time.  A  little  positive  reinforcement  now  could  save  you  a  lot  of  frustration  in  the  future.This  article  was  originally  published  on  upwave.com.©  2013  upwave,  All  Rights  Reserved.</TEXT></DOC>

He  was  64.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Scott  Asheton,  who  co-founded  and  played  drums  for  the  influential  proto-punk  band  the  Stooges,  has  died.  He  was  64.The  death  was  disclosed  by  singer  Iggy  Pop,  who  formed  the  band  with  Asheton,  Scott's  brother  Ron  and  Dave  Alexander  in  1967."My  dear  friend  Scott  Asheton  passed  away  last  night,"  Pop  wrote  Sunday  on  Facebook,  not  mentioning  the  cause  of  death."Scott  was  a  great  artist,  I  have  never  heard  anyone  play  the  drums  with  more  meaning  than  Scott  Asheton.  He  was  like  my  brother.  He  and  Ron  have  left  a  huge  legacy  to  the  world."Ron  Asheton  died  in  2009.The  Stooges  were  punk  well  before  punk  rock  came  along.  At  a  time  when  even  hard  rock  bands  were  putting  forth  a  little  peace  and  love,  the  Stooges  were  brash,  forthright  and  polarizing,  relying  on  the  brute  force  of  power  chords  and  Pop's  peanut-butter-smearing  antics  to  establish  a  core  of  followers."Taking  their  cue  from  the  over-amplified  pounding  of  British  blues,  the  primal  raunch  of  American  garage  rock,  and  the  psychedelic  rock  (as  well  as  the  audience-baiting)  of  the  Doors,  the  Stooges  were  raw,  immediate,  and  vulgar,"  Stephen  Thomas  Erlewine  wrote  on  Allmusic.com.Pop  told  CNN  in  2010  that  the  sound  happened  partly  by  accident.  The  band  was  a  little  too  "studious"  in  the  early  days,  but  after  their  manager  "pulled  the  plug  on  our  rehearsal  room,"  in  Pop's  telling,  the  singer  started  stalking  the  manager  around  the  place.  Pop's  anger  rubbed  off  on  the  Asheton  brothers."When  I  did  that,  they  played  differently.  Ron  and  Scott  started  playing  really  furiously,  and  we  were  rocking,"  he  recalled.Iggy  Pop  roars  with  a  renewed  'Power'The  Ann  Arbor,  Michigan-formed  band's  first  two  albums,  "The  Stooges"  (1969)  and  "Fun  House"  (1970),  exemplified  their  sound.  The  songs  were  deliberately  basic  --  two-  and  three-chord  sledgehammers  with  titles  such  as  "No  Fun,"  "Dirt"  and  "I  Wanna  Be  Your  Dog.""Artistically,  what  our  group  had  to  offer  really  was  ahead  of  its  time,"  Pop  told  CNN.  The  late  Kurt  Cobain  of  the  grunge  band  Nirvana  called  the  Stooges'  1973  album,  "Raw  Power,"  his  favorite  album  of  all  time.The  band  wasn't  immune  to  its  own  behavior.  The  albums  didn't  sell,  and  drug  abuse  took  its  toll.  After  "Raw  Power,"  the  Stooges  broke  up,  and  Scott  Asheton  joined  several  other  bands.  The  Stooges  reunited  in  2003  and  released  a  fourth  album  in  2007.The  Stooges  were  inducted  into  the  Rock  and  Roll  Hall  of  Fame  in  2010.Social  media  responded  to  Asheton's  death."Deeply  (saddened)  by  the  loss  of  my  mate  #ScottAsheton,"  wrote  photographer  Mick  Rock  on  Twitter,  who  was  very  much  a  part  of  the  '70s  scene."We  all  lost  a  hell  of  a  drummer  today.  Scott  Asheton  of  the  Stooges  is  gone.  MC5,  Lou  Reed,  Iggy...  These  bands  changed  me  and  changed  music,"  tweeted  actor  Linden  Ashby.Asheton  is  survived  by  his  wife,  Liz,  and  a  daughter,  Leanna.People  we've  lost  in  2014</TEXT></DOC>

Louisiana  police  also  have  a  warrant  for  his  arrest.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Los  Angeles  (CNN)  --  A  Los  Angeles  County  judge  ordered  former  NFL  star  and  rape  defendant  Darren  Sharper  to  be  held  without  bail  Thursday  in  the  wake  of  additional  charges  in  Arizona.Sharper,  38,  was  being  held  on  $1  million  bail  connected  with  charges  of  drugging  and  raping  two  women  in  the  Los  Angeles  area,  but  Judge  Renee  Korn  removed  the  bail  and  ordered  him  to  remain  in  jail  after  this  week's  announcement  that  an  Arizona  grand  jury  has  indicted  Sharper.Sharper's  next  court  date  in  Los  Angeles  is  March  24.A  grand  jury  in  Tempe,  Arizona,  indicted  Sharper  on  two  counts  of  sexual  assault  and  three  counts  of  administering  dangerous  drugs  relating  to  an  incident  alleged  to  have  happened  on  November  21,  Tempe  police  said  Wednesday.Authorities  have  said  Sharper,  38,  is  under  investigation  in  three  other  states  --  Louisiana,  Nevada  and  Florida  --  in  cases  of  alleged  sexual  assault.So  far,  he  has  been  charged  only  in  California  and  Arizona.New  Orleans  police  have  issued  an  arrest  warrant  for  Sharper.  Another  man  accused  in  the  New  Orleans  case,  Erik  Nunez,  was  charged  last  week  with  two  counts  of  aggravated  rape  and  released  on  $400,000  bail  on  Monday,  CNN  affiliate  WVUE  reported.The  application  for  the  arrest  warrant  says  New  Orleans  detectives  interviewed  two  women  who  said  they  were  raped  on  September  23.  The  two  accusers  told  police  they  were  so  impaired  they  don't  recall  "the  entirety  of  the  sexual  intercourse,"  and  that  they  never  agreed  to  have  sex.In  February,  Sharper  pleaded  not  guilty  in  the  Los  Angeles  County  court  to  charges  of  rape  by  use  of  drugs,  furnishing  a  controlled  substance  and  possession  of  a  controlled  substance,  all  felonies.  Those  alleged  rapes  occurred  in  January  and  last  October,  authorities  said.  His  attorneys  said  he  maintains  any  sex  was  consensual.In  the  Florida  investigation,  a  woman  in  January  filed  a  sexual  battery  complaint  in  Miami  Beach  against  Sharper  relating  to  a  2012  incident,  a  police  report  said.Miami  Beach  Police  said  they  are  investigating  the  case.Sharper  played  for  the  Green  Bay  Packers,  Minnesota  Vikings  and  New  Orleans  Saints  from  1997  through  the  2010  season.  The  five-time  Pro  Bowl  player  intercepted  63  passes  in  his  career,  tying  for  seventh  all-time;  he  is  tied  for  second  all-time  in  interceptions  returned  for  touchdowns  with  11,  according  to  Pro-Football-Reference.com.He  was  recently  fired  as  an  NFL  Network  analyst.</TEXT></DOC>

Go  to  CNN.com  for  complete  coverage  or  take  it  with  you  on  your  iPhone,  iPad  or  Android.Washington  (CNN)  --  Three  numbers  to  keep  in  mind  Tuesday  night  as  President  Barack  Obama  delivers  his  State  of  the  Union  address:  six,  30  and  43.Six  as  in  the  number  of  seats  Republicans  need  to  gain  this  November  to  take  control  of  the  Senate.30:  The  historical  average  of  House  seats  gained  by  the  other  party  --  in  this  case  the  Republicans  --  in  a  two-term  president's  "six-year  itch"  midterm  election.And  43%,  of  course,  is  Obama's  job  approval  rating  --  a  reminder  that  his  political  standing  is  weak,  though  up  slightly  from  its  recent  low  point,  as  he  stands  before  a  closely  divided  Congress  --  and  country  --  to  lay  out  his  agenda  for  year  six  of  his  presidency."One  of  the  greatest  powers  a  president  has  is  the  power  to  set  the  agenda,"  said  veteran  Democratic  strategist  and  wordsmith  Paul  Begala,  a  close  adviser  to  former  President  Bill  Clinton.  "He  (Obama)  will  use  that  power  to  great  effect  in  the  State  of  the  Union  address."Here's  how  we  see  the  state  of  the  UnionAnother  Clinton  White  House  veteran  disagreed,  arguing  this  president  is  too  weakened  and  the  2014  campaign  landscape  too  troublesome  to  seize  the  initiative."State  of  the  Union  means  nothing,"  this  Democrat  said,  speaking  only  on  condition  of  anonymity.  "Re-read  last  year's  address.  How  relevant  was  it  last  year  in  terms  of  how  2013  turned  out?"In  fact,  Obama  failed  to  get  any  of  his  top  2013  State  of  the  Union  priorities  through  Congress.  Congress  ignored  his  calls  for  a  new  jobs  program,  for  new  gun  controls  and  for  sweeping  immigration  reform.Because  of  that,  the  2014  speech  is  viewed  by  strategists  in  both  parties  as  part  of  a  defining  test:  Can  Obama  rebuild  his  standing  enough  to  force  action  on  some  of  his  priorities,  or  will  2014  instead  be  remembered  as  another  frustrating  year  of  gridlock  and  the  gateway  to  "lame  duck"  status?  To  that  end,  many  see  this  speech  --  this  wish  list  --  as  potentially  his  last  chance  for  significant  action.8  memorable  State  of  the  Union  moments"At  this  stage  of  a  presidency,  a  State  of  the  Union  address  cannot  be  expected  to  have  much,  if  any,  consequence  in  terms  of  public  opinion,"  said  leading  Republican  pollster  Bill  McInturff.Despite  all  the  attention,  McInturff  called  the  speech  "an  ephemeral  event  that  is  perhaps  a  short-term  focus  of  the  ultimate  D.C.  policy  insiders."As  always,  the  State  of  the  Union  is  a  policy  address,  a  chance  for  the  President  to  lay  out  his  wish  list  to  the  Congress  and  the  American  people.  But  it  is  always  a  political  stage  as  well,  a  dramatic  nationally  televised  theater  for  the  President  to  frame  his  argument.This  year,  even  as  he  asks  Congress  to  act  on  economic  and  other  initiatives,  President  Obama  will  distance  himself  from  an  unpopular  Congress  and  promise  to  use  executive  powers  to  implement  some  of  his  priorities.The  stakes  are  enormous:  As  the  President  delivers  his  speech,  the  odds  --  and  the  early  election  year  data  --  suggest  Republicans  will  not  only  keep  their  House  majority  but  also  have  a  good  chance  to  capture  control  of  the  Senate.How  would  complete  Republican  control  of  Congress  alter  the  final  two  years  of  the  Obama  presidency?  It  is  a  debate  worth  having,  yet  one  that  can  wait  a  bit,  as  we  first  test  whether  the  President  has  better  luck  with  Congress  in  2014  than  he  did  in  2013,  and  whether  he  can  bend  the  political  climate  back  more  in  his  favor.Gingrich:  Obama  playing  a  weak  hand  at  State  of  the  UnionWhich  is  where  those  numbers  come  in.The  White  House  says  its  No.  1  political  goal  this  year  is  protecting  the  Democratic  majority  in  the  Senate.  Yet  that  goal  --  blocking  Republicans  from  a  net  six-seat  gain  --  could  significantly  complicate  the  President's  policy  agenda.Several  of  the  most  vulnerable  Senate  Democratic  incumbents  are  from  states  Obama  lost  badly  in  2012:  Arkansas,  Alaska  and  Louisiana  to  name  three.  Those  and  other  Democrats  are  opposed  to  some  things  the  President  wants  --  like  new  gun  controls  --  and  in  favor  of  ideas  the  White  House  is  against,  including  modifications  to  the  President's  health  care  law.Zelizer:  Six  ways  to  fight  inequalityBegala  acknowledges  the  tough  political  environment  facing  the  President.  But  he  says  he  can  navigate  it  with  a  smartly  crafted  2014  State  of  the  Union  wish  list."How  can  he  help  red-state  Democrats  running  in  places  where  he  lost  badly?"  Begala  said.  "By  raising  issues  that  play  well  in  places  he  doesn't.  So  you  will  hear  a  lot  about  middle-class  economics:  raising  the  minimum  wage,  extending  unemployment  insurance,  pay  equity  and  workplace  fairness  for  working  women,  greater  access  to  child  care  for  working  moms,  pre-K  for  young  kids  and  college  aid  for  young  adults.  "The  House  Republican  majority  opposes  most  of  the  President's  ideas,  though  there  have  been  some  discussions  testing  whether  compromises  can  be  reached  on  the  minimum  wage,  unemployment  insurance  and,  from  time  to  time,  even  immigration  policy.The  historical  average  for  a  two-term  president's  party  in  this  sixth  year  midterm  is  a  loss  of  30  House  seats.  Even  the  most  optimistic  Republicans  view  that  as  unlikely,  given  the  shrinking  number  of  competitive  House  districts.But  Republican  flexibility  in  policy  discussions  could  depend  on  their  own  November  midterm  calculations,  and  at  the  moment  top  party  strategists  predict  GOP  gains  in  the  high  single  digits  on  the  House  side.Republicans  say  Obama  has  a  lot  of  explaining  to  do"They  will  oppose  his  popular  economic  agenda  at  their  own  political  peril,"  Begala  said,  holding  out  hope  the  President  would  have  an  opportunity  either  to  score  policy  successes  or  bend  the  political  momentum  back  in  his  favor.The  43%  number  is  the  one  worth  watching  as  the  year  unfolds  --  midterm  elections  are  shaped  most  by  the  President's  standing.If  Obama  can  climb  closer  to  50%,  Democratic  chances  improve  significantly.  If  he  slips  closer  to  40%  or  below,  then  a  GOP  takeover  of  the  Senate  becomes  more  and  more  likely.A  little  history:In  2006,  President  George  W.  Bush  had  an  identical  43%  job  approval  rating  at  the  time  of  his  State  of  the  Union  address.There  was  little  fear  of  the  President  in  Congress  then,  in  either  party,  and  as  a  result  little  of  his  agenda  was  enacted  --  immigration  and  Social  Security  changes  were  among  the  goals  Bush  laid  out.  Come  November  2006,  Republicans  lost  30  House  seats,  and  their  majority.7  things  you  didn't  know  about  the  State  of  the  UnionBill  Clinton,  on  the  other  hand,  had  a  59%  approval  rating  to  begin  his  sixth  year  in  office,  and  Ronald  Reagan  was  at  64%  around  his  1986  State  of  the  Union.Democrats  defied  the  historical  averages  in  the  Clinton  "six-year  itch"  election;  Republicans  actually  lost  five  House  seats,  and  the  Senate  balance  of  power  was  unchanged.In  1986,  then-majority  Democrats  made  only  modest  gains  in  the  House  (plus  five  seats),  but  did  pick  up  eight  Senate  seats  to  take  control  of  that  chamber.Outside  of  Washington,  observers  like  New  Hampshire  GOP  activist  Thomas  Rath  see  an  opportunity  if  the  President  "acknowledge(d)  at  the  outset  that  overwhelmingly  Americans  share  a  common  belief  --  Washington  does  not  work.  He  should  acknowledge  that  both  parties  share  that  blame;  both  are  responsible."Rath's  advice?"He  needs  to  listen  to  the  mood  of  this  country  and  understand  that  folks  do  not  want  to  hear  a  partisan  harangue  but  rather  want  a  strong  message  of  leadership  and  cooperation  from  the  man  they  elected  to  do  just  that."And  Rath's  election-year  State  of  the  Union  prediction:  "He  will  do  nothing  of  this  sort."Obama  to  raise  minimum  wage  for  federal  contractors</TEXT></DOC>

A  focus  on  early  education.  More  taxes  for  the  wealthy.  Closing  tax  breaks  enjoyed  by  the  oil  and  gas  industry.  Those  are  some  of  the  more  high  profile  items  in  President  Obama's  budget  for  2015.  Here  are  some  other  components  of  the  President's  budget  that  are  interesting,  impactful  or  just  random.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Washington  (CNN)  --  The  battle  over  the  budget  often  revolves  around  politically  partisan  issues  of  taxes  and  spending.  But  President  Barack  Obama's  proposed  spending  plan  for  the  next  fiscal  year  totals  $3.9  trillion  so  there's  a  lot  that  can  be  overlooked.  We  read  the  budget  plan  so  you  didn't  have  to.Here's  what  else  is  in  it:Obama's  budget:  Help  for  workers,  taxes  for  the  richLessons  learned?  The  State  Department  would  receive  $4.6  billion  to  protect  staff  at  consulates  and  embassies  overseas.  It's  a  recommendation  from  the  Benghazi  Accountability  Review  Board  after  the  deadly  attacks  that  killed  four  Americans  in  2012.Mental  health:  As  mental  health  has  received  increased  attention  after  multiple  mass  shootings  in  recent  years,  the  budget  outlines  $75  million  for  mental  health  programs  specifically  for  youth  and  young  adults.Mass  violence:  To  prevent  mass  shootings,  $10  million  is  proposed  to  train  local  law  enforcement  to  respond  to  mass  shootings.  Some  of  that  money  is  for  a  public  awareness  campaign  to  prevent  such  events.Compounding  pharmacies:  After  a  Massachusetts  pharmacy  that  mixed  its  own  medication  was  found  to  be  the  source  of  a  meningitis  outbreak,  it  was  realized  that  compounding  pharmacies  slide  under  the  radar.  This  budget  provides  $25  million  for  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration  to  inspect  the  facilities.From  welfare  to  work:  It's  true.  Obama  receives  a  lot  of  flak  from  political  adversaries  for  bolstering  the  nanny  state  and  creating  a  culture  of  dependency.  In  this  budget,  he  proposes  to  "redirect"  $602  million  to  a  program  that  works  with  employers  to  provide  subsidized  employment  opportunities  for  low-income  people.Unemployment  benefits:  While  the  President  proposes  an  increase  in  federal  unemployment  benefits,  he  would  also  invest  $3  billion  to  ensure  people  who  received  disability  insurance  benefits  don't  also  receive  unemployment  benefits  as  well.  Perhaps  another  item  where  Republicans  and  Democrats  can  reach  common  ground?Airport  lines:  The  budget  proposal  would  direct  the  Transportation  Security  Administration  to  focus  its  resources  on  high-risk  passengers  and  make  it  easier  for  low-risk  passengers  to  pass  through  airport  security  check  points.  "TSA  will  improve  the  customer  experience  while  enhancing  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  its  screening  operators,"  the  budget  document  says.Obama  wants  better  tax  deal  for  working  familiesMore  prisons?  The  United  States  locks  up  more  people  per  capita  than  any  other  country.  To  accommodate  the  massive  number  of  prisoners,  the  President  proposed  $8.4  billion  "to  continue  bringing  newly  completed,  or  acquired,  prisons  on  line."Military  sexual  assault:  While  New  York  Sen.  Kirsten  Gillibrand  has  been  unsuccessful  in  passing  her  legislation  that  would  reform  how  the  military  handles  incidences  of  sexual  assault,  the  President  includes  some  of  her  proposals  in  his  budget  aimed  at  "eliminating  sexual  assault  from  the  military."  He  calls  for  a  "full-scale  review"  of  changes  by  December.Nine  to  five  or  six  or  seven:  The  Department  of  Labor  would  receive  $41  million  for  300  new  investigators  to  ensure  that  employers  follow  wage  and  overtime  laws.International  AIDS:  The  President  proposes  an  additional  $300  million  to  the  $1.35  billion  budgeted  to  fund  AIDS,  tuberculosis  and  malaria  prevention  around  the  world.Illness  in  the  U.S.:  This  budget  prioritizes  the  accelerated  development  "of  a  universal  flu  vaccine."Flat-line:  The  President  makes  some  cuts  to  federal  programs,  including  eliminating  funding  for  grants  for  abstinence-only  education.The  feds'  customer  services:  Speaking  of  customer  service,  $100  million  would  be  spent  to  "significantly  improve  Internet  and  in-person  services  at  the  Social  Security  Administration.  Another  $150  million  would  "further  reduce  wait  times  and  enhance  services  for  the  public."So-long  penny.  And  the  nickel?  The  Treasury  Department  is  taking  on  a  major  review  of  the  use  of  coins  in  U.S.  currency.  It  "will  result  in  the  development  of  alternative  options  for  the  penny  and  the  nickel."The  not-so-secret  life  of  bees:  It's  widely  known  that  bees  are  disappearing.  What's  not  known  is  the  reason.  The  President  dedicates  $50  million  worth  of  public-private  research  grants  and  preservation  for  bee  habitats.</TEXT></DOC>

Adults  between  25  and  64  account  for  more  than  half  of  flu  deaths  this  season,  according  to  the  CDC,  compared  with  less  than  a  quarter  last  year."Influenza  can  make  anyone  very  sick,  very  fast  and  it  can  kill,"  said  the  CDC's  director,  Dr.  Tom  Frieden.  "Vaccination  every  season  is  the  single  most  important  thing  you  can  do  to  protect  yourself."CDC  experts  estimate  only  a  third  of  people  18  to  64  had  been  vaccinated  by  November.  About  40%  to  45%  of  Americans  get  vaccinated  each  year,  Frieden  said.Health  officials  continue  to  encourage  vaccinations  for  everyone  who  is  at  least  6  months  old.  The  CDC's  Morbidity  and  Mortality  Weekly  Report  noted  this  year's  flu  vaccine  reduces  the  chance  of  having  to  go  to  the  doctor  for  treatment  by  about  60%  across  all  age  groups.  In  past  years,  the  vaccine's  effectiveness  has  ranged  from  30%  to  65%.The  CDC  has  known  for  weeks  that  the  dominant  flu  strain  this  season  is  the  H1N1  virus,  which  first  emerged  in  April  2009  and  caused  a  pandemic.  It's  included  in  all  flu  shots  and  nasal  vaccines  this  year,  according  to  the  MMWR."We  are  committed  to  the  development  of  better  flu  vaccines,  but  existing  flu  vaccines  are  the  best  preventive  tool  available  now,"  Frieden  said.Pregnant  women  are  at  particularly  high  risk  of  developing  serious  complications  from  the  flu,  such  as  pneumonia.Leslie  Creekmore  of  Arkansas  was  20  weeks'  pregnant  when  she  contracted  the  flu  this  month.  Five  days  after  checking  into  a  hospital,  she  miscarried.  Three  weeks  later,  Creekmore  died.  She  did  not  get  the  flu  vaccine.Fifty  pediatric  flu-related  deaths  have  been  reported  during  the  current  flu  season,  according  to  the  MMWR.  Adult  flu  deaths  are  not  reported  on  a  national  basis,  but  the  CDC  estimates  that  between  3,000  and  49,000  people  die  each  year  because  of  the  flu  and  flu-related  illness.When  H1N1  first  surfaced,  California  health  officials  decided  to  make  reporting  fatal  influenza  cases  in  all  individuals  under  65  mandatory.  As  of  February  14,  local  health  officials  had  reported  243  deaths."The  405  reports  of  severe  cases  (i.e.,  fatal  and  ICU  cases  combined)  were  more  than  in  any  season  since  the  2009  pandemic,"  officials  wrote  in  the  MMWR.Influenza  activity  in  the  United  States  remained  elevated  through  February  8,  according  to  the  CDC.  Twenty-four  states  reported  widespread  flu  activity  that  week."Widespread"  means  that  more  than  50%  of  geographic  regions  in  a  state  --  counties,  for  example  --  are  reporting  flu  activity.  The  designation  addresses  the  spread  of  the  flu,  not  its  severity.Experts  expect  elevated  flu  activity  in  parts  of  the  United  States  for  several  more  weeks,  especially  in  states  where  flu  activity  started  later."I  want  to  remind  you  that  the  season  is  not  over,"  said  Dr.  Anne  Schuchat,  director  of  the  National  Center  for  Immunization  and  Respiratory  Diseases.  "There  is  still  a  lot  of  influenza  circulating.  If  you  haven't  been  vaccinated  yet,  it's  not  too  late  for  you  to  benefit."In  addition  to  getting  the  vaccine,  washing  your  hands  frequently  and  staying  home  when  you're  sick  can  help  you  and  others  get  through  the  flu  season.

Chris  Christie  faces  brewing  storms  --  literally  and  figuratively.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Chris  Christie  faced  new  storms,  literally  and  figuratively,  on  the  first  day  of  his  second  term  as  New  Jersey  governor.A  scandal  rocking  his  administration  over  suggestions  of  political  dirty  tricks  and  strong-armed  politics  has  already  cost  four  top  advisers  their  jobs,  spawned  multiple  investigations  and  threatens  to  cloud  any  presidential  ambitions  the  Republican  may  have  for  2016.He  took  the  oath  of  office  and  then  launched  into  a  speech  that  praised  how  his  state  came  together  in  his  first  four  years  to  meet  the  challenges  of  economic  recession  and  Superstorm  Sandy,  as  well  as  the  landslide  re-election  victory  voters  gave  him  last  November.Christie  did  not  mention  the  brewing  scandals  but  did  note  another  storm,  the  wintry  one  raging  outside  the  War  Memorial  in  Trenton  that  provided  an  apt  metaphor  for  the  start  of  his  second  term.A  Republican  governor  in  a  state  dominated  by  Democrats,  he  contrasted  himself  with  the  partisanship  in  Washington  by  promoting  a  bipartisan  vision  for  the  Garden  State.'Our  dreams  are  the  same'"This  election  has  taught  us  that  the  ways  we  divide  each  other  --  by  race,  by  class,  by  ethnicity,  by  wealth,  and  yes  by  political  party  --  is  neither  permanent  nor  necessary,"  he  said.  "Our  dreams  are  the  same:  a  good  job,  a  great  education  for  our  children,  safe  streets  in  our  neighborhood  and  core  values  which  give  our  lives  real  meaning."The  remarks  countered  an  image  some  opponents  offer  about  an  administration  they  say  takes  hardball  politics  to  new  levels  in  a  state  known  for  being  rough-and-tumble  politically.The  state  legislative  and  federal  investigations  are  primarily  looking  at  suggestions  top  aides  and  advisers  to  the  governor  orchestrated  traffic  jams  around  the  George  Washington  Bridge  in  Fort  Lee  last  year  to  punish  that  town's  Democratic  mayor  for  not  endorsing  Christie  for  re-election.Christie  has  denied  knowledge  of  the  alleged  bridge  scheme.Christie  scandals:  What  you  need  to  knowHours  before  Christie's  second  inaugural,  a  top  New  Jersey  Republican  defended  him."He's  a  former  federal  prosecutor,  indicted  over  a  hundred  politicians.  He's  the  last  guy  on  earth  who's  going  to  do  an  illegal  activity.  It's  repugnant  to  him,"  said  Jon  Bramnick,  the  Republican  leader  in  the  New  Jersey  State  Assembly,  on  CNN's  "New  Day."With  the  next  race  for  the  White  House  on  the  horizon,  and  Christie  said  to  be  considering  a  bid  for  the  GOP  nomination,  he  hopes  his  inaugural  message  resonates  with  a  national  audience.However,  new  national  polling  indicates  his  crossover  appeal  among  Independents  and  Democrats,  a  rare  characteristic  that  elevates  his  national  standing,  has  softened.CNN  exclusive:  Port  Authority  job  created  for  Christie  ally,  source  saysHoboken  mayor  provides  more  evidenceAside  from  the  bridge  scandal,  Christie's  team  faces  questions  about  how  the  administration  handled  Superstorm  Sandy  relief  money  approved  by  the  federal  government.Hoboken  Mayor  Dawn  Zimmer  this  week  alleged  that  the  Christie's  administration  conditioned  --  or  "held  hostage"  --  storm  recovery  funds  for  her  town  on  her  support  for  a  redevelopment  project  proposed  by  a  firm,  The  Rockefeller  Group,  with  ties  to  the  governor.Zimmer  said  Lt.  Gov.  Kim  Guadagno  delivered  the  message  in  a  parking  lot  last  May,  saying  it  came  directly  from  Christie.Guadango  denies  the  allegation;  Zimmer  is  standing  firm,  saying  she's  already  told  her  story  to  federal  prosecutors.  State  legislative  investigators  also  want  to  hear  from  Zimmer.Also  on  Sandy,  a  federal  watchdog  is  looking  into  how  the  state  used  relief  money  in  promoting  the  state's  recovery  from  the  October  2012  storm  that  devastated  coastal  areas  in  the  state.The  Housing  and  Urban  Development  inspector  general's  office  is  specifically  looking  at  spending  on  an  ad  produced  for  Jersey  Shore  marketing  purposes  that  featured  Christie  and  his  family.Christie's  office  has  said  the  Obama  administration  signed  off  on  its  marketing  plan,  and  vehemently  denies  any  wrongdoing  in  the  Zimmer  matter.Who  is  Dawn  Zimmer?Hot  piece  of  land  in  Hoboken  at  center  of  Christie-Zimmer  disputeSee  her  journal  entriesChristie  marches  on  as  controversy  at  home  unfoldsCNN's  Chris  Frates,  Steve  Kastenbaum,  Erin  McPike,  Jake  Tapper,  Paul  Steinhauser  and  Dana  Davidsen  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Of  a  Jennifer  Lopez  movie.Finley,  27,  was  arrested  Thursday  in  Pickens  County,  South  Carolina,  on  a  misdemeanor  charge  of  failure  to  return  the  video,  according  to  CNN  affiliate  WYFF-TV.The  movie,  "Monster-In-Law,"  starring  Lopez  and  Jane  Fonda  as  a  feuding  potential  daughter-  and  mother-in-law,  was  rented  from  a  video  store,  Dalton  Videos,  that  is  now  out  of  business.The  WYFF  report  says  Finley  was  at  the  county  sheriff's  office  on  another  matter  when  an  active  warrant  for  her  arrest  was  discovered.  Chief  Deputy  Creed  Hashe  told  the  station  that  the  store's  owner  had  asked  a  Pickens  County  judge  for  the  warrant  years  ago  when  Finley  didn't  return  her  video.Hashe  said  Finley  had  been  sent  several  certified  letters  asking  her  to  turn  herself  in.Finley  spent  the  night  in  jail  because  her  bond  hearing  couldn't  be  held  until  Friday  morning.  A  judge  released  her  on  $2,000  bond.Efforts  to  reach  out  to  Finley  via  social  media  were  unsuccessful  early  Monday.  But  a  woman  identifying  herself  as  Finley,  and  whose  profile  picture  appeared  similar  to  Finley's  mug  shot,  took  to  Fox  Carolina  News  Facebook  page  on  Saturday  to  defend  herself.She  said  that  after  renting  the  movie  she  had  to  move  out  of  state  because  of  her  husband's  job  and  that  she  simply  forgot  about  it."I'm  no  criminal,  but  Pickens  County  Sheriff's  office  sure  made  me  feel  like  I  was,"  she  wrote.She  said  she  never  received  any  letters  from  the  sheriff's  office,  while  striking  back  at  people  who  had  made  negative  comments  on  the  Fox  post."If  I  had,  it  would  have  been  taken  care  of  immediately,"  she  wrote.  "Some  of  you  need  to  quit  (judging)  like  you  are.  This  is  a  bogus  charge  and  everyone  knows  it."For  Finley,  it's  no  laughing  matter.  But  that  didn't  stop  folks  online  from  commenting  on  the  ridiculousness  of  it  all."Oh  god,  I'm  so  embarrassed,"  wrote  Twitter  user  Alec  MacKinnon.  "Now  everyone  is  going  to  know  I  rented  'Monster  In  Law.'  ""They  should  sentence  her  to  time  already  served,"  wrote  one  CNN  commenter.  "She'll  never  get  the  2  hours  she  spent  watching  that  movie  back."Others  were  taking  shots  at  what  they  felt  was  an  overreaction  by  law  enforcement."Wait  till  they  find  out  that  she  forgot  to  REWIND  the  tape!!!"  annother  commenter  wrote.The  Pickens  County  Sheriff's  Office  did  not  immediately  return  a  call  seeking  comment.</TEXT></DOC>

The  infectious  optimism?  The  bouncy  melody?  The  fun  videos?</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  There  are  happy  songs  --  and  then  there  is  "Happy."The  bouncy  tune  by  singer/composer/producer/rapper  Pharrell  Williams  has  occupied  the  No.  1  spot  on  the  charts  for  more  than  a  month.It's  spurred  countless  covers  --  including  one  by  Academy  Award-winning  actress  Gwyneth  Paltrow,  reprising  her  guest  star  role  in  the  100th  episode  of  "Glee."There  is  even  a  YouTube  version  of  "Happy"  that  has  gone  completely  to  the  dogs.What  is  it  about  this  song,  which  is  so  infectiously  enjoyable  that  Meryl  Streep  had  to  shimmy  to  it  when  Williams  performed  at  the  Oscars?Is  it  the  catchy  melody?  Is  it  the  insistent  nature  of  such  lyrics  as  "Clap  along  if  you  feel  like  happiness  is  the  truth"?  Is  it  that  extra  bounce  you  feel  when  the  back  up  singers  airily  croon  "Because  I'm  happppppyyyy"?  Or  is  it  the  joy  of  watching  Williams  and  several  other  folks  dance,  bounce  and  lip-sync  along  with  the  song  in  the  music  video?Yes.Simply  put,  the  song  is  all  those  things,  even  as  it  has  managed  to  seemingly  capture  the  rush  of  happiness  in  its  lyrics  and  melody.Not  a  bad  trick  for  a  tune  that  slowly  grew  from  a  single  on  last  summer's  "Despicable  Me  2"  soundtrack  to  such  popularity  that  Robert  Morast,  a  writer  for  the  Virginian-Pilot,  recently  entered  into  a  debate  of  whether  it  should  be  considered  for  the  official  state  song  of  Virginia."Pharrell's  hit  track  is  a  jolt  of  mood-lifting  music,"  wrote  Morast,  who  was  more  partial  to  the  Carter  Family's  "Can  the  Circle  Be  Unbroken."  "And  while  it's  fine  to  be  happy,  the  best  art  is  crafted  with  a  range  of  emotional  perspectives."Even  with  its  slow  build,  "Happy"  caught  ears  from  the  beginning.  Upon  release  it  was  quickly  dubbed  "an  instant  contender  for  2013's  Song  of  the  Summer"  by  Rolling  Stone.  Since  then,  it's  topped  the  charts  in  more  than  a  dozen  countries  besides  the  United  States,  including  the  United  Kingdom,  France,  Germany  and  Poland.Violinist  Lindsey  Stirling,  who's  worked  with  John  Legend  and  mixes  classically  styled  music  with  electronic  dub-step  beats,  asks  simply,  how  "can  you  not  love  ('Happy')?""I  was  with  a  friend,  and  when  ('Happy')  came  on,  her  baby  started  kicking  and  trying  to  dance,"  Stirling  said.  "We  were  laughing  hysterically  and  saying  'Even  babies  love  this  song.'  "She  said  she  believes  the  reason  "Happy"  is  so  beloved  is  because  of  its  uplifting  message."I  get  so  excited  when  something  this  positive  goes  this  big,"  said  Stirling,  whose  album  "Shatter  Me"  will  be  released  at  the  end  of  April.  "It's  spreading  good  feelings  and  isn't  at  all  controversial.  It's  just  something  that  is  making  people  really  happy."Williams  has  partnered  with  the  United  Nations  Foundation  in  celebration  of  Thursday's  International  Day  of  Happiness,  encouraging  fans  to  donate  to  the  organization  and  submit  content  to  his  24Hoursof  Happiness.com  site.Visitors  were  asked  to  tag  their  submissions,  be  they  dancing,  singing  or  just  "being  happy"  with  the  #HappyDay.  At  noon  Thursday,  in  each  time  zone  around  the  world,  Williams  will  highlight  some  of  the  best."Happy"  is  also  one  of  the  lead  singles  on  Williams  new  album  "Girl,"  which  has  already  shot  to  No.  1  in  almost  80  countries  and  on  streaming  music  giant  Spotify.  The  singer  is  overwhelmed  by  the  goodwill."This  is  probably  the  most  I've  ever  been  humbled  in  my  entire  life,"  Williams  told  the  Los  Angeles  Times  about  his  song  and  the  reaction  to  it.  "Because  it's  something  bigger  than  me,  bigger  than  anything  I've  ever  done."No  doubt  that  makes  him  happy.</TEXT></DOC>

He  will  be  arraigned  on  the  new  count  on  Thursday.Chism  pleaded  not  guilty  in  December  to  murder,  aggravated  rape  and  robbery  charges  stemming  from  the  killing  of  the  popular  teacher.  Police  said  a  box  cutter  Chism  had  taken  to  school  was  the  murder  weapon.The  affidavit,  released  Monday,  said  that  after  being  booked  in  connection  with  the  crime,  Chism  "admitted  to  murdering"  his  teacher.  Chism,  in  the  presence  of  his  mother,  Diana  Chism,  waived  his  Miranda  rights.The  affidavit  also  said  Chism  may  have  sought  to  "memorialize"  the  crime  by  photographing  or  videotaping  parts  of  it  with  his  cell  phone,  which  was  later  destroyed  in  what  investigators  said  was  an  attempt  to  hide  incriminating  evidence.The  Essex  County  district  attorney's  office  said  Friday  that  it  presented  a  grand  jury  with  additional  evidence.  The  new  youthful  offender  indictment  alleges  that  Chism  forcibly  had  sexual  intercourse  with  the  victim."Aggravated  rape  is  charged  when  there  is  serious  bodily  harm  and/or  when  the  rape  was  committed  during  the  commission  of  another  felonious  and  assaultive  crime,"  the  district  attorney's  office  said  in  a  statement.Denise  Regan,  Chism's  public  defender,  could  not  be  reached  for  comment.Chism,  who  is  being  held  without  bail,  is  set  to  appear  January  30  in  Salem  Superior  Court  for  a  pre-trial  conference.According  to  a  police  affidavit,  a  ninth-grade  student  told  investigators  that  Chism  became  visibly  upset  when  Ritzer  spoke  after  class  on  the  day  of  the  crime  about  his  home  state  of  Tennessee.When  Ritzer  noticed  that  Chism  was  upset,  she  changed  the  subject,  said  the  unidentified  student,  who  described  Chism  as  "talking  to  himself."The  affidavit  includes  testimony  from  witnesses  as  well  as  a  school  video  surveillance  timeline  showing  Chism  and  Ritzer  in  the  same  area  of  the  school  during  the  teacher's  final  moments.In  the  video,  Ritzer  appears  to  enter  a  second-floor  girls'  restroom  --  apparently,  a  faculty  restroom  was  occupied  --  and  Chism,  wearing  gloves  and  red  sweatshirt  with  the  hood  pulled  over  his  head,  appears  to  enter  the  restroom  about  a  minute  later,  according  to  the  affidavit.Shortly  after,  a  female  student  enters  the  bathroom  and  then  quickly  walks  out,  according  to  the  court  papers.  She  told  investigators  she  saw  the  back  of  a  person  who  appeared  to  be  changing  clothes;  the  person's  rear  was  exposed,  with  clothes  piled  on  the  floor.The  video  shows  Chism  leaving  the  restroom,  returning  later  with  a  recycling  barrel,  and  again  leaving  the  restroom  pulling  the  barrel  --  this  time  with  a  black  mask  on  his  forehead,  the  court  papers  say.  He  pulls  the  barrel  outside  the  building  and  toward  the  student  parking  lot.  Investigators  said  the  video  shows  what  appear  to  be  blood  stains  near  the  bathroom  and  on  Chism's  pants.Court  papers  detail  horrifying  final  moments  of  teacher's  lifeAfter  Chism's  mother  reported  him  missing  on  the  evening  of  October  22,  police  had  his  cell  company  "ping"  the  location  of  his  phone.  The  phone  was  found  to  be  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Hollywood  Hits  Theater,  where  investigators  learned  the  teen  had  purchased  a  movie  ticket  and  then  left.The  affidavit  said  that,  when  Chism  was  spotted  by  a  police  officer  the  next  day,  he  was  carrying  a  knife;  a  search  of  his  backpack  turned  up  a  bloodstained  box  cutter.  Asked  where  the  blood  came  from,  Chism  allegedly  responded,  "The  girl."  He  was  also  allegedly  carrying  credit  cards  and  driver's  licenses  belonging  to  Ritzer,  as  well  as  a  pair  of  woman's  underwear.Friends,  relatives  bewildered  by  arrest  of  'storybook  kid'  in  teacher  slayingThe  armed  robbery  indictment  alleges  that  Chism  robbed  Ritzer  of  credit  cards,  an  iPhone  and  her  underwear.Police  discovered  Ritzer's  body  in  a  wooded  area  near  the  school,  covered  with  leaves  and  debris  in  an  apparent  attempt  to  conceal  it,  the  court  papers  said.

"This  is  a  tragic  and  sudden  loss  and  we  ask  that  you  respect  our  privacy  during  this  time  of  grieving."The  Oscar-winning  actor  last  talked  with  someone  at  8  p.m.  Saturday,  as  far  as  authorities  have  determined,  a  law  enforcement  official  said.He  was  expected  to  pick  up  his  children  Sunday  but  didn't  show  up,  the  official  said.  Playwright  David  Katz  and  another  person  went  to  the  apartment  and  found  him  dead,  the  official  said.Police  officers  found  him  in  a  T-shirt  and  shorts  with  his  eyeglasses  still  on  his  head.Police  also  found  several  empty  bags  branded  "Ace  of  Hearts"  --  a  street  name  for  heroin  --  in  the  apartment,  two  law  enforcement  sources  familiar  with  the  investigation  told  CNN.Also  in  the  apartment  were  close  to  50  envelopes,  branded  "Ace  of  Spades,"  containing  what  is  believed  to  be  heroin,  the  two  sources  said.Investigators  also  found  in  the  apartment,  which  was  leased  from  a  friend,  according  to  the  two  sources:•  More  than  20  used  syringes  in  a  plastic  cup.•  Several  other  bags  containing  white  powder.•  Prescription  drugs,  including  the  blood-pressure  medication  clonidine  hydrochloride;  the  addiction-treatment  drug  buprenorphine;  Vyvanse,  a  drug  used  to  treat  attention-deficit  (hyperactivity)  disorder;  hydroxyzine,  which  can  be  used  to  treat  anxiety;  and  methocarbamol,  a  muscle  relaxer.  Authorities  are  investigating  whether  Hoffman  had  prescriptions  for  these  drugs,  the  sources  said.Timeline  of  Hoffman's  final  days,  hoursThe  law  enforcement  sources  told  CNN  that  investigators  have  begun  to  piece  together  where  Hoffman  was  in  the  days  before  his  death  by  talking  to  his  family  and  friends.An  assistant  for  Hoffman  told  police  she  saw  him  Friday  at  his  apartment  and  there  was  nothing  out  of  the  ordinary.  He  also  seemed  fine  when  she  spoke  to  him  on  Saturday  at  about  1:30  p.m.  ET.But  Mimi  O'Donnell,  Hoffman's  ex-partner,  told  authorities  that  when  she  saw  him  near  his  apartment  at  2  p.m.  Saturday  she  thought  he  appeared  to  be  high.O'Donnell  said  she  spoke  with  him  on  the  phone  about  six  hours  later  and  again  thought  he  seemed  high,  the  sources  said.The  next  morning,  on  Sunday,  Hoffman  failed  to  show  up  at  her  home  to  pick  up  their  three  children.At  11  a.m.  she  asked  Katz  to  go  to  Hoffman's  apartment.  He  called  police  30  minutes  later.Investigators,  working  on  the  theory  that  Hoffman's  death  was  a  drug  overdose,  are  now  trying  to  find  exactly  where  he  bought  the  drugs,  the  sources  said.This  will  involve  searching  his  phone  in  addition  to  tracking  his  movements,  the  sources  told  CNN.Authorities  also  are  looking  into  whether  anyone  was  with  the  actor  when  he  died,  law  enforcement  officials  said.Philip  Seymour  Hoffman  'seemed  like  a  very  content  guy'Hoffman  loved  'deep,  dense  characters'Hoffman  won  an  Academy  Award  for  best  actor  for  the  2005  biopic  "Capote"  and  drew  critical  acclaim  for  his  roles  in  a  wide  variety  of  films.He  was  a  beefy  5-foot-10-inch  man  but  was  convincing  as  the  slight,  5-foot-3-inch  Truman  Capote.  He  had  a  booming  voice  like  a  deity's  but  often  played  schlumpy,  conflicted  characters."He  just  loved  those  deep,  dense  characters.  That's  where  I  think  he  found  his  true  calling,"  said  Bradley  Jacobs,  a  senior  editor  of  Us  Weekly.Hoffman's  big  break  in  Hollywood  came  with  a  small  role  as  Chris  O'Donnell's  classmate  in  the  1992  film  "Scent  of  a  Woman."For  years,  Hoffman  was  the  kind  of  anonymous  character  actor  who  earned  critical  raves  but  was  often  unnoticed  by  the  general  public.  He  used  his  abilities  to  take  chances  with  such  directors  as  a  then-unknown  Paul  Thomas  Anderson,  with  whom  he  worked  in  "Hard  Eight"  (and  several  ensuing  films)  and  Todd  Solondz  ("Happiness")."I  think  about  that  a  lot,"  he  told  Esquire  in  2012  of  his  anonymity.  "I  feel  it  cracking  lately,  the  older  I'm  getting.  I  think  I'm  less  anonymous  than  I  was."As  an  actor,  Hoffman  could  be  heartfelt  and  giving,  as  with  his  male  nurse  in  "Magnolia"  or  rock  critic  in  "Almost  Famous,"  or  creepily  Machiavellian,  like  the  gamemaster  in  the  latest  "Hunger  Games"  movie  or  a  "Mission:  Impossible"  movie  villain.Cameron  Crowe,  who  directed  "Almost  Famous,"  said  a  notable  scene  in  which  Hoffman's  character  Lester  Bangs  speaks  with  a  young  journalist  about  being  uncool  was  not  what  Crowe  had  initially  envisioned.  He  said  in  between  takes  Hoffman  listed  through  his  headphones  to  taped  interviews  with  Bangs,  a  well-known  rock  music  writer  who  died  in  1982.  Hoffman  didn't  speak."When  the  scene  was  over,  I  realized  that  Hoffman  had  pulled  off  a  magic  trick.  He'd  leapt  over  the  words  and  the  script,  and  gone  hunting  for  the  soul  and  compassion  of  the  private  Lester,  the  one  only  a  few  of  us  had  ever  met,"  Crowe  wrote  on  his  website.  "The  crew  and  I  will  always  be  grateful  for  that  front-row  seat  to  his  genius."Hoffman  also  appeared  in  "Charlie  Wilson's  War,"  "Doubt"  and  "The  Master,"  for  which  he  was  nominated  as  best  supporting  actor.He  appeared  last  month  at  the  Sundance  Film  Festival,  where  a  movie  he  starred  in,  "God's  Pocket,"  premiered."He  seemed  really  in  good  spirits,  and  it's  just  so  shocking,"  said  CNN  Entertainment  commentator  Krista  Smith,  who  interviewed  Hoffman  at  the  festival.  "Because,  just  looking  at  his  body  of  work  and  knowing  how  many  actors  revered  him  and  how  they  look  up  to  him.  ...  The  one  thing  that  was  so  special  about  him  is  that  he  crossed  all  platforms.  ...  Every  genre,  he  managed  to  fit  in  and  just  be  brilliant  at  whatever  he  was  doing."Beloved  resident  of  New  York  neighborhoodBut  despite  his  love  of  performance,  Hoffman  was  a  private  person  who  rarely  spoke  about  his  family,  Jacobs  said.In  New  York's  Greenwich  Village  neighborhood,  where  he  lived,  it  was  common  to  see  the  actor  riding  a  bicycle  and  walking  his  children  to  the  public  school  they  attended."He'd  go  quietly  about  his  business  with  his  children.  I  still  remember  the  day  he  won  the  Oscar,  him  walking  his  kids  to  school,  not  long  after.  And  people  were  giving  him  high  fives,"  said  CNN's  Rose  Arce,  whose  daughter  attended  school  with  Hoffman's  children.After  his  Oscar  win  at  the  Academy  Awards  in  2006,  Hoffman  thanked  his  mother  for  taking  him  to  his  first  play."She  brought  up  four  kids  alone,  and  she  deserves  a  congratulations  for  that.  ...  And  she  took  me  to  my  first  play,  and  she  stayed  up  with  me  and  watched  the  NCAA  Final  Four,  and  my  passions,  her  passions  became  my  passions.  And,  you  know,  be  proud,  Mom,  because  I'm  proud  of  you,  and  we're  here  tonight,  and  it's  so  good,"  he  said  in  his  acceptance  speech.Hoffman's  father  was  a  salesman,  and  his  mother  was  a  family  court  judge,  according  to  a  biography  on  the  Turner  Classic  Movies  website.  He  landed  his  first  professional  stage  role  before  graduating  from  high  school  and  went  on  to  study  acting  at  New  York  University.Hoffman  stayed  active  on  stage  even  as  his  star  rose  in  Hollywood.  He  starred  in  a  Broadway  production  of  "Death  of  a  Salesman"  in  2012  and  was  co-artistic  director  of  the  Labyrinth  Theater  Company  in  New  York.Battling  addictionLast  year,  Hoffman  revealed  that  he  had  entered  rehab  to  deal  with  a  drug  problem,  telling  TMZ  that  he'd  kicked  a  substance  abuse  habit  for  23  years  but  recently  relapsed.In  a  2011  interview  with  "60  Minutes,"  he  discussed  his  past  struggles  with  drug  and  alcohol  addiction."Anything  I  could  get  my  hands  on,  I  liked  it  all,"  he  said.Asked  why  he  decided  to  sober  up,  he  replied,  "You  get  panicked.  ...  I  was  22,  and  I  got  panicked  for  my  life,  it  really  was,  it  was  just  that.  And  I  always  think,  'God,  I  have  so  much  empathy  for  these  young  actors  that  are  19  and  all  of  a  sudden  are  beautiful  and  famous  and  rich.'  I'm  like,  'Oh,  my  God.  I'd  be  dead.'  "According  to  TMZ,  Hoffman  said  last  year  that  he'd  fallen  off  the  wagon,  started  taking  prescription  pills  and  slipped  into  snorting  heroin.The  actor's  public  comments  about  his  battle  with  substance  abuse  illustrate  the  struggles  many  addicts  face,  according  to  HLN's  Dr.  Drew  Pinsky,  an  addiction  specialist."Someone  with  opiate  addiction,  they  are  doing  pushups  their  whole  lives.  And  they  must  work  on  it  all  the  time.  And  even  working  on  it,  there's  a  high  probability  of  relapse.  And  God  willing,  they  get  adequate  treatment,  and  they  re-engage  in  treatment,  and  things  go  well,"  Pinsky  said.  "But  often,  it's  a  frequently  fatal  condition.  We  just  simply  have  to  continually  remind  ourselves  of  that.  And  now  it  has  taken  a  glorious,  glorious  talent  from  us."After  he  returned  from  rehab,  Hoffman  rented  the  apartment  where  his  body  was  found  Sunday,  two  neighbors  said.  The  rest  of  his  family  lived  elsewhere  in  the  neighborhood.'He  was  a  giant  talent'Word  of  Hoffman's  death  sparked  a  flood  of  reactions  from  actors,  directors,  studio  chiefs  and  fans."This  is  a  horrible  day  for  those  who  worked  with  Philip,"  actor  Tom  Hanks  said  in  a  prepared  statement.  "He  was  a  giant  talent.  Our  hearts  are  open  for  his  family."Lionsgate,  the  studio  behind  "The  Hunger  Games"  movies,  described  Hoffman  as  "a  singular  talent  and  one  of  the  most  gifted  actors  of  our  generation."Robert  De  Niro,  who  starred  opposite  Hoffman  in  the  1999  movie  "Flawless,"  said  he  was  "very,  very  saddened"  by  Hoffman's  death."This  is  one  of  those  times  where  you  say  'this  just  shouldn't  be.  He  was  so  young  and  gifted  and  had  so  much  going,  so  much  to  live  for.'  "For  Mike  Nichols,  who  directed  Hoffman  in  his  Oscar-nominated  turn  in  "Charlie  Wilson's  War,"  there  were  no  words,  just  grief."No  words  for  this.  He  was  too  great  and  we're  too  shattered,"  he  said  in  an  e-mailed  statement.Heroin  use  on  the  rise,  authorities  warnAuthorities  have  warned  that  heroin  addiction  is  soaring  and  noted  an  uptick  in  the  availability  of  the  drug.Last  week,  the  Drug  Enforcement  Administration  announced  a  heroin  mill  bust  in  the  Bronx,  New  York,  after  the  agency  seized  $8  million  worth  of  the  drug.The  DEA  has  warned  that  people  who  are  addicted  to  opioid  prescription  pills  are  now  finding  highly  pure  heroin  easier  and  cheaper  to  obtain.It  produces  a  similar,  if  more  dangerous,  high  because  unlike  with  the  pills,  there  is  no  way  to  regulate  the  dosage  of  heroin,  given  the  undetermined  purity.CNN's  Jennifer  Henderson,  Chelsea  J.  Carter,  Susan  Candiotti,  Todd  Leopold,  Carolyn  Sung,  Matthew  Carey,  Evan  Perez  and  Jason  Hanna  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Kelly  is  another  Christie  appointee  fighting  a  legislative  subpoena.Agents  visited  her  house  and  spoke  with  her  parents;  they  also  visited  her  father's  job  last  month,  Critchley  said.The  U.S.  attorney's  office  in  New  Jersey  contacted  Critchley  to  see  whether  Kelly  would  be  interested  in  talking,  and  he  told  them  she  was  not,  he  said.These  visits  are  the  first  indications  that  investigators  have  been  looking  to  question  those  with  close  ties  to  Christie.Stepien  managed  both  Christie  gubernatorial  campaigns,  but  Christie  asked  him  to  leave  his  political  organization  in  January  after  his  name  surfaced  in  e-mails  around  the  scandal  involving  abrupt  traffic  lane  closures  near  the  George  Washington  Bridge  in  Fort  Lee  last  September.Kelly  was  Christie's  deputy  chief  of  staff  for  legislative  and  intergovernmental  affairs,  and  her  name  surfaced  in  those  e-mails  as  well.  Christie  fired  her  after  the  e-mails  became  public.Both  federal  and  legislative  investigators  are  probing  suggestions  that  top  Christie  appointees  orchestrated  the  lane  closures  as  part  of  a  political  scheme  to  punish  the  mayor  of  Fort  Lee  for  not  endorsing  Christie  for  re-election.Stepien  has  not  been  accused  of  any  wrongdoing,  and  Christie  denies  knowing  about  the  traffic  gridlock  until  after  it  happened.Christie,  a  Republican  viewed  as  a  possible  presidential  candidate  in  2016,  also  has  said  repeatedly  he  knew  nothing  about  any  related  political  mischief  by  people  working  on  behalf  of  the  state.Critchley  said  he  plans  to  file  court  papers  on  Thursday.The  U.S.  attorney's  office  in  Newark  had  no  comment  on  the  Stepien  matter.</TEXT></DOC>

A  No-Pressure  Guide  to  Being  Your  Best  Self"  and  "Does  This  Pregnancy  Make  Me  Look  Fat?  The  Essential  Guide  to  Loving  Your  Body  Before  and  After  Baby."  She  oversees  content  for  Proud2Bme,  a  program  of  the  National  Eating  Disorders  Association.  Follow  her  on  Twitter  @clairemysko.(CNN)  --  In  two  recent  studies,  researchers  at  Florida  State  University  explored  whether  eating  disorders  are  linked  to  social  media  use.  The  answer?  Like  that  most  awkward  of  Facebook  statuses  says,  it's  complicated.Summaries  in  the  International  Journal  of  Eating  Disorders  described  the  research.  In  the  first  study,  960  college  women  completed  a  self-reported  eating  disorder  screening  assessment.  They  also  answered  a  series  of  questions  about  their  Facebook  use.  A  "small  but  significant"  positive  correlation  was  found  between  duration  of  Facebook  use  and  disordered  eating.In  the  second,  84  women  from  the  first  study  were  divided  into  two  groups.  One  group  was  instructed  to  use  Facebook  as  they  typically  would  for  20  minutes.  The  other  group  was  told  to  research  the  ocelot,  a  rainforest  cat,  on  Wikipedia  and  YouTube.  Unsurprisingly,  the  women  who  spent  20  minutes  on  Facebook  reported  greater  body  dissatisfaction  than  those  who  got  to  look  at  cute  cat  photos.The  research  shows  that  there  is  some  connection  between  Facebook  use  and  disordered  eating  risk.  (I  don't  believe  there  is  anything  uniquely  problematic  about  Facebook  as  compared  to  other  social  media  platforms;  it's  just  the  platform  these  researchers  chose.)But  the  studies  do  not  suggest  that  social  media  platforms  should  be  held  responsible  for  causing  eating  disorders.  After  all,  we're  talking  about  a  wide  spectrum  of  illnesses  that  have  complex  biological,  psychological  and  cultural  roots.  A  simplistic  blame  game  would  be  seriously  misguided.  We  need  more  research  to  better  understand  this  connection  and,  perhaps  more  important,  how  social  media  can  be  used  as  a  positive  tool  for  outreach,  early  intervention  and  recovery.I  work  with  college  students  every  day  in  my  job  overseeing  the  National  Eating  Disorders  Association's  youth  outreach.  For  those  who  struggle  with  poor  body  image,  perfectionism  or  anxiety  --  just  a  few  of  the  many  risk  factors  associated  with  disordered  eating  --  social  media  can  be  downright  toxic.  Facebook,  Instagram,  Tumblr,  Twitter,  Pinterest  and  their  many  new  cousins  do  provide  an  unprecedented  degree  of  access  to  images  and  messages  that  can  entrench  and  sometimes  trigger  disordered  eating  thoughts  and  behaviors.  Frequent  users  of  social  media  can  end  up  feeling  as  though  they're  alternating  between  broadcast  and  comparison  modes,  which  are  both  dangerous  places  to  be  if  you  are  prone  to  believing  that  your  self-worth  is  based  on  others'  approval."When  I  look  at  other  people's  albums  on  Facebook,  the  comparing  is  automatic.  I  end  up  feeling  like  crap."  This  comment  came  to  me  from  an  18-year-old  who  participated  in  a  Proud2Bme  virtual  roundtable  on  how  social  media  affects  teens'  body  image.  It  is  a  sentiment  I  hear  expressed  constantly  in  my  work.Back  when  I  was  caught  up  in  my  own  eating  disorder  as  a  teen,  I  used  to  stare  at  my  thighs  in  the  mirror,  wishing  they  could  be  as  thin  as  those  of  models  in  the  pictures  I  tore  out  of  magazines.  There  were  no  hashtags  like  #thighgap,  which  have  turned  appearance-related  fixations  into  searchable  universes  with  neverending  streams  of  photos  and  "thinspirational"  text.  I  wanted  desperately  to  be  liked,  but  there  were  no  "likes"  or  "hearts"  for  me  log  on  to  watch  and  tally.  The  point  is  that  the  obsessions,  compulsions  and  comparisons  that  drive  eating  disorders  are  nothing  new.  Social  media  have  just  amplified  them.  But  it  also  has  the  potential  to  amplify  solutions.  We  need  to  figure  out  how  we  can  most  effectively  use  it  to  promote  media  literacy,  self-acceptance,  support,  recovery  and  body  image  activism.Some  might  choose  to  unplug  from  social  media  to  protect  their  mental  health;  there's  a  reason  that  most  residential  eating  disorder  treatment  centers  ban  social  media  use  among  patients.  But  the  reality  is  that  most  people  at  risk  or  actively  struggling  with  disordered  eating  use  social  media  in  some  way.The  good  news  is  that  social  media  give  us  all  the  ability  to  be  content  curators,  media  makers  and  rabble  rousers.  If  you  want  to  fill  your  feed  with  messages  of  body  acceptance,  you  can  choose  pages  and  accounts  to  follow  that  will  deliver  those  messages.  Sure,  I  still  have  to  report  spammy  "belly  busting"  advertising,  but  the  content  I  see  and  share  through  social  media  reflects  my  values  and  interests  --  and  I  have  no  interest  in  seeing  anything  related  to  weight  loss  or  body  shaming.  Rather  than  consuming  and  internalizing  media  toxicity,  we  can  use  social  media  talk  back  to  a  culture  that  makes  us  feel  like  we're  never  good  enough.For  example,  19-year-old  Benjamin  O'Keefe,  who  is  recovering  from  anorexia,  started  a  Change.org  petition  reprimanding  Abercrombie  &  Fitch's  CEO  for  comments  saying  the  company  was  intentionally  exclusionary  and  calling  for  it  to  include  plus  sizes.  More  than  80,000  people  signed  his  petition,  and  Abercrombie  recently  announced  that  it  will  carry  plus  sizes,  starting  this  spring.Just  last  week  was  National  Eating  Disorders  Awareness  Week.  It  was  the  most  successful  in  the  organization's  history;  the  #NEDAwareness  hashtag  had  a  reach  of  23  million  during  that  week,  and  that  social  media  awareness  does  translate  to  an  increase  in  people  seeking  help.  We  saw  it  in  the  increased  volume  of  calls  to  the  helpline  and  visits  to  the  website.  We  saw  it  in  the  stories  and  photos  of  hope  shared  on  Twitter,  Tumblr,  Instagram  and  Facebook.Social  media  can  stoke  body  dissatisfaction  and  reinforce  disordered  eating.  It  can  also  empower  individuals  to  use  their  voices  and  resist  mainstream  media  messages  about  beauty  and  thinness.  Let's  keep  working  to  understand  the  nuances  of  those  risks  and  leverage  the  benefits  to  build  a  movement  of  change.The  opinions  expressed  are  solely  those  of  Claire  Mysko.</TEXT></DOC>

But  do  you  really  know  your  own  decorating  style?Perhaps  it  was  easy  to  see  that  your  mom  had  a  taste  for  historic,  Colonial  decorating.  Maybe  you've  always  marveled  at  the  way  a  friend  embraced  midcentury  modern  style  to  create  the  perfect  "Mad  Men"  pad.But  if  your  decor  seems  to  lack  that  kind  of  continuity  and  flair,  you're  not  alone.Fight  feeling  overwhelmedIn  this  day  and  age,  asking  someone  to  name  their  decorating  style  is  almost  a  trick  question,  said  Better  Homes  and  Gardens  home  content  director  Jill  Waage.Thanks  to  nebulous  decorator  terms  such  as  "eclectic"  or  "personalization,"  interior  decor  isn't  as  easy  to  typify  as  it  was  even  10  years  ago.  (Remember  "Moroccan  style"?)  That  makes  decorating  harder  than  it  used  to  be,  Waage  said.Since  1924,  Better  Homes  and  Gardens  (first  published  under  the  name  "Fruit,  Garden  and  Home"  in  1922)  has  been  giving  all  manner  of  home  economics  and  homemaking  advice.  Readers'  questions  have  always  betrayed  an  anxiety  over  home  decor."Pick  a  decade,"  Waage  said.  "People  are  still  looking  for  tips  about  how  to  use  color,  arrange  furniture,  always  looking  to  make  their  home  better."What's  different  in  2014,  Waage  said,  is  that  homeowners  itching  for  a  living  room  makeover  are  indelibly  changed  by  the  design  information  available  to  them.By  now  a  generation  has  grown  up  witnessing  complete  home  redecorations  within  the  span  of  a  30-minute  television  show.  Early  adopters  of  Pinterest  and  devotees  of  tutorial-disseminating  decor  blogs  are  largely  empowered  --  or  sometimes  overwhelmed  --  by  this  media,  Waage  said.The  magazine  still  delivers  decorating  tips  and  examples,  but  instead  of  a  few  fresh  looks  every  month,  tips  now  include  online  color  choice  generators  and  automatic  room  planners.Even  with  a  new  understanding  of  the  mechanics  of  decorating,  it's  still  difficult  to  orchestrate  the  room  of  your  dreams,  or  even  realize  what  it  is  you  like  in  the  first  place,  she  said.So  what's  a  DIY  decorater  to  do?Be  brave  enough  to  tryBravery  and  experience  are  what  helped  self-taught  blogger,  photographer  and  decorator  Emily  Clark  handle  her  home  decor.  Figuring  out  which  interior  styles  influence  you  is  born  from  self  confidence  that  only  comes  with  age,  she  said.She  no  longer  focuses  on  the  giant  set  of  matching  furniture  she  and  her  husband  bought  as  newlyweds  in  their  first  grown-up  home.  She  encourages  slowing  down  to  make  decorating  a  gradual  process."It's  about  not  second-guessing  yourself.  As  you  get  older,  you  get  more  confident  in  your  decisions,"  Clark  said.It  has  been  15  years  since  she  lived  in  her  first  apartment,  and  her  family  now  lives  in  its  second  home  --  and  Clark  finally  feels  comfortable  broadcasting  her  style  to  people  around  the  world  through  her  blog."A  lot  of  people  get  stumped  or  scared  they're  going  to  mess  up,"  when  applying  their  tastes  to  interior  decor,  Clark  said.  But  discovering  what  you  appreciate  about  decor  means  you  have  to  be  brave  enough  to  try  decorating  in  the  first  place,  she  said."Taking  chances  and  enjoying  where  you  are  and  what  you're  looking  at  every  day.  It's  better  than  sitting  around  looking  at  blank  walls,  worried  about  what  to  do,"  she  said."My  philosophy  has  been,  if  I  don't  love  it  to  begin  with,  it  can't  get  any  worse.  If  I  have  a  piece  of  furniture  sitting  here  that  I  detest  to  begin  with,  slapping  a  coat  of  paint  on  it  isn't  going  to  make  it  any  worse."Through  clipping  magazine  images  from  Southern  Living  or  House  Beautiful  and  looking  online  when  she  decorated  her  first  home,  she  uncovered  some  obvious  patterns,  she  said."There  are  things  I  am  naturally  drawn  to,"  she  said,  "I  love  black  and  white  stripes,  I  love  blues,  I  love  textures.  I  like  a  good  mix  of  things."What  she  doesn't  like,  even  among  her  decor  blogging  peers,  is  the  accelerated  pace  of  decorating  trends  and  how  many  bloggers  adopt  them,  making  those  ideas  feel  a  lot  less  personal."I  want  to  know  what  you  like,  I  don't  want  to  know  that  you  bought  every  Nate  Berkus  piece  at  Target,"  Clark  said.When  she  finds  a  blogger  whose  home  shows  a  distinct  personality,  "it  motivates  me  to  get  off  the  computer  and  do  stuff  to  my  own  house,"  she  said.  "That's  a  good  house!"It's  OK  to  call  the  prosAlexis  Kraft,  owner  of  the  Kraft  Studio  design  firm  and  an  interior  design  professor  at  Parsons  The  New  School  for  Design  in  New  York,  teaches  his  students  not  only  how  to  recognize  and  manifest  the  decorating  styles  of  clients,  but  also  how  to  do  the  same  for  themselves."A  designer  starts  to  realize  early  on  in  their  education  and  in  their  career  that  they  need  to  have  a  sense  of  style,"  he  said.  "They  need  to  embrace  and  embody  (a  design  style)  that  then  becomes  marketable  for  them:  Their  style  becomes  part  of  what  (potential  clients)  are  attracted  to."That  ability  is  something  of  a  superpower,  he  said.  "I  like  to  think  anyone  can  be  an  interior  designer,  but  it's  not  something  everyone  can  do,"  he  said.He  likens  interior  decor  to  music.  "We  all  have  opinions  of  (whether  or  not)  music  is  good,"  he  said.  "Not  all  of  us  can  be  musicians."The  interest  in  design,  an  innate  sense  about  art  and  an  ability  to  understand  the  relationship  between  objects  and  space  is  part  of  why  interior  design  is  such  a  specific  career  path,  he  said.  Interior  designers  spend  years  in  school  and  internships  learning  little  details  like  where  to  mount  a  toilet  paper  holder  or  how  a  kitchen  tile  can  keep  a  remodeled  kitchen  looking  fresh  for  decades.Kraft  can  not  deny  the  grip  that  a  modern,  DIY  attitude  has  on  Americans.  Miraculous  TV  makeovers  or  bloggers  who  document  their  decorating  adventures  are  compelling,  motivating  voices  in  the  interior  design  conversation,  he  said.But  there's  a  chasm  between  the  way  we  talk  about  design  and  the  effort  it  takes  to  create  a  beautiful  room  in  your  own  home."There  is  still  an  art  to  it  that  has  to  be  developed,"  he  said.If  you're  not  happy  with  the  look  of  your  home,  you  can  work  to  hone  that  artistic  ability  --  or  you  can  call  for  backup.  Sometimes,  he  said,  hiring  an  interior  designer  is  the  way  to  discover  your  style.What's  your  decorating  style?

Yet.</TITLE><TIME>Tue,  04  Mar  2014  14:43:22  EST</TIME><ABSTRACT>Four  members  of  Congress  are  leading  efforts  to  establish  the  National  Women's  History  Museum  in  Washington.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Rep.  Marsha  Blackburn  (R-Tennessee),  Rep.  Carolyn  Maloney  (D-New  York),  Sen.  Susan  Collins  (R-Maine)  and  Sen.  Barbara  Mikulski  (D-Maryland)  are  part  of  a  bipartisan  effort  in  Congress  to  establish  the  National  Women's  History  Museum  in  Washington.(CNN)  --  Did  you  know  that  the  "frequency  hopping"  technology  that  is  vital  to  much  of  our  military  technology  and  helps  keep  your  cell  phone  and  your  GPS  devices  secure  was  developed  and  patented  by  a  famous  movie  star?Did  you  know  that  there  was  an  amazing  16-year-old  patriot  who  outdid  Paul  Revere,  riding  45  miles  in  the  pouring  rain  to  warn  New  York  colonial  militias  that  "the  British  are  coming"?Did  you  know  that  there  was  a  secret  agent,  code  named  "355,"  who  worked  for  George  Washington's  band  of  spies,  the  Culper  Ring?  The  agent  supplied  key  intelligence  on  British  activities  during  the  Revolutionary  War,  and  she  was  so  good  at  keeping  a  secret  that  we  still  don't  know  her  real  name.If  you  don't  know  about  all  these  people,  it's  understandable.  Their  stories  aren't  told  widely  or  often  --  perhaps  because  they  were  all  women.  For  some  reason  or  other,  when  the  story  of  our  country  is  told,  women  --  really  great  women  --  have  tended  to  be  left  out  of  the  telling.You  see  the  results  everywhere  you  look:--  A  survey  of  U.S.  history  textbooks  found  that  only  10%  of  the  individuals  identified  in  the  texts  were  women.--  Less  than  8%  of  the  2,560  national  historic  landmarks  chronicle  the  achievements  of  women.--  Of  the  210  statues  in  the  U.S.  Capitol,  only  15  are  of  female  leaders.That's  the  bad  news.  The  good  news  is  that  thanks  to  a  strong  bipartisan  effort  in  Congress,  we  may  soon  be  one  step  closer  to  addressing  this  imbalance  by  establishing  a  National  Women's  History  Museum  in  Washington.  Together,  we  have  introduced  a  common-sense  bill  to  move  this  idea  forward.We  have  more  than  73  bipartisan  co-sponsors  in  the  House,  19  in  the  Senate  and  a  national  coalition  of  women's  groups  behind  us.  We  recognize  money  is  tight  --  that's  why  we're  not  asking  for  taxpayer  support.  Private  donations  would  fund  the  museum's  construction  and  operation.A  vital  part  of  recognizing  equal  rights  for  women  is  acknowledging  and  commemorating  the  deep  and  lasting  contributions  women  have  made  throughout  history.  When  young  people  visit  our  nation's  capital,  they  should  have  a  chance  to  be  just  as  inspired  by  women's  accomplishments  as  men's.We  establish  and  operate  museums,  not  just  as  some  kind  of  giant  drawer  in  which  to  store  our  memorabilia,  but  as  way  to  celebrate  our  accomplishments,  affirm  our  shared  values  and  preserve  the  full  and  accurate  story  of  our  common  history.  And  unfortunately,  only  half  of  that  story  is  presently  being  told.The  stories  of  courageous  and  pioneering  Americans  such  as  abolitionist  Harriet  Tubman,  astronaut  Sally  Ride,  Supreme  Court  Justice  Sandra  Day  O'Connor  and  the  founder  of  the  Girl  Scouts,  Juliette  Gordon  Low,  will  inform  and  inspire  future  generations.The  remarkable  women  who  helped  to  make  this  country  what  it  is  today  deserve  to  have  their  histories  told  and  preserved  for  the  ages.  Their  stories  of  success  are  the  stories  that  will  inspire  and  encourage  millions  of  women.  Our  daughters  and  our  sons  deserve  the  chance  to  learn  the  story  --  the  full  story  --  of  how  this  amazing  country  came  to  be.And  by  the  way,  the  movie  star  inventor?  That  was  Hedy  Lamarr.The  16  year-old  who  rode  farther  than  Paul  Revere  was  Sybil  Ludington.And  the  spy,  code  named  "355"?  Well,  we  still  don't  know  the  name  --  but  we  know  the  patriot  was  a  "she."And  just  wait  until  you  see  all  the  other  amazing  women  and  American  history  you'll  learn  about  one  day  soon  when  the  National  Women's  History  Museum  opens.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Rep.

"It's  called  stacking.  You  can  stack  the  same  drug  too  close  together,  or  you  can  start  to  stack  other  drugs,  one  on  top  of  the  other.  That's  how  people  get  into  trouble.  They  do  call  it  accidental  death  as  well."Police  found  nearly  50  envelopes  branded  "Ace  of  Spades"  filled  with  what  they  believe  was  heroin  in  the  actor's  Manhattan  apartment,  two  law  enforcement  sources  familiar  with  the  inquiry  said.Used  syringes,  prescription  drugs  and  empty  bags  that  authorities  suspect  were  used  to  hold  heroin  also  were  found  in  the  apartment  where  Hoffman,  46,  was  found  dead,  sources  said.He  was  expected  to  pick  up  his  children  that  day  but  didn't  show  up,  the  official  said.  Playwright  David  Katz  and  another  person  went  to  the  apartment  and  found  him  dead,  the  official  said.Police  officers  found  him  in  a  T-shirt  and  shorts  with  his  eyeglasses  still  on  his  head.Robert  Vineberg,  a  57-year-old  musician,  was  arrested  in  connection  with  Hoffman's  death  and  released  on  bail  earlier  this  month.  Vineberg  was  among  four  people  arrested  in  Manhattan  in  the  days  after  Hoffman's  death.Prosecutors  said  Vineberg,  who  was  arrested  on  a  felony  charge  of  criminal  possession  of  a  controlled  substance,  had  just  under  50  small  bags  of  heroin  as  well  as  packaging  paraphernalia  in  his  apartment  during  a  raid.  In  another  one  of  his  apartments  in  the  same  Mott  Street  building,  prosecutors  said,  250  small  bags  of  heroin  were  found.Vineberg  was  found  to  have  the  actor's  phone  number  stored  in  his  cell  phone,  a  law  enforcement  official  told  CNN.Two  other  people  arrested  in  connection  with  Hoffman's  death  --  Juliana  Luchkiw  and  Max  Rosenblum,  both  22  --  were  released  earlier  this  month  until  their  next  court  dates.Prosecutors  did  not  file  charges  against  a  fourth  person  arrested  in  the  raid.Hoffman  was  mourned  in  New  York  February  7  in  a  star-studded  private  funeral  attended  by  family  and  close  friends.Hoffman,  who  was  nominated  for  Academy  Awards  four  times,  won  the  Oscar  for  best  actor  in  2006  for  his  portrayal  of  writer  Truman  Capote  in  "Capote."

But  their  message  --  plus  a  flood  of  outside  spending  by  Democrats  focused  on  the  issue  of  Social  Security  --  is  drowning  out  other  issues  in  the  race,  Republican  candidate  David  Jolly  says.His  Democratic  opponent,  Alex  Sink,  isn't  shying  away  from  the  health  care  debate,  touting  the  law's  benefits  and  saying  she's  open  to  improvements.Both  parties  are  looking  at  this  race  as  a  testing  ground  for  their  messages  going  into  the  midterm  elections.  Florida's  13th  District  is  one  of  a  small  number  of  competitive  ones,  and  Republicans  and  Democrats  say  the  tight  race  here  will  come  down  to  which  campaign  gets  its  supporters  out.Both  sides  have  spent  more  than  $11  million  on  media  and  direct  mail,  according  to  data  from  the  Sunlight  Foundation.  The  bulk  of  that  spending  comes  from  outside  groups  hoping  to  shape  two  very  different  narratives.Eight  things  to  watch  between  now  and  Election  DayRepublican  groups  and  Jolly's  campaign  have  concentrated  on  tying  Sink  to  Obamacare  and  its  rocky  rollout  and  to  President  Barack  Obama  and  House  Democratic  Leader  Nancy  Pelosi,  who  have  low  approval  ratings  among  independent  voters.Jolly  thinks  the  health  care  law  is  a  top  issue  for  voters,  but  the  message  he  was  trying  to  deliver  last  week  at  a  senior  center  focused  heavily  on  local  issues.  "There  is  a  lot  more  going  on  here  that  just  Obamacare,"  he  said.Jolly  served  as  a  longtime  aide  to  GOP  Rep.  Bill  Young,  whose  death  last  October  after  representing  the  area  for  more  than  40  years  prompted  the  special  election.  At  the  senior  event,  Jolly  pointed  out  his  connection  to  Young  and  the  federal  resources  the  late  congressman  helped  to  deliver  for  the  district,  saying  Young  was  "nearly  a  father  to  me."Borger:  Congress  takes  the  year  offBut  Democrats  are  trying  to  make  Jolly's  work  as  a  Washington  lobbyist  after  he  left  Young's  staff  the  driving  issue  in  the  campaign,  arguing  he  backed  changes  to  Social  Security  that  could  cut  benefits.The  district  has  one  of  the  highest  concentrations  of  voters  over  age  65  in  the  country.  Talk  about  changing  retirement  benefits  or  any  concerns  that  Obamacare  provisions  could  affect  health  care  coverage  resonate  strongly  with  voters  here.Pre-emptive  strategy  on  ObamacareStanding  next  to  former  Florida  Democratic  Sen.  Bob  Graham  at  an  event  with  seniors  at  her  campaign  office,  Sink  called  the  current  programs  "an  American  promise"  and  said,  "those  programs  were  put  in  place  for  a  good  reason,  and  I'm  going  to  fight  to  protect  the  integrity  of  the  Social  Security  and  Medicare  programs  for  all  of  us."Sink,  who  served  as  Florida's  chief  financial  officer  and  ran  unsuccessfully  for  governor  in  2010,  recognizes  that  Obamacare  is  a  major  issue.  She  acknowledges  that  the  Obama  administration's  proposal  to  cut  the  popular  Medicare  Advantage  is  a  major  worry  among  older  voters,  who  she  says  will  make  up  half  of  the  electorate  in  the  race.  Other  Democratic  candidates  tend  to  avoid  the  O-word,  but  Sink  talks  about  the  law's  benefits  and  argues  she  won't  go  back  to  the  old  system.Crist:  Democrats  'ought  to  strengthen  up'  and  support  ObamacareSink's  strategy  on  Obamacare  appears  to  be  pre-emptive:  she  stresses  how  the  health  care  law  will  help  people  but  also  notes  it  has  some  major  flaws  that  need  fixing.She  said  she  is  open  to  Republican-backed  plans  to  change  the  law's  current  requirement  that  employers  provide  health  insurance  to  employees  who  work  more  than  30  hours  a  week.  She  also  said  Obamacare's  current  requirement  that  businesses  with  more  than  50  employees  offer  health  insurance  is  "an  arbitrary  number"  and  says  she  wants  to  work  across  party  lines  to  adjust  the  law  to  avoid  any  "unintended  consequences,"  such  as  keeping  businesses  from  expanding.Obama:  Democrats  'sleepy'  during  midtermsJolly  reiterates  the  Republican  mantra  that  Obamacare  must  be  repealed  altogether.  Because  his  own  campaign  hasn't  raised  nearly  as  much  money  as  Sink's,  the  bulk  of  the  ads  and  direct  mail  attacking  Sink  are  from  the  National  Republican  Campaign  Committee  and  other  allies  like  the  U.S.  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  the  American  Action  Network,  which  backs  GOP  candidates  in  House  races.Although  he  concedes  it's  not  likely  to  happen,  Jolly  says  he  remains  committed  to  getting  rid  of  Obamacare  entirely.  He  ticks  through  his  plan  to  cover  younger  workers  with  a  small  government  program  and  says  he  wants  to  make  sure  those  with  pre-existing  conditions  can  always  obtain  insurance.Some  Republicans  worry  about  repeal-Obamacare  strategyHe  said  Obamacare  shows  "two  very  different  views  of  government.  We  can  talk  about  specific  health  care  solutions,  but  it  really  comes  down  to  a  view  of  government  that  says  we  need  more  government  in  individual  lives.  We  need  individual  mandates  and  we  need  more  interference  between  government  and  families  versus  a  view  of  government  that  says  no,  we  don't.  That's  wrong.  "Some  Republicans  worry  that  the  bright  line  the  party  is  drawing  about  repealing  Obamacare  isn't  the  right  tactic.Bob  Sikora,  a  resident  at  the  Regency  Oaks  senior  community  who  supports  Jolly,  told  CNN  he  thinks  the  GOP  should  be  talking  about  improving  the  law  instead  of  scrapping  it  entirely."I  would  certainly  think  personally  if  I  were  in  charge  of  his  campaign,  I  would  not  have  said,  'I'm  out  to  repeal  it'  --  he's  been  forced  to  say  that  by  some  of  the  party  higher-ups  that  control  the  tea  party,  which  is  controlling  what  Republicans  are  saying  right  now,"  Sikora  said.Sink  told  CNN  the  concerns  about  the  health  care  law  are  lower  on  the  priority  list  for  people  in  the  district.  She  puts  it  as  "fifth"  on  the  list  of  things  voters  raise  with  her  at  forums,  after  homeowners'  worries  about  the  skyrocketing  costs  of  flood  insurance,  veterans  issues,  and  the  fear  that  any  plans  to  start  offshore  drilling  could  hurt  the  tourism  industry  in  this  beach  community.But  one  Sink  supporter,  Julie  Meyer,  who  runs  a  retail  shop  in  St.  Petersburg,  told  CNN  she  thinks  voters  and  the  candidates  should  be  talking  about  Obamacare."I  would  like  the  conversation.  I  think  there  are  blatant  lies  about  what  is  being  said  about  Obamacare  and  that's  very,  very  unfortunate,  because  people  should  be  able  to  decide  with  the  real  information,"  Meyer  said.Texas  kicks  off  first  primary  of  2014Democrats  had  a  head  startDemocrats  had  the  advantage  going  into  the  race  because  they  did  not  have  to  spend  time  and  money  on  a  primary.  Jolly  endured  a  contentious  primary  in  January  and  didn't  have  any  significant  resources  going  into  the  general  election.  With  no  primary  opposition,  the  Sink  campaign  went  to  work  against  Jolly  early  and  stuck  with  the  line  of  attack  that  electing  him  would  send  someone  to  Washington  who  wanted  to  cut  Social  Security.The  Democratic  Congressional  Campaign  Committee  and  outside  groups  have  spent  millions  to  drive  that  message  home  and  link  it  to  Jolly's  lobbying  history.  House  Majority  PAC,  an  outside  group  that  backs  Democratic  candidates,  has  spent  close  $750,000  on  one  ad  that  says  Jolly  "lobbied  for  a  special  interest  that  wanted  to  privatize  Social  Security."Jolly  insists  that  Sink  has  misrepresented  his  position  on  the  issue  and  says  he  would  vote  against  the  House  Republican  budget  authored  by  Budget  Committee  Chairman  Paul  Ryan  because  of  the  changes  it  would  make  to  Social  Security  and  Medicare."They  spent  a  million  dollars  painting  me  as  an  extremist  and  a  million  dollars  on  Social  Security  and  Medi-scare  and  Social  Security  claims  that  are  false,"  the  GOP  candidate  told  CNN.Poll:  Anti-incumbent  feelings  at  all-time  highJolly  reiterates  he  opposes  the  proposals  to  privatize  retirement  accounts  or  alter  how  Medicare  benefits  are  structured."I  think  the  current  reform  plans  are  too  aggressive,  and  I  don't  think  we  should  pursue  them,"  Jolly  said.Republicans  privately  acknowledge  that  Sink's  ability  to  start  her  ads  early,  combined  with  the  fact  that  her  campaign  and  the  outside  groups  supporting  her  are  outspending  them,  has  hurt.David  Wasserman,  who  analyzes  House  races  for  the  Cook  Political  Report,  told  CNN  that  "Democrats  have  been  more  consistent  with  their  message  in  this  race,  building  a  narrative  about  Jolly  as  a  lobbyist  who  operates  behind  closed  doors,  and  that  has  clearly  helped."District  is  evenly  splitThis  district  is  split  down  the  political  middle  --  37%  of  those  registered  to  vote  are  Republicans,  about  35%  are  Democrats  and  28%  are  unaffiliated  or  back  a  third-party  candidate.  There  is  a  libertarian  candidate,  Lucas  Overby,  competing  in  the  race,  and  he  has  participated  in  the  three  major  debates.  But  it's  unclear  what  kind  of  impact  he'll  have  in  drawing  votes  away  from  Jolly  or  Sink.Florida  allows  absentee  voting  by  mail,  and  well  over  half  of  those  who  were  mailed  ballots  have  returned  them.  In  past  election  cycles,  Republicans  have  traditionally  posted  a  stronger  return  rate  of  absentee  ballots,  but  the  Pinellas  County  supervisors  office  reports  that  the  GOP  holds  about  a  4-point  edge  over  Democrats  sending  in  their  ballots.Voters  here  frequently  mention  their  distaste  for  the  gridlock  in  Washington,  and  supporters  of  both  Sink  and  Jolly  told  CNN  they  aren't  sure  that  their  candidate  will  be  able  to  change  much.Tami  Simms,  a  registered  independent  who  backed  Young  in  the  past  and  works  as  a  Realtor  in  St.  Petersburg,  told  CNN  she's  voting  for  Sink.  But  she's  unsure  a  new,  more  junior  representative  will  deliver  the  same  results."I  know  there  are  some  concerns  that  no  one  is  going  to  have  (the)  power  that  Congressman  Young  had  from  his  tenure  and  from  his  longtime  experience.

Paul  Ryan,  the  head  of  the  House  Budget  Committee  and  2012  Republican  vice  presidential  nominee,  has  begun  to  examine  the  issue  of  poverty  over  the  past  18  months.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Washington  (CNN)  --  Rep.  Paul  Ryan  is  trying  to  talk  about  the  issue  of  poverty,  but  the  talk  so  far  has  produced  more  problems  than  solutions.Trying  to  address  the  latest  political  snafu,  the  Wisconsin  Republican  said  he  was  "inarticulate"  when  he  talked  on  a  conservative  radio  program  Wednesday  about  a  "tailspin  of  culture,  in  our  inner  cities  in  particular,  of  men  not  working  and  just  generations  of  men  not  even  thinking  about  working  or  learning  the  value  and  the  culture  of  work."Ryan,  the  head  of  the  House  Budget  Committee  and  2012  Republican  vice  presidential  nominee,  has  begun  to  examine  the  issue  of  poverty  over  the  past  18  months.He  made  the  statements  on  Bill  Bennett's  "Morning  in  America"  radio  program.California  Rep.  Barbara  Lee  called  his  statement  "deeply  offensive"  and  a  "thinly  veiled  racial  attack"  and  House  Minority  Leader  Nancy  Pelosi's  press  office  called  it  "shameful."But  are  Democrats  Lee  and  Pelosi  engaging  in  political  double  standards?The  scarlet  'R'Andra  Gillespie,  political  science  professor  at  Emory  University,  said  personal  bias  and  perspective  dictate  their  response."Rightly  or  wrongly,  when  Republicans  make  comments  about  structural  issues,  that's  going  to  be  perceived  by  some  as  paternalistic,"  she  said.Bob  Woodson,  who  has  known  Ryan  for  years  and  heads  the  Center  for  Neighborhood  Enterprise,  an  organization  that  works  with  people  on  the  outskirts  of  society,  said  people  "should  earn  a  right  to  be  critical"  by  either  living  in  or  working  with  impoverished  communities.Rand  Paul  fights  for  felon  voting  rightsWhile  Woodson  admires  Ryan's  interest  in  poverty  and  his  willingness  to  travel  to  some  of  the  most  difficult  neighborhoods  with  him  and  his  organization,  he  said  the  lawmaker  hasn't  yet  earned  the  right  to  be  critical  "at  this  point."What  about  President  Barack  Obama,  who  has  made  similar  statements  about  the  structural  problems  of  race  and  poverty?Obama's  advantageAt  the  launch  of  the  new  program  "My  Brother's  Keeper,"  tailored  to  help  African-American  and  Latino  youth  succeed,  Obama  reeled  off  statistics  that  show  minorities  are  more  likely  to  be  arrested  and  suspended  from  school  and  less  likely  to  graduate."And  the  worst  part  is,  we've  become  numb  to  these  statistics,"  Obama  said  last  month,  adding  that  people  should  not  make  excuses.In  addition  to  My  Brother's  Keeper,  Attorney  General  Eric  Holder  has  made  recent  announcements  that  attempt  to  change  the  structural  disadvantages  facing  people  of  color,  including  his  support  of  a  plan  that  would  reduce  prison  sentences  for  some  drug  offenses.But  it's  what  a  politician  says  and  how  he  says  it  that  matters."It's  going  to  be  received  differently  from  a  black  Democrat  than  from  a  white  Republican,"  Gillespie  said.But  criticism  isn't  reserved  only  for  white  Republicans.Obama  not  immuneSince  Obama,  a  black  man  who  grew  up  without  a  father  and  worked  in  inner  city  Chicago,  entered  the  national  political  scene,  he  has  also  been  criticized  for  his  rhetoric  toward  the  black  community.He  was  criticized  by  some  for  being  patronizing  after  his  commencement  speech  at  Morehouse  College  last  year,  where  he  advised  students  to  help  a  fellow  young  black  man  and  be  a  good  father  and  spouse.And  after  his  Father's  Day  address  in  2008,  where  he  told  black  men  to  be  involved  in  their  children's  lives,  Rev.  Jesse  Jackson  was  caught  off  camera  saying  Obama  talks  "down  to  black  folks."John  Edwards  says  Dems  should  do  more  on  povertyRyan's  second  strikeRyan's  comments,  however,  were  doubly  troubling  to  some  because  he  referenced  one  of  the  most  offensive  authors  on  the  issue  of  race  and  class."You're  buddy  Charles  Murray  or  Bob  Putnam  over  at  Harvard  --  those  guys  have  written  books  on  this,  which  is  --  we  have  got  this  tailspin  of  culture,"  Ryan  said  to  Bennett.Murray,  a  self-described  "right-wing  ideologue,"  is  the  author  of  the  book,  "The  Bell  Curve,"  which  hypothesizes  that  African-Americans  social  and  economic  disadvantages  are  because  they  are  less  intelligent  than  whites.Gillespie  said  that  if  a  politician  is  going  to  talk  about  race  and  poverty  and  wants  to  be  taken  serious,  "Don't  invoke  the  man  that  wrote  'The  Bell  Curve.'"Woodson,  who  worked  at  the  conservative  think  tank,  the  American  Enterprise  Institute  with  Murray  when  "The  Bell  Curve"  was  released  in  1994,  agreed,  saying  he  constantly  tells  Ryan  to  stop  quoting  conservative  scholars  because  their  polarizing  rhetoric  "seeps  into  his  speeches.""All  of  these  guys  ...  do  not  talk  to  the  people  they  write  about,"  Woodson  said.  "The  only  thing  they  are  passionate  about  is  the  failures  of  the  poor."Ryan's  recent  interest  in  poverty  is  likely  to  culminate  in  policy  proposals  that  are,  based  on  his  recent  speeches,  going  to  advocate  fewer  government-centered  poverty  programs.In  a  statement  Thursday,  one  day  after  his  controversial  remarks,  Ryan  said  he  was  trying  to  make  a  larger  point:  That  "we  cannot  settle  for  this  status  quo  and  that  government  and  families  have  to  do  more  and  rethink  our  approach  to  fighting  poverty."This  flare-up  comes  less  than  two  weeks  after  he  released  a  report  analyzing  92  federal  anti-poverty  programs,  concluding  that  are  a  confusing  patchwork  of  often  ineffective  prescriptions  to  combating  the  problem.Woodson  says  Ryan's  remarks  damage  his  attempt  to  be  authoritative  on  anti-poverty  legislation  and  issues.It's  only  "a  minor  setback,"  he  added.Instead,  Woodson  advised  that  Ryan  needs  to  talk  about  the  people  he  has  met  in  the  communities  he  has  visited.Ryan  did  a  version  of  that  last  week  at  the  annual  Conservative  Political  Action  Conference  where  he  told  a  story  about  a  child  who  wanted  to  bring  a  brown  bag  lunch  to  school  instead  of  receiving  free  lunch  because  it  showed  that  someone  cared.But  that  story  was  not  true  and  he  was  forced  to  issue  a  correction.</TEXT></DOC>

Hall  was  hit  11  times.The  incident  occurred  July  1,  2012,  in  a  parking  lot  next  to  a  shuttered  Chinese  restaurant,  in  full  view  of  passing  motorists.  A  video  of  the  incident  was  obtained  exclusively  by  CNN  weeks  later.The  Saginaw  County  prosecutor  and  the  Michigan  attorney  general  had  declined  to  prosecute  the  officers."After  a  careful  review  of  all  of  the  evidence,  experienced  prosecutors  from  the  Criminal  Section  of  the  Civil  Rights  Division  and  the  United  States  Attorney's  Office  for  the  Eastern  District  of  Michigan  have  determined  that  the  evidence  in  this  case  is  insufficient  to  prove,  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt,  that  the  SPD  officers  willfully  shot  Hall  for  an  unlawful  purpose,  rather  than  for  their  stated  purpose  of  preventing  Hall  from  harming  SPD  staff,"  the  Justice  Department  said  in  a  statement.The  statement  continued:  "Even  if  the  officers  were  mistaken  in  their  assessment  of  the  threat  posed  by  Hall,  this  would  not  establish  that  the  officers  acted  willfully,  or  with  an  unlawful  intent,  when  using  deadly  force  against  Hall."Hall's  family  said  he  had  a  history  of  mental  illness.At  the  time  of  the  shooting,  then-Saginaw  Police  Chief  Gerald  Cliff  said  Hall  was  "known  to  be  an  assaultive  person"  with  "a  long  history"  of  contacts  with  law  enforcement,  "not  only  with  police  from  our  department,  but  with  the  county."In  the  video  purchased  by  CNN,  shot  by  a  motorist  from  across  the  street,  Hall  was  seen  arguing  with  a  half  dozen  officers.  For  more  than  three  minutes  he  walks  back  and  forth,  and  at  one  time  appears  to  crouch  in  a  "karate  stance,"  according  to  the  man  who  captured  the  scene.Police  said  Hall  had  just  had  a  run-in  with  a  convenience  store  clerk.  On  the  video,  he  tells  police,  "My  name  is  Milton  Hall,  I  just  called  911.  My  name  is  Milton,  and  I'm  p---ed  off."  When  an  officer  tells  him  to  put  the  knife  down,  he  responds,  "I  ain't  putting  s--t  down."  He  appears  unimpressed  by  a  police  dog,  telling  officers,  "Let  him  go.  Let  the  motherf---ing  dog  go."Finally,  Hall  turns  to  the  left  of  the  frame,  where  another  officer  had  moved  out  of  view  a  short  time  earlier.  That's  when  the  police  open  fire  with  a  reported  46  shots  in  a  five-second  hail  of  bullets.The  on-site  police  supervisor  was  demoted  to  patrolman,  police  said  afterward.  Two  others  were  disciplined  for  violating  department  policies  in  connection  with  the  shooting.  Three  of  their  five  dash-cam  video  cameras  were  not  working  properly.In  a  statement,  Jewel  Hall,  Milton's  mother,  said  she  was  not  surprised  by  Tuesday's  development."However,  that  decision  does  not  negate  the  civil  litigation  that  we  can  pursue  and  the  standards  in  that  matter  are  less  stringent  and  we  believe  justice  will  prevail."</TEXT></DOC>

But  experts  say  the  plane  may  have  been  flying  too  high  or  fast  to  register  with  cell  towers.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  It's  a  popular  question  on  social  media:  Why  didn't  passengers  on  board  the  missing  Malaysia  Airlines  Flight  370  make  mobile  calls?Many  recall  that  when  United  Flight  93  was  hijacked  on  September  11,  2001,  passengers  were  able  to  make  two  cell  phone  calls  during  the  flight's  final  moments.  Several  other  calls  were  made  using  airphones.If  metadata  was  detected  from  cell  phones  on  Flight  370,  surely  it  would  shed  more  light  on  the  missing  plane's  flight  path?The  plane  may  have  been  flying  too  high  or  too  fast  to  register  with  cell  towers,  according  to  telecoms  experts,  but  careful  analysis  of  the  passengers'  cell  phone  records  will  need  to  be  completed  to  be  certain."So  far,  we  have  not  had  any  evidence  of  any  telephone  company  of  any  member  trying  to  contact,"  said  Malaysia  Airlines  CEO  Ahmad  Jauhari  Yahya  at  a  news  conference  on  Monday."But  anyway,  we  are  still  checking.  There  are  millions  of  records  to  process.  It  is  being  done  as  part  of  the  investigation."Was  the  plane  too  high?According  to  radar  analysis,  the  plane  is  believed  to  have  been  flying  as  high  as  45,000  feet  and  as  low  as  23,000  feet.But  even  this  lower  altitude  is  too  high  to  register  with  mobile  towers,  experts  say."If  you  look  at  the  data  in  this  case,  the  altitude  at  which  the  planes  were  traveling  is  too  high,"  Vincent  Lau,  wireless  communications  specialist  and  professor  at  the  Hong  Kong  University  of  Science  and  Technology's  Department  of  Electronic  and  Computer  Engineering,  told  CNN."Even  on  the  ground  it  wouldn't  be  easy  to  pick  up  from  that  distance,  and  if  you  are  flying  it's  even  more  difficult  because  at  those  angles  you  are  only  picking  up  what  we  call  leakage  from  the  side  loops  of  the  antennas,  which  are  substantially  weaker  than  the  signals  from  the  main  loops  of  the  base  stations."While  business  class  seats  on  the  aircraft  are  known  to  have  been  equipped  with  phones  that  worked  via  satellite,  it  would  be  easy  to  strike  down  that  system  from  inside  the  plane,  said  Lau.Reports  on  Monday  that  the  plane  flew  as  low  as  5,000  feet  or  less  over  mountainous  terrain  --  possibly  in  order  to  evade  radar  detection  --  haven't  been  confirmed."In  terms  of  the  altitude  it  would  have  to  be  no  higher  than  around  10,000  feet.  Anything  higher  ...  would  be  problematic,"  according  to  Bill  Rojas,  director  of  telecom  research  at  IDC  Asia  Pacific.Unlike  in  urban  areas,  where  cell  phone  antennae  are  typically  pointed  down  toward  the  ground,  cell  towers  in  rural  areas  are  up  to  30-45  meters  high  and  are  often  pointed  at  an  angle  meant  to  cover  wider  distances.So  if  you're  up  in  the  sky,  you  can  receive  the  signal  as  well,  Rojas  said."If  the  airplane  were  flying  over  northern  Malaysia  or  southern  Thailand  --  basically  the  rural  area  --  then  it's  very  possible  that  a  cell  tower  could  register  the  signal  from  the  phones,  assuming  they  were  on,"  said  Rojas."Technically  it  is  possible."Retrieving  the  dataIf  smartphones  had  been  on  and  registered  with  a  cell  tower,  the  records  would  be  relatively  easy  to  retrieve."The  registrations  would  typically  be  logged  and  depending  on  the  operator  they  will  be  kept  for  hours,  days  or  months,"  said  Rojas.The  telecom  expert  said  that  he'd  place  particular  focus  on  the  phone  numbers  of  passengers  from  Thailand  or  Malaysia."I  would  assume  that  the  authorities  are  checking  with  the  mobile  operators  by  comparing  known  passenger  cell  numbers  to  see  if  there  were  any  pings  or  attempted  or  successful  network  registrations  in  northern  Malaysia  or  southern  Thailand  or  possibly  even  Indonesia,"  said  Rojas.  "Any  passenger  who  had  roaming  capabilities  or  a  local  Malaysian  number  --  if  the  plane  were  over  Malaysia  --  could  in  theory  have  been  registered  on  the  network  if  their  phone  was  on."If  a  passenger  does  not  have  international  roaming  then  their  access  would  be  rejected  by  the  network  and  for  a  period  of  time  that  metadata  might  be  stored  by  the  network."If  the  metadata  records  were  erased  automatically  after  a  few  days  or  a  few  hours,  could  they  be  retrieved?"Each  mobile  operator  will  have  its  own  guidelines  for  the  duration  of  metadata  storage  and  would  not  normally  be  made  public  for  obvious  national  security  and  law  enforcement  reasons."Rojas  said  as  far  as  speed  was  concerned,  the  aircraft  would  need  to  have  been  flying  at  speeds  below  250  kilometers  per  hour  (155  mph)  in  order  for  passengers  to  make  or  receive  calls.Passengers  on  high-speed  trains  in  Japan  and  other  countries  can  make  calls  via  3G  networks  at  speeds  of  up  to  240  kilometers  per  hour,  but  cell  towers  aren't  able  to  register  a  signal  beyond  those  speeds,  Rojas  said.</TEXT></DOC>

Steven  Junkin  told  reporters  Friday.Davison  may  have  first  encountered  the  shooter  on  Interstate  70  in  Maryland  and  traveled  between  13  and  15  miles,  with  the  gunman  in  pursuit,  before  being  forced  off  the  road  just  beyond  the  Pennsylvania  state  line,  authorities  said.Junkin  said  Davison  called  911  from  Maryland  and  Pennsylvania,  but  he  declined  to  provide  details.  Authorities  have  not  released  the  contents  of  those  911  calls,  citing  the  ongoing  investigation.A  task  force  made  up  of  Maryland,  Pennsylvania  and  West  Virginia  state  police,  as  well  as  FBI  agents,  is  seeking  help  from  the  public  and  operators  of  body  shops  in  finding  a  "dark  colored"  Ford  Ranger  XLT  pickup  with  damage  on  the  driver's  side  from  ramming  into  Davison's  car."How  concerned  are  we  that  it'll  happen  again?"  Junkin  asked.  "We  obviously  have  an  individual  out  there  who  was  so  incensed  that  he  continued  to  pursue  Mr.  Davison  and  took  it  to  that  next  step.  He  murdered  an  individual  for  whatever  slight  that  he  perceived.  Will  this  person  do  it  again?  We  don't  know.  We  don't  want  to  take  that  chance."The  Maine  resident  ended  up  shot  multiple  times,  a  death  that  authorities  have  ruled  a  homicide.Anyone  with  information  is  asked  to  call  Crime  Stoppers  at  800-472-8477.Investigators  initially  believed  the  same  motorist  may  have  been  behind  another  road  rage  shooting  eight  hours  earlier  and  56  miles  northeast,  but  Junkin  said  Friday  that  the  two  crimes  do  not  appear  to  be  related.James  Allocca,  Davison's  uncle,  told  CNN  this  week  that  the  family  "wants  justice  before  someone  else  gets  hurt."The  victim's  father,  Timothy  Davison  Sr.,  said  he  learned  about  his  son's  death  when  police  arrived  at  his  door  Saturday."I  can't  begin  to  tell  you  what  it's  like  to  hear  that,"  he  said.  "It's  not  right."He  went  to  Pennsylvania  on  Tuesday  to  collect  his  son's  personal  belongings.His  son,  he  said,  was  a  "great  guy  and  a  very  easy  kid  to  raise.""He  cared  for  everyone  around  him,"  he  said.  "He  was  a  rugged  kid,  extremely  sensitive."Davison  worked  at  his  father's  construction  business.He  said  he  hoped  to  meet  his  son's  killer.  Asked  what  he  would  say,  Davison  said:  "That  is  for  me.""There  are  different  levels  of  loss,"  Allocca  said.

Philip  Breedlove,  NATO's  supreme  allied  commander  Europe,  also  told  CNN's  Christiane  Amanpour  that  with  40,000  troops  massed  near  the  border,  Russia  has  all  the  components  necessary  to  move  on  Ukraine.These  forces  are  "supported  by  fixed-wing  aircraft,  rotary  aircraft,  all  of  the  logistics  required  in  order  to  successfully  make  an  incursion  if  they  needed,"  he  said.In  terms  of  deterrence,  Breedlove  said  NATO  has  a  good  air  and  sea  plan  and  is  working  in  the  next  several  days  on  developing  a  land  component  to  that  reassurance.Ukraine  is  not  a  NATO  member,  but  many  countries  that  are  members  --  such  Poland  and  the  Baltic  states  --  have  voiced  their  increasing  anxiety  about  Russia's  recent  actions.NATO  said  on  Tuesday  that  it  would  suspend  "all  practical  civilian  and  military  cooperation"  with  Russia  in  response  to  its  annexation  of  Ukraine's  southern  Crimea  region,  which  has  triggered  the  worst  East-West  crisis  since  the  Cold  War.It  also  said  it  had  seen  no  sign  that  Moscow  is  withdrawing  some  of  its  troops  from  the  eastern  Ukrainian  border,  as  Russia  has  claimed.NATO  chief  Anders  Fogh  Rasmussen,  speaking  in  Brussels  at  the  end  of  a  two-day  meeting  of  foreign  ministers  from  the  28-member  NATO  bloc,  said  he  shared  Breedlove's  concerns.  He  accused  Russia  of  trying  to  intimidate  Ukraine  as  part  of  an  attempt  to  "reestablish  a  Russian  sphere  of  influence  covering  the  former  Soviet  space."Rasmussen  again  said  Russia  had  a  "massive  military  buildup  along  Ukraine's  borders,"  with  troops  in  a  high  state  of  readiness,  and  that  NATO  had  not  seen  signs  of  any  significant  reduction  in  that  buildup."This  is  really  a  matter  of  grave  concern.  If  Russia  were  to  intervene  further  in  Ukraine,  I  wouldn't  hesitate  to  call  it  a  historic  mistake,"  he  said."That  would  lead  to  further  ...  international  isolation  of  Russia.  It  would  have  far-reaching  consequences  for  relations  between  Russia  and  what  we  as  a  whole  might  call  the  Western  world.  It  would  be  a  miscalculation  with  huge  strategic  implications."Urging  Moscow  to  pull  back  its  troops  from  the  border,  Rasmussen  stressed  that  NATO  wants  to  find  a  political  and  diplomatic  solution  to  the  crisis  in  Ukraine.In  an  earlier  media  interview  Wednesday,  Breedlove  said  that  Russia  could  "roll  across  the  country  in  three  to  five  days  if  it  wanted  to,"  a  NATO  military  official  said.Russia  dismisses  'Cold  War'  sparringAs  the  diplomatic  back-and-forth  continued  Wednesday,  Russian  Foreign  Minister  Sergey  Lavrov  spoke  with  U.S.  Secretary  of  State  John  Kerry  by  phone.The  Russian  Foreign  Ministry  said  Lavrov  stressed  the  need  for  joint  efforts  to  launch  "internal  dialogue  in  Ukraine"  to  reach  national  unity  and  raised  concern  about  the  decisions  reached  by  NATO,  "which  don't  help  the  implementation  of  these  tasks."A  senior  State  Department  official  said  Kerry  "conveyed  the  strong  support  he  was  hearing  for  the  people  of  Ukraine  and  the  legitimate  government  of  Ukraine"  from  counterparts  at  the  NATO  meeting.  He  also  reiterated  the  objective  of  de-escalating  the  crisis  and  called  for  Russian-Ukrainian  government  talks.A  statement  posted  by  Russia's  Foreign  Ministry  on  Wednesday,  quoting  spokesman  Aleksandr  Lukashevich,  dismissed  NATO's  words  as  rhetoric  that  harks  back  to  the  Cold  War."The  wording  of  the  statement  rather  reminds  us  of  verbal  sparring  of  the  Cold  War  times,  while  the  decision  itself  brings  us  six  years  back,  when  Brussels  'froze'  the  work  of  the  Russia-NATO  Council,"  it  said.  "It  is  well  known  how  this  'freeze'  ended  up.  NATO  initiated  a  return  to  cooperation  with  Russia,  stating  an  'all-weather  nature'  of  cooperation  within  the  framework  of  the  Russia-NATO  Council."The  NATO  ministers  said  on  Tuesday  that  political  dialogue  in  the  NATO-Russia  Council  could  continue,  "as  necessary,  at  the  ambassadorial  level  and  above,  to  allow  us  to  exchange  views,  first  and  foremost  on  this  crisis."They  said  they  would  review  NATO's  relations  with  Russia  at  their  next  meeting  in  June.Marine  deploymentWithin  the  next  few  days,  175  U.S.  Marines  from  Camp  Lejeune  in  North  Carolina  will  begin  deploying  to  Romania  as  part  of  an  effort  to  beef  up  a  Marine  Corps  presence  in  Europe  for  dealing  with  contingencies.  The  deployment  to  Romania  was  long  planned,  Pentagon  spokesman  Colonel  Steve  Warren  said.The  Marines  will  become  additional  forces  assigned  to  a  so-called  Special  Purpose  Marine  Air  Ground  Task  Force  headquartered  in  Moron,  Spain.  But  additional  forces  in  Romania  will  beef  up  the  U.S.  military  presence  in  the  region  as  tensions  have  risen  over  the  Russian  troop  buildup  along  Ukraine's  border.Romania  has  agreed  to  allow  up  to  600  U.S.  forces  on  its  soil  at  any  one  time.  There  are  an  additional  300  Marines  in  Romania  as  part  of  a  longstanding  bilateral  training  program.The  Pentagon  is  also  considering  additional  moves  in  Eastern  Europe  to  beef  up  military  deployment  exercises.  A  Navy  warship  is  expected  to  enter  the  Black  Sea  in  the  coming  days  for  another  round  of  port  visits  and  exercises  as  part  of  the  effort,  Warren  said.Kerry:  Don't  use  energy  as  a  weaponEarlier  Wednesday,  Kerry  said  energy  supplies  must  not  be  used  as  a  political  weapon,  speaking  at  an  EU-U.S.  energy  summit  held  in  Brussels  alongside  the  NATO  talks.His  remarks  came  after  Russian  energy  giant  Gazprom  announced  a  hefty  increase  in  the  price  of  natural  gas  it  supplies  to  Ukraine.Kerry,  who  spoke  while  flanked  by  EU  foreign  policy  chief  Catherine  Ashton,  said  the  European  Union  and  United  States  were  taking  "important  steps"  to  make  it  harder  for  one  state  to  hold  another  hostage  to  energy  supplies."No  nation  should  use  energy  to  stymie  a  people's  aspirations,"  said  Kerry,  co-chairman  of  the  EU-U.S.  Energy  Council.  "We  cannot  allow  it  to  be  used  as  a  political  weapon  or  an  instrument  of  aggression."Europe  and  the  United  States  are  working  together  to  reduce  Ukraine's  reliance  on  Russian  energy  by  developing  alternative  sources  of  natural  gas,  Kerry  said."We're  working  in  lockstep  to  help  Ukraine  bring  natural  gas  in  from  Poland  and  Hungary  and  develop  a  route  through  Slovakia,"  he  said,  adding  that  the  United  States  also  hopes  to  export  more  natural  gas  in  the  future.At  the  same  time,  Kerry  said  Ukraine  has  committed  to  work  to  reduce  consumer  subsidies  to  make  its  energy  market  more  efficient.The  International  Monetary  Fund  last  week  agreed  to  lend  Ukraine  up  to  $18  billion  over  the  next  two  years  in  return  for  a  package  of  reforms,  including  to  its  energy  market.In  the  United  States,  the  House  of  Representatives  gave  final  congressional  approval  Tuesday  to  legislation  that  would  provide  $1  billion  in  loan  guarantees  to  Ukraine  and  would  impose  sanctions  on  Russia  for  its  actions  in  Ukraine.  President  Barack  Obama  is  expected  to  sign  the  bill."Developments  in  Ukraine  have  brought  energy  security  concerns  to  the  fore  and  prove  the  need  to  reinforce  energy  security  in  Europe,"  said  a  joint  statement  issued  by  the  EU-U.S.  Energy  Council.Kerry  also  spoke  again  Wednesday  with  his  NATO  counterparts,  including  Frank-Walter  Steinmeier  of  Germany,  Norway's  Borge  Brende,  Poland's  Radoslaw  Sikorski  and  British  Foreign  Secretary  William  Hague.Gas  price  hikeAfter  the  increase  in  gas  prices  reported  by  Russian  state  media  Tuesday,  Ukraine  will  pay  $385.50  per  1,000  cubic  meters  of  gas,  up  from  the  previous  rate  of  $268.50.The  move,  which  is  now  in  effect,  ends  a  discount  that  was  agreed  to  before  Ukraine's  pro-Moscow  President  Viktor  Yanukovych  was  ousted  after  months  of  street  protests.Ukraine  also  owes  $1.7  billion  in  unpaid  natural  gas  bills,  Gazprom  chief  executive  Alexei  Miller  was  quoted  as  saying  by  the  state-run  RIA  Novosti  news  agency.In  a  move  that  may  add  to  Ukraine's  financial  woes,  Russian  President  Vladimir  Putin  signed  a  bill  Wednesday  terminating  Russian  agreements  with  Ukraine  over  the  lease  of  its  Black  Sea  naval  base  in  Crimea,  RIA  Novosti  reported.Russia  paid  the  Ukrainian  government  $530  million  annually  for  use  of  the  Sevastopol  base,  and  it  wrote  off  nearly  $100  million  of  Kiev's  debt  for  the  right  to  use  Ukrainian  waters,  according  to  the  news  agency.  This  deal  will  now  come  to  an  end.Also  terminated  was  an  agreement  under  which  Russia  gave  Ukraine  a  $100  discount  on  natural  gas,  RIA  Novosti  said.  This  means  that  the  price  Ukraine  pays  is  expected  to  rise  to  $485.50  per  1,000  cubic  meters  of  gas  once  the  Russian  government  issues  an  official  resolution,  it  said.Far-right  leader's  death  investigatedSeparately,  Ukraine's  Interior  Ministry  released  a  statement  about  the  death  last  month  of  prominent  far-right  activist  Oleksandr  Muzychko,  better  known  as  Sashko  Biliy.The  ministry  has  said  that  Muzychko,  a  leader  of  Right  Sector,  a  far-right  group  prominent  in  the  recent  anti-government  protests,  had  been  killed  in  a  shootout  with  police  in  the  town  of  Rivne.  Ukrainian  lawmaker  Oleksandr  Doniy,  whose  constituency  is  in  Rivne,  gave  a  different  version  of  events,  saying  the  activist  was  dragged  into  a  car  and  then  shot.On  Wednesday,  the  ministry  said  special  forces  had  "acted  in  accordance  with  the  law  and  all  their  actions  are  concluded  legitimate"  during  his  arrest.  It  said  Muzychko  was  killed  when  he  fired  at  himself.What  do  we  know  about  Russia's  troop  buildup  on  Ukraine's  border?Is  Crimea  gone?
