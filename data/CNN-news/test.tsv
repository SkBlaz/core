She  was  not  sure  how  many  had  been  reached.According  to  the  National  Institute  of  Neurological  Disorders  and  Stroke,  CJD  affects  about  one  person  in  every  1  million  people  per  year  worldwide."It  is  important  to  note  that  there  are  multiple  variations  of  CJD  and  this  case  is  not  related  to  mad  cow  disease,"  Novant  Health  said  in  a  statement.The  hospital  confirmed  that  on  January  18,  an  operation  was  performed  on  a  patient  with  CJD  symptoms  who  later  tested  positive  for  the  illness.Even  though  the  surgical  instruments  were  sterilized  by  standard  hospital  procedures,  they  should  have  gone  through  enhanced  sterilization  procedures  used  when  there  are  confirmed  or  suspected  cases  of  CJD.The  original  patient  "had  neurological  symptoms  that  could  have  been  attributed  to  CJD  or  another  brain  disease,"  Novant  Health  said.  "There  were  reasons  to  suspect  that  this  patient  might  have  had  CJD.  As  such,  the  extra  precautions  should  have  been  taken,  but  were  not."The  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention,  as  well  as  the  World  Health  Organization,  recommends  that  surgical  equipment  used  on  CJD  patients  be  destroyed  or  decontaminated  through  an  intense  disinfecting  process.Although  CJD  can  be  transferred  through  surgical  equipment,  hospital  officials  say  the  likelihood  of  these  patients  contracting  the  disease  is  very  low.The  CDC  corroborates  that  assessment.It  says  that  no  cases  of  the  disease  have  been  linked  to  the  use  of  contaminated  medical  equipment  since  1976.But  Lindsay  made  no  excuses."On  behalf  of  the  entire  team  at  Novant  Health,  I  apologize  to  the  patients  and  their  families,  for  having  caused  this  anxiety."CJD  is  a  rare,  degenerative  and  fatal  brain  disorder,  according  to  the  National  Institutes  of  Health.  It's  characterized  by  rapid,  progressive  dementia.  Initial  symptoms  can  include  problems  with  muscular  coordination,  personality  changes  including  impaired  memory  and  thinking;  and  impaired  vision.CJD  is  believed  to  be  caused  by  a  type  of  protein  called  a  prion.  It  can  be  sporadic,  hereditary  or  acquired;  the  acquired  type  is  the  rarest  form,  according  to  the  NIH,  and  seen  in  fewer  than  1%  of  cases.  It  is  not  contagious  through  casual  contact.Asked  whether  the  18  people  would  be  tested,  Mayer  said  there  is  no  quick  test  for  CJD.  The  original  patient  underwent  brain  surgery  and  then  the  disease  was  found  through  a  number  of  tests  afterward,  she  said.  In  some  cases,  CJD  can  take  years  to  show  up,  Mayer  said.The  hospital  has  instituted  the  enhanced  sterilization  process  on  all  surgical  instruments  used  in  brain  surgery,  Novant  Health  said.In  September,  13  patients  received  similar  warnings  from  two  hospitals  in  New  Hampshire  and  Massachusetts,  when  a  patient  who  had  undergone  neurosurgery  was  later  suspected  to  have  CJD.The  hospitals  shared  the  specialized  surgical  equipment  that  was  used  to  operate  on  the  patient  and  continued  to  use  it  until  the  suspicion  of  exposure  to  the  disease  surfaced.Learn  more  about  Creutzfeldt-Jakob  disease30,000  in  Britain  may  carry  human  form  of  mad  cow</TEXT></DOC>

He  is  the  author  of  "Jimmy  Carter"  and  "Governing  America."(CNN)  --  President  Obama  attracted  a  lot  of  attention  when  he  went  on  "Between  Two  Ferns,"  going  mano-a-mano  with  comedian  Zach  Galifianakis.  The  President  handled  Galifianakis'  barbs  well,  throwing  some  back  at  the  comedian  (ridiculing  his  film  "Hangover  3,"  for  example)  and  successfully  stoking  interest  in  his  health  care  program,  based  on  the  uptick  in  traffic  that  followed.The  show  was  condemned  by  some  who  saw  it  as  disrespectful  of  the  office  of  the  presidency;  others  said  the  president  performed  brilliantly,  doing  what  presidents  need  to  do  in  this  day  and  age,  by  appearing  on  a  hip  and  edgy  popular  culture  outlet.Reaching  young  people  any  way  he  can  is  particularly  urgent  with  the  March  31  deadline  for  health  coverage  enrollment  under  the  Affordable  Care  Act.  The  administration  has  not  made  its  sign-up  targets,  and  evidence  suggests  balance  between  young  and  healthy  versus  old  and  infirm  is  not  what  the  President  wanted.But  while  gimmicks  like  the  "Ferns"  appearance  may  produce  some  quick-hit  results,  they  won't  go  far  in  re-energizing  young  people  about  Obama's  presidency.  In  the  case  of  the  health  care  program,  for  example,  it  seems  that  many  young  people  have  not  been  convinced  the  program  is  in  their  best  interest.  A  good  part  of  this  has  to  do  with  the  failure  of  the  administration  to  explain  this  complex  program  to  the  public  since  its  inception.If  President  Obama  --  or  politicians  from  either  party  --  really  want  to  engage  younger  Americans  and  reignite  the  energy  of  2008,  they  will  need  to  do  much  more.  Americans  in  their  late  teens  and  early  20s  who  are  just  starting  to  vote  are  not  so  gullible  or  pliable.They  are  looking  for  help  in  tough  times.  They  want  their  government  to  offer  real  solutions  to  real  problems  that  they  see,  not  just  cool  appearances  that  might  make  them  laugh  a  bit.Like  all  the  other  Americans  who  are  struggling  in  the  modern  economy,  younger  voters  want  job  security.  Too  many  leave  college  without  any  good  job  prospects  and  those  who  do  succeed  often  find  jobs  with  meager  benefits  and  limited  long-term  stability.  This  is  a  far  cry  from  the  1950s  and  1960s,  the  era  when  young  Americans  who  finished  their  high  school  education  and  went  to  college  could  expect  to  enter  careers  that  would  bring  them  financial  security  and  allow  them  to  do  better  than  their  parents.As  Sarah  Ayers  of  the  Center  for  American  Progress  noted,  the  unemployment  crisis  for  young  Americans  includes  "high  school  students  who  are  having  a  harder  time  finding  after-school  jobs,  twenty-somethings  who  are  increasingly  stuck  in  unpaid  internships  instead  of  paying  jobs,  and  college  students  who  are  settling  for  low-wage,  low-skill  jobs  such  as  waiting  tables  or  serving  coffee."Many  younger  Americans  exiting  college  work  multiple  jobs  to  make  ends  meet  or  find  work  in  transitory  positions  without  benefits.  According  to  the  New  York  Fed,  unemployment  is  at  its  worst  rate  in  two  years  for  recent  college  graduates  and  many  fortunate  to  have  employment  are  in  jobs  that  don't  require  their  degrees.President  Obama  has  not  been  able  to  do  much  about  this  situation.  While  he  worked  hard  to  push  a  stimulus  bill  that  would  move  the  nation  out  of  recession  in  2009,  long-term  investment  in  jobs  has  not  been  a  big  part  of  his  record.In  his  stimulus  bill,  passed  at  the  height  of  his  influence,  the  President  focused  too  much  on  tax  cuts  and  not  enough  on  the  kinds  of  public  jobs  that  would  have  been  attractive  to  younger  Americans  struggling  to  find  a  place  in  the  workforce.  The  cost  of  using  his  political  capital  on  health  care,  moreover,  was  to  diminish  the  possibility  for  greater  public  investments  in  growing  areas  of  the  job  market.Neither  has  the  President  figured  out  how  to  halt  the  flight  of  jobs  to  other  countries.What's  more,  young  people  also  see  a  Washington  that  is  broken,  a  city  gridlocked  in  partisan  conflict  as  decisions  revolve  around  powerful  single-issue  lobbyists  who  gain  influence  by  throwing  money  at  candidates.When  Obama  originally  ran  for  the  presidency,  he  promised  to  promote  a  different  kind  of  politics.  He  took  the  political  process  seriously,  and  argued  that  without  campaign  finance,  lobbying  and  other  kinds  of  government  reforms,  politics  would  never  get  better.Yet  after  taking  office  he  abandoned  many  of  those  efforts  in  order  to  focus  on  immediate  economic  and  foreign  policy  crises.  The  decision  to  leave  government  reform  behind  has  had  long-term  costs,  among  them  a  loss  of  trust  among  younger  Americans  in  the  basic  character  of  the  political  process.  The  institutions  of  government  seem  as  broken  in  2014  as  they  did  in  2008.President  Obama  also  lost  many  millennials  by  continuing  to  uphold  and  expand  aspects  of  President  Bush's  War  on  Terrorism  that  trampled  on  civil  liberties.  While  young  people,  like  all  Americans,  agree  that  the  federal  government  needs  to  protect  the  nation  from  terrorist  threats,  they  also  don't  like  all  the  revelations  about  how  the  National  Security  Agency  has  conducted  intensive  surveillance  into  telephone  conversations,  texting  and  Internet  traffic.For  millennial  Americans  who  distrust  so  many  institutions,  the  freedom  and  right  to  communicate  through  the  Internet  has  defined  much  of  their  lives.  This  has  been  the  realm  through  which  they  experience  the  world.  As  they  have  learned  how  President  Obama's  administration  oversaw  data  logging  efforts  that  undermined  some  of  the  very  freedom  they  desired,  he  has  continued  to  lose  some  of  their  trust.  According  to  a  poll  by  Harvard  University's  Institute  of  Politics  in  December  2013,  many  Americans  between  19  and  29  years  of  age  think  the  surveillance  programs  go  too  far.Nor  has  President  Obama  been  able  to  make  much  progress  on  an  issue  that  matters  very  much  to  younger  Americans,  one  that  will  affect  them  much  more  than  seniors  who  have  greater  political  clout:  climate  change.  Younger  Americans  have  grown  up  learning  about  the  disastrous  consequences  of  human  decisions  on  the  environment  and  observing  frightening  swings  in  the  weather  that  portend  greater  dangers.  A  bipartisan  poll  in  2013  found  strong  support  among  younger  voters  for  a  climate  change  bill.Yet  despite  bold  words  of  support  for  climate  change  legislation,  the  President  has  been  unable  to  move  Congress  on  this  issue  and,  by  many  accounts,  he  has  not  made  this  a  real  priority  in  his  administration.  For  many  younger  Americans  this  has  been  a  great  disappointment.  The  activism  surrounding  the  President's  upcoming  decision  on  the  Keystone  pipeline  has  highlighted  this.To  be  sure,  the  President  has  faced  intractable  opposition  from  Republicans  in  Congress  who  have  refused  to  move  on  this  issue  and  have  stifled  one  of  the  initiatives  that  could  have  been  hugely  attractive  to  younger  Americans.Even  his  biggest  policy  accomplishment  for  younger  Americans—allowing  people  to  stay  on  their  parent's  health  insurance  policies  until  age  26—has  been  blunted  by  the  unpopularity  of  the  individual  mandate  many  of  them  will  be  subjected  to,  as  well  as  the  failure  to  impose  tougher  cost  controls,  which  may  mean  higher  prices  for  those  who  do  buy  insurance.Going  on  fun  entertainment  shows  is  certainly  an  interesting  and  probably  effective  way  to  reach  young  Americans  on  the  Affordable  Care  Act,  but  after  all  the  disappointment  and  heartbreak  they  have  experienced  since  he  took  office,  that's  about  as  far  as  it  can  go.In  the  near  future,  the  administration  must  do  a  better  job  to  explain  how  the  particulars  of  the  health  care  program  benefit  younger  Americans  and  to  at  least  try  to  make  progress—even  if  through  executive  power—on  issues  like  climate  change.  It  must  be  clear  to  young  voters,  if  Democrats  can  overcome  this  political  problem,  that  the  GOP  rather  than  the  President's  lack  of  interest  is  to  blame  for  the  lack  of  progress.  With  Keystone,  the  decision  is  in  Obama's  control.The  President  should  also  continue  to  work  on  smaller  programs,  such  as  student  loans,  where  he  has  been  able  to  deliver  tangible  results  to  this  population.Obama  and  other  politicians,  in  both  parties,  must  remember:  To  excite  disenchanted  voters  distrustful  of  all  institutions,  you  must  show  that  you  can  make  progress  on  the  policy  issues  that  matter  to  them  and  to  do  so  through  a  stronger  political  process  that  leads  them  to  believe  in  politics  once  again.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Julian  Zelizer.</TEXT></DOC>

The  girl's  mother  denied  that  contention  in  an  interview  with  CNN.Jean  Peters  Baker  was  appointed  special  prosecutor  in  October  and  reopened  the  case.Coleman,  who  was  14  when  she  claimed  she  was  raped,  released  a  statement  through  Baker's  office."Today,  I  am  grateful  that  the  defendant  took  responsibility  by  pleading  guilty  to  the  charges.  I  am  ready  to  move  forward,"  Coleman,  16,  said.Her  mother  said  Baker  did  the  best  she  could  under  tough  circumstances,  alluding  to  her  belief  that  evidence  had  been  altered,  destroyed  or  lost.Barnett's  attorney,  Jay  R.  Hobbs,  said  the  misdemeanor  charge  "accurately  reflects  the  conduct  of  which  he  should  be  held  accountable  for."Baker  said  there  wasn't  enough  evidence  to  file  a  felony  sex  assault  or  endangerment  charge."This  is  the  outcome  that  we  believe  was  the  right  and  just  outcome  in  this  case,"  she  told  reporters.Coleman  was  in  a  hospital  after  a  weekend  suicide  attempt,  her  mother  told  CNN  on  Tuesday.  Melinda  Coleman  said  her  daughter  had  been  harassed  by  several  people  through  social  media.Melinda  Coleman  was  not  in  court  Thursday,  telling  CNN  that  she  wanted  to  stay  with  her  daughter.CNN  does  not  typically  identify  alleged  victims  of  sexual  assault  but  has  done  so  in  this  case  because  Daisy  and  her  mother  had  chosen  to  go  public.The  most  important  term  of  Thursday's  plea  deal,  Baker  said,  was  the  condition  that  Barnett  apologize  to  Coleman.  The  prosecutor  said  she  believed  the  verbal  apology  was  genuine  and  heartfelt.  She  will  relay  the  statement  to  Daisy  at  a  later  date,  she  said.Barnett  also  will  have  to  pay  the  Colemans  $1,800,  take  drug  tests  and  do  community  service.  He  is  not  allowed  to  be  around  alcohol.If  he  violates  his  probation,  he  will  go  to  jail  for  120  days.The  case  gained  national  attention  last  year  when  on  the  one-year  anniversary  of  the  incident  the  Kansas  City  Star  featured  the  story.According  to  a  Missouri  State  Highway  Patrol  probable  cause  statement  filed  by  prosecutors,  Daisy  Coleman  and  a  friend  were  drinking  at  the  Coleman  home  in  Maryville,  which  is  in  northwest  Missouri,  about  100  miles  north  of  Kansas  City.Coleman  and  Barnett  were  texting  each  other  and  after  midnight,  Coleman  and  her  friend  sneaked  out  to  meet  Barnett,  who  drove  them  to  his  neighborhood.The  patrol  statement  didn't  identify  Coleman's  friend,  but  Paige  Parkhurst,  13  at  the  time,  later  came  forward  to  the  media.After  they  sneaked  into  Barnett's  parents  home,  they  drank  in  the  basement,  along  with  several  other  people.  Coleman  told  investigators  she  started  drinking  vodka,  then  doesn't  remember  anything  else  until  she  woke  up  in  her  yard  around  5  a.m.  She  was  barefoot,  dressed  only  in  a  T-shirt  and  yoga  pants.Barnett  said  that,  after  about  an  hour  of  drinking,  he  drove  Coleman,  Parkhurst  and  a  boy  to  another  friend's  house,  where  Barnett  asked  the  friend  to  drive  them  to  Coleman's  house  to  drop  her  off,  according  to  the  statement.Barnett  and  a  juvenile  carried  Coleman  to  one  side  of  her  home  then  came  back  to  the  car,  the  document  says.  Weather  records  indicated  temperatures  were  in  the  low  20s  that  morning.The  probable  cause  statement  was  filed  by  prosecutors  as  part  of  the  plea  deal.  It  focuses  on  the  alleged  endangerment  and  makes  no  mention  of  a  sexual  assault  allegation.In  a  statement  issued  in  October,  a  lawyer  for  the  Barnett  family  noted  that  a  felony  charge  of  sexual  assault  was  filed  January  9,  2012,  against  Matthew  Barnett,  alleging  sexual  intercourse  with  someone  who  was  incapacitated."Mr.  Barnett  cooperated  with  the  investigation  and  freely  admitted  to  the  sexual  encounter,"  said  the  statement  from  lawyer  Robert  Sundell.  "While  many  find  Matt  Barnett's  behavior  reprehensible,  the  legal  issue  was  whether  a  crime  was  committed."Subsequent  investigation  and  interviews  raised  substantial  doubt  about  the  felony  charge,  specifically  including  whether  the  young  lady  was  incapacitated  during  the  encounter."Melinda  Coleman  has  said  she  thought  the  charges  against  Barnett  had  been  dropped  because  of  his  family's  political  connections  --  one  of  his  grandfathers  was  a  popular  four-term  state  representative.Parkhurst  said  she  was  raped  by  a  different  boy  that  same  night.  That  case  was  settled  in  juvenile  court.Melinda  Coleman  said  in  2013  that  her  children  had  received  threats  and  she  was  fired  from  her  job  as  a  veterinarian  at  a  clinic.  The  Colemans  have  since  moved  to  another  town.The  case  gained  traction  after  the  newspaper  article  and  the  Colemans'  appearances  on  CNN.  The  online  activist  collective  Anonymous  picked  up  the  cause,  releasing  a  statement  that  questioned  how  the  case  was  being  handled.Why  Anonymous  wants  justice  in  the  Missouri  rape  caseCNN's  Michelle  Richmond  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

The  scandal  led  to  almost  200  students  suing  the  district,  claiming  that  they,  too,  were  victims.In  a  CNN  interview  Wednesday  at  his  Beverly  Hills  attorney's  office,  Breed  said  he  urged  the  system  to  wait  until  a  conviction  in  the  Berndt  case  before  settling  the  student  claims.  Among  the  student  allegations  was  that  they  were  forced  to  eat  cookies  with  semen  on  them,  Breed  said."There's  clearly  some  children  where  there  was  no  evidence  that  they  ate  a  cookie,  had  semen  in  their  mouth  or  fluid  in  their  mouth.  They  are  alleging,  but  it's  not  necessary  true,"  Breed  said."I  did  not  agree  with  settling,  but  they  felt  it  was  politically  better  and  they  felt  the  pressure"  from  the  scandal,  he  said.  "But  my  view  point  was  to  wait  and  see  because  we  really  don't  know  if  there  was  semen  in  the  classroom."This  is  a  sad  case,"  he  added.  "There  is  corruption  at  LAUSD  sadly,  and  there's  a  lot  of  people  in  place  supervising  that  don't  have  the  level  of  expertise  needed  to  see  (the  corruption)."Last  June,  the  school  system  sought  a  court  injunction  imposing  "a  gag  order"  on  Breed  to  keep  him  from  publicly  discussing  "the  Miramonte  settlement  fiasco,"  his  suit  said.  But  a  judge  dismissed  the  district's  request  as  long  as  Breed  never  mentioned  the  names  of  the  alleged  student  victims,  Breed  said.On  Wednesday,  a  media  consultant  hired  by  the  school  district  to  be  its  spokesman  dismissed  the  allegations  as  "frivolous"  and  described  Breed  as  a  disgruntled  employee."The  allegations  are  false.  There  was  a  rigorous  processing  of  all  the  settlements,"  said  Sean  Rossall,  the  consultant  serving  as  spokesman  for  the  system's  general  counsel.  "There  had  to  be  substantial  information  before  any  settlement  was  made."These  are  nothing  more  than  baseless  allegations  by  a  disgruntled  former  employee,"  Rossall  continued.  "He's  simply  trying  to  latch  on  to  the  attention  being  paid  to  Miramonte  to  try  to  line  his  own  pocket  with  millions  of  dollars,  taxpayer  dollars."It's  really  unfortunate  that  he  would  choose  to  do  this  and  impact  the  families  that  are  already  impacted  by  the  incident  in  Miramonte  and  take  this  money  from  our  students  and  schools  with  baseless  allegations,"  Rossall  added.Last  year,  General  Counsel  David  Holmquist  told  CNN  that  the  district  was  paying  $30  million  to  settle  what  now  amounts  to  63  of  190  students'  claims  alleging  they  were  victims  of  sexually  lewd  acts  by  Berndt.  Holmquist  called  the  agreements  "good  settlements"  at  the  time.  The  remaining  students'  claims  are  still  pending.Breed's  lawsuit,  which  seeks  at  least  $10  million  in  damages,  claims  Los  Angeles  Unifed  School  District  Chief  Business  and  Compliance  Counsel  Gregory  McNair  and  Holmquist  ignored  a  school  list  of  approved  outside  attorneys.  Instead,  the  lawsuit  claims,  they  hired  outside  representation  based  on  McNair's  "personal  relationships"  with  those  law  firms.Those  newly  hired  legal  firms  didn't  have  experience  in  sexual  assault  and  molestation  cases,  but  still  represented  the  system  in  handling  legal  claims  filed  in  the  Miramonte  abuse  case,  the  lawsuit  claims.One  outside  counsel  was  a  law  firm  where  McNair  once  worked,  and  another  was  an  attorney  who  was  a  law  school  classmate  of  McNair's,  the  suit  charged.McNair  and  Holmquist  couldn't  be  reached  for  comment  Wednesday.  School  spokesman  Rossall  said  he  was  speaking  on  their  behalf.Under  an  alleged  "cronyism"  arrangement,  the  outside  attorneys  were  paid  between  $390  to  $450  an  hour  --  more  than  twice  the  $175-an-hour  rate  that  the  board  typically  paid  on  its  approved  list  of  outside  attorneys,  the  lawsuit  claims.When  asking  about  the  legal  fees,  school  spokesman  Rossall  said  the  Miramonte  case  "is  a  different  size  of  scope  in  litigation  than  is  typically  seen.""We  really  need  specialists  who  understood  the  issues  and  had  the  bandwidth  to  handle  the  amount  of  claims  being  brought  forth,"  Rossall  said.Breed  found  "numerous  errors"  in  vetting  each  student  claims,  such  as  the  lack  of  signatures  verifying  information,  lack  of  Social  Security  numbers,  and  the  wrong  names  when  compared  to  school  classroom  rosters,  the  lawsuit  claims.For  example,  one  pupil  who  received  $470,000  "did  not  attend  classes  with  the  abuser"  and  "essentially  maintained  others  wanted  and  got  money  so  he  should  get  some  as  well,"  the  lawsuit  states.In  another  example,  a  girl  "was  touched  just  once  on  the  shoulder  by  the  accused  teacher,"  and  when  this  issue  was  raised,  the  outside  counsel  contacted  the  mediator,  who  ruled  he  couldn't  change  the  settlement,  the  suit  said."Because  the  proper  vetting  process  was  not  followed,  LAUSD  will  be  forced  to  pay  $470,000  for  a  single  act  of  touching  on  the  shoulder,"  the  lawsuit  said.Breed,  who  has  30  years  of  experience  in  risk  management,  was  hired  by  the  district  to  serve  as  chief  risk  officer  from  April  2012  to  June  2013  at  a  salary  of  $14,438  a  month,  the  lawsuit  said.Breed  claimed  that  when  he  acted  as  a  whistle-blower  in  reporting  his  allegations,  his  contract  was  not  renewed  in  an  act  of  retaliation,  and  he  was  denied  more  than  $14,000  in  annual  contributions  to  his  retirement  account.At  the  time  the  school  district  announced  the  $30  million  settlement,  Holmquist  said  taxpayer  money  and  possibly  school  insurance  funds  would  cover  that  cost,  but  those  insurance  carriers  are  now  refusing  to  indemnify  the  school  system  and  fund  the  settlement  because  of  "attorney  incompetence  by  corruptly  selected  counsel,"  the  lawsuit  contends.A  second  teacher  at  Miramonte  Elementary,  Martin  Springer,  was  also  charged  with  felony  lewd  conduct  with  a  girl  under  age  14  in  the  aftermath  of  the  Berndt  case  in  2011.  Springer  has  pleaded  not  guilty,  and  his  case  is  pending.</TEXT></DOC>

CNN  explores  the  places,  the  people  and  the  passions  unique  to  this  African  nation.(CNN)  --  How  would  you  design  a  movie  poster  for  a  Hollywood  blockbuster  you'd  never  seen,  filled  with  characters  you  knew  nothing  about  and  actors  you'd  never  heard  of?Would  Jean-Claude  Van  Damme  look  like  a  surgical  glove  stuffed  full  of  walnuts?  Would  Cujo  the  killer  dog  look  like  a  guilty  spaniel  that'd  devoured  the  cake  at  a  child's  birthday  party?  Would  James  Bond  have  the  stunned  expression  of  a  man  who  had  just  received  a  large  electricity  bill?If  your  only  brief  was  to  pack  a  crowd  into  a  mobile  African  cinema  hall,  you  might  also  want  to  add  some  incidental  aliens  shooting  laser  beams  from  their  eyes.In  Ghana  --  where  the  Golden  Age  of  movie  posters  during  the  1980s  and  1990s  produced  these  lurid,  vibrant  and  outlandish  originals  --  the  movie  poster  may  be  a  dying  art  form  but  it  has  since  become  big  business.Western  collectors  now  pay  thousands  for  prime  examples  of  the  genre  and  the  artists  who  once  churned  out  the  posters  to  fill  Ghana's  dilapidated  cinema  clubs  are  finding  a  new  lease  of  life  reproducing  them  for  art  aficionados.Jeaurs  Oka  Afutu,  39,  began  painting  the  posters  when  he  was  14  years  old  but  now  works  from  his  home  in  Accra,  Ghana,  to  produce  them  for  art  dealers,  selling  them  for  between  $75  and  $100  apiece.Currently  putting  the  finishing  touches  on  a  canvas  cut  from  a  flour  sack,  he's  producing  a  distinctively  Ghanaian  take  on  the  biopic  "Mandela:  Long  Walk  to  Freedom.""Action  and  war  works  a  lot  ...  and  women  too:  both  actually,"  Afutu  told  CNN,  showing  that  Hollywood's  time-honored  recipe  of  sex  and  violence  is  an  international  language."It  all  depends  on  what  the  audience  prefers."Read  more:  Keeping  Africa's  star  of  democracy  shiningWhen  he  produced  these  originals  for  Ghana's  cinema  clubs  ---  often  no  more  than  rows  of  seats  in  the  open  air  around  a  gas-powered  generator  and  a  TV  set  with  a  VCR  ---  his  job  was  to  draw  crowds.To  do  this,  he  applied  his  imagination  to  the  canvas,  producing  scenes  that  didn't  exist  in  the  original  film;  placing  dripping  knives  in  the  hands  of  zombie  assassins  or  guns  at  the  ready  for  various  heroes  who  had  no  weapons  in  the  actual  film.These  surreal  variations  spiced  up  a  whole  generation  of  schlock-horror  films  that  came  out  of  Hong  Kong,  Hollywood,  Bollywood,  and  its  Nigerian  equivalent  Nollywood.  As  one  critic  remarked,  the  posters  are  often  far  better  than  the  films.African  art  dealer  Ernie  Wolfe,  who  first  noticed  the  movie  posters  in  1990  while  researching  Ghana's  phenomenon  of  fantasy  coffins,  said  that  despite  the  untutored  style  of  the  posters,  the  artists  knew  exactly  what  effect  they  wanted  to  create."They  are  definitely  very,  very  good  artists  and  they  paint  exactly  what  they  want,"  said  Wolfe  who  has  written  two  books  on  the  genre  "Extreme  Canvas"  and  "Extreme  Canvas  2.""Having  looked  at  hundreds  of  them,  you  become  aware  of  their  individual  hand,  their  idiosyncrasies  and  their  brush  strokes."The  ones  that  interest  me  the  most  are  the  ones  before  the  tradition  died  in  about  2000."Read  more:  Bamboo  bikes  turn  around  fortunesGhana's  economic  development  --  combined  with  affordable  technology  that  has  brought  home  entertainment  within  the  reach  of  many  Ghanaians  --  put  paid  to  the  movie  poster  cottage  industry.While  they're  still  being  made  by  some  of  the  artists  that  produced  them  two  decades  ago,  Wolfe  explained,  they're  now  made  as  commodities  for  the  art  market."The  best  of  the  Golden  Age  movie  posters  --  from  the  '80s  to  the  late  '90s  --  are  the  ones  where  they  just  completely  went  out  into  the  land  where  there  are  no  rules,"  he  said.  "It  gave  them  an  incredible  freedom  to  be  expressive."They  made  images  that  they  knew  would  bring  people  in  and  no  one  was  looking  over  their  shoulder  to  tell  them  they  couldn't  do  anything."The  only  restriction,  he  said,  was  the  size  of  the  canvases  which  fell  strictly  into  two  versions:  one  side  of  a  50kg  flour  bag  or  two  sides  stitched  together."Apart  from  that,  there  were  no  limits."He  said  the  works  also  fall  into  the  realm  of  art  artifact  where  the  evidence  of  their  original  purpose  is  also  part  of  the  narrative."The  work  patterns  of  their  use;  having  been  nailed  up  by  their  corners  and  splattered  by  mud  from  passing  buses  also  tell  a  rich  story  about  how  they  were  utilized,"  Wolfe  said.With  rare  vintage  works  fetching  as  much  as  $15,000  and  Golden  Age  posters  routinely  going  for  between  $1,500  and  $3,000,  a  market  in  fakes  has  emerged.Wolfe,  however,  remains  sanguine."It's  possible  to  say  they're  fakes  but  it's  also  possible  to  say  they're  a  homage,"  he  said.While  the  commoditized  versions  are  still  artworks  in  their  own  right,  Wolfe  said  they  occupy  a  different  zone  to  the  stark  immediacy  of  the  originals."There's  a  big  difference  between  those  works  that  were  produced  for  them,  Ghanaians,  and  the  ones  that  are  produced  for  us  (collectors)."CNN's  On  the  Road  series  often  carries  sponsorship  originating  from  the  countries  we  profile.

He  is  the  author  of  "Jimmy  Carter"  and  "Governing  America."(CNN)  --  President  Barack  Obama  has  made  it  clear  to  Congress  that  if  they  will  not  work  with  him  he  will  work  around  them.Before  the  State  of  the  Union  address,  the  president  announced  that  he  was  increasing  the  minimum  wage  for  workers  under  federal  contract  to  $10.10  an  hour.  During  the  State  of  the  Union,  "wherever  and  whenever  I  can  take  steps  without  legislation  to  expand  opportunity  for  more  American  families,  that's  what  I'm  going  to  do."Republicans  predictably  complained.  Some  warned  that  the  president  was  embracing  an  unconstitutional  set  of  tools  that  would  violate  the  laws  of  the  land.  "We  don't  have  a  monarchy  in  this  country,"  warned  Rep.  Steve  Scalise,  R-Louisiana,  "there's  an  executive  branch  and  the  legislative  branch,  and  the  president  has  to  work  with  Congress  to  get  things  done."Though  Obama  has  been  far  more  timid  in  using  executive  power  than  President  George  W.  Bush,  many  in  the  GOP  suddenly  have  a  legal  problem  with  presidents  going  their  own  way.Most  experts  agree  that  what  the  president  has  done  is  squarely  within  the  prerogatives  accorded  to  presidents.  There  is  a  long  history  of  presidents  using  executive  power  ever  since  the  founding  of  the  nation.The  power  of  the  office  grew  enormously  over  the  course  of  the  20th  century  and  presidents  became  increasingly  comfortable  using  mechanisms  such  as  signing  statements  and  executive  orders  to  achieve  their  goals.In  December  1980,  President  Jimmy  Carter  used  an  executive  order  to  protect  56  million  acres  of  Alaskan  wilderness  from  mining  and  logging.  President  Ronald  Reagan  used  executive  power  to  weaken  federal  agencies  that  were  responsible  for  policies  he  opposed.President  Bill  Clinton  used  an  executive  order  in  1995  to  prevent  the  federal  government  from  entering  into  contracts  with  companies  that  hired  strike-breakers.  In  2001,  Bush  enraged  many  Democrats  when  he  restricted  public  access  to  the  papers  of  former  presidents.  He  also  overturned  many  environmental  regulations  that  Clinton  had  put  into  place.  Environmentalists  complained.Following  the  revelation  of  how  many  signing  statements  --  attachments  to  a  bill  in  which  a  president  can  express  concerns  about  sections  that  he  believes  to  be  unconstitutional  --  Bush  had  used,  Rep.  Dianne  Feinstein,  D-California,  explained  that  what  the  president  was  saying  is  "Congress,  what  you  do  isn't  really  important;  I'm  going  to  do  what  I  want  to  do."  Sen.  John  Cornyn,  R-Texas,  defended  Bush,  stating,  "It  is  precedented  and  it's  not  new."Obama  has  lagged  behind  most  presidents  in  making  full  use  of  his  office.  The  average  for  number  of  executive  orders  for  presidents  since  1900  is  44  per  year.  Obama  has  averaged  37  executive  orders  --  less  than  Republican  Presidents  Dwight  Eisenhower,  Richard  Nixon,  Gerald  Ford,  Ronald  Reagan  and  George  H.W.  Bush.But  just  because  the  president  can  take  executive  action,  is  it  a  good  idea  to  do  so?  There  are  good  reasons  that  Democrats  should  be  leery  about  using  presidential  power  to  achieve  their  ends.Most  important,  the  executive  orders  put  into  place  by  one  president  can  be  easily  and  quickly  overturned  by  the  next  president.  Killing  policies  that  are  put  into  place  by  Obama  would  not  be  extraordinarily  difficult  nor  would  it  require  the  kind  of  long,  protracted  struggle  that  Republicans  have  engaged  in  with  Obamacare,  thus  far  unsuccessfully.When  Clinton  came  into  office  in  1993,  he  reversed  Reagan's  executive  order  from  1984  that  prohibited  the  use  of  federal  funds  to  advocate  abortion.  In  2009,  Obama  revoked  Bush's  order  restricting  public  access  to  presidential  papers.Presidential  power  also  deprives  a  policy  of  the  fierce  public  debate  and  congressional  vote  that  comes  with  legislation.  Although  the  process  of  passing  bills  through  Congress  is  usually  very  painful  for  a  president,  if  successful  a  policy  obtains  a  kind  of  legitimacy  that  rarely  comes  from  executive  action.  This  is  evident  from  how  durable  the  programs  from  the  New  Deal  and  Great  Society,  such  as  Social  Security,  the  Civil  Rights  Act,  and  Medicare  and  Medicaid  have  been  over  time.Through  legislative  debate,  supporters  of  a  bill  are  forced  to  present  their  case  and  to  persuade  a  sufficient  number  of  representatives  and  senators  to  come  to  their  side.Sometimes  a  president  from  one  party  can  persuade  some  members  from  the  opposition  to  vote  for  a  bill,  permanently  putting  their  imprint  on  the  policy.This  was  a  powerful  part  of  why  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964  gained  such  widespread  legitimacy  throughout  the  nation.  Even  when  opponents  lose,  they  are  given  their  chance  to  say  no  and  to  explain  to  the  public  why  they  oppose  an  idea.  By  contrast,  the  process  of  issuing  executive  orders  opens  up  policies  to  charges  of  illegitimacy  in  a  way  that  are  much  more  difficult  to  sell  with  laws  passed  by  Congress.Equally  important  for  a  president,  legislators  go  must  go  on  record.  When  they  do  so  in  support  of  a  bill  the  legislator  becomes  much  more  invested  in  the  coming  years  in  defending  that  decision.  Opponents  go  on  record  as  well,  and  when  a  policy  turns  out  to  be  popular  and  successful  this  makes  them  much  more  hesitant  to  continue  their  attacks  on  a  program.For  decades,  Republicans  shied  away  from  the  kind  of  oppositional  statements  toward  Medicare  proposals  uttered  by  Barry  Goldwater  and  Reagan  in  the  early  1960s  for  fear  that  voters  would  remember  how  they  had  stood  firm  against  benefits  that  turned  out  to  be  enormously  popular.Obama  certainly  would  prefer  to  obtain  legislation  and  the  turn  to  executive  power  is  a  decision  of  last  resort,  one  that  realistically  might  be  the  only  way  he  can  achieve  anything  else  in  the  next  few  years.

"And  because  of  these  choices,  the  United  States  is  today  moving,  as  we  said  we  would,  to  impose  additional  costs  on  Russia."'We  said  we  would'His  hastily  arranged  remarks  signaled  European  allies  that  Obama  would  take  a  leading  role  on  the  issue,  and  also  responded  to  pressure  from  political  foes  and  some  supporters  at  home  for  a  tougher  response  to  what  Vice  President  Joe  Biden  called  a  "land  grab"  by  Putin.Even  Hillary  Clinton,  Obama's  former  secretary  of  state  who  is  the  overwhelming  favorite  for  the  Democratic  presidential  nomination  in  2016,  said  this  week  that  the  administration  should  do  more  to  support  Ukraine.Russia  lawmakers  vote  to  annex  Crimea;  U.S.  steps  up  sanctionsThe  steps  announced  Thursday  expanded  on  a  previous  U.S.  list  of  sanctions  targets,  adding  more  senior  Russian  officials  and  what  officials  called  "cronies"  of  Putin  as  well  as  a  bank  controlled  by  a  Putin  associate.Obama  also  warned  Moscow  that  possible  further  sanctions  would  go  after  key  sectors  of  the  economy  if  Russia  escalates  the  crisis  in  Ukraine.A  new  executive  order  signed  by  Obama  authorizes  his  administration  to  target  Russian  companies  in  the  financial  services,  energy,  metals  and  mining,  defense  and  engineering  industries  --  all  vital  components  of  the  Russian  economy.EU  leaders  met  Thursday  to  discuss  their  own  steps,  so  Obama's  immediate  response  gave  him  the  mantle  of  leadership  on  the  matter.Finland's  Minister  for  European  Affairs  and  Foreign  Trade  Alexander  Stubb  told  CNN's  Nina  dos  Santos  that  the  EU  will  add  as  many  as  10  more  names  to  its  previous  list  of  targets,  but  won't  hit  any  companies  at  this  stage.So  far,  European  powers  such  as  Germany  and  Britain  have  been  unwilling  to  embrace  significant  economic  sanctions  against  Russia  because  of  their  strong  trade  and  investment  ties  with  Moscow.Severe  consequencesIn  a  briefing  to  reporters,  senior  U.S.  administration  officials  sounded  further  warnings  against  any  Russian  provocations  in  Ukraine."We  believe  that  it  is  very  important  to  signal  that  if  Russia  further  escalates  this  situation  they  will  be  met  with  severe  consequences,"  one  official  said.The  tough  talk  looked  even  more  credible  compared  to  Russia's  almost  comical  response  to  the  U.S.  announcement:  sanctions  against  nine  U.S.  political  leaders  and  administration  officials.On  Ukraine,  more  must  be  doneMoscow's  list  included  House  Speaker  John  Boehner,  Senate  Majority  Leader  Harry  Reid,  Republican  Sens.  John  McCain  and  Dan  Coats,  Democratic  Sens.  Robert  Menendez  and  Mary  Landrieu,  and  some  members  of  Obama's  White  House  team."I  guess  this  means  my  spring  break  in  Siberia  is  off,  my  Gazprom  stock  is  lost,  and  my  secret  bank  account  in  Moscow  is  frozen,"  McCain  joked  in  response.'Badge  of  honor'Landrieu,  who  is  facing  a  tough  re-election  battle  this  year  in  generally  conservative  Louisiana,  called  her  sanction  by  Russia  "a  badge  of  honor."Obama  and  U.S.  officials  have  made  clear  that  the  response  to  Russia  will  remain  in  the  diplomatic  and  economic  arenas,  with  one  senior  administration  official  essentially  rejecting  for  now  any  direct  U.S.  effort  to  bolster  Ukraine's  military  forces  for  a  ground  war."Nobody  wants  the  outcome  here  to  be  a  full-bore  military  conflict  between  Russia  and  Ukraine,  and  in  fact,  the  Ukrainian  government  themselves  have  been  quite  restrained  in  not  giving  in  to  provocation  and  not  having  this  go  the  way  of  bloodshed,"  the  official  said,  adding  that  "we  don't  want  to  take  steps  to  add  to  a  momentum  of  further  militarizing  the  situation."Clinton  walks  a  'fine  line'  on  PutinCNNMoney's  Mark  Thompson  and  CNN's  Dana  Bash  and  Lisa  Desjardins  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

He  is  author  of  the  new  book  "Own  Your  Cancer:  A  Take-Charge  Guide  for  the  Recently  Diagnosed  and  Those  Who  Love  Them."(CNN)  --  No  one  is  ever  truly  prepared  to  hear,  "You  have  cancer"  --  three  little  words  that,  despite  impressive  advances  in  treatment,  immediately  conjure  up  frightening  images  of  hair  loss,  chronic  nausea,  surgery  and  even  death.But  hearing  "the  C-word"  is  even  more  overwhelming  when  it  is  entirely  unexpected,  spoken  to  a  seemingly  healthy  person.  The  unanticipated  lesion  on  your  mammogram.  The  unsuspected  tumor  on  your  routine  colonoscopy.  The  surprise  prostate  nodule  on  your  physical  exam.And  it  may  become  more  common:  The  American  Society  of  Clinical  Oncologists  predicted  in  a  report  released  Tuesday  that  cancer  will  become  the  leading  cause  of  death  in  the  United  States  in  16  years,  surpassing  heart  disease.For  thousands  of  "healthy"  individuals  each  year,  the  fears  engendered  by  those  three  little  words  are  accompanied  by  a  horribly  powerful  shock.So  what  do  you  do  first  when  blindsided  by  cancer?  Here,  in  order,  are  four  initial  actions  and  one  inaction  that  will  help  you  remain  oriented  and  in  control  of  your  life.Take  a  breath.  Seriously.  You  are  the  same  person  today  as  you  were  yesterday  when  you  didn't  know  you  had  cancer.  You  have  no  symptoms,  so  while  possible,  it  is  unlikely  your  cancer  has  spread  throughout  your  body.  You  truly  have  time  to  get  yourself  together,  your  thoughts  organized.  Your  cancer  is  not  spreading  with  every  passing  second  or  even  every  passing  day.  Take  a  breath  and  then  commit  to  the  following  four  steps.WHO:  Imminent  global  cancer  'disaster'Own  your  cancer.  This  is  the  single  most  important  step  in  addressing  your  cancer  and  your  life.You  are  in  shock  over  the  diagnosis.  So  many  fears  are  swirling  around  in  your  head.  You'll  never  be  able  to  understand  this  complex,  life-threatening  disease.  You  are  way  past  overwhelmed.  The  independent,  successful,  active,  intelligent  person  you  were  just  days  ago  (before  you  were  a  "cancer  patient")  has  rapidly  disintegrated.  You  must  surrender  yourself  over  to  "the  experts"  --  the  doctors  and  nurses  and  therapists.  You  must  forfeit  all  involvement  in  your  care.No,  you  must  not!  Don't  hand  over  control  of  decisions  that  will  affect  both  the  duration  and  quality  of  your  life  to  experts,  who  are  strangers,  who  know  nothing  about  you  the  individual,  you  the  person.Don't  give  up  ownership  of  your  life.  Continue  owning  your  life  by  owning  your  cancer  and  accepting  responsibility  --  learning  the  limited  number  of  critical  facts  about  your  malignancy,  selecting  physicians,  actively  participating  in  your  care  decisions.  Own  your  cancer  and  remain  in  charge  of  your  life.Don't  run  to  the  Internet.  In  the  midst  of  your  initial  shock  and  fear,  the  worst  thing  you  can  do  is  jump  onto  the  World  Wide  Web.  Not  only  are  you  emotionally  volatile,  you  are  not  yet  prepared  to  understand  and  interpret  the  prognostic  and  treatment  statistics  as  they  relate  to  your  type  and  stage  of  malignant  disease.You  likely  don't  yet  possess  the  knowledge  to  differentiate  credible  from  the  layers  of  crazy  "alternative  therapy"  websites  floating  through  the  ether.  Don't  worry.  If  you  follow  step  two  and  truly  own  your  cancer,  you'll  soon  recognize  trustworthy  sites  and  successfully  translate  information  into  meaningful  knowledge  specific  to  you.Select  the  right  physician  partners.  Most  newly  diagnosed  cancer  patients  are  so  overwhelmed  they  simply  accept  without  question  the  surgeon,  radiation  oncologist  and  oncologist  to  whom  they  are  referred.  But  who  makes  these  referrals?  Doctors  who  don't  really  know  you  refer  you  to  other  doctors  who  don't  know  you  at  all.No  one  better  than  you  and  your  loved  ones  understand  your  personality,  style  and  approach  to  life  (including  life's  challenges).  You  are  far  and  away  the  most  fit  to  select  physicians  who  should  partner  with  you  in  battling  your  disease.Most  cancers  are  preventable.  Here's  howIt  may  be  foreign  to  you,  even  intimidating,  but  you  need  to  select  your  physician  partners.  Interview  doctors.  No,  you  won't  have  the  knowledge  to  analyze  deeply  the  appropriateness  of  their  treatment  recommendations  (that's  why  you  should  interview  more  than  one),  but  you're  really  listening  for  how  they  interact  with  you  and  your  family.Do  they  welcome  questions?  Are  they  interested  in  educating  you?  Do  you  feel  rushed?  Are  they  too  serious?  Not  serious  enough?  To  participate  actively  in  your  care,  you  need  to  select  physician  partners  who  are  the  best  fit  for  you.Understand  two  critical  features  of  your  cancer.  Yes,  you  are  smart  enough  to  learn  about  the  two  critical  features  of  your  cancer,  as  guided  by  your  physician  partners  and  credible  resources,  and  put  that  knowledge  to  good  use.First,  you  must  learn  how  your  specific  type  of  cancer  behaves,  as  each  (breast,  prostate,  whatever)  is  unique.  Second,  you  must  understand  your  specific  cancer  stage.  Staging  differs  by  cancer  type.  However,  common  to  all  staging  is  objective  evaluation  of  your  tumor,  of  malignant  spread  (metastasis)  to  your  lymph  nodes,  and  of  tumor  metastasis  to  distant  organs  or  structures.Your  specific  cancer  type  and  stage  determine  everything  that  matters  to  you:  your  chance  of  cure,  potential  treatments  (and,  therefore,  associated  risks  and  side  effects),  and  your  likelihood  of  recurrent  cancer  following  treatment.Yes,  you  were  blindsided  by  your  cancer.  But  you  have  the  time  and  the  smarts  to  make  the  right  moves.  Own  your  cancer.Cancer  robbed  me  of  my  health;  now,  I'm  taking  it  back</TEXT></DOC>

Stephen  Sigmund  is  the  executive  director  of  the  Global  Gateway  Alliance.(CNN)  --  Vice  President  Joe  Biden  was  right  to  call  attention  to  New  York's  LaGuardia  Airport.  From  the  dilapidated  state  of  LaGuardia's  Central  Terminal  Building  to  the  minimal  public  transport  links  and  outdated  air  traffic  control  system,  the  metro  area's  airports  are  in  desperate  need  of  modernization.But  now  it's  time  for  Biden  and  other  leaders  to  put  their  money  where  their  rhetoric  is.  The  Federal  Government  and  local  politicians  must  step  up  and  take  sustained  action.And  the  goal  should  be  to  fix  the  problem,  not  point  fingers.  Despite  its  outdated  condition,  LaGuardia  serves  25  million  passengers  a  year.  As  the  closest  airport  to  Manhattan,  it  is  coveted  by  airlines.Moreover,  New  York  City's  three  major  airports  serve  more  than  110  million  people  a  year,  account  for  500,000  jobs  and  contribute  $63  billion  to  our  regional  economy,  according  to  a  November  2013  study  from  Global  Gateway  Alliance  and  Partnership  for  New  York  City.  And  they  are  the  largest  global  gateway  to  the  world  for  international  travelers,  with  U.S.  Customs  data  showing  that  John  F.  Kennedy  International  Airport  handles  the  most  international  visitors  and  Newark  International  Airport  the  fifth  most.  As  such,  the  airports  serve  as  a  symbol  for  the  entire  United  States.Airports  are  responsible  for  the  first  and  last  impressions  visitors  have,  and  in  New  York,  some  54  million  tourists  visited  last  year.  They  are  fundamentally  vital  to  our  economy,  tourism  industry  and  our  global  reputation.As  the  vice  president  pointed  out,  New  York's  airports  are  a  symbol  of  underinvestment  in  infrastructure  throughout  the  country.  When  the  Beatles  landed  in  New  York  50  years  ago  last  week,  our  airports  were  a  symbol  of  the  modern,  efficient  and  forward-looking  transportation  infrastructure  in  the  United  States.  Now,  they  are  the  embodiment  of  our  falling  behind  the  rest  of  the  world.Cities  all  over  the  world  have  recognized  the  significance  of  their  airports  and  have  invested  in  state-of-the-art  technology  and  infrastructure.  Our  own  Global  Gateway  Alliance  survey  showed  that  airports  from  Singapore  to  Paris  are  providing  innovative  amenities  such  as  40  foot  slides,  ice  skating  rinks  and  on  airport  baby  strollers  to  ensure  that  passengers  have  the  best  possible  experience.The  same  survey  showed  LaGuardia  and  New  York  area  airports  at  the  bottom  of  the  list  of  passenger  amenities.The  bottom  line  is  we  to  have  to  invest  in  our  airports  to  avoid  losing  out  to  national  and  international  competitors  and  to  provide  a  better  quality  of  life  for  those  millions  of  passengers.At  LaGuardia,  here's  how:--  21st  century  terminals:  LaGuardia's  Central  Terminal  Building,  built  in  1964,  is  a  prime  example  of  an  outdated  terminal  desperately  in  need  of  redevelopment,  which  is  why  it's  so  important  for  the  Port  Authority  to  deliver  on  the  promise  of  a  modern,  efficient  and  innovative  terminal.  There  are  also  significant  space  constraints  with  only  two  short  runways  and  limited  parking,  which  are  challenges  that  need  to  be  addressed.--  Better  passenger  amenities:  Frequently  voted  the  worst  airport  in  the  U.S.  by  passengers,  LaGuardia  is  definitely  not  known  for  its  amenities.  All  of  the  New  York  area  airports  would  benefit  from  providing  what  are  now  basic  services,  such  as  free  Wi-Fi,  which  would  help  business  travelers,  and  leave  visitors  with  a  better  impression  of  their  time  in  New  York.--  Improved  transportation  links:  Public  transportation  access  to  all  of  New  York's  airports  is  behind  other  world  class  cities,  which  have  one  seat  train  rides  directly  from  the  city  center  to  the  airport.  Options  for  getting  to  LaGuardia  via  public  transportation  are  very  limited,  but  a  Bus  Rapid  Transit  system,  with  dedicated  lanes  and  just  a  few  stops  to  the  airport,  would  help  remedy  that.  This  service  would  remove  the  threat  of  traffic  delays  normally  associated  with  buses  and  provide  a  convenient  and  reliable  direct  ride  to  the  airport.  Reviving  long  dormant  plans  for  a  direct  subway  extension  to  LaGuardia  are  also  worth  exploring.--  Bring  NextGen  to  New  York  first:  LaGuardia,  along  with  JFK  and  Newark,  is  the  most  delayed  airport  traffic  control  system  in  the  country.  Every  day,  our  airspace  contributes  to  one  half  to  three  quarters  of  all  delays  around  the  country.  The  solution  is  NextGen,  the  new  satellite-based  air  traffic  control  system.  Replacing  the  old  1960s  radar  technology  means  fewer  delays  on  the  ground  and  in  the  air.  But  the  FAA  has  to  step  up  and  make  it  happen  in  New  York.  Right  now,  the  federal  government  is  years  behind  in  developing  NextGen,  and  the  FAA  wants  to  roll  it  out  in  smaller  markets  first,  despite  the  tremendous  impact  the  New  York  airspace  has  on  national  delays.It's  past  time  to  stop  ignoring  our  airports  and  to  move  them  to  the  front  of  the  priorities  line.  That's  how  LaGuardia  will  go  from  Third  World  to  world  class.Follow  @CNNOpinion  on  Twitter.Join  us  at  Facebook/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  are  solely  those  of  the  authors.</TEXT></DOC>

He  was  pronounced  dead  at  the  scene.Investigators  discovered  close  to  50  envelopes  of  what  they  believed  was  heroin  in  the  apartment,  law  enforcement  sources  said.  They  also  found  used  syringes,  prescription  drugs  and  empty  plastic  bags  of  a  type  commonly  used  to  hold  drugs,  the  sources  said.Hoffman,  who  was  nominated  for  Academy  Awards  four  times,  won  the  Oscar  for  best  actor  in  2006  for  his  portrayal  of  writer  Truman  Capote  in  "Capote."

"A  lot  of  flights  were  canceled  pre-emptively,  so  we  don't  have  a  lot  of  people  stranded  in  the  airports.  It's  just  everyone  trying  to  get  in  and  out  of  D.C.  today  that'll  have  to  postpone  their  travel  plans."But  there  is  good  news.  "The  storm  did  move  a  little  farther  south  than  was  forecast  over  the  weekend,  so  New  York  was  spared  the  brunt  of  the  snow,  and  Philly  won't  see  as  much  as  originally  forecast,"  Morris  said.  "We're  only  looking  at  3  to  6  inches  of  snow  when  all  is  said  and  done  in  the  Philly  area  at  the  end  of  the  day.  We're  only  expecting  a  few  flurries  in  New  York  today."And  the  storm  should  clear  out  pretty  quickly.  "This  storm  will  be  over  and  done  with  before  you  know  it,"  Morris  said.  "The  snow  should  be  tapering  off  by  sunset,  and  that'll  give  crews  time  to  clear  the  runways  and  get  flights  moving  again.  Everything  should  be  back  up  and  running  normally  by  (Tuesday)  morning."Although  occasional  bad  winter  weather  isn't  anything  new  for  the  nation's  airlines,  the  relentless  pounding  off  snow  and  ice  is  having  a  big  impact.United  Airlines  had  to  cancel  22,500  flights  in  the  past  two  months,  four  times  as  many  flights  as  the  first  two  months  of  last  year,  the  airline  reported  Thursday.  In  January,  JetBlue  Airways  said  the  company's  profits  would  be  hurt  by  cancellations  forced  by  the  winter  weather.With  so  many  cancellations  and  the  possibility  of  more  severe  weather  affecting  your  travel,  consider  taking  these  measures  to  ease  the  pain  of  winter  travel.Building  airplanes  in  the  world's  biggest  buildingRebook  your  flight  for  free.  Airlines  don't  want  you  stranded  at  the  airport,  so  don't  wait  for  the  bad  weather  to  hit  to  change  your  itinerary  without  paying  a  change  fee.  They  will  often  post  weather  policies  on  their  websites.Act  quickly.  Rebook  your  itinerary  as  soon  as  possible.  Other  passengers  are  snapping  up  open  seats  as  you  wonder  whether  you  should  make  the  call.

You  might  live  in  a  sunny  place  and  be  traveling  to  a  sunny  place,  but  your  aircraft  and  crew  might  be  coming  from  Chicago.  Don't  assume  you  won't  be  affected  by  the  storms.Charge  your  devices.  Charge  up  before  you  head  out,  and  keep  a  charger  and  a  power  pack  or  a  few  battery  chargers  for  your  portable  electronic  devices  handy,  just  in  case  you  do  get  stuck.  You  can  probably  reschedule  your  flight  on  your  iPad  or  smartphone  while  you're  waiting  in  line  to  rebook.Be  nice.

Just  because  you're  not  flying  doesn't  mean  the  weather  won't  affect  you.

But  she  wanted  more  for  her  growing  family,  so  she  gave  up  the  swear  words  --  for  the  following  reasons.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  upwave  is  Turner  Broadcasting's  new  lifestyle  brand  designed  to  entertain  the  health  into  you!

I  grew  up  in  and  around  Boston,  where  most  folks  use  swear  words  as  adjectives,  nouns  and  pronouns.  It  doesn't  matter  if  you're  10  or  100:  In  Boston,  the  F-  and  S-words  are  always  preferred  when  describing  positive  things  or  events  ("I  just  gawt  a  kick-ahhhs  f***ing  pahking  spawt!")  or  negative  people  or  situations  ("That  f***ing  piece  of  s**t  took  my  pahking  spawt!").  In  my  experience,  anyway.So,  I  grew  into  a  writer  who  gets  a  kick  out  of  using  curse  words.  It's  my  profession  to  play  with  language,  and  sometimes,  no  other  term  can  drive  a  point  home  as  efficiently.However,  when  my  kids  were  born,  I  went  mellow.  At  that  time,  it  wasn't  much  of  a  conscious  decision.  Aside  from  the  time  I  dropped  a  can  of  formula  on  my  foot,  there  wasn't  much  reason  to  curse  at  or  around  a  baby.  But  as  my  kids  (and  stress  levels)  grew,  certain  words  began  to  slip  out  almost  unbeknownst  to  me,  like  air  out  of  a  slow-leaking  tire.upwave:  3  ways  to  check  stress  at  the  doorI  decided  to  curb  the  cursing  around  my  kids  because...I'd  rather  rule  my  roost  by  exampleWhen  I  grew  up,  "Do  as  I  say,  not  as  I  do"  was  a  common  parenting  crutch.  Back  then,  parents  said  and  did  whatever  they  wanted  and  their  offspring  were  expected  to  just  respect  the  adage  and  fall  in  line,  just  because.  As  a  kid,  I  found  this  free  pass  for  hypocritical  behavior  quite  annoying.  But  when  I  became  a  parent,  I  finally  saw  the  value  in  it.  Kids  need  limits.  They  can't  drink  or  get  a  credit  card  either,  can  they?  Just  because  I  curse  doesn't  mean  they  can  or  should.  That  philosophy  worked  pretty  well...  until  the  day  my  kid  called  me  a  hypocrite.  So  I  let  go  of  the  crutch.upwave:  Is  it  good  to  let  your  kids  screw  up?You  can't  rely  on  reverse  psychologyAs  any  parent  will  tell  you,  the  Murphy's  Law  of  parenting  states  that  whatever  principles  you  endorse  may,  at  some  point,  inspire  and  incite  your  children  to  do  just  the  opposite.  In  my  life,  this  law  pertains  to  cursing.  My  dad  was  always  real  uptight  about  swearing,  which  greatly  contributed  to  my  becoming  a  potty  mouth  to  rival  any  known  clichés  about  potty  mouths.  But  who  knows  if  my  kids  would,  as  I  did,  eventually  position  their  sensibilities  in  direct  opposition  to  mine?  It's  a  (pardon  the  pun)  crapshoot,  at  best.upwave:  The  6-step  fearless  parenting  modelI  want  my  kids  to  be  verbally  creativeI'd  like  my  kids  to  have  more  colorful  descriptors  under  their  belts  than  just  "F"  this  and  "S"  that.  As  I'm  raising  my  family  in  New  York  --  a  city  that  is  just  as  committed  to  colorful  language  as  my  hometown  --  I  figure  there'll  be  plenty  of  time  for  them  to  perfect  their  cursing  skills.For  now,  the  challenge  lies  in  editing  my  vocabulary  while  encouraging  theirs  to  grow.This  article  was  originally  published  on  upwave.com.©  2013  upwave,  All  Rights  Reserved.</TEXT></DOC>

Today,  his  family  credits  fish  oil  for  his  dramatic  recovery.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>For  more  on  Grant  Virgin's  incredible  story,  tune  in  to  "Sanjay  Gupta,  MD"  at  4:30  p.m.  ET  Saturday  and  7:30  a.m.  ET  Sunday.Palm  Desert,  California  (CNN)  --  It  was  mild  curiosity  that  drew  John  Virgin  and  his  son  Bryce  to  the  flashing  lights  and  commotion  of  an  accident  scene  near  their  home.In  the  back  of  John's  mind  was  his  older  son,  Grant,  who  had  gone  for  a  walk  nearby  minutes  earlier.He  gestured  to  an  emergency  medical  technician  to  ask  what  happened."I  called  him  over  and  I  said,  'My  son  was  walking  over  this  way,'  and  he  said,  'Describe  him,'"  said  John.  "I  said,  'Well,  he's  6  feet  tall  and  has  hair  color  just  like  mine,'  and  then  he  pointed  at  Bryce  and  said,  '...and  looks  just  like  him.'"John  looked  down  at  the  area  that  had  been  cordoned-off  --  the  pavement  covered  with  blood  --  and  his  heart  sank."At  that  point  you  realize  your  worst  fear,"  he  said.  "I  knew  it  was  grave."Minutes  earlier,  the  16-year-old  had  been  airlifted  to  a  nearby  trauma  center  after  being  struck  by  a  hit-and-run  driver.  He  had  a  long  list  of  injuries:  a  torn  aorta,  a  traumatic  brain  injury  --  including  skull  fractures  and  bleeding  throughout  his  brain  --  compound  bone  fractures  and  spinal  fractures.  Seemingly  endless  bits  of  broken  glass  and  gravel  were  embedded  in  his  skin.John  and  Bryce  Virgin  rushed  home  to  break  the  news  to  Grant's  mother,  JJ.  Then  the  family  hurried  to  the  hospital,  hoping  to  find  him  still  alive.When  they  arrived,  they  were  met  by  grim-faced  doctors  who  offered  the  slimmest  odds  that  Grant  Virgin  would  live  through  the  night.Instead  of  shrugging  their  shoulders  in  acceptance,  his  parents  were  indignant."It's  like,  how  dare  you  not  fight  for  my  son's  life?"  said  JJ  Virgin.  "It  really  took  us  ...  getting  very  aggressive  and  assertive  to  save  our  son's  life,  because  they  weren't  going  to  do  it."They  told  us  not  to.  They  told  us  to  let  him  go."From  that  moment  forward  --  time  and  time  again  --  they  would  go  against  doctor's  orders.  That  included  trying  unconventional,  untested  therapies  --  anything  that  might  help  Grant.  One  in  particular  involved  giving  him  high  doses  of  omega-3  fatty  acids  (found  in  fish  oil).Fish  oil  is  what  the  Virgin  family  believes  ultimately  --  dramatically  --  altered  his  life  course,  and  healed  his  brain.Weeks  before  fish  oil  was  even  considered,  Grant  Virgin  underwent  multiple  surgeries,  and  spent  considerable  time  on  a  ventilator.Eventually,  his  body  was  stable,  but  his  brain  was  still  riddled  with  damage.  He  was  in  a  coma,  and  his  doctors  urged  his  family  to  "wait  and  see"  while  his  brain  healed."The  doctor  told  me,  'OK,  now  we  wait.'  and  I  go,  'We  wait?'  'Yes,  we  wait,'"  said  JJ  Virgin,  who  questioned  that  course  of  action  --  "'Surely  there's  something  we  can  do?'"The  doctor's  response,  according  to  her:  "'Nope,  there's  nothing  we  can  do.  We  just  wait.  The  brain's  got  its  own  time  schedule.'"Around  the  same  time,  she  was  receiving  a  flurry  of  advice  from  friends.  One  suggested  trying  progesterone  to  heal  her  son's  brain.In  early  studies,  progesterone  has  been  associated  with  reduced  inflammation  in  the  brain  and  improved  neurological  outcomes  after  traumatic  brain  injury.  But  the  data  in  this  area,  although  promising,  are  very  early.Despite  that,  beginning  about  two  weeks  after  the  accident,  his  mother  and  father  began  intermittently  rubbing  a  cream  containing  progesterone  on  him.  (A  leading  expert  questioned  the  efficacy  of  administering  progesterone  in  this  way,  noting  that  in  studies,  it  is  administered  intravenously.)His  family  says  very  soon  afterward,  Grant  Virgin  emerged  from  his  coma,  and  began  to  speak.It  was  mostly  a  few  words  and  phrases  --  "Let's  go"  or  "I  love  you"  --  uttered  in  endless  cycles,  but  his  family  was  heartened  by  his  progress."When  your  kid  is  in  a  coma,  and  then  coming  out  of  a  coma,  you  watch  every  nuance,"  said  JJ  Virgin.  "If  his  eyelash  fluttered,  'Oh,  his  eyelash  fluttered!'"You're  holding  on  to  anything  that  you  can  see  and  monitoring  everything,  every  single  day.  And  so  it  was  very  clear  when  the  acceleration  happened.  Really  clear."Another,  more  dramatic,  acceleration  occurred  several  weeks  later  --  about  nine  weeks  after  the  accident.JJ  Virgin  got  more  advice,  this  time  from  friends  who  had  seen  a  CNN  report  about  high-dose  fish  oil  used  in  cases  of  severe  traumatic  brain  injury.Fish  oil,  they  thought,  might  heal  Grant  Virgin's  brain."If  someone  said  to  me,  you  know  what,  you  can  give  him  fish  oil,  you  can  give  him  better  nutrition,  you'll  get  maybe  5%  (improvement),  I'll  take  that,"  she  said.She  got  in  touch  with  one  of  the  foremost  omega-3  experts,  Dr.  Barry  Sears,  who  had  consulted  on  the  first-ever  case  of  high-dose  fish  oil  for  traumatic  brain  injury  in  2006.It  involved  a  miner,  Randal  McCloy,  who  was  involved  in  a  deadly  explosion  in  West  Virginia.  His  brain  had  been  badly  damaged  by  carbon  monoxide,  and  his  team  of  doctors  was  trying  desperately  to  keep  him  alive.McCloy's  neurosurgeon  at  the  time,  Dr.  Julian  Bailes,  describes  considering  high-dose  fish  oil  in  this  case,  as  akin  to  "throw(ing)  the  kitchen  sink  at  him.""There  is  no  known  solution,  there's  no  known  drug,  there's  nothing  that  we  have  really  to  offer  these  sorts  of  patients,"  said  Bailes,  co-director  of  NorthShore  Neurological  Institute  in  Evanston,  Illinois,  during  a  previous  interview  with  CNN.The  theory  behind  fish  oil  as  a  therapeutic  intervention  for  traumatic  brain  injury  is  at  once  simple  and  complex.Simply  stated,  the  brain's  cell  wall  is,  in  part,  composed  of  omega-3  fatty  acids."If  you  have  a  brick  wall  and  it  gets  damaged,  wouldn't  you  want  to  use  bricks  to  repair  it?"  said  Dr.  Michael  Lewis,  founder  of  the  Brain  Health  Education  and  Research  Institute.  "By  supplementing  using  (omega-3  fatty  acids)  in  substantial  doses,  you  provide  the  foundation  for  the  brain  to  repair  itself."More  complicated  is  how  omega-3  fatty  acids  might  control  inflammation  --  or  damage  --  in  the  brain.  Sears  likens  it  to  quelling  a  metaphorical  fire  in  the  brain.That  "fire"  begins  when  the  brain  is  traumatized  --  as  with  a  profound  injury  like  Grant  Virgin's,  or  milder  insults  like  concussions  suffered  on  a  soccer  field.  Neurons  snap,  setting  off  a  wave  of  inflammation  in  the  brain  that  can  smolder  for  long  periods  of  time  --  sometimes  weeks  or  months  after  the  injury  has  occurred."That  (inflammation)  will  continue  over  and  over  unless  there's  a  second  response  that  turns  it  off,"  said  Sears,  president  of  the  Inflammation  Research  Foundation.The  fatty  acid  that  Sears  says  can  effectively  "turn  off"  that  inflammatory  fire  is  a  metabolite  (what  remains  after  the  body  breaks  something  down)  of  eicosapentaenoic  acid,  or  EPA,  called  resolvin.EPA  is  found  in  fish  oil."What  we  think  is  happening  is,  high  levels  of  EPA  coursing  in  the  brain  metabolize  into  resolvins,  turning  down  and  turning  off  inflammatory  process,"  said  Sears.Considering  that,  according  to  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention,  1.7  million  traumatic  brain  injuries  occur  in  the  United  States  each  year,  any  intervention  --  especially  a  cheap  one  like  fish  oil  --  is  an  exciting  prospect.But  fish  oil  as  a  viable  and  well-studied  intervention  is  still  a  ways  off;  for  now  it  dwells  in  the  realm  of  the  anecdote  or  case  study.There  is  McCloy,  who  recovered  only  a  few  months  after  his  mining  accident.And  a  case  similar  to  Grant  Virgin's:  a  teenager  named  Bobby  Ghassemi  who  nearly  died  in  a  car  accident  before  getting  a  large  infusion  of  fish  oil.  A  few  months  later,  he  attended  his  high  school  graduation.There  was  the  case  of  an  8-year-old  girl  who  nearly  drowned  after  her  stroller  rolled  into  a  canal.  Her  head  and  face  were  under  water  for  more  than  five  minutes.Eighty-two  days  after  her  accident,  according  to  a  case  study  published  last  year  in  the  journal  PharmaNutrition,  she  was  given  high  doses  of  omega-3  fatty  acids,  after  which,  "...the  patient  exhibited  very  gradual  but  steady  progress  in  terms  of  her  tolerance  for  stimulation  and  activity."There  are  seven  such  cases  in  the  medical  literature,  according  to  Sears."Maybe  the  work  with  Randy  (McCloy)  was  just  a  lucky  break,"  said  Sears,  "But  we've  now  done  it  seven  times.  So,  so  far  we're  7-for-7  in  severe  brain  trauma."But  there  are  other  cases  --  likely  many  more  than  have  been  successful  --  when  fish  oil  was  tried  and  did  not  work.It  could  be  that  fish  oil  was  administered  outside  the  optimal  therapeutic  window.  Or  perhaps  younger  brains  are  more  receptive  to  the  intervention  (most  of  the  successful  case  studies  are  among  young  people).And  there  is  a  concern  among  doctors  that  high  doses  of  fish  oil  could  cause  excessive  bleeding.Those  caveats,  well  known  to  Grant  Virgin's  family,  did  not  deter  them.Nine  weeks  after  the  accident,  as  Grant  was  being  transferred  from  an  acute  care  to  a  rehabilitation  hospital,  the  Virgin  family  told  doctors  at  the  new  facility  that  he  was  already  on  a  20-gram-per-day  regimen  of  fish  oil.In  reality,  his  parents  had  been  sneaking  a  few  grams  of  fish  oil  into  his  feeding  tube  for  weeks,  but  nothing  resembling  that  high  dosage.Two  days  after  he  began  at  this  more  aggressive  dosage,  JJ  Virgin  got  a  phone  call  late  one  night."I  get  this  call  like  midnight,  and  I'm  asleep,  and  I  wake  up  the  next  morning  and  go,  'Did  Grant  call  me  and  did  we  have  this  whole  conversation?'"  she  said.  "I  just  remember  waking  up  the  next  morning  going,  'I  must  have  dreamed  that,  that  couldn't  have  possibly  happened."When  she  arrived  to  the  hospital  the  next  morning,  a  nurse  told  her  that,  in  fact,  it  had  not  been  a  dream.Forty-eight  hours  after  receiving  high-dose  fish  oil,  Grant  Virgin  asked  a  nurse  for  a  cell  phone  to  call  his  mother,  and  proceeded  to  have  a  conversation  with  her."Unbelievable,"  she  said.  "Unbelievable."Unbelievable,  especially  considering  that  was  only  two  months  after  Grant  Virgin's  parents  had  been  told  to  "let  him  go.""We  had  been  told  he'd  never  be  able  to  recognize  anybody,  he  will  never  be  able  to  focus  his  eyes,  all  the  grim  stuff,"  said  John  Virgin.  "(They  said)  the  diffuse  damage  to  his  brain  is  so  much  that  he's  never  going  to  be  Grant  again."Today,  16  months  after  the  accident,  none  of  that  is  true.  In  fact,  his  parents  say  he  is  even  better  than  he  was  when  he  made  that  call  to  his  mother."We're  not  expecting  Grant  to  get  close  to  where  he  was  before,  he's  going  to  be  better  than  he  was  before,"  said  his  father.  "And  he's  progressing  every  day."The  Virgin  family  says  that  progress  would  not  be  happening  if  they  had  merely  accepted  what  conventional  medicine  told  them."I  think  one  of  the  saddest  things  is  to  get  to  a  place  and  have  someone  tell  you,  'You  should  just  let  your  son  die,'  and  you  don't  have  the  information  to  make  the  right  decision,"  said  JJ  Virgin."There  is  such  hopelessness  about  brain  injury  and  there  shouldn't  be."That  rampant  hopelessness  when  it  comes  to  traumatic  brain  injury  is  fueling  a  push  by  Bailes  and  Sears  to  do  further  studies  about  omega-3.  (Bailes  receives  research  money  from  fish  oil  companies,  and  Sears  has  his  own  EPA-rich  formulation  of  fish  oil).They  are  on  the  cusp  of  beginning  a  broader  study  to  find  out  if  omega-3  can  be  a  useful  intervention  for  some  people  after  traumatic  brain  injury.The  Virgin  family,  based  on  their  own  dramatic  experience,  is  sure  that  omega-3  will  do  for  others  what  it  did  for  their  son."OK,  what  if  it  didn't  do  anything?"  said  John  Virgin.  "It  certainly  couldn't  hurt,  but  what  if  you  have  this  kind  of  result?"</TEXT></DOC>

Kathleen  Sebelius  is  secretary  of  Health  and  Human  Services.  Lisa  Monaco  is  assistant  to  the  President  for  homeland  security  and  counterterrorism.(CNN)  --  Eleven  years  ago  this  week,  the  world  faced  the  outbreak  of  Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome,  or  SARS,  a  new  epidemic  that  infected  some  8,000  people,  took  the  lives  of  775  individuals,  and  inflicted  $30  billion  in  damage  to  regional  economies.The  emergence  of  SARS  was  a  wake-up  call  for  the  World  Health  Organization  and  its  members,  including  the  United  States.  The  world  had  to  do  more  to  prevent,  detect  and  respond  to  new  biological  threats.This  is  not  just  a  health  challenge;  it's  a  security  challenge  as  well.Infectious  diseases  --  whether  naturally  occurring,  deliberate  or  accidental  --  have  the  potential  to  cause  enormous  damage  in  terms  of  lives  lost,  economic  impact  and  ability  to  recover,  just  as  with  nuclear,  chemical,  or  cybersecurity  attacks.During  the  anthrax  attacks  of  2001,  22  people  were  infected  and  five  people  lost  their  lives  here  in  in  the  United  States.  The  cleanup  cost  was  more  than  $1  billion.  The  global  H1N1  influenza  pandemic  of  2009  killed  284,000  people  worldwide  in  its  first  year  alone,  according  to  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention.In  the  decade  since  the  SARS  outbreak,  we  have  made  notable  progress.  China,  for  instance,  has  shown  leadership  in  its  transparent  approach  to  the  ongoing  and  rapidly  escalating  H7N9  influenza  outbreak.Under  revised  WHO  regulations,  many  countries  have  increased  capability  and  made  event  reporting  more  transparent.But  80%  of  the  world's  nations  still  are  not  prepared  to  deal  with  new  pandemics,  and  more  can  and  must  be  done  across  the  health,  agriculture  and  security  sectors  to  elevate  this  issue  and  steer  resources  toward  it.The  United  States  has  made  addressing  infectious  disease  threats  a  priority.  On  Thursday  in  Washington  and  Geneva,  we  are  convening  26  countries  to  launch  a  Global  Health  Security  Agenda  that  will  accelerate  progress  on  addressing  a  wide  range  of  global  health  security  threats.With  our  partners  and  allies,  we'll  be  intensifying  our  efforts  to  meet  the  challenges  of  an  increasingly  globalized  world,  whether  that  means  the  emergence  and  spread  of  new  microbes,  the  globalization  of  travel  and  food  supply,  the  rise  of  drug-resistant  pathogens,  or  the  risk  of  an  inadvertent  or  intentional  release.At  the  same  time,  we'll  continue  to  work  to  prevent  terrorists  from  developing,  acquiring  or  using  biological  agents  for  harm.New  diseases  are  inevitable,  but  in  the  21st  century  we  have  the  tools  to  greatly  reduce  the  threat  posed  by  global  epidemics.  We  can  put  in  place  a  safe,  secure,  globally  linked,  inter-operable  system  to  prevent  disease  threats,  detect  outbreaks  in  real  time,  and  share  information  and  expertise  to  respond  effectively.To  achieve  this  goal,  we  must  work  more  effectively  across  sectors  and  governments,  harmonize  our  efforts,  identify  what  works  and  measure  our  progress.We  invite  national  leaders,  international  organizations  and  nongovernmental  stakeholders  from  around  the  world  to  join  us  in  this  endeavor.  Our  security  and  the  lives  and  livelihoods  of  our  citizens  depend  on  it.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  John  Kerry,  Kathleen  Sebelius  and  Lisa  Monaco.</TEXT></DOC>

"Logan  was  never  supposed  to  be  coupled  with  Veronica  originally,  show  creator  Rob  Thomas  revealed  at  the  PaleyFest  panel.  But  he  grew  on  the  writers  when  they  saw  Dohring's  chemistry  with  star  Kristen  Bell.That  chemistry  came  back  right  away  when  he  did  his  first  scene  with  Bell  on  set,  Dohring  told  CNN."I  think  Kristen  is  amazing,  and  when  she  smiles  at  me  I  kind  of  go,  'holy  s---  what  do  I  do?'  I  smile  back,  and  it  just  comes  right  back."Meanwhile,  Chris  Lowell  offered  "Team  Piz"  fans  this  hint  about  his  character's  chances  of  being  the  one  to  end  up  with  Veronica."I  think  Rob  likes  to  not  put  a  period  on  the  end  of  every  sentence  when  he  finishes  something,"  he  said.  "The  show  ended  on  a  cliffhanger  note.  I  believe  in  a  way  he  did  a  similar  thing  here."Thomas  said  the  resolution  might  still  be  debated  in  fan  circles  even  after  they  see  the  movie."I  think  that  fans  will  understand  why  Veronica  makes  the  decisions  she  makes,"  he  said."It's  a  fun  predicament  to  put  Veronica  in  --  will  she  go  with  her  good  sense  or  her  passions?"One  thing  Thomas  did  make  clear  is  that  he  made  the  final  call  on  how  things  ended  up."It  was  not  up  for  a  vote.  Certainly  I  had  a  way  I  wanted  it  to  go  and  that's  how  it  went,  but  we'll  let  the  fans  decide  if  they're  happy  with  how  it  ended  up."Of  course,  none  of  this  would  have  been  possible  without  the  crowdfunding  from  Kickstarter,  which  gave  the  movie  its  budget  of  well  over  $5  million."It's  been  a  roller  coaster  ride  for  me  in  terms  of  hope,"  he  said."There  were  moments  where  I  felt  optimistic  and  bullish  about  our  chances,  and  others  where  I  felt  so  low,  I  thought  it  wouldn't  happen.  Kristen  Bell  has  this  confidence  and  optimism  that  kept  it  going.  It  was  like  a  mini-miracle  when  it  came  together."Thomas  thinks  this  could  potentially  be  something  we  see  more  and  more,  especially  when  it  comes  to  Warner  Bros.,  the  studio  that  owns  "Veronica  Mars"  and  gave  Thomas  the  opportunity  to  try  crowdfunding.  (Warner  Bros.  Pictures  is  owned  by  Time  Warner,  which  also  owns  CNN.)"The  next  few  weeks  will  tell.  If  the  movie  makes  money  then  I  think  there's  an  opportunity  for  more  movies  like  ours  to  be  made,"  he  said."If  we  find  this  model  that  can  support  $5  or  $10  million,  I  think  [Warner  Bros.]  would  be  thrilled,  and  I'd  be  proud  if  we  got  more  $5  to  10  million  movies  [based  on  existing  series  or  properties]  because  of  this."So  might  we  get  more  "Veronica  Mars"  after  this?  There's  already  a  CW  Web  series  based  on  Ryan  Hansen's  character  Dick  Casablancas  set  to  shoot  in  July.Thomas  told  the  fans  at  PaleyFest  that  the  idea  of  a  Netflix  or  Amazon  season  of  "Veronica  Mars"  excites  him  to  no  end."I  would  love  to  be  able  to  do  the  R-rated  version  of  'Veronica  Mars.'  I  would  love  to  tell  some  darker  stories."In  the  meantime,  fans  can  hope  that  Thomas'  TV  adaptation  of  the  comic  book  "iZombie"  starring  Rose  McIver  ("Once  Upon  a  Time,"  "Masters  of  Sex")  gets  picked  up  by  the  CW."They  said  they  wanted  a  kick-ass  female  centric  show  like  'Buffy'  and  'Veronica,'  and  I  think  it's  a  fun  show  in  that  vein,"  he  told  CNN."I  think  we  jump  off  the  comic  book  [storylines]  quite  a  bit,  but  we  keep  the  basic  idea  that  our  young  female  zombies  have  to  eat  brains  to  survive,  and  she  gets  the  memories  of  the  people  whose  brains  she's  consuming."Well,  we  can  see  one  big  difference  right  away.  So  not  just  "Veronica  Mars"  fans  but  clearly,  "Walking  Dead"  fans  might  want  to  check  it  out,  as  well.</TEXT></DOC>

The  doors  of  the  National  Corvette  Museum  opened  as  usual  Thursday  morning,  but  this  day  is  not  going  to  be  typical.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  At  the  Church  of  the  Corvette,  it's  the  Day  After.  The  doors  of  the  National  Corvette  Museum  opened  as  usual  Thursday  morning  in  Bowling  Green,  Kentucky,  but  this  day  is  not  going  to  be  typical.When  a  historically  giant  sinkhole  suddenly  appears  inside  one  of  the  world's  sanctuaries  of  uber-cool  cars  as  it  did  Wednesday,  it  changes  the  mental  landscape  a  bit.A  40-foot-wide,  20-to-30-foot  deep  chasm  tends  to  shake  you  up,  say  folks  who've  seen  the  hole  with  their  own  eyes.  No  one  was  hurt,  but  the  mood  in  the  museum  is  somber.  They're  a  bit  less  shaken  than  they  were  Wednesday,  when  the  sinkhole  swallowed  eight  priceless  Corvettes  inside  a  part  of  the  museum  called  the  Sky  Dome."We've  been  given  an  OK  and  everything  is  safe,"  said  museum  spokeswoman  Katie  Frassinelli.  About  a  dozen  visitors  were  exploring  the  place  Thursday  morning,  she  said,  but  the  Sky  Dome  remains  closed  indefinitely.Nature's  disturbance  of  this  holy  site  started  a  wave  of  concern  across  the  Corvette  Nation  that  continued  to  ripple  around  the  web  Thursday."Who  could  fathom  such  a  thing?"  asked  CNN  commenter  440sixpack.  "I  don't  live  anywhere  near  this  sort  of  geological  risk,  but  still  I'm  tempted  to  arrange  for  a  sub-surface  analysis  under  my  own  garage  just  so  I  can  still  sleep  good."Fans  at  Supercompressor.com  asked  the  question:  Why  couldn't  this  "have  happened  to  a  Yugo  museum  instead?"'Vette  fans  have  been  stepping  forward  to  help.  Auto  parts  store  owner  Chuck  Tamraz  told  reporters  he's  volunteering  to  find  any  replacement  parts  to  restore  the  cars.So,  what  the  hell  happened?  How  could  a  gaping  hole  just  appear  in  such  a  wrong  place?Keep  in  mind  that  this  is  cave  country.  Western  Kentucky  is  the  home  of  Mammoth  Cave  National  Park,  the  largest  known  cave  system  in  the  world.  Sinkholes  pop  up  constantly  in  these  parts,  usually  caused  by  ground  water  eroding  underground  limestone  over  many  years,  forming  a  void  underneath  the  surface  of  the  earth.  Eventually,  the  soil  that  was  above  the  dissolving  limestone  has  nothing  to  support  it  anymore,  and  it  collapses."Right  now,  the  ground  at  the  museum  seems  like  it's  pretty  stable,"  said  Western  Kentucky  University  geologist  Jason  Polk.  Experts  have  assessed  and  inspected  the  entire  building  using  ground  monitoring  equipment.  Engineer  Matthew  Dettman,  a  22-year  professor  at  WKU,  said  sinkholes  rarely  form  in  clusters.  "The  likelihood  that  another  is  going  to  drop  out  is  possible,  but  unlikely.""The  contractor  in  charge  will  certainly  want  to  do  some  investigation  to  verify  that  we  don't  have  any  other  issues  in  the  building  that  we  know  of,"  Dettman  said.That  contractor,  Mike  Murphy  of  Scott,  Murphy  and  Daniel  Construction,  acknowledged  that  his  business  runs  across  at  least  one  of  these  sinkhole  situations  every  month."The  only  difference  is  this  one  swallowed  eight  collector  Corvettes,"  he  said.  "But  it  is  repairable."He  assured  reporters  Thursday  the  building  was  "in  good  condition,  and  the  foundation  and  structure  is  in  good  condition."But  the  cars.  Those  sweet  cars.  Oh,  the  humanity!Some  of  them,  Dettman  said,  are  buried  so  deep  in  the  hole  that  they  can't  be  seen  from  the  surface.  "It's  fascinating,  and  sad,"  he  said  Thursday  morning  on  the  phone.  But  "the  timing  could  have  been  a  lot  worse,"  Dettman  said.  Amazing  closed  circuit  security  video  shows  the  hole  opening  up  early  Wednesday  morning  before  the  museum  was  scheduled  to  open.  "There  are  times  where  there  are  so  many  people  in  that  room,  you  can't  even  move  around."Some  of  the  museum  workers  were  busy  washing  the  cars  that  survived  the  sinkhole.  "I  can't  say  we've  ever  had  to  clear  concrete  dust  off  of  our  cars  before,"  Frassinelli  said.  "They  have  to  be  really  careful."Polk,  who  spent  most  of  Wednesday  at  the  sinkhole  site,  said  "the  whole  experience  was  surreal,"  adding  that  "it  was  definitely  lucky  for  the  people  --  not  so  much  for  the  Corvettes."By  the  way,  for  the  record,  he  says  he's  a  'Vette  fan  --  but  he  drives  a  Toyota.For  right  now,  Dettman  says  the  risk  is  extremely  minimal.  The  Sky  Dome  has  been  closed  to  the  public,  while  visitors  will  be  able  to  tour  the  rest  of  the  facility.  Another  stroke  of  luck:  the  dome's  round  shape  makes  it  less  likely  to  collapse  on  itself,  Dettman  said.  But  about  10%  of  the  concrete  footing  supporting  the  structure's  signature  red  spire,  which  shoots  high  over  the  museum,  has  been  "undermined"  somewhat.  "We  do  have  to  shore  it  up  even  though  part  of  it  is  bearing  on  bedrock,"  he  explained.The  Sky  Dome  has  a  long  road  to  recovery.  It  will  take  at  least  four  to  six  days  to  pull  the  Corvettes  out  of  the  chasm,  and  then  construction  crews  will  begin  filling  in  the  hole,  Murphy  said.Timing  may  have  been  good  for  the  Sky  Dome,  but  it  was  bad  on  another  level.  The  sinkhole  comes  as  the  museum  prepares  to  celebrate  its  20th  anniversary  this  August.  Big  doings  are  in  the  works,  including  the  grand  opening  of  a  new  nearby  MotorSports  Park,  where  sinkholes  were  found  and  dealt  with  during  construction."Sinkholes  are  so  common  here  that  I  would  have  been  shocked  if  they  hadn't  found  any,"  Dettman  said.But  museum  executive  director  Wendell  Strode  said  the  Sky  Dome  will  reopen  in  time  for  the  festivities.  "August  is  our  target  date,"  he  said.How  do  you  fix  a  sinkhole?  You  can  fill  it  in  with  dirt  or  other  types  of  material.  Or  sometimes,  it's  impossible  to  fix,  and  the  location  has  to  be  abandoned.  It  depends  on  the  situation,  said  Polk.Discussions  about  how  to  proceed  with  the  museum  sinkhole  are  expected  to  continue  Thursday,  and  there's  no  firm  plan  yet.  No  one  really  knows  how  long  it  will  be  before  we  know  if  the  Sky  Dome  will  survive  this  attack  by  Mother  Nature.Hopefully,  said  Polk,  "the  sooner  the  better."CNN's  Chelsea  J.  Carter  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

One  woman  called  out  for  her  baby.Another,  they  said,  hit  the  ceiling  so  hard  that  she  cracked  the  panel  above  her  head.United  Airlines  Flight  1676,  carrying  114  passengers  and  five  crew  members,  was  headed  from  Denver  to  Billings,  Montana.Just  as  it  was  about  to  land,  turbulence  struck.  The  plane  started  convulsing."There  was  a  lot  of  screaming,  a  lot  of  hollering,"  Bill  Dahlin  told  CNN  affiliate  KTVQ.Three  crew  members  and  two  passengers  were  taken  to  local  hospitals.All  were  treated  and  released  except  one  flight  attendant,  the  airline  said.Dahlin  said  the  turbulence  apparently  took  the  flight  crew  by  surprise."I  think  they  were  trying  to  assess  things  themselves,  so  they  really  didn't  offer  any  explanation  because  of  what  happened  so  quickly,"  he  told  KTVQ.Another  passenger,  Laurel  Linde,  told  CNN  the  sudden  turbulence  felt  like  a  fall."It  almost  felt  like  an  impact  from  below  the  plane.  It  was  so  sharp,  and  then  things  and  people  were  flying  everywhere,"  she  said.Some  folks  weren't  strapped  into  their  seats,  like  a  man  sitting  just  a  row  or  two  in  front  of  Linde."He  flew  up  out  of  his  seat,  hit  the  roof  of  the  plane  and  ended  up  on  the  other  side  of  the  aisle  on  top  of  a  woman  on  that  side,"  she  said.United  Airlines  said  its  flight  safety  team  will  review  what  happened."Our  primary  focus  is  assisting  our  employees  and  passengers  who  were  injured,"  United  spokeswoman  Christen  David  said.Transatlantic  flights  set  to  be  bumpierLast  month,  a  United  flight  returned  to  Newark  Liberty  International  Airport  in  New  Jersey  after  turbulence  injured  five  flight  attendants.The  Beijing-bound  United  Flight  89  hit  "severe  turbulence"  about  45  minutes  into  the  flight,  officials  said.According  to  the  FAA,  turbulence  can  be  unexpected  and  can  happen  even  when  the  sky  appears  to  be  clear.United  Airlines  flight  returns  to  Newark  airport  after  severe  turbulenceCNN's  Mike  Ahlers,  Dana  Ford  and  Ray  Sanchez  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

So  while  Friday's  California  Superior  Court  hearing  did  signal  apparent  progress  in  the  hot-button  case,  it  does  not  represent  a  final  agreement.Earlier  in  this  hearing,  the  judge  asked  attorneys  for  the  McMath  family  and  Children's  Hospital  Oakland  to  confer  to  attempt  to  settle  the  issue  of  what  will  happen  with  Jahi.After  this  hearing  broke,  representatives  for  both  the  family  and  hospital  headed  to  federal  court.There,  a  magistrate  will  oversee  mandatory  talks  between  representatives  of  the  hospital  and  the  family,  CNN  affiliate  KTVU  reported.Both  hearings  occurred  on  the  same  day  that  the  coroner  for  Alameda  County  issued  a  death  certificate  for  Jahi.  This  action  is  not  directly  connected  to  Friday's  pair  of  legal  proceedings.Meanwhile,  a  deadline  looms.  A  judge  has  ruled  that  Jahi  can  be  cut  off  a  ventilator  at  5  p.m.  Tuesday.Bleeding  profuselyLast  month,  Jahi  had  surgery  to  remove  her  tonsils,  adenoids  and  extra  sinus  tissue.  Doctors  had  recommended  the  surgery  to  treat  pediatric  obstructive  sleep  apnea,  a  condition  that  made  her  stop  breathing  in  her  sleep  and  caused  other  medical  problems.Before  the  surgery,  Jahi  was  worried  that  she  would  never  wake  up,  according  to  her  uncle.  She  seemed  fine  after  the  surgery  and  asked  for  a  Popsicle  because  her  throat  hurt.Opinion:  Let  the  parents  decideIt  wasn't  long  before  something  went  terribly  wrong.  In  the  intensive  care  unit,  the  girl  began  bleeding  profusely  --  an  image  that  her  mother  said  would  be  forever  seared  in  her  mind.According  to  family  members,  Jahi  went  into  cardiac  arrest.  Days  later,  she  was  declared  brain  dead.Hospital  officials  have  said  privacy  laws  prevent  them  from  discussing  details  of  the  case.More  supportThe  family  of  Terri  Schiavo  has  joined  the  battle  recently."Together  with  our  team  of  experts,  Terri's  Network  believes  Jahi's  case  is  representative  of  a  very  deep  problem  within  the  U.S.  healthcare  system  --  particularly  those  issues  surrounding  the  deaths  of  patients  within  the  confines  of  hospital  corporations,  which  have  a  vested  financial  interest  in  discontinuing  life,"  the  Terri  Schiavo  Life  &  Hope  Network  said  in  a  statement.Schiavo  was  a  brain-damaged  woman  who  died  in  2005  after  living  on  a  feeding  tube  for  more  than  a  decade.  She  was  the  subject  of  a  lengthy  legal  battle  between  her  parents  and  her  husband,  Michael  Schiavo,  who  maintained  that  she  wouldn't  have  wanted  to  live  in  a  "persistent  vegetative  state."The  organization  said  it  has  been  overseeing  the  efforts  of  several  groups  to  help  get  Jahi  transferred  out  of  Children's  Hospital  Oakland  and  brought  "to  a  safe  place."Jahi's  family  said  Tuesday  that  it  had  found  a  facility  in  New  York  willing  to  take  her.  The  Oakland  hospital  "refused  to  agree  to  allow  us  to  proceed  in  that  matter,"  Jahi's  uncle  Omari  Sealey  said.The  hospital  denied  the  accusation."We  have  done  everything  to  assist  the  family  of  Jahi  McMath  in  their  quest  to  take  the  deceased  body  of  their  daughter  to  another  medical  facility,"  hospital  spokesman  Sam  Singer  said."To  date,  they  have  been  unwilling  or  unable  to  provide  a  physician  to  perform  the  procedures  necessary,  transportation,  or  a  facility  that  would  accept  a  dead  person  on  a  ventilator.  Our  hearts  and  thoughts  go  out  to  them  in  this  tragic  situation,  but  the  statements  being  made  by  their  attorney  and  some  family  members  are  misleading  and  untrue."Family  attorney  Christopher  Dolan  had  accused  the  hospital  of  being  "hell-bent"  on  ending  Jahi's  life.In  addition  to  the  coroner,  a  judge  has  declared  Jahi  brain  dead  as  well.  Doctors  say  there's  no  chance  she  will  come  back  to  life.Sealey  said  Wednesday  that  the  family  still  hopes  to  move  her  to  another  facility.He  accused  the  hospital  of  starving  his  niece  by  not  using  a  feeding  tube  to  provide  her  with  nutrients.Singer  said  a  judge  had  dismissed  the  family's  request  for  additional  medical  procedures  Tuesday,  including  a  feeding  tube.CNN's  Greg  Botelho  and  Elizabeth  Landau  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

And  that's  before  they  hit  the  casinos.They  hope  the  political  payoff  will  come  in  appearances  before  some  of  the  party's  most  influential  donors  attending  the  Republican  Jewish  Coalition  annual  spring  meeting.Former  Florida  Gov.  Jeb  Bush  and  current  Govs.  Chris  Christie  of  New  Jersey,  Scott  Walker  of  Wisconsin  and  John  Kasich  of  Ohio  will  speak  before  the  group,  which  seeks  to  promote  Jewish  causes  among  Republicans.Many  of  the  nation's  leading  Republican  fundraisers  and  donors  are  part  of  the  organization.  Some  donors  estimate  about  a  third  of  the  party's  most  important  fundraisers  are  active  in  the  coalition,  so  it's  a  major  audience  for  the  possible  presidential  candidates  attending.Bush  is  getting  a  lot  of  attention  because  he  has  been  tapped  to  speak  at  a  private,  VIP  dinner  with  major  financiers  on  Thursday  night  --  giving  him  top  billing  for  the  event  and  a  major  platform  as  he  considers  whether  to  seek  the  party's  nomination.  While  he  has  said  he  won't  make  a  decision  until  the  end  of  this  year  and  won't  engage  in  further  talk  about  the  subject,  Bush  has  recently  picked  up  the  pace  with  his  political  schedule,  appearing  in  the  past  two  weeks  at  fundraisers  for  Sen.  Lamar  Alexander,  R-Tennessee,  and  Govs.  Susana  Martinez,  R-New  Mexico,  and  Brian  Sandoval,  R-Nevada,  both  running  for  re-election,  as  well  as  at  an  event  for  House  Republicans  helping  him  build  a  network  of  supporters  if  he  needs  one."Jeb  has  something  to  prove  at  this  meeting,"  one  influential  Republican  donor  who  will  be  attending  told  CNN.  "It  is  pretty  significant"  for  him  to  come  to  the  event  because  he  has  refused  to  tip  his  hand  any  more  about  his  intentions,  the  donor  said.  "Jeb  has  to  do  a  good  job  of  handling  that  issue."Another  party  money  man  said  the  event  is  a  "great  opportunity  for  him"  with  decision-makers.  "Showing  up  and  speaking  is  showing  'I  am  taking  this  seriously,'  "  is  how  he  put  it  to  CNN.Bush,  who  served  as  Florida's  governor  from  1999  to  2007,  is  liked  by  many  in  this  key  group.  During  his  tenure,  and  his  father's  and  brother's  time  in  the  White  House,  they  built  good  relations  with  the  American  Jewish  community.Jeb  Bush,  Hillary  Clinton  together  again  to  talk  educationMany  eyes  on  Christie  as  wellChristie,  who  speaks  on  Saturday,  is  also  known  to  many  in  this  group."Most  of  the  people  will  be  making  a  judgment  on  Christie"  during  his  appearance,  one  of  the  donors  told  CNN.  "We  are  not  absent  'Bridgegate,'  "  referring  to  the  scandal  over  the  closing  of  access  lanes  to  the  George  Washington  Bridge  last  year  in  an  apparent  act  of  political  retaliation  by  some  of  his  aides.  Christie  has  said  he  was  not  aware  of  the  closings  until  they  happened."People  are  going  to  want  to  have  the  hallway  conversations  ...  private  meetings"  to  discuss  where  the  controversy  stands,  the  donor  said.A  different  major  party  fundraiser  said  that  Christie  so  far  has  emerged  fine  among  many  of  the  donors,  who  like  his  political  accomplishments  and  policies."I  don't  think  in  the  long  term  this  will  harm  him,"  the  fundraiser  said.As  Christie  travels  around  the  country  raising  millions  as  head  of  the  Republican  Governors  Association,  he  is  building  up  support  among  the  donor  class.Besides  their  public  appearances  at  the  meeting,  Christie,  Kasich  and  Walker  all  can  be  expected  to  have  smaller  individual  sessions  with  some  influential  attendees.Christie:  Bridge  scandal  doesn't  change  anything  about  2016Will  Adelson  tip  his  hand?The  host  for  the  weekend  activities  is  Republican  mega-donor  Sheldon  Adelson,  owner  of  the  Venetian  Casino  where  the  meeting  is  taking  place,  and  active  in  the  Republican  Jewish  Coalition.  Adelson  and  his  wife  gave  $93  million  to  various  groups  and  candidates  in  the  2012  election  cycle,  according  to  the  Center  for  Responsive  Politics,  making  them  the  biggest  individuals  financiers  of  outside  groups.The  Thursday  dinner  will  be  at  the  airport  hangar  Adelson  uses.While  candidates  and  groups  would  love  to  have  his  support,  several  GOP  donors  said  they  doubt  Adelson  will  tip  his  hand  any  time  soon.  One  said  he  is  "very  hard  to  uncover  ...  he  likes  to  support  existing  groups  with  real  structure."Adelson  did  support  the  super  PAC  Winning  Our  Future  that  backed  former  House  Speaker  Newt  Gingrich  in  2012  because  of  his  pro-Israel  stance,  a  majority  priority  for  Adelson.Besides  Adelson,  some  of  the  more  influential  Republican  fundraisers  include  businessman  Lewis  Eisenberg,  former  ambassador  Sam  Fox,  former  Republican  National  Committee  Chairman  Ken  Mehlman,  and  former  ambassador  Mel  Sembler.Santorum  'very  open'  to  another  presidential  runAll  over  the  placeUnlike  four  years  ago  where  most  of  these  donors  ended  up  supporting  Mitt  Romney,  this  go-around  is  expected  to  be  much  different."You  still  have  the  donor  groups  all  over  the  place,"  said  one  of  the  fundraisers  while  also  emphasizing  just  how  early  in  this  process  things  stand.The  amount  of  activity  by  the  field  of  possible  2016  contenders  reaching  out  to  prospective  financial  backers  is  at  about  the  same  pace  it  was  four  years  ago,  several  of  those  interviewed  said.  What  is  different,  they  said,  is  that  the  field  at  this  stage  appears  to  be  shaping  up  to  be  much  stronger  than  last  time  around  --  meaning  the  battle  for  support  among  these  key  supporters  will  likely  be  intense."I  think  the  difference  is  in  the  quality  of  the  candidates,"  the  fundraiser  said.CNN  has  learned  Texas  Gov.  Rick  Perry  and  Louisiana  Gov.  Bobby  Jindal,  who  have  been  traveling  the  country  as  part  of  their  official  duties,  met  recently  with  some  prominent  Republican  donors,  but  did  not  indicate  their  future  plans.One  of  the  most  active  Republicans  considering  a  White  House  bid  has  been  Sen.  Rand  Paul  of  Kentucky,  who  has  met  with  donors  and  who  has  been  working  to  broaden  his  appeal  beyond  his  father's  libertarian  base.Desire  to  break  glass  ceiling  big  part  of  aura  around  Clinton</TEXT></DOC>

It  felt  like  a  Joe  Weider  bodybuilding  magazine  turned  into  an  ultraviolent  videogame.  But  the  film's  visual  artistry  was  undeniable.In  "300:  Rise  of  an  Empire,"director  Noam  Murro  uses  3-D  to  up  the  wow  factor  even  further.  There's  so  much  crimson  gore  flying  off  the  screen  you  feel  as  if  you  should  be  wearing  a  tarp  like  the  folks  in  the  front  row  of  a  Gallagher  show.  Xerxes,  the  pierced  and  waxy-smooth  Persian  king  played  by  Rodrigo  Santoro,  is  out  to  avenge  the  death  of  his  father  at  the  hands  of  strapping  Athenian  he-man  Themistokles  (Sullivan  Stapleton).Egged  on  by  his  sultry  adviser  Artemisia  (Eva  Green),  Xerxes  and  his  men  square  off  against  the  outnumbered  Greek  forces  —  this  time  on  the  high  seas.  The  Aegean  setting  is  a  nice  excuse  to  stage  clever  naval  gambits  that  turn  into  slo-mo  orgies  of  impaling  and  limb-hacking.  But  really,  the  film  belongs  to  Green  —  maybe  the  only  actress  ever  to  "graduate"  from  being  a  Bertolucci  muse  to  a  bloodthirsty  action-flick  dominatrix.With  her  raven  hair,  smoky  voice,  and  leather  fetish  wear,  she  gooses  the  repetitive  carnage  into  something  deliciously  sinister.  In  the  movie's  best  scene,  she  and  her  enemy  Themistokles  turn  a  discussion  of  surrender  into  a  rough-sex  brawl.  Henry  Kissinger  she's  not.

The  result:  a  "spacecraft  to  wear."The  45  kilogram  suit  incorporates  air  and  power  supplies,  communication  devices,  sensors  to  take  biometric  readings,  and  ventilation  --  plus  all  the  facilities  required  to  allow  the  astronaut  to  eat,  drink  and  (even)  scratch  their  nose  while  away  from  base.Read:  The  ISS  space  suit  gets  upgradedNo  contactIt's  a  robotic  creation  with  all  the  life-supports  systems  of  a  conventional  spacesuit  but  with  added  capabilities  needed  to  operate  all  alone  on  a  distant  planet  --  where  fast  communication  with  earth  is  impossible.There,  the  suit  will  have  to  double  as  companion,  adviser  and  mission  control  to  the  astronaut.  It's  50%  software,  says  Groomer:  a  built-in  virtual  assistant  will  be  on  hand  to  say  "be  careful  you're  running  out  of  oxygen"  or  "your  next  target  is  2  kilometers  away."Staying  toughWearing  the  Apollo-era  suits  sported  by  moonlanders,  the  Mars  explorers  would  be  "very  dead,  very  soon",  Groomer  warns  --  the  suits  being  not  nearly  robust  enough  for  the  longer  term  missions  they'll  be  expected  to  undertake  across  Mars'  "totally  unforgiving"  landscape.The  suits  are  designed  to  be  repaired  mid-mission  but  Groomer  says  he's  also  been  looking  to  medieval  armories  for  inspiration  for  the  tough  mars  suits  --  taking  cues  for  the  design  of  its  upper  torso  from  an  armor  suit  he  found  recently.Watch:  See  how  NASA  spacesuits  are  testedThe  smart  suitGroomeer's  main  concern,  though,  is  not  toughness.He  and  his  team  are  caught  up  in  a  mini-Space  Race:  developing  suits  in  competition  with  NASA  and  North  Dakota  University's  NDX-2,  MIT's  BioSuit,  and  others.Where  the  other  teams'  suits  are  strongly  focused  on  withstanding  the  physical  strains  of  walking  on  Mars,  Groomer  claims  his  team's  effort  is  the  most  intelligent:"The  big  difference  in  our  suit  is  that  we  consider  it  as  a  central  hub  for  an  entire  family  of  instruments,"  meaning  the  wearer  can  keep  control  of  a  robotic  explorer  vehicle  and  all  the  devices  and  sensors  to  be  housed  at  the  Martian  base  station.It  might  sound  impressive,  but  the  word  Groomer  keeps  mentioning  is  "safety."  The  complex  computer  systems  are  as  much  as  he  can  do  to  keep  the  astronauts  of  the  future  safe,  380  million  kilometers  from  home.Watch  the  video  above  for  more  on  the  Aouda.X  spacesuit.</TEXT></DOC>

His  lawyer  says  so  and  some  experts  note  the  challenge  that  law  enforcement  officers  face  in  making  split-second  decisions  in  the  face  of  imminent  danger.  But  the  late  teen's  family  and  a  legal  expert  disagree,  saying  there  was  no  reason  he  had  to  die.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  A  man  calls  911  saying  his  family  needs  help.  His  wife  is  scared  of  their  schizophrenic  son,  armed  with  a  screwdriver.  One,  then  two,  then  three  law  enforcement  officers  --  all  from  different  agencies  --  arrive.  After  the  situation  calms  somewhat,  according  to  the  family,  a  tussle  ensues.What  happens  next?In  a  case  this  week  out  of  Boiling  Spring  Lakes,  North  Carolina,  one  officer  responded  by  firing  his  gun,  killing  18-year-old  Keith  Vidal,  who  was  mentally  ill.The  teen's  furious  family  soon  take  their  case  public,  saying  there's  no  justification  for  Sunday's  shooting.  Vidal,  they  say,  weighed  all  of  100  pounds;  he  was  mentally  ill,  yes,  but  he  was  a  "good  kid."CNN  first  learned  of  the  shooting  through  an  iReport  sent  by  a  family  friend.Veteran  defense  attorney  Mark  O'Mara,  a  CNN  legal  analyst,  agrees  with  the  family.  From  what  he  knows  of  the  case  --  including  the  police  detective  first  saying  he  was  'defending  himself,"  only  to  later  say  through  his  lawyer  he  was  defending  another  officer  --  O'Mara  thinks  "deadly  force  was  (not)  the  only  option"  when  you  have  three  officers  responding  to  subdue  a  slim,  mentally  ill  teenager."Every  other  opportunity  to  resist  using  that  deadly  force  should  be  deployed  (first),"  said  O'Mara.  "Why  not  just  back  away  from  the  situation  and  see  what  happens?"Yet  some  criminal  experts  say  it  may  not  be  that  simple.  Law  enforcement  officers  thrust  into  situations  like  this  do  have  protocols  to  follow.  They  often  do  have  nonlethal  tools  like  Tasers  at  their  disposal.  But  things  don't  always  go  to  plan;  in  fact,  things  oftentimes  go  wrong,  forcing  an  officer  to  make  extremely  difficult,  split-second  decisions  whether  to  use  lethal  force  or  not."They  have  to  make  a  judgment  very  quickly:  Is  (the  individual)  a  danger  to  themselves  or  a  danger  to  others?"  said  Ron  Martinelli,  a  justice  and  forensic  consultant  who  trains  police  officers  on  what  to  do  in  such  situations.The  lawyer  for  Bryon  Vassey  --  the  Southport,  North  Carolina,  police  detective  who  fired  the  fatal  shot  in  this  instance  --  said  firmly  that  his  client  made  the  correct,  spur-of-the-moment  decision."At  the  instant  that  it  occurred,  he  had  to  make  that  (judgment  call)  in  that  split  instant,"  W.  James  Payne  told  CNN.'Objective  reasonable'  to  use  force?Investigators  and,  possibly,  a  civil  or  criminal  jury  will  decide  whether  Detective  Vassey  did  the  right  thing.Already,  two  law  enforcement  departments  have  weighed  in,  determining  that  their  officers  didn't  break  the  law  or  policy.  The  Southport  police  department  put  Vassey  on  paid  administrative  leave,  a  step  that  John  Midgette,  the  head  of  the  North  Carolina  Police  Benevolent  Association,  says  is  standard  in  such  cases.That  department's  police  chief,  Jerry  Dove,  says  Vassey  has  a  spotless  record  but,  still,  he's  "waiting  for  when  I  hear  all  the  inquiries."  Those  are  being  conducted  by  the  state  Bureau  of  Investigation  and  chief  prosecutor  for  the  state's  13th  Judicial  District,  with  the  latter  possibly  pressing  charges.Experts  say  the  final  judgments  likely  will  hinge  on  whether  Vassey  acted  in  an  "objectively  reasonable"  matter.  That  term  comes  from  a  1989  Supreme  Court  ruling,  Graham  v.  Connor,  and  means  that  an  officer  --  and  ultimately,  higher  authorities  --  must  decide  on  the  spot  whether  there  is  a  valid  presumption  of  an  imminent,  serious  risk  that  would  warrant  the  use  of  force."It's  objectively  reasonable  as  seen  by  the  officer,"  said  Martinelli,  a  former  officer  who  adds  there's  no  federal  legal  requirement  that  officers  use  "the  least  intrusive  level  of  force"  nor  do  they  "have  to  put  themselves  at  risk."  "And  it  often  all  depends  on  a  rapidly  evolving  situation."Opinion:  How  to  stop  tragic  shootings  of  mentally  illDavid  Klinger,  a  ex-patrol  officer  who  now  teaches  at  the  University  of  Missouri-St.  Louis,  explains  "notions  of  reasonableness  are  predicated  on  the  circumstances."  Even  then,  different  law  enforcement  officers  working  alongside  each  other  may  well  reach  opposite  conclusions  on  whether  someone  poses  a  real  threat  and  should  be  fired  upon,  noted  Klinger,  an  expert  in  officer-involved  shootings.In  the  Boiling  Spring  Lakes  case,  there  were  three  different  officers  at  the  scene.  The  first  two  didn't  open  fire,  but  Vassey  did.Vidal  was  making  a  "stabbing  motion  to  an  exposed  part"  of  another  officer  --  wearing  a  bulletproof  vest  --  struggling  with  him,  said  the  detective's  lawyer.  But  this  downed  officer  didn't  yell  out,  asking  for  help  or  someone  to  shoot,  according  to  Payne.O'Mara  said  it  doesn't  make  sense  to  him  that  shots  needed  to  be  fired  after  Vidal  had  been  tased  and  given  he  was  outnumbered  by  the  three  officers  in  the  room,  including  two  that  Vidal's  family  claimed  had  him  pinned  down.Ultimately,  it  won't  matter  what  outside  experts,  Detective  Vassey  or  even  the  late  teen's  family  think  is  "objectively  reasonable"  in  this  case.Speaking  generally  about  cases  like  these,  University  of  North  Carolina-Charlotte  criminology  professor  Vivian  Lord  said,  "It's  up  to  the  courts  to  make  a  decision  on  whether  or  not  they  agree  with  that."Three  officers,  all  from  different  agenciesIt  may  be  notable,  too,  that  the  three  officers  who  responded  all  came  from  different  agencies.Especially  in  small  towns,  having  one  officer  from  another  agency  like  a  sheriff's  department  come  to  a  scene  isn't  unusual,  said  Lord.  Typically,  she  adds,  the  first  responding  officer  and  one  from  the  home  agency  --  in  this  case,  from  Boiling  Spring  Lakes  police  --  acts  as  the  lead  officer.But  Vidal's  stepfather  Mark  Wilsey  --  who,  along  with  the  late  teen's  mother,  witnessed  the  incident  --  said  the  Southport  detective  was  assertive  when  he  came  in,  disrupting  the  situation."(He)  walks  in  the  room,  walks  around  the  corner,  (and)  says,  'We  don't  have  time  for  this.  Tase  that  kid  now.  Let's  get  him  out  of  here,'"  Wilsey  said,  according  to  CNN  affiliate  WWAY.Authorities  have  not  confirmed  that  such  a  statement  was  made,  or  that  this  detective  by  himself  made  the  situation  worse.Still,  Martinelli  said  generally  --  even  if  every  officer  did  everything  right  --  issues  can  arise  when  there  are  officers  not  used  to  working  together  due  to  differences  in  style,  training  or  perspective."When  you  have  multiple  jurisdictions  involved,  it's  very  difficult  to  communicate,"  he  said.  "It's  not  unusual  for  one  officer  to  act  one  way,  and  another  officer  to  act  another  way."The  significance  of  late  teen's  schizophreniaAnd  when  officers  respond  to  deal  with  a  mentally  ill  person,  any  disruption  can  have  a  snowball  effect,  experts  say.The  911  caller  made  clear  Vidal  had  schizophrenia,  adding  he  "won't  take  his  medication,"  was  carrying  a  screwdriver  and  wanted  "to  fight  his  mother."  Vidal's  stepbrother,  Mark  Ryan  Wilsey,  told  CNN  that  local  police  were  familiar  with  him,  having  come  to  the  house  at  least  three  times  before."He's  not  doing  very  good,"  said  the  man  on  the  911  call.  "We've  got  to  get  him  someplace."According  to  O'Mara,  the  fact  this  was  a  call  for  help  --  to  subdue  someone  and  get  him  to  a  professional  --  is  significant."They  have  to  respond  with  that  in  mind,"  said  the  Florida-based  lawyer.  "...  They  have  to  look  at  the  situation  as  not  being  a  criminal  (matter),  but  as  being  (to  help)  someone  who  is  ill."It  is  also  important  to  note  someone  who  suffers  from  a  mental  illness  like  schizophrenia  may  not  act  rationally;  he  or  she  may  seem  to  communicate  coherently  and  appear  composed  one  moment,  only  to  spiral  out  of  control  the  next."It  doesn't  take  a  whole  lot,"  said  Lord,  a  licensed  psychologist,  who  made  a  point  to  add  schizophrenics  aren't  necessarily  violent.  "If  somebody  is  calming  down,  ...  anything  changing  could  make  that  happen."Within  70  seconds  --  according  to  police  records  cited  by  CNN  affiliate  WECT  --  of  when  the  Southport  detective  arrived,  things  went  downhill  quickly,  ending  in  Vidal's  death.The  detective  didn't  necessarily  have  to  do  or  say  anything  to  set  off  this  spiral.  Martinelli  --  who  said  he  specializes  in  handling  what  authorities  call  emotionally  disturbed  people,  or  EDPs  --  said  anyone  coming  into  a  room  and  distracting  a  mentally  ill  person  "could  be  like  throwing  gas  on  a  flame."Adds  Lord,  "If  (a  mentally  ill  individual)  is  unstable,  it's  hard  to  say  what  might  have  made  this  blow  back  up."Justified  or  not?Vidal's  stepbrother  said  the  first  two  officers  to  arrive  "did  nothing  wrong.""All  they  did  was  tase  my  brother  and  try  to  get  him  into  handcuffs  so  he  couldn't  harm  himself,"  said  Mark  Ryan  Wilsey,  who  wasn't  at  the  scene  but  relayed  his  family's  account.  "They  had  the  situation  under  control."'My  brother  just  needed  help,  and  now  he  is  dead'The  family  lays  the  blame  squarely  on  the  Southport  detective."This  officer  who  shot  my  son  needs  to  be  behind  bars,"  said  Vidal's  mother,  Mary  Wilsey.  "He  needs  to  die  the  way  my  son  died."The  detective  spoke  moments  after  the  shooting,  saying  on  a  radio  call,  "I  don't  know  if  you've  been  advised  or  not,  but  shots  fired.  I've  had  to  defend  myself  against  the  subject."His  story  later  changed,  with  his  lawyer  and  the  North  Carolina  Police  Benevolent  Association  saying  the  shots  were  fired  to  defend  another  officer.  O'Mara  said  he  believes  the  altered  story  might  come  back  to  hurt  Vassey.The  benevolent  association  is  siding  squarely  with  the  detective,  concluding  after  talking  with  two  of  the  officers  involved  that  the  teen  posed  a  "deadly  threat.""We  are  very  confident  that  the  officers  did  what  they  should  have  under  state  law,"  Midgette,  the  trade  group's  director,  told  CNN.  "It's  a  very  tragic  situation,  but  we  do  believe  the  officer."CNN's  David  Mattingly  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

What  do  you  do  in  this  desperate  situation?According  to  Gerard  Depardieu  --  France's  biggest  actor,  both  figuratively  and  literally  --  the  only  logical  and  mature  thing  to  do  is  pee  into  a  trusty  plastic  bottle.In  August  2011,  the  Frenchman  was  stuck  on  a  delayed  flight  from  Paris  to  Dublin  when  nature  called  ...  or  rather  began  screaming  with  terrifying  insistence.Unsympathetic  flight  attendants  wouldn't  allow  the  actor  to  use  the  bathrooms,  which  were  locked  until  takeoff.Fellow  actor  Edouard  Baer  offered  Depardieu  an  empty  bottle  to  pee  into.The  bladder-challenged  62-year-old  went  ahead  and  did  what  he  had  to  do.Depardieu  probably  would  have  gotten  away  with  it  if  his  aim  was  better.

The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  the  author.(CNN)  --  Rahm  Emanuel  is  building  a  Second  City.  Two  cities  really,  as  the  "two  summers"  theme  shown  in  Episode  4  of  "Chicagoland"  suggests.  One  white,  one  black.  One  for  the  rich,  one  for  the  poor.  One  for  private  schools,  one  for  closed  schools.  A  new  Chicago  for  the  saved  and  the  damned.  Gold  coast  heavens  and  low-end  hells.  It's  biblical,  binary.The  mayor's  new  Chicago  is  a  second  city  for  the  first  citizens  who  colonized  the  land  and  took  it  from  the  Pottawatomie.  The  mayor's  vision  is  not  for  most  Chicagoans  who  live  here  now.It  is  not  for  Jason  Barrett.  In  last  week's  "Chicagoland"  episode,  Principal  Elizabeth  Dozier  of  Fenger  High  School  secures  the  early  release  of  Barrett,  who  she  is  mentoring.  But  he  is  re-arrested  and  becomes  one  of  the  thousands  of  black  and  brown  bodies  disproportionately  locked  up  and  routed  into  America's  growing,  often  privatized,  prison  system.The  mayor's  new  Chicago  is  not  for  black  and  brown  and  white  workers  who  toil  in  multiple  service  sector  jobs  that  the  mayor's  neo-liberal  economic  advisers  hail  as  job  creation.  In  fact  Emanuel  and  his  advisers  have  been  the  proponents  of  a  global  economic  policy  that  packs  up  the  kind  of  blue  collar  jobs  that  built  Chicago  and  sends  them  south  with  ease:  Emanuel  championed  NAFTA  at  the  Clinton  White  House.The  Chicago  that  the  mayor  and  his  team  of  wealthy  financiers  are  continuing  to  create  and  sell  is  a  second  city  of  tourists  and  grand  inequities.  The  disparity  gap  grows  between  those  who  have  and  those  who  have  to  rent.  Those  who  can  afford  private  schools  like  the  mayor's  children  and  those  whose  public  neighborhood  schools  are  underfunded  and  tracked  and  given  impossible  and  idiotic  standardized  tests  to  validate  their  existence.The  new  Chicago  is  for  new  businesses  that  will  be  lured  with  tax-free  incentives,  gaining  advantages  they  won't  have  to  pay  back  in  order  to  be  responsible  citizens.  The  new  Chicago  is  based  on  old  European  models  of  urban  planning,  concentric  zones  of  wealth  where  working  and  poor  people  are  pushed  to  the  margins  of  the  land  and  public  discourse.The  mayor  is  like  a  suburban  kid  back  in  the  city  with  his  parents'  money  who  wants  to  go  to  Lollapalooza.  When  the  list  of  50  school  closings  in  mostly  black  and  brown  neighborhoods  was  leaked,  he  was  skiing  on  spring  break  in  Utah.  This  month  when  a  group  of  poets  from  the  Chicago  public  high  school  Team  Englewood  hoped  to  speak  to  the  mayor  directly  at  Louder  Than  A  Bomb:  The  Chicago  Youth  Poetry  Festival,  he  chose  instead,  the  same  night,  to  be  on  a  giant  swing  at  a  $450-a-ticket  gala,  eating  a  $1,000  priced  meal,  served  by  a  celebrity  chef.The  slick  series  "Chicagoland"  glosses  over  issues  such  as  economic  injustice,  white  supremacy,  the  declining  middle  class  and  the  school  to  prison  pipeline.  Chicago  on  TV  appears  in  a  vacuum,  rather  than  in  the  torrent  of  history.Police  Chief  Garry  McCarthy's  stop-and-frisk  policy  is  a  continuation  of  America's  long  history  of  criminalizing  and  dehumanizing  black  and  brown  bodies.  Police  force  and  presence  in  neighborhoods  is  sometimes  the  cause  of  violence  and  destruction  rather  than  its  cessation.  Chicago  is,  after  all,  the  home  of  Jon  Burge,  a  Chicago  police  commander  who  was  fired  for  torture  and  later  convicted  of  lying  about  the  practice.  It  was  also  the  home  of  Rekia  Boyd,  an  unarmed  young  black  woman  shot  and  killed  by  a  Chicago  police  detective.The  mayor  maintains  systemic  inequity  and  champions  individual  exceptionalism.  In  Episode  4,  the  gracious  white  mayor  provides  an  internship  for  one  young  black  man  while  his  city  locks  up  thousands.  Recidivism  and  the  school  to  prison  pipeline  is  the  "real  graduation"  to  paraphrase  the  most  honest  articulation  of  Episode  4  from  an  interview  with  an  unnamed  prisoner.The  dismantling  of  public  education  in  Chicago  is  a  pathway  toward  a  privatized  school  system  living  at  the  center  of  the  Department  of  Education  in  Washington.  The  mayor  and  his  cronies  are  the  architects  of  these  blueprints  concerned  with  standardized  tests  but  not  standards  for  every  student's  academic  success  and  environment.  Until  they  hold  the  system  to  the  standards  they  demand  for  their  own  children,  for  all  children,  schools  will  continue  to  fail  students  they  seek  to  teach.The  mayor  is  not  a  mentor  or  educator.  He  is  a  millionaire  businessman.  In  Episode  4,  he  walks  around  after-school  programs  patting  black  kids  on  the  head  like  some  king.  He  considers  himself  a  white  savior,  but  he  is  something  antithetical.In  Episode  4,  he  says  he  gives  kids  a  second  chance.  But  it  is  certain  the  schools  and  the  city  will  fail  students  of  color  and  send  them  to  the  largest  jail  in  the  country.Chance,  the  incredibly  gifted  hyper-literate  emergent  hip-hop  superstar  at  the  center  of  Episode  4  and  at  the  center  of  a  youth  cultural  renaissance  in  Chicago,  succeeds  despite  the  school  system  he  was  suspended  from  and  because  of  a  strong  two  parent  household,  an  informal  network  of  aunties  in  the  working  class  community  of  Chatham,  and  a  cadre  of  arts  programs.

Kiev  fears  it  may  be  an  invasion  force  ready  to  push  into  Russian-speaking  communities  in  eastern  Ukraine.

Kiev  fears  it  may  be  an  invasion  force  ready  to  push  into  Russian-speaking  communities  in  eastern  Ukraine.  Others  are  concerned  that  Moscow's  expansion  plans  may  not  stop  at  Crimea  and  that  other  former  Soviet  states  may  follow.NATO's  top  commander  has  voiced  worries  Moscow's  forces  could  roll  into  Moldova's  separatist  region  Transnistria  on  the  opposite  side  of  Ukraine.  Since  Moscow  annexed  Crimea  last  week,  many  of  the  half-million  people  in  that  small,  impoverished  region  have  renewed  calls  to  join  the  Russian  Federation,  too.Will  other  regions  in  Ukraine  or  Moldova  be  the  next  West-East  Europe  flashpoint?Where  is  Transnistria?Transnistria  is  a  breakaway  region  of  the  former  Soviet  state  of  Moldova.  The  Russian  speakers  of  Transnistria  seceded  from  Moldova  in  1990,  a  year  before  the  Soviet  Union's  dissolution,  amid  fears  that  Moldova  would  shortly  merge  with  neighboring  Romania,  whose  language  and  culture  it  broadly  shares.Photos:  Two  days  in  TransnistriaThe  separatist  region  fought  a  brief  war  with  Moldova  in  1992,  and  it  declared  itself  an  independent  state,  but  it  remains  unrecognized  by  any  country.Attempts  to  resolve  the  dispute  have  made  little  progress,  with  Russian  troops  standing  guard,  acting  as  peacekeepers.Transnistria  is  already  beyond  the  control  of  the  Moldovan  government.  Just  as  a  statue  of  Lenin  overlooks  the  main  square  in  the  Crimean  capital,  Simferopol,  so  another  stands  outside  Transnistria's  regional  assembly  in  Tiraspol.  A  2006  referendum  produced  a  97.2%  vote  in  favor  of  joining  Russia,  a  slightly  higher  score  than  in  Crimea's  recent  referendum.Unlike  Crimea,  however,  landlocked  Transnistria  is  far  from  Russia,  wedged  between  Moldova  and  Ukraine.  It's  a  sliver  of  territory  along  the  Dniester  River,  with  about  30%  of  its  population  ethnic  Russian.Why  are  people  worried?Until  now,  Russia  has  officially  recognized  Transnistria  as  being  part  of  Moldova.  But  events  in  Ukraine  may  have  shifted  Moscow's  calculation,  some  say.During  a  trip  last  week  to  Moscow,  Mikhail  Burla,  speaker  of  Transnistria's  separatist  parliament,  urged  Russia  to  incorporate  the  region,  according  to  reports  from  the  Russian  capital.On  Sunday,  NATO's  top  military  commander,  Gen.  Philip  Breedlove,  said  the  Russian  force  at  the  Ukrainian  border  now  to  the  east  was  "very,  very  sizable  and  very,  very  ready.""There  is  absolutely  sufficient  force  postured  on  the  eastern  border  of  Ukraine  to  run  to  Transnistria  if  the  decision  was  made  to  do  that,  and  that  is  very  worrisome,"  said  Breedlove,  a  U.S.  Air  Force  general.What  about  Moldova?One  of  Europe's  poorest  countries,  Moldova  has  been  governed  by  pro-Western  leaders  since  2009.  It  has  clinched  an  association  agreement  with  the  European  Union,  as  currently  sought  by  the  pro-Western  leaders  who  came  to  power  in  Ukraine  after  the  removal  of  Moscow-backed  President  Viktor  Yanukovych.The  small  country  of  3.5  million  people  is,  like  Ukraine,  indebted  to  Moscow  for  natural  gas  imports  that  help  keep  its  economy  afloat.  As  with  Ukraine,  Russia  opposes  Moldova's  efforts  to  build  links  with  the  EU.Moldovan  President  Nicolae  Timofti  has  warned  Russia  not  to  consider  any  move  to  take  over  Transnistria  in  the  same  way  it  wrestled  Crimea  away  from  Kiev.Timofti  has  echoed  criticism  from  Ukraine's  pro-Western  leaders,  the  United  States  and  EU  countries  when  speaking  of  Russia's  actions  in  the  Black  Sea  peninsula.And  Ukrainian  fears?For  Kiev's  new  leaders,  the  most  immediate  concern  is  not  Transnistria  but  a  growing  separatist  sentiment  in  its  cities  closest  to  its  eastern  border  with  Russia."We  are  very  much  concerned  about  this  development  and  deployment  of  Russian  troops  on  our  eastern  borders,"  acting  Foreign  Minister  Andrii  Deshchytsia  said  on  ABC's  "This  Week."  "We  are  ready  to  respond."A  senior  U.S.  defense  official  told  CNN  on  Monday  that  Russia  "has  enough  troops  that  we  believe  they  could  move  against  Ukraine  at  any  time  now."The  official  emphasized  the  United  States  still  does  not  know  Russia's  intentions  on  the  border.  U.S.  intelligence  indicates  the  Russian  forces  are  positioned  possibly  to  go  after  three  Ukrainian  cities:  Kharkiv,  Luhansk  and  Donetsk.  Russian  forces  have  moved  so  close  to  the  border,  there  would  be  no  warning  time,  and  the  United  States  would  likely  only  see  an  incursion  as  it  was  happening.In  the  past  few  weeks,  there  have  been  pro-Russian  rallies  in  cities  such  as  Donetsk,  Yanukovych's  home  city.  The  latest  over  the  weekend,  however,  were  small,  with  organizers  saying  only  a  few  thousand  people  rallied."What  is  happening  in  Kiev  is  not  for  me.  Russia,  Crimea,  Belarus  are  mine,  they  are  our  brothers,  we  are  with  them,  and  I  want  to  appeal  --  'Putin  help  us,'  "  Donetsk  resident  Vasily  Anenko  said  --  cries  that  have  become  increasingly  heard  in  the  area.Kiev  has  ordered  the  withdrawal  of  armed  forces  from  Crimea,  citing  Russian  threats  to  the  lives  of  military  staff  and  their  families,  effectively  yielding  the  region  to  Moscow's  forces,  which  stormed  one  of  Kiev's  last  bases  there  Monday.What  has  Russia  said?Moscow  has  continuously  stated  Russia  has  no  intention  to  move  further  into  Ukraine.  The  Kremlin  says  it  is  simply  conducting  military  exercises.Russian  Deputy  Defense  Minister  Anatoly  Antonov  was  quoted  by  the  state's  Itar-Tass  news  agency  Sunday  as  saying  Russia  was  complying  with  international  agreements  limiting  the  number  of  troops  near  its  border  with  Ukraine.Moscow's  ambassador  to  the  EU,  Vladimir  Chizhov,  said  nobody  has  anything  to  fear  from  Russia  and  that  the  country  does  not  have  any  "expansionist  views."Asked  to  give  a  commitment  that  Russian  troops  would  not  move  into  Ukrainian  territory  outside  Crimea,  Chizhov  told  Britain's  BBC:  "There  is  no  intention  of  the  Russian  Federation  to  do  anything  like  that."And  the  West?In  what  has  become  the  biggest  East-West  confrontation  since  the  Cold  War,  the  United  States  and  EU  have  imposed  visa  bans  and  asset  freezes  on  some  of  Russian  President  Vladimir  Putin's  closest  political  and  business  allies.  But  they  have  held  back  so  far  from  measures  designed  to  hit  Russia's  wider  economyU.S.  Vice  President  Joe  Biden  was  dispatched  to  meet  Polish  and  Baltic  leaders  last  week  in  an  effort  to  reassure  NATO  allies  alarmed  at  the  Kremlin's  intervention  in  Ukraine.U.S.  Secretary  of  State  John  Kerry  traveled  to  Moldova  in  December  --  part  of  a  show  of  support  for  its  pro-Western  moves  in  the  face  of  Russian  pressure  --  when  it  signed  the  key  economic  and  political  agreement  with  the  EU.  Russia  had  responded  to  Moldova's  moves  toward  the  EU  by  cutting  off  imports  of  Moldovan  wine.On  Monday,  U.S.  President  Barack  Obama  began  crisis  talks  at  a  meeting  with  other  leaders  of  the  Group  of  Seven,  a  group  of  industrialized  nations  that  excludes  Russia,  which  joined  in  1998  to  form  the  G8.  The  group  is  to  consider  a  collective  response  to  the  crisis  during  talks  in  The  Hague,  the  Netherlands."Europe  and  America  are  united  in  our  support  of  the  Ukrainian  government  and  the  Ukrainian  people,"  Obama  said.  "We're  united  in  imposing  a  cost  on  Russia  for  its  actions  so  far.  "Persuading  Putin  to  relinquish  Crimea  is  a  goal  that  now  seems  beyond  reach,  and  Western  officials  are  likely  to  seek  ways  to  deter  the  Russian  leader  from  seizing  others  parts  of  Ukraine.However,  persuading  Europeans  to  sign  on  to  tougher  sanctions  could  be  a  challenge  for  Obama.  The  EU  does  10  times  as  much  trade  with  Russia  as  the  United  States,  and  is  the  biggest  customer  for  Russian  oil  and  gas.  The  bloc's  28  members  also  include  countries  with  widely  varying  relationships  with  Moscow.</TEXT></DOC>

Dianne  Feinstein  for  complaining  about  the  CIA  removing  classified  documents  from  her  staff's  computers  after  giving  the  intelligence  community  a  pass  on  spying  on  private  citizens,  he  joined  a  chorus  of  civil  liberties  advocates  who  say  she's  being  hypocritical."What  is  incredible  about  these  accusations  is  they  are  not  coming  from  Senator  Ron  'Privacy  is  important'  Wyden  or  Senator  Rand  'Don't  kill  me  with  a  flying  robot'  Paul,"  Stewart  said.  "They  are  coming  from  Dianne  'So  the  NSA  is  looking  at  your  data'  Feinstein."He  then  played  a  montage  of  clips  showing  the  many  instances  in  which  Feinstein,  chairman  of  the  Senate  Intelligence  Committee,  has  supported  National  Security  Agency  snooping  on  private  citizens.Those  who  have  long  complained  that  neither  Congress  nor  the  intelligence  community  have  done  enough  to  safeguard  the  rights  of  private  citizens  find  it  ironic  that,  for  months,  the  spy  agency  and  the  Intelligence  Committee  charged  with  its  oversight  have  waged  a  behind-the-scenes  battle  accusing  each  other  of  improper  snooping.The  Justice  Department  is  weighing  whether  to  investigate  CIA  claims  that  Intelligence  Committee  staffers  accessed  material  they  shouldn't  have  seen  while  reviewing  millions  of  documents  at  a  Virginia  facility.Those  same  advocates  find  the  complaints  of  Feinstein,  who  has  been  one  of  the  intelligence  community's  staunchest  supporters,  as  especially  disingenuous.Feinstein  says  CIA  spied  on  Senate  computers"As  a  privacy  advocate,  she  has  gotten  angry  about  spying  on  (German  Chancellor)  Angela  Merkel  and  spying  on  herself.  But  being  OK  with  spying  on  the  rest  of  us  is  questionable,"  said  Mike  German,  a  former  FBI  agent  and  a  fellow  with  the  Brenna  Center  for  Justice.Feinstein  did  not  respond  to  a  request  for  comment.During  a  fiery  speech  Tuesday  that  stunned  lawmakers  and  members  of  the  intelligence  community,  Feinstein,  a  California  Democrat,  accused  the  CIA  of  secretly  taking  classified  documents  from  her  staff's  computers  during  an  oversight  investigation.Her  comments  made  public  a  private  long  running  saga  over  the  review  of  documents  related  to  the  post  9/11  Bush  administration  program  for  questioning  terror  suspects  --  a  practice  that  ultimately  was  ended  by  President  Barack  Obama  in  2009.CIA  Director  John  Brennan  challenged  Feinstein's  claims.What  are  the  CIA  and  Senate  fighting  about?Privacy  advocates  and  civil  liberty  groups  hailed  Feinstein's  diatribe  against  the  CIA's  tactics  as  a  watershed  moment  in  urging  stronger  checks  on  the  executive  branch's  spying  practices."It's  highly  significant  that  a  senator  with  Senator  Feinstein's  credentials  in  working  with  the  intelligence  community  would  go  to  the  Senate  floor  and  make  a  constitutionally  protected  speech  about  how  the  CIA  is  undermining  a  critical  oversight  role,"  said  Greg  Nojeim,  a  senior  counsel  with  the  nonprofit  Center  for  Democracy  and  Technology.A  number  of  her  congressional  colleagues  applauded  her  speech  as  well."Senator  Feinstein  is  a  dedicated  public  servant  who  deserves  enormous  credit  for  speaking  publicly  about  this  dispute,  which  goes  to  the  heart  of  the  separation  of  powers,"  Sen.  Patrick  Leahy,  a  Vermont  Democrat,  told  CNN  in  a  statement."She  has  spoken  to  the  conscience  of  every  senator,  of  both  parties.  She  is  standing  up  for  the  principles  on  which  this  country  was  founded,  and  the  rest  of  us  must  follow  her  example,"  he  said.Leahy  has  been  a  steady  critic  of  the  intelligence  community's  practices  --  especially  the  sweeping  NSA  surveillance  programs  publicized  by  Edward  Snowden's  leaks  --  and  has  stridently  questioned  claims  by  national  security  officials  that  the  government's  bulk  collection  of  phone  records  thwarted  terror  attacks.However,  privacy  and  civil  liberties  advocates  took  issue  with  Feinstein's  pique.  They  also  see  a  double-standard  in  the  outrage  of  other  lawmakers  such  as  Republican  Sen.  Lindsey  Graham  of  South  Carolina,  who  also  called  the  allegations  "dangerous  to  a  democracy."These  types  of  actions  have  always  been  "dangerous  to  a  democracy"  even  when  they  happen  to  ordinary  private  citizens,  civil  liberties  advocates  said."It's  clear  the  CIA  was  trying  to  play  'keep-away'  with  documents  relevant  to  an  investigation  by  their  overseers  in  Congress,  and  that's  a  serious  constitutional  concern,"  Snowden,  a  former  NSA  contractor,  told  NBC  News  in  a  statement  Tuesday."But  it's  equally  if  not  more  concerning  that  we're  seeing  another  'Merkel  Effect,'  where  an  elected  official  does  not  care  at  all  that  the  rights  of  millions  of  ordinary  citizens  are  violated  by  our  spies,  but  suddenly  it's  a  scandal  when  a  politician  finds  out  the  same  thing  happens  to  them,"  he  said.House  intel  chair  warns  of  penalty  if  CIA  searched  Senate  computersPrivacy  and  civil  liberty  advocates  hope  more  oversight  will  occur  now  that  members  of  Congress  have  gotten  a  personal  taste  of  intelligence  gathering  practices  they  find  objectionable."We've  had  12  years  of  an  intelligence  community  acting  with  very  little  checks  on  it,"  said  Chris  Anders,  a  senior  legislative  counsel  with  the  American  Civil  Liberties  Union.  "The  reason  they  are  so  out  of  control  is  that  there's  been  very  little  oversight  being  exercised  by  Congress  or  the  courts."Outrage  by  both  lawmakers  and  private  citizens  will  build  support  for  reforms,  German  said."Hopefully,  now  that  Feinstein  has  this  new  found  skepticism,  she  will  open  the  lid  so  that  the  American  public  can  see  what  has  been  done  in  their  name  in  the  past  ten  years,"  German  said.</TEXT></DOC>

That  mark  narrowly  bested  the  best  human  time  of  5.5  seconds,  set  by  Mats  Valk  of  the  Netherlands  last  year."We  knew  Cubestormer  3  had  the  potential  to  beat  the  existing  record,  but  with  the  robot  performing  physical  operations  quicker  than  the  human  eye  can  see,  there's  always  an  element  of  risk,"  said  David  Gilday,  who  built  the  robots  along  with  co-inventor  Mike  Dobson.Dobson  is  an  engineer  with  ARM,  the  company  that  makes  the  souped-up  processors  in  the  Samsung  Galaxy  S4  used  to  power  Cubestormer  3.The  phone  analyzes  the  cube  and  calculates  the  best  sequence  of  moves  to  solve  it,  then  instructs  the  robot's  four  arms  to  get  to  work.Eight  Lego  Mindstorms  EV3  bricks  perform  motor  control  and  sequencing  on  the  robot."In  the  end,  the  hours  we  spent  perfecting  the  robot  and  ensuring  its  motor  and  intelligence  functions  were  properly  synchronized  paid  off,"  Gilday  said.  "Our  big  challenge  now  is  working  out  if  it's  possible  to  make  it  go  even  faster."The  cube,  originally  called  the  Magic  Cube,  was  invented  in  1974  by  Erno  Rubik,  a  Hungarian  architect.  It  is  believed  to  be  the  best-selling  toy  of  all  time,  with  more  than  350  million  cubes  sold  since  it  was  launched  internationally  in  1980.According  to  its  makers,  any  permutation  can  be  solved  in  20  moves  or  fewer.While  they  were  at  it,  Gilday's  team  members  also  set  a  couple  of  other  Rubik's  Cube  records  over  the  weekend.Another  robot  solved  a  4-by-4  cube  (the  regular  Rubik's  is  3-by-3)  in  just  over  1  minute,  18  seconds,  and  an  intricate  9-by-9  cube  became  the  biggest  ever  to  be  solved  by  a  robot,  with  another  machine  sorting  it  in  just  over  34  minutes.</TEXT></DOC>

He  has  to  be  tried  on  an  assault  charge  in  Washington  first.Only  then  will  the  judge  decide  whether  Brown  must  go  to  jail  for  violating  his  probation  in  the  Rihanna  assault  because  of  the  assault  arrest  a  few  blocks  from  the  White  House  in  October.Brown  seemed  disappointed  by  the  decision,  although  his  three  months  of  therapy  may  have  helped  him  handle  the  stress  in  court.  He  closed  his  eyes  and  appeared  to  meditate  for  about  five  minutes  while  his  lawyer,  Mark  Geragos,  met  privately  with  the  judge  and  prosecutor."Mr.  Brown  is  able  to  use  behavioral  strategies  to  manage  acting  out  on  impulses,"  the  director  of  his  rehab  program  wrote  in  a  letter  to  the  court.  "Mr.  Brown  is  teaming  relaxation  exercises  that  will  reduce  consequent  impulsive  behaviors."He  also  looks  physically  better  during  his  latest  court  appearance,  something  noted  by  his  lawyer.The  rehab  director's  letter  revealed  that  Brown  had  been  suffering  from  a  "severe  case  of  insomnia,"  which  has  been  "stabilized."Brown,  24,  told  his  probation  officer  that  he  "appreciates  what  he  has  learned  in  the  rehabilitation  facility,  as  it  has  allowed  him  to  change  his  life  for  the  better,"  the  officer  wrote  in  his  report.Brown  "looks  forward  to  staying  out  of  trouble,"  the  probation  report  said.He  reports  to  a  highway  cleanup  labor  crew  in  Los  Angeles  three  days  a  week  to  fulfill  the  750  hours  of  service  remaining  in  his  probation  requirements,  the  report  said.  At  that  rate,  Brown  could  complete  the  labor  in  mid-October  and  possibly  be  free  from  probation  requirements  by  the  end  of  the  year.His  legal  troubles  began  five  years  ago  when  he  beat  then-girlfriend  Rihanna  in  a  rented  Lamborghini  on  a  Hollywood  street.  He  pleaded  guilty  to  felony  assault  in  June  2009,  which  resulted  in  a  sentence  of  five  years  of  probation  and  1,400  hours  of  community  labor.The  judge  has  revoked  Brown's  probation  twice  in  the  last  year,  most  recently  because  of  his  arrest  on  a  sidewalk  near  the  White  House  after  allegedly  punching  a  man.Brown  voluntarily  entered  a  rehab  program  a  day  after  being  released  from  a  Washington  jail  in  October,  but  he  was  kicked  out  a  few  days  later  for  "throwing  a  rock  through  his  mother's  car  window"  after  a  family  session  at  the  center,  a  probation  report  said.  Brown  was  upset  because  his  mother  said  she  wanted  him  to  stay  in  treatment,  the  report  said."Mr.  Brown  preceded  to  walk  outside  and  pick  up  a  rock  and  threw  it  through  his  mother's  car  window  and  it  shattered,"  according  to  letter  from  the  rehab  center  included  in  the  probation  report.His  mother  sat  next  to  Brown  at  Friday's  hearing.Los  Angeles  County  Judge  James  Brandlin  will  revisit  Brown's  rehab  versus  jail  status  on  April  23,  a  week  after  the  assault  trial  in  Washington.</TEXT></DOC>

Or  you  thought  it  was  the  right  place  to  express  affection  for  your  favorite  primate  by  choosing  "monkey."More  likely,  you  were  lazy  and  wanted  something  easy  to  remember,  like  "123456."If  you're  using  any  of  these  passwords,  change  them.Those  are  some  of  the  most  common  passwords,  according  to  a  new  list  released  by  security  company  Splash  Data.  The  group  comes  up  with  the  top  25  list  based  on  lists  of  passwords  that  were  stolen  and  posted  publicly  in  the  previous  year.This  year,  the  most  common  password  is  "123456,"  which  unseated  last  year's  No.  1,  "password."In  addition  to  strings  of  digits  in  numerical  order  and  simple  words  and  letters  like  "qwerty"  and  "admin,"  there  are  a  few  phrases  on  the  list.  The  sweet  and  common  "iloveyou"  is  beloved  by  hackers,  as  is  "letmein,"  "trustno1"  and  "password1."A  string  of  high-profile  breaches  in  the  past  year  may  serve  as  a  wake-up  call  to  the  consumers  who  use  these  passwords.  Many  perhaps  assume  they  would  never  be  the  target  of  hackers,  so  there's  no  reason  to  enact  strict,  or  even  common-sense,  security  measures.This  year's  list  was  clearly  skewed  by  the  large  number  of  Adobe  passwords  included  in  the  round-up,  as  indicated  by  the  presence  of  "adobe123"  and  "photoshop"  on  the  list  at  number  10  and  15  respectively.  Adobe  experienced  a  sizable  security  breach  in  2013  that  affected  38  million  users.We  can  deduce  that  choosing  a  password  named  after  the  product  for  which  it's  used  is  a  bad  idea.  Also  avoid  using  your  own  name  or  other  obvious  words  someone  who  knows  you  could  guess  (the  name  of  your  husband,  child,  cat).To  beef  up  your  defenses,  immediately  change  any  of  your  own  passwords  that  show  up  on  the  list.  Combine  random  words  instead  of  using  common  phrases,  and  if  you  include  numbers  or  symbols,  don't  just  substitute  3s  for  your  Es.  If  you're  ready  to  take  your  security  to  the  next  level,  don't  use  the  same  password  for  all  sites.Also,  when  possible,  turn  on  two-factor  identification,  in  which  access  is  granted  based  on  a  password  and  something  else,  such  as  a  specific  image.</TEXT></DOC>

The  company  is  protesting  Mozilla's  new  CEO,  Brendan  Eich,  who  supported  an  anti-same-sex  marriage  campaign.  Firefox  is  owned  by  Mozilla.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Dating  site  OkCupid  is  calling  for  its  members  to  ditch  Firefox  and  use  another  browser  to  search  for  love.  The  company  is  protesting  Mozilla's  new  CEO,  Brendan  Eich,  who  supported  an  anti-same-sex  marriage  campaign.  Firefox  is  owned  by  Mozilla.When  OkCupid  members  navigate  to  the  site  on  a  Firefox  browser,  they  are  met  with  a  message  encouraging  them  to  use  an  alternative  browser  to  access  the  site,  including  Google  Chrome,  Opera,  Safari  and  the  amusingly  misspelled  Internet  Exploder."Those  who  seek  to  deny  love  and  instead  enforce  misery,  shame  and  frustration  are  our  enemies,  and  we  wish  them  nothing  but  failure,"  reads  the  message.The  page  points  out  that  8%  of  the  matches  made  on  OkCupid  are  between  same-sex  couples.Last  week,  Mozilla  promoted  Eich,  a  longtime  employee  who  was  previously  the  company's  chief  technology  officer,  to  the  position  of  CEO.  The  move  prompted  renewed  outrage  by  third-party  developers  and  employees.  Eich  donated  $1,000  to  support  Propostion  8  in  2008.  The  California  ballot  initiative  sought  to  ban  same-sex  marriage  in  the  state.  The  donation  was  made  public  in  2012  but  Eich  held  onto  his  job.After  the  announcement  of  Eich's  promotion,  app  development  company  Rarebit  announced  it  had  pulled  its  apps  from  Firefox.  "As  a  married  gay  couple  who  are  co-founders  of  this  venture,  we  have  chosen  to  boycott  all  Mozilla  projects,"  said  founder  Hampton  Catlin  in  an  open  letter  to  the  company.Various  Mozilla  employees  have  also  spoken  up  about  the  promotion,  taking  to  Twitter  to  openly  share  their  disappointment  with  Eich's  politics.  Some  have  come  together  and  publicly  called  for  Eich  to  step  down.Eich  posted  a  blog  on  his  personal  site  last  week  addressing  the  backlash.  He  outlined  his  plan  to  support  LGBT-friendly  policies  at  Mozilla  and  expressed  "sorrow  at  having  caused  pain.""I  am  committed  to  ensuring  that  Mozilla  is,  and  will  remain,  a  place  that  includes  and  supports  everyone,"  he  said.The  apology  hasn't  satisfied  everyone,  and  the  backlash  continues  to  grow  one  week  later.  OkCupid  is  one  of  the  most  high-profile  companies  to  take  a  stand  against  Eich's  appointment.The  letter  on  the  OkCupid  home  page  is  a  bold  move.  However,  it  is  not  actually  blocking  Firefox  users  from  using  OkCupid.  At  the  bottom  of  the  page  is  a  link  to  continue  on  to  the  site."Mozilla  supports  equality  for  all,  including  marriage  equality  for  LGBT  couples.  No  matter  who  you  are  or  who  you  love,  everyone  deserves  the  same  rights  and  to  be  treated  equally,"  said  a  Mozilla  spokesperson  in  a  statement.  "OK  cupid  never  reached  out  to  us  to  let  us  know  of  their  intentions,  nor  to  confirm  facts."</TEXT></DOC>

Lawyers  sometimes  beat  the  charge  in  court.A  lawyer  can  defend  a  DUI  charge  by  focusing  on  the  technical  aspects  of  the  arrest  and  testing,  questioning  whether  police  did  everything  right,  attorney  Michael  Salnick  told  CNN.  If  problems  or  deficiencies  are  found  in  what  law  enforcement  did,  those  issues  could  be  challenged.Was  there  probable  cause  for  police  to  stop  the  singer's  Lamborghini?  GPS  tracking  data  suggests  the  sports  car  was  not  speeding  in  the  minutes  before  the  arrest.  If  the  judge  lets  a  jury  hear  that,  it  might  create  reasonable  doubt  about  the  police  officer's  claim  he  stopped  Bieber  and  friend  Khalil  Sharieff  after  seeing  them  drag  racing  on  a  residential  street.Was  there  probable  cause  for  the  officer  to  test  Bieber's  sobriety?  The  arresting  officer  said  he  became  suspicious  because  he  smelled  alcohol  on  the  singer's  breath,  but  lab  tests  later  showed  the  alcohol  level  in  his  system  was  well  below  Florida's  legal  limit  for  drivers  under  the  drinking  age  of  21.  Bieber's  lawyer  could  argue  that  the  officer  made  it  up  to  justify  the  arrest.  His  defense  might  be  bolstered  if  the  judge  allows  the  officer's  disciplinary  record  to  be  used  to  challenge  his  credibility.While  the  alcohol  level  was  below  the  legal  limit,  a  preliminary  toxicology  report  on  Bieber's  urine  sample  said  he  tested  positive  for  "metabolite  of  THC,"  which  indicates  marijuana  use,  and  alprazolam,  the  generic  name  for  the  prescription  sedative  Xanax.  "Yeah,  we  were  smoking  all  night  at  the  studio,"  the  singer  told  a  police  officer  who  told  him  he  "reeked  of  marijuana,"  according  to  police  documents.No-risk  trial  in  FloridaDefendants  sometimes  accept  plea  deals  because  they  fear  a  judge  would  impose  a  tougher  sentence  if  they  were  convicted  in  a  trial.  That's  not  a  risk  with  Florida's  DUI  law,  Salnick  said.A  judge  would  not  give  a  sentence  any  different  than  what  a  prosecutor  might  offer  in  a  plea  deal,  but  a  plea  deal  might  allow  the  DUI  charge  to  be  kept  off  the  defendant's  criminal  record,  replaced  by  reckless  driving,  he  said.  Probation  rules  --  including  a  drug-testing  requirement  --  would  be  the  same.So,  why  go  to  trial?  An  acquittal  would  be  Bieber's  only  way  to  avoid  probation  and  drug  testing,  short  of  persuading  the  Miami  prosecutor  to  drop  the  case,  Salnick  said.The  prosecutor  in  Miami  has  not  discussed  a  plea  agreement  with  Bieber's  lawyer,  Ed  Griffith,  a  spokesman  for  the  Miami-Dade  state  attorney's  office  told  CNN  Tuesday.  "It's  way  too  early  to  offer  a  plea  deal,  if  one  was  to  be  offered."Bieber  could  choose  the  DUI  diversion  program  that  is  available  to  all  first-time  offenders,  Griffith  said.  It  would  last  between  six  and  nine  months  with  random  drug  testing,  about  $1,000  in  fines  and  fees,  40  hours  of  community  service,  an  alcohol  education  class.  In  addition,  Bieber  would  have  to  attend  a  session  in  which  victims  of  DUI  wrecks  tell  their  stories."There  are  11  stories  presented  by  real  victims  and  sometimes  defendants  who  relay  their  experiences,"  a  description  of  the  three-hour  session  said.  "There  is  a  quiz  at  the  end,  and  the  defendant  has  to  score  100  percent  prior  to  completion."Deal  or  no  deal,  first-time  offenders  rarely  go  to  jail  if  convicted  of  drunken  driving  in  Florida,  Salnick  said.  Bieber  is  likely  not  facing  jail,  unless  he  violates  probation  --  such  as  by  failing  a  drug  test.A  trial  had  been  scheduled  to  start  next  Tuesday,  but  instead  a  "sounding"  hearing  will  be  held  with  lawyers  talking  to  the  judge  about  preparations  for  a  trial.Toronto  assault  chargeBieber's  best  resolution  of  an  assault  charge  in  Toronto  may  be  a  plea  deal  that  includes  a  "diversion"  plan,  according  to  a  Canadian  lawyer  interviewed  by  CNN."If  he  goes  to  trial,  he  probably  would  be  convicted,"  said  attorney  James  Morton,  a  past  president  of  the  Ontario  Bar  Association.  "The  Canadian  system's  conviction  rate  is  extraordinarily  high."  Just  3.5%  of  all  defendants  who  plead  not  guilty  and  go  to  trial  are  acquitted,  he  said.Bieber  allegedly  struck  his  limousine  driver  on  the  back  of  his  head  several  times  while  driving  to  a  Toronto  nightclub  in  December.Toronto  prosecutors  are  likely  already  talking  to  Bieber's  lawyer  about  a  plea  deal  with  a  "conditional  discharge,"  in  which  the  case  would  not  be  prosecuted  if  he  takes  part  in  anger  management  and  community  service,  Morton  said.  It's  the  likely  result  for  a  young  person  without  a  criminal  record  who  is  not  a  celebrity,  he  said.  Prosecutors  will  be  under  "intense  scrutiny"  and  will  want  to  avoid  a  deal  that  "looks  like  they're  favoring  a  famous  Canadian  star,"  he  said.The  first  court  hearing  is  set  for  March  10,  but  Bieber  does  not  have  to  be  there.  A  magistrate  will  hold  several  hearings  over  the  next  few  months  to  make  sure  the  prosecution  has  handed  over  all  of  its  evidence,  including  statements  and  any  video,  to  the  defense  before  the  case  is  assigned  to  a  judge  for  trial,  Morton  said.California  egg  probeBieber  faces  a  possible  vandalism  charge  in  connection  with  eggs  tossed  at  his  neighbor's  home  last  month,  which  caused  an  estimated  $20,000  damage  to  a  Calabasas,  California,  mansion.The  egging  case  is  what  lawyers  call  a  "wobbler."  The  Los  Angeles  County  district  attorney's  office  could  prosecute  it  as  a  misdemeanor  or  a  felony  under  California  law.  It  is  up  to  the  prosecutor  to  decide  how  serious  the  case  is,  based  on  a  defendant's  criminal  history  and  other  circumstances.  A  prosecutor  has  had  the  results  of  the  sheriff's  investigation  for  almost  three  weeks,  and  a  decision  could  come  soon.A  felony  vandalism  conviction  could  bring  up  to  three  years  in  prison  and  a  $50,000  fine.  The  maximum  penalty  for  a  misdemeanor  conviction  is  a  year  in  the  county  jail  and  a  $50,000  fine.  A  felony  conviction  could  also  limit  Bieber's  ability  to  work  in  the  United  States,  because  he  is  a  Canadian  citizen  with  a  work  visa.Investigators  searched  his  $6.5  million  home  last  month,  seizing  the  security  video.  Detectives  gave  the  district  attorney  video  clips  identified  from  the  night  of  the  egg  attack  to  use  in  the  prosecution  of  Bieber.  Another  video  recorded  by  the  neighbor  was  also  provided  to  investigators.Flying  high?The  Federal  Aviation  Administration  is  looking  into  allegations  that  Bieber  and  other  passengers  onboard  a  charter  flight  from  Canada  to  New  Jersey's  Teterboro  Airport  on  January  31  interfered  with  the  flight  crew,  the  agency  said.Bieber  and  his  father  were  "extremely  abusive  verbally"  to  the  flight  attendant  on  the  Gulfstream  IV  aircraft  as  he  traveled  to  attend  the  Super  Bowl,  according  to  a  law  enforcement  sources.  Both  Biebers  refused  a  pilot's  repeated  warnings  to  stop  smoking  pot  on  the  flight,  according  to  a  report  by  U.S.  Customs  and  Border  Protection,  which  was  read  to  CNN.The  FAA  has  not  said  when  its  investigation  will  conclude.CNN's  John  Couwels  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

The  Hahn  family's  commitment  to  quality  is  driven  in  large  part  by  their  Christian  faith,  which  in  turn  may  soon  threaten  the  company's  very  existence.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  A  key  provision  of  the  health  care  reform  law  championed  by  President  Barack  Obama  came  under  harsh  criticism  from  the  conservative  majority  of  the  Supreme  Court  on  Tuesday.The  justices  debated  a  hotly  contested  issue  testing  the  limits  of  government-mandated  contraception  coverage,  specifically  involving  for-profit  corporations  that  object  to  it  for  religious  reasons.The  justices  appeared  divided  along  ideological  lines  in  a  90-minute  oral  argument,  with  the  federal  government  offering  a  spirited  defense  of  the  Affordable  Care  Act."How  does  a  corporation  exercise  religion?"  asked  Justice  Sonia  Sotomayor,  summarizing  perhaps  the  key  constitutional  question  at  hand."This  is  a  religious  question,"  said  Justice  Samuel  Alito,  suggesting  the  businesses  have  such  a  right.  "You  want  us  to  provide  a  definitive  secular  answer."Before  the  hearing  began,  hundreds  of  demonstrators  representing  both  sides  of  the  issue  rallied  in  front  of  the  courthouse  on  Capitol  Hill.The  court  is  reviewing  provisions  of  the  Affordable  Care  Act  requiring  for-profit  employers  of  a  certain  size  to  offer  insurance  benefits  for  birth  control  and  other  reproductive  health  services  without  a  co-pay.At  issue  is  whether  certain  companies  can  refuse  to  do  so  on  the  sincere  claim  it  would  violate  their  owners'  long-established  personal  beliefs.Two  separate  appeals  are  being  heard  together.The  outcome  was  uncertain,  but  the  court  could  cast  preliminary  votes  later  this  week.  A  final  written  ruling  is  expected  by  late  June.5  things  to  know  about  Obamacare  and  contraceptivesThe  cases  involve  two  appeals  from  Conestoga  Wood  Specialties.  The  companion  legal  challenge  comes  from  Hobby  Lobby,  an  Oklahoma-based  arts  and  crafts  retail  giant.  The  Hahn  family  owns  Conestoga  and  the  Green  family  owns  Hobby  Lobby.Both  corporations  emphasize  their  desire  to  operate  in  harmony  with  biblical  principles  while  competing  in  a  secular  marketplace.  That  includes  their  leaders'  publicly  stated  opposition  to  abortion.The  cases  present  a  complex  mix  of  legal,  regulatory,  and  constitutional  concerns--  over  such  hot-button  issues  as  faith,  abortion,  corporate  power,  executive  agency  discretion,  and  congressional  intent.Political  stakesThe  political  stakes  are  large,  especially  for  the  future  effectiveness  of  Obamacare,  which  marks  its  fourth  anniversary  this  week.The  botched  rollout  of  HealthCare.gov,  the  federal  site  where  consumers  can  sign  up  for  insurance,  has  become  another  political  flashpoint.Republicans  claim  the  law,  approved  by  Congress  without  their  support,  is  unworkable  and  are  campaigning  furiously  against  it  in  this  year's  midterm  elections.The  church-state  issue  now  in  the  spotlight  involves  three-pronged  rules  negotiated  last  year  between  the  Obama  administration  and  various  outside  groups.Under  the  changes,  churches  and  houses  of  worship  are  exempt  from  the  contraception  mandate.Other  nonprofit,  religiously  affiliated  groups,  such  as  church-run  hospitals,  parochial  schools  and  charities  like  the  Little  Sisters  of  the  Poor,  must  either  offer  coverage,  or  have  a  third-party  insurer  provide  separate  benefits  without  the  employer's  direct  involvement.Lawsuits  in  those  cases  are  pending  in  several  federal  appeals  courts.For-profit  businesses  in  spotlightThe  Hobby  Lobby  and  Conestoga  claims  are  in  yet  another  Obamacare  category:  for-profit  corporations  claiming  a  religion-based  exemption.These  suits  follow  the  high  court's  decision  two  years  ago  that  narrowly  upheld  the  key  funding  provision  of  the  health  care  law,  a  blockbuster  ruling  affirming  that  most  Americans  would  be  required  to  purchase  insurance  or  pay  a  financial  penalty,  the  so-called  individual  mandate.The  constitutional  debate  shifts  to  the  separate  employer  mandates  and  whether  corporations  themselves  enjoy  the  same  First  Amendment  rights  as  individuals.Three  federal  appeals  courts  have  struck  down  the  contraception  coverage  rule,  while  two  others  have  upheld  it.  That  "circuit  split"  made  the  upcoming  Supreme  Court  review  almost  certain.A  key  issue  for  the  bench  will  be  interpreting  a  1993  federal  law  known  as  the  Religious  Freedom  Restoration  Act,  requiring  the  government  to  seek  the  "least  burdensome"  and  narrowly  tailored  means  for  any  law  that  interferes  with  religious  convictions.  Can  companies,  churches,  and  universities  be  included,  or  do  the  protections  apply  only  to  "persons?""Our  family  started  Hobby  Lobby  built  on  our  faith  and  together  as  a  family,"  Barbara  Green,  Hobby  Lobby  co-owner,  told  CNN  after  the  arguments.  "We  believe  that  Americans  don't  lose  their  religious  freedom  when  they  open  a  family  business.  We  were  encouraged  by  today's  arguments.  We  are  thankful  that  the  Supreme  Court  took  our  case  and  we  prayerfully  await  the  justice's  decision."Vocal  backing  for  mandateIn  the  arguments  on  Tuesday,  Obama's  two  appointees  to  the  high  court  offered  the  most  vocal  backing  of  the  mandate."Congress  has  given  a  statutory  entitlement  and  that  entitlement  is  to  women  and  includes  contraceptive  coverage,"  said  Justice  Elena  Kagan.  "And  when  the  employer  says,  no,  I  don't  want  to  give  that,  that  woman  is  quite  directly,  quite  tangibly  harmed."Sotomayor  asked  the  lawyer  for  the  companies:  "Is  your  claim  limited  to  sensitive  materials  like  contraceptives  or  does  it  include  items  like  blood  transfusion,  vaccines?  For  some  religions,  products  made  of  pork?  Is  any  claim  under  your  theory  that  has  a  religious  basis,  could  an  employer  preclude  the  use  of  those  items  as  well?"Solicitor  General  Donald  Verrilli,  arguing  for  the  administration,  said  the  case  was  really  not  about  the  government  or  the  corporate  officers:  "The  rights  of  the  third  party  employees  are  at  center  stage  here.""In  the  entire  history  of  this  country,  there  is  not  a  single  case  in  which  a  for-profit  corporation  was  granted  an  exemption"  on  religious  liberty  grounds,  when  that  would  harm  the  rights  of  others,  he  added.Tough  questionsJustice  Anthony  Kennedy  --  who  may  prove  the  decisive  vote  --  posed  tough  questions  on  both  sides."The  government,  through  its  healthcare  plan  --  under  your  view  --  is  allowing  the  employer  to  put  the  employee  in  a  disadvantageous  position,  he  said  at  one  point  to  Paul  Clement,  representing  the  Greens  and  Hahns.  "The  employee  may  not  agree  with  these  religious  beliefs  of  the  employer.  Do  the  religious  beliefs  just  trump?  Is  that  the  way  it  works?"Clement  said  there  were  other  ways  to  ensure  an  employer  did  not  have  to  violate  her  religious  beliefs,  while  still  giving  workers  the  mandated  coverage."Because  you  have  a  unique  situation  here,  where  their  policy  is  about  a  government  subsidy  for  a  government-preferred  health  care  item,  and  the  question  is  who  pays?"  said  Clement.  "The  government  paying  or  a  third-party  insurer  paying  is  a  perfectly  good  least  restrictive  alternative."Chief  Justice  John  Roberts  wondered  whether  government's  interest  was  really  "compelling"  as  required,  when  the  administration  had  already  granted  so  many  coverage  exemptions  --  including  to  houses  of  worship,  religious  non-profits,  small  companies,  and  grandfathered  health  plans.He  suggested  corporate  rights  extend  into  a  wider  range  of  areas,  including  allowing  companies--  along  with  individuals--  to  bring  racial  discrimination  claims.  "Does  the  government  have  a  position  on  whether  corporations  have  a  race?"  he  asked  Verrilli.Kennedy  later  took  issue  with  the  government  on  another  point."Under  your  view,  a  for-profit  corporation  could  be  forced  in  principle  to  pay  for  abortions,"  which  is  currently  not  allowed  under  federal  law."No.  I  think,  as  you  said,  the  law  now  is  to  the  contrary,"  replied  Verrilli,  who  said  most  women  taking  IUDs  do  not  equate  that  with  abortion."But  your  reasoning  would  permit  that,"  said  Kennedy,  sharply.  "You  say  profit  corporations  just  don't  have  any  standing  to  vindicate  the  religious  rights  of  their  shareholders  and  owners.""Isn't  that  what  we  are  talking  about  in  terms  of  their  religious  beliefs?"  added  Roberts.  "One  of  the  religious  beliefs  is  that  they  have  to  pay  for  these  four  methods  of  contraception  that  they  (corporations)  believe  provide  abortions."Under  the  ACA,  financial  penalties  of  up  to  $100  per  day  per  employee  can  be  levied  on  firms  that  refuse  to  provide  comprehensive  health  coverage.  Hobby  Lobby,  which  has  about  13,000  workers,  estimates  the  penalty  could  cost  it  $475  million  a  year.Abortion  rights  groups  urged  the  justices  to  again  uphold  a  key  tenet  of  Obamacare."What  I  think  we  saw  today  was  the  importance  of  having  (three)  women  on  the  Supreme  Court,"  said  Cecile  Richards,  President,  Planned  Parenthood  Action  Fund.  "What's  at  stake  in  this  case  is  whether  millions  of  women  and  their  right  to  preventive  care  including  birth  control  is  trumped  by  a  handful  of  CEOs  who  have  their  own  personal  opinions  about  birth  control."The  cases  are  Sebelius  v.  Hobby  Lobby  Stores,  Inc.  (13-354);  and  Conestoga  Wood  Specialties  Corp.  v.  Sebelius  (13-356).</TEXT></DOC>

"My  level  of  enthusiasm  is  very  high."The  study  was  published  in  Nature  Medicine.'We  were  surprised'In  the  beginning,  the  researchers  knew  they  wanted  to  find  a  blood  test  to  detect  Alzheimer's  but  didn't  know  what  specifically  to  look  for.  Should  they  examine  patients'  DNA?  Their  RNA?  Or  should  they  look  for  the  byproducts  of  DNA  and  RNA,  such  as  fats  and  proteins?They  decided  to  start  with  fats,  since  it  was  the  easiest  and  least  expensive.  They  drew  blood  from  hundreds  of  healthy  people  over  age  70  living  near  Rochester,  New  York,  and  Irvine,  California.  Five  years  later,  28  of  the  seniors  had  developed  Alzheimer's  disease  or  the  mild  cognitive  problems  that  usually  precede  it.Scouring  more  than  100  fats,  or  lipids,  for  what  might  set  this  group  apart,  they  found  that  these  28  seniors  had  low  levels  of  10  particular  lipids,  compared  with  healthy  seniors.To  confirm  their  findings,  the  researchers  then  looked  at  the  blood  of  54  other  patients  who  had  Alzheimer's  or  mild  cognitive  impairment.  This  group  also  had  low  levels  of  the  lipids.Overall,  the  blood  test  predicted  who  would  get  Alzheimer's  or  mild  cognitive  impairment  with  over  90%  accuracy."We  were  surprised,"  said  Mark  Mapstone,  a  neuropsychologist  at  the  University  of  Rochester  Medical  Center  and  lead  author  of  the  study.  "But  it  turns  out  that  it  appears  we  were  looking  in  the  right  place."Alzheimer's  risk  before  symptoms:  Do  you  want  to  know?The  'holy  grail'The  beauty  of  this  test,  Mapstone  says,  is  that  it  caught  Alzheimer's  before  the  patient  even  had  symptoms,  suggesting  that  the  disease  process  begins  long  before  people's  memories  start  failing.  He  says  that  perhaps  the  lipid  levels  started  decreasing  at  the  same  time  as  brain  cells  started  dying.He  and  his  team  plan  to  try  out  this  test  in  people  in  their  40s  and  50s.  If  that  works,  he  says,  that  would  be  the  "holy  grail,"  because  then  researchers  could  try  experimental  drugs  and  treatments  in  a  group  that's  almost  sure  to  get  the  disease.  That  would  speed  research  along  immensely.Plus,  people  could  get  a  heads  up  that  they  were  probably  destined  to  get  Alzheimer's.  Although  some  people  might  not  want  to  know  that  they're  destined  for  a  horrible  disease,  others  might  be  grateful  for  the  warning.Federoff  said  he  would  want  to  know  whether  he  was  on  his  way  to  getting  the  disease,  even  though  there's  nothing  he  could  do  about  it.  He  might  want  to  take  a  family  trip  he'd  been  thinking  about  or  might  want  to  appoint  a  successor  at  work."I  would  make  sure  that  things  that  are  important  to  me  get  done,"  he  said.But,  Federoff  added,  others  might  not  want  to  know  they  were  about  to  get  a  devastating  disease  they  were  powerless  to  stop."I  think  it's  a  very  personal  decision,"  Federoff  said.  "It  would  have  to  be  thought  through  on  multiple  dimensions.  Patients  and  their  families  would  have  to  be  counseled."Next  stepsOther  research  teams  are  looking  at  other  possible  tests  for  Alzheimer's.  The  need  for  a  screening  test  of  some  kind  for  Alzheimer's  has  never  been  greater:  A  report  released  last  week  says  the  disease  claims  the  lives  of  perhaps  a  half  a  million  Americans,  making  it  nearly  as  deadly  as  heart  disease  and  cancer.If  any  of  these  tests  work  out  --  and  that's  still  an  if  --  it  would  take  years  to  make  it  to  doctors'  offices,  since  the  test  would  need  to  be  validated  by  other  labs  and  with  larger  groups  of  people.  Thee  test  developed  by  the  Georgetown  and  Rochester  researchers,  for  example,  was  used  mainly  in  white  people,  and  it  might  not  work  as  well  with  other  groups.Heather  Snyder,  a  spokeswoman  for  the  Alzheimer's  Association,  said  the  study  was  well  done  but  much  work  is  still  needed."It's  an  interesting  paper.  It's  an  intriguing  study.  But  it  is  very  preliminary,"  she  said.Overwhelming  burden,  cost  of  Alzheimer's  to  triple,  report  says</TEXT></DOC>

Typically,  the  flu  season  begins  in  the  winter  months  and  peaks  in  January  or  February,  according  to  the  CDC.The  number  of  states  with  widespread  flu  activity  increased  from  25  to  35  for  the  week  ending  January  4,  according  to  the  CDC's  weekly  flu  advisory  report."Widespread"  means  that  more  than  50%  of  geographic  regions  in  a  state  --  counties,  for  example  --  are  reporting  flu  activity.  The  designation  addresses  the  spread  of  the  flu,  not  its  severity.However,  the  number  of  states  experiencing  a  high  proportion  of  outpatient  visits  to  health  care  providers  for  flu-like  illnesses  stayed  the  same  from  last  week,  at  20.  The  most  severe  activity  was  seen  in  parts  of  the  South  and  Southwest.Widespread  flu  activity  was  reported  in  Alabama,  Alaska,  Arkansas,  California,  Colorado,  Connecticut,  Georgia,  Idaho,  Illinois,  Indiana,  Kansas,  Kentucky,  Louisiana,  Maine,  Massachusetts,  Minnesota,  Missouri,  Montana,  Nebraska,  New  Hampshire,  New  York,  North  Carolina,  North  Dakota,  Ohio,  Oklahoma,  Oregon,  Pennsylvania,  Rhode  Island,  South  Dakota,  Texas,  Utah,  Virginia,  Washington,  Wisconsin  and  Wyoming.In  some  areas,  including  central  Texas  and  the  San  Francisco  Bay  Area,  overflow  tents  have  been  set  up  to  handle  flu  patients,  CNN  affiliates  have  reported.Health  officials  have  said  this  year's  flu  season  appears  pretty  typical  --  as  opposed  to  last  year's,  which  was  severe.The  only  atypical  thing  seen  this  year  is  that  the  most  common  strain  has  been  H1N1,  which  became  known  as  swine  flu  during  a  2009  outbreak.H1N1  is  the  same  virus  that  caused  a  pandemic  in  2009,  Dr.  Michael  Jhung,  a  medical  officer  in  the  CDC's  flu  division,  has  said.  It  was  dubbed  swine  flu  because  it  was  being  seen  for  the  first  time  in  humans.Since  then,  "it's  established  itself  very  nicely  in  the  human  population,"  he  said.  H1N1  has  been  seen  every  season  since  2009  in  people  and  is  no  longer  referred  to  as  swine  flu.  The  strain  is  so  common  that  it  was  included  in  this  year's  vaccination,  Jhung  said.5  ways  to  combat  flu  in  your  homeFour  new  pediatric  flu  deaths  were  reported  to  the  CDC  last  week,  according  to  the  flu  report.  A  total  of  10  influenza-related  child  deaths  have  been  reported  since  September  29.The  agency  does  not  track  adult  deaths  related  to  the  flu,  although  some  states  do,  and  deaths  have  been  reported.The  exact  number  of  flu-related  adult  deaths  is  hard  to  track  and  varies  from  year  to  year.  The  CDC  has  estimated  that  from  1976  through  2007,  between  3,000  and  49,000  people  died  of  flu-related  causes."It  depends  on  the  season;  it  depends  on  the  virus,"  Jhung  said.Last  year,  381,000  people  were  hospitalized  and  171  children  died  in  what's  being  called  a  relatively  severe  season.However,  the  CDC  estimates  that  flu  vaccination  prevented  6.6  million  illnesses  last  year,  3.2  million  doctor  visits  and  at  least  79,000  hospitalizations.Flu  vaccines  are  recommended  for  everyone  6  months  and  older,  especially  pregnant  women  and  those  at  high  risk  of  complications,  including  the  elderly,  children  younger  than  5  years  and  those  with  underlying  medical  conditions  such  as  asthma  or  diabetes.Antiviral  medications  are  a  good  treatment  if  you  do  get  sick,  Jhung  said,  particularly  those  at  high  risk  for  complications.  Ideally,  antivirals  should  be  started  within  two  days  of  when  symptoms  appear.</TEXT></DOC>

Rob  Portman  says  the  African  elephant  could  die  off  because  of  the  huge  demand  for  ivory  in  China.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Rob  Portman,  a  Republican,  is  a  U.S.  senator  from  Ohio.(CNN)  --  The  African  elephant,  one  of  the  world's  most  majestic  animals,  is  in  danger.  In  the  early  1900s,  5  million  elephants  roamed  the  African  continent.  Then  the  ivory  trade  drove  them  to  the  brink  of  extinction,  with  90%  of  African  elephants  killed  for  the  ivory  in  their  tusks.In  1989,  the  world  reacted,  imposing  a  ban  on  the  international  trade  in  ivory  passed  by  the  U.N.  Convention  on  International  Trade  in  Endangered  Species.  Elephant  populations  stabilized.  But  today,  driven  by  growing  demand  for  ivory  ornaments  and  carvings  in  Asia,  particularly  in  China,  elephant  poaching  has  returned  with  a  vengeance.The  largest  slaughter  in  one  year  since  the  1989  ban  was  passed  happened  in  2012,  with  up  to  35,000  elephants  killed.  This  adds  up  to  nearly  100  a  day.  Tens  of  thousands  are  killed  every  year.  Without  action,  the  day  may  come  when  this  magnificent  creature  is  known  only  in  history  books.Estimates  say  if  elephants  continue  to  be  slaughtered  at  today's  rates,  the  creatures  could  be  extinct  in  a  decade.  Not  only  do  elephants  die.  The  wildlife  rangers  who  try  to  protect  them  from  poachers  are  being  killed.The  illicit  trade  in  ivory  --  "white  gold"  --  is  a  billion  dollar  industry,  and  because  it  is  illegal,  it  tends  to  attract  some  very  bad  actors.  It  is  blood  ivory:  Al-Shabaab,  a  wing  of  al  Qaeda  based  in  Africa  that  is  responsible  for  continued  instability  in  Somalia,  is  known  to  finance  its  operations  through  the  poaching  of  elephants.  Al-Shabaab  raises  an  estimated  $600,000  a  month  through  the  ivory  trade.  The  Lord's  Resistance  Army,  another  terrorist  group  infamous  for  forcing  children  to  fight  in  its  ranks,  also  engages  in  poaching  and  trafficking  of  elephant  ivory.Stopping  the  ivory  trade  has  become  not  only  a  matter  of  conservation  but  one  of  national  security  and  international  stability.Last  year,  the  United  Nations  issued  a  report  warning  that  elephant  poaching  is  the  worst  it  has  been  in  a  decade,  while  ivory  seizures  are  at  their  highest  levels  since  1989.  Last  summer,  President  Barack  Obama  issued  an  executive  order  recognizing  that  the  poaching  of  protected  species  and  the  illicit  trade  in  ivory  has  become  an  international  crisis  that  the  United  States  must  take  a  leading  role  in  combating.Saving  elephants  and  other  threatened  species  is  a  cause  that  cuts  across  partisan  lines  and  international  boundaries.  We  all  have  a  part  to  play.It  starts  in  our  personal  lives.The  ivory  trade  prospers  because  there  is  a  demand  for  luxury  goods  fashioned  from  it.  As  consumers,  we  should  never  buy  products  made  with  ivory  and  should  encourage  others  to  be  mindful  that  their  purchases  are  not  illegally  sourced  through  trafficking.  And  we  should  continue  to  shine  a  spotlight  on  the  problem  of  illegal  poaching  and  the  threat  it  poses  to  African  elephants  and  other  species.There  are  actions  our  government  can  take,  as  well.  As  co-chairman  of  the  U.S.  Senate  International  Conservation  Caucus,  I  have  worked  with  my  colleagues  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle  to  educate  members  of  Congress  on  these  ongoing  problems  and  introduce  legislation  that  authorizes  proven  conservation  programs  and  directs  resources  to  the  international  effort  to  dismantle  the  machinery  of  illegal  poaching.The  Conservation  Reform  Act  is  part  of  this  effort.  If  passed,  it  would  streamline  and  increase  the  effectiveness  of  our  existing  international  conservation  efforts.  I  am  also  working  to  reauthorize  the  Saving  Vanishing  Species  Stamp,  which  raises  funds  for  the  protection  of  threatened  animals  and  their  habitat  at  no  cost  to  the  U.S.  taxpayer.Over  the  years,  we  have  watched  as  the  actions  of  a  few  shortsighted,  malicious  and  greedy  people  have  nearly  destroyed  whole  species.  If  we  act  now,  we  can  make  sure  that  the  African  elephant  doesn't  become  another  sad  entry  on  a  long  list  of  animals  we  can  never  bring  back.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Rob  Portman.</TEXT></DOC>

It  can  be  so  many  things:  sweet,  loving,  awkward,  intense,  transporting,  disappointing,  boring,  sublime,  life  altering.On  the  delicious  and  passionate  side  of  the  spectrum,  a  smooch  can  be  a  heart-healthy  micro  workout,  a  hormone  releaser  and  a  mood  booster.  It's  also  fun  --  and  a  great  way  to  connect  with  the  person  you  care  about."Sex,  as  wonderful  as  it  is,  can  be  perfunctory,"  says  Andréa  Demirjian,  author  of  "Kissing:  Everything  You  Ever  Wanted  to  Know  about  One  of  Life's  Sweetest  Pleasures."  "Kissing  is  intimate:  You're  right  there  in  the  space  of  your  soul.  It  gets  to  the  core  of  your  heart  and  spirit  because  it's  such  a  lovely  way  to  express  and  receive  love  and  affection.  A  kiss  a  day  really  can  keep  the  doctor  away."upwave:  An  apple  a  day  keeps  the  doctor  away?1.  Kissing  helps  reduce  blood  pressureMaking  out  isn't  just  good  for  your  emotional  heart,  it  gives  your  anatomical  one  a  workout,  too.  "Kissing  passionately  gets  your  heartbeat  revved  in  a  healthy  way  that  helps  lower  your  blood  pressure,"  says  Demirjian.  "It  dilates  your  blood  vessels  --  blood  is  flowing  in  a  good,  solid  fashion  and  getting  to  all  your  vital  organs."2.  Kissing  zaps  cramps  and  headaches"Kissing  is  great  if  you  have  a  headache  or  menstrual  cramps,"  says  Demirjian.  You  may  be  inclined  to  wave  away  advances  when  you're  curled  into  an  achy  ball,  but  the  blood-vessel  dilation  brought  on  by  a  good  long  smooching  session  can  really  help  ease  your  pain.  In  fact,  Demirjian  recommends  replacing  the  ol'  "Not  tonight,  dear  --  I  have  a  headache"  line  with,  "Honey,  I  have  a  headache.  Come  kiss  me!"upwave:  How  to  divert  your  mind  from  pain3.  Kissing  fights  cavitiesA  smooch-a-thon  gets  all,  er,  fluids  flowing  --  including  your  saliva.  "When  you're  kissing,  you're  secreting  more  saliva  in  your  mouth,"  says  Demirjian.  "That's  the  mechanism  that  washes  away  the  plaque  on  your  teeth  that  leads  to  cavities."  (So  much  more  fun  than  gargling!)4.  Kissing  amps  up  your  happy  hormones"If  you're  feeling  stressed  or  rundown,  a  little  kissing  or  lovemaking  [is]  actually  the  elixir  you  need  to...  feel  better,"  says  Demirjian.  "It  will  relax,  restore  and  revitalize  you....  The  feel-good  chemicals  in  the  brain  get  percolating:  serotonin,  dopamine,  oxytocin  --  things  you  can  get  from  the  rush  of  exercising."upwave:  9  ways  having  a  partner  makes  life  better5.  Kissing  burns  (a  few)  caloriesIt  can't  compare  to  30  minutes  on  the  elliptical,  but  a  vigorous  makeout  session  can  burn  8  to  16  calories  per  smooch,  says  Demirjian.  "Kissing  and  lovemaking  can  be  a  vigorous  exercise  if  you're  fully  engaged,"  she  says.  "You  need  to  have  a  passionate  kiss  [in  order  to  burn  those  calories],  but  it  doesn't  have  to  be  a  10-hour  makeout  session."6.  Kissing  boosts  self-esteemOne  German  study  found  that  men  who  got  a  nice  juicy  kiss  from  their  wives  before  leaving  for  work  made  more  money.  "If  he  leaves  his  home  happy,  he's  more  productive  at  work  because  he's  not  feeling  emotionally  distressed,  so  he's  going  to  make  more  money,"  explains  Demirjian.  "Kissing  has  so  much  to  do  with  your  self-esteem  and  feeling  loved  and  connected."upwave:  How  to  be  lucky  in  love7.  Kissing  can  give  you  a  facelift  (kind  of)Per  Demirjian,  deep  kissing  can  shape  up  the  neck  and  jawline,  which  are  often  trouble  spots  for  those  concerned  about  looking  older.  "Your  mouth  has  a  number  of  facial  muscles,"  she  says.  "When  those  are  engaged  in  kissing,  you  can  tighten  and  tone  them."8.  Kissing  is  a  barometer  for  sexual  compatibilityIt  can  be  an  excellent  way  to  check  out  a  potential  partner  for  sexual  compatibility  before  getting  naked  and  emotionally  involved,  says  Demirjian.  But  if  your  very  first  liplock  with  a  new  partner  is  meh,  she  recommends  giving  him  or  her  one  more  shot."Sometimes  during  the  first  kiss,  people  are  feeling  awkward,  nervous  or  embarrassed,"  she  says.  "That  might  not  breed  the  most  seductive,  sexy  experience."  Second  kiss  is  crappy,  too?  That's  your  cue  to  take  your  lips  --  and  the  rest  of  you  --  elsewhere.This  article  was  originally  published  on  upwave.com.©  2013  upwave,  All  Rights  Reserved.</TEXT></DOC>

Edward  Byrom  Sr.  was  fatally  shot  in  his  home  in  Iuka,  Mississippi,  while  Michelle  was  in  the  hospital  receiving  treatment  for  double  pneumonia.The  state  Supreme  Court  has  the  final  say  on  executions  and  has  yet  to  confirm  the  date  or  weigh  in  on  the  request.If  Byrom  is  put  to  death,  she  will  be  the  first  woman  the  state  has  executed  in  70  years,  but  her  advocates  say  there  are  many  reasons  she  deserves  a  stay.Chief  among  them  is  the  fact  that  Byrom's  son  has  confessed  not  once,  but  four  times,  to  killing  his  abusive  father:  in  three  jailhouse  letters  smuggled  to  his  mother,  and  once  in  a  statement  given  to  a  court-appointed  psychologist.In  what's  been  called  a  "perversion  of  American  jurisprudence"  by  Warren  Yoder,  executive  director  of  the  Public  Policy  Center  of  Mississippi,  a  jury  has  never  heard  any  of  Edward  Byrom  Jr.'s  confessions.In  one  explicit  confession  letter  to  his  mother,  Byrom  Jr.  detailed  how  he  killed  his  father  in  a  rage  after  his  father  called  him  a  "bastard,  no  good,  mistake,  and  telling  me  I'm  inconciderate  (sic)  and  just  care  about  my  self."His  father  hit  him  for  the  last  time  that  day,  Byrom  Jr.  wrote."He  slaps  me,  then  goes  back  to  his  room.  As  I  sat  on  my  bed,  tears  of  rage  flowing,  remembering  my  childhood,  my  anger  kept  building  and  building,"  the  letter  said.Byrom  Jr.  retrieved  a  9mm  handgun  --  a  WWII  weapon  that  belonged  to  his  grandfather,  according  to  the  Jackson  Free  Press  --  entered  his  father's  bedroom,  opened  fire  and  fled,  Byrom  Jr.  wrote.Today,  Byrom  Jr.  is  a  free  man,  living  where  he  grew  up,  in  Tishomingo  County  in  rural  northeastern  Mississippi.  He  has  found  religion,  according  to  a  letter  he  wrote  to  his  mother  after  her  conviction,  and  his  Facebook  page  says  he  studied  fine  arts  at  the  New  Orleans  Baptist  Theological  Seminary.The  planAuthorities  say  Byrom  Jr.,  his  mother  and  his  friend,  Joey  Gillis,  colluded  to  kill  Edward  Byrom  Sr.  in  1999.  It  was  a  murder-for-hire  scheme,  and  Michelle  Byrom  was  the  alleged  mastermind.After  the  shooting,  Byrom  Jr.  went  to  the  hospital,  told  his  mother  what  happened,  then  went  back  home  to  check  to  see  if  his  father  was  still  alive,  according  to  a  filing  by  the  defense.  When  he  found  Byrom  Sr.  dead,  he  called  911.Sheriff's  officials  arrived,  questioned  Byrom  Jr.,  their  main  suspect  at  the  time,  and  then  Byrom  Jr.'s  best  buddy,  Gillis,  because  he  had  spent  part  of  the  day  with  Byrom  Jr.,  according  to  a  sheriff's  official's  statement  during  the  trial.Evidence  at  the  trial  included  a  statement  to  Sheriff  David  Smith,  in  which  Byrom  Jr.  accused  Gillis  of  the  shooting  and  his  mother  of  hiring  his  friend  to  kill  his  father.  Gunpowder  residue  was  found  only  on  Byrom  Jr.'s  hands,  never  on  Gillis',  the  evidence  showed.At  trial,  prosecutors  presented  a  theory  that  Michelle  Byrom  was  looking  to  collect  on  her  husband's  $150,000  life  insurance  policy  and  planned  to  pay  Gillis  $15,000  in  exchange  for  the  killing.Yet  in  one  jailhouse  letter,  Byrom  Jr.  wrote  that  he  was  inebriated  and  had  fabricated  a  story  in  his  statement  to  Smith."When  they  got  me  here,  I  gave  them  a  bullshit  story  after  another,  trying  to  save  my  own  ass,  but  when  David  Smith  started  questioning  me,  and  told  me  what  happened,  I  was  so  scared,  confused,  and  high,  I  just  started  spitting  the  first  thought  out,  which  turned  into  this  big  conspiracy  thing,  for  money,  which  was  all  BS,  that's  why  I  had  so  many  different  stories,"  his  letter  read.At  the  time  of  her  husband's  shooting,  Michelle  Byrom  was  under  the  influence  of  about  a  dozen  drugs,  several  of  which  could  have  seriously  impaired  her  judgment,  according  to  an  affidavit  prepared  by  a  pharmacology  professor  for  the  defense  team.Mississippi  Highway  Patrol  officers  questioned  Michelle  Byrom  in  the  hospital  --  not  because  she  was  a  suspect,  but  because  they  had  questions  about  the  ownership  of  the  murder  weapon,  according  to  the  U.S.  District  Court.Later  that  day,  Michelle  Byrom  gave  statements  to  Smith  that  included  detailed  accounts  of  the  plan  and  the  killing.  Throughout  the  interrogations,  Smith  encouraged  Michelle  to  protect  her  son,  telling  her  that  Byrom  Jr.  had  already  confessed  to  the  murder-for-hire  conspiracy  and  given  details  about  his  mother's  involvement,  according  to  court  documents.According  to  the  state,  while  Michelle  Byrom  was  heavily  medicated,  her  doctor  and  a  nurse  were  present  during  the  initial  police  questioning  and  told  authorities  the  drugs  in  her  system  should  not  affect  her  understanding  of  their  questions  and  her  responses.Four  out  of  five  of  the  interviews  conducted  with  her  took  place  in  the  hospital.  Two  were  thrown  out  because  Michelle  Byrom  hadn't  properly  been  advised  of  her  rights,  but  subsequent  incriminating  statements  she  made  stuck.Deal  struckByrom  Jr.  cut  a  deal  with  prosecutors,  and  the  night  before  Michelle  Byrom's  trial  began  in  2000,  he  agreed  to  testify  against  his  mother  in  return  for  a  lighter  sentence.Michelle  Byrom's  attorneys,  who  were  trying  their  first  capital  murder  case,  withheld  Byrom  Jr.'s  letters  confessing  to  the  crime,  planning  instead  to  use  them  against  him  on  the  stand,  appellate  court  documents  say.Their  strategy  failed  when  prosecutors  argued  the  letters  couldn't  be  introduced  as  evidence  mid-trial.  Still,  the  defense  was  able  to  question  Byrom  Jr.  on  the  stand  about  the  content  of  the  letters  and  statements  he'd  made  admitting  to  killing  his  father.On  the  stand,  Byrom  Jr.  denied  everything.  He  testified  that  Gillis  was  the  killer  and  that  Michelle  Byrom  had  hired  him.  He  also  testified  that  once  he  and  his  mother  realized  police  were  intercepting  their  letters,  they  began  to  fabricate  details,  including  his  confessions,  in  hopes  of  sparing  them  both.Michelle's  subsequent  appeals  argued  that  failing  to  present  the  letters  during  trial  hurt  her  chances  of  acquittal.  After  the  jury  found  Michelle  Byrom  guilty,  her  attorneys,  banking  on  a  retrial,  advised  her  to  waive  a  jury  sentencing  and  have  the  trial  judge,  Thomas  Gardner,  determine  her  penalty.On  November  18,  2000,  the  judge  sentenced  Michelle  to  death.  Gillis,  the  alleged  trigger  man,  never  testified.CNN's  attempts  to  reach  Gardner  were  not  immediately  successful.In  2006,  Mississippi's  Supreme  Court  voted  5-3  against  Byrom's  appeal,  saying  "counsel's  performance  did  not  prejudice"  Byrom  during  the  penalty  phase  of  her  original  trial.But  in  the  dissenting  argument,  Justice  Jess  Dickinson  wrote,  "I  have  attempted  to  conjure  up  in  my  imagination  a  more  egregious  case  of  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel  during  the  sentencing  phase  of  a  capital  case.  ...  I  cannot."The  state  supreme  court  review  called  it  a  "perplexing"  choice  by  her  counsel  not  to  present  certain  evidence  during  trial.Byrom  Jr.'s  plea  deal  saw  him  sentenced  to  30  years  in  prison.  He  was  released  in  August  on  earned-release  supervision.Facebook  photos  of  Byrom  Jr.,  who  did  not  respond  to  CNN's  requests  for  comment,  show  him  posing  on  a  motorcycle  in  one  picture  and  with  a  child  in  another.In  a  telephone  interview  with  the  Clarion-Ledger,  Byrom  Jr.  told  the  newspaper  he  knew  his  mother  would  be  executed.  Asked  if  he  shot  his  father,  Byrom  Jr.  responded,  "No,  sir."Goddess  or  witchThe  Public  Policy  Center's  Yoder  says  the  prosecution  portrayed  Michelle  Byrom  as  a  witch  in  a  part  of  the  country  where  "people  only  have  two  categories  for  women:  goddess  or  witch."Michelle  Byrom  was  "pressed  to  craft  testimony  worthy  of  a  capital  offense  --  murder-for-hire,  which  makes  a  terrific  story  for  a  jury:  'Witch  manipulated  son  by  scheming,'  "  Yoder  said.Michelle  Byrom  was  abused  all  her  life,  according  to  the  defense.Family  members  and  doctors  submitted  affidavits  detailing  disturbing  abuse.  Michelle  Byrom's  siblings  told  the  court  their  stepfather  hit  them  for  minor  misbehavior  and  that  Michelle  confided  that  he'd  sexually  abused  her.  She  left  home  at  15  and  after  a  brief  courtship  moved  in  with  Byrom  Sr.  He  was  31  at  the  time.Her  husband  allegedly  continued  to  abuse  her,  even  forcing  her  to  have  sex  with  other  men,  which  he  videotaped,  according  to  court  documents.  When  Byrom  Jr.  was  born,  Byrom  Sr.  started  abusing  his  son,  a  "classic  abuse  pattern  to  enforce  silence,"  Yoder  said.Despite  these  circumstances,  former  Assistant  District  Attorney  Arch  Bullard,  who  prosecuted  the  case,  told  CNN  that  Michelle  was  doubtless  the  leader  of  the  murder-for-hire  plot,  and  the  conviction  has  stood  throughout  the  legal  process.Although  abuse  was  mentioned  in  the  defense  opening,  Bullard  said,  those  allegations  were  never  backed  up.  There  was  no  paper  trail  of  abuse,  no  domestic  violence  arrest  record,  no  record  of  hospitalizations.  Instead,  Bullard  said,  Michelle  Byrom  wanted  a  payout  from  her  husband's  life  insurance  policy."Not  only  do  I  think  that  she  was  the  mastermind  or  part  of  the  conspiracy  to  have  him  killed,  so  did  the  jury,  so  have  all  the  appellate  courts  in  Mississippi,  and  throughout  the  federal  system,"  the  former  prosecutor  said.Bullard  says  he  has  "total  faith  in  our  judicial  system,"  and  while  he  still  believes  Gillis  was  the  shooter,  "it  doesn't  matter  who  the  trigger  person  was.  (Michelle  Byrom)  was  intimately  involved  in  the  planning  and  execution  of  her  husband."Michelle  Byrom's  supporters  argue  that  her  capital  murder  conviction  should  be  thrown  out  if  Gillis  wasn't  the  trigger  man,  let  alone  if  Byrom  Jr.  killed  his  father  in  a  fit  of  rage  without  conspiring  with  his  friend  or  mother.They  also  question  why  more  value  isn't  placed  on  two  circumstances  surrounding  the  killing:  Police  never  found  gunpowder  residue  on  Gillis'  hands,  and  Byrom  Jr.  led  police  to  the  murder  weapon.In  a  rare  interview,  Gillis  told  CNN  that  he's  innocent  and  that  Byrom  Jr.  and  prosecutors  used  him  as  a  pawn.  Gillis  was  released  from  prison  in  2009  after  serving  time  for  conspiracy  to  commit  capital  murder  and  accessory  after  the  fact  --  charges  to  which  he  pleaded  guilty  in  a  deal  after  Michelle  Byrom's  sentencing.Gillis  says  he  paid  with  his  freedom  as  a  result  of  his  former  buddy's  betrayal.During  his  eight  years,  10  months  and  15  days  in  prison,  "they  took  all  my  rights  away,  and  they  had  knowledge  I  didn't  do  it,"  he  said.He  now  has  a  family  and  says  he  can  "forgive,  but  never  forget."  Gillis  said  Byrom  Jr.  tried  to  connect  with  him  on  Facebook  after  the  two  were  released  from  prison,  but  Gillis  ignored  the  request,  essentially  communicating  that  he  had  no  intention  of  associating  with  his  old  pal.Now  a  free  man,  he's  angry  with  the  system  and  wants  to  move  on.Last-ditch  appealAt  the  heart  of  Michelle  Byrom's  quest  to  spare  her  from  lethal  injection  is  the  argument  that  she  received  ineffective  counsel  and  that  her  son's  confession  to  a  court-appointed  psychologist  was  never  presented  to  a  jury.Her  defense  team  also  alleges  the  trial  judge  was  aware  of  the  confession  but  concealed  the  evidence  in  the  guilt  phase.Though  Byrom  Jr.'s  confessions  weren't  used  during  Michelle  Byrom's  sentencing  phase,  his  confessions  were  the  reason  prosecutors  allowed  Gillis  to  plead  guilty  to  lesser  charges.  The  "offer  of  proof"  presented  by  the  prosecutor  as  part  of  Gillis'  plea  bargain  stated  Gillis  was  not  the  shooter,  which  doesn't  jibe  with  the  prosecution's  trial  theory  that  Gillis  pulled  the  trigger  and  Michelle  was  the  mastermind.In  his  dissent,  Justice  Dickinson  also  noted  that  Michelle's  trial  judge  didn't  have  the  legal  authority  to  issue  a  death  sentence  because  a  defendant  must  be  "knowing"  and  "voluntary"  in  waiving  their  right  to  a  jury  sentencing  in  a  capital  case.  Michelle  Byrom's  current  attorneys  say  she  was  not  "knowing"  because  her  decision  was  based  on  erroneous  legal  advice  from  her  trial  lawyers.A  juror  told  the  Clarion-Ledger,  which  printed  some  of  Byrom  Jr.'s  confession  letters,  that  while  the  letters  showed  the  son  was  "very  disturbed,"  she  didn't  believe  they  warranted  a  different  verdict.Bullard,  the  ex-prosecutor  who  told  CNN  the  case  stood  out  in  his  20-year  career  because  of  the  senselessness  of  the  crime,  said  he  stood  by  the  original  verdict."When  you're  trying  a  capital  murder  case,  you  make  decisions  based  upon  your  preparations.  There  is  a  Sunday  morning  armchair  review  by  the  appellate  courts  that  looks  at  what  occurred.  All  courts  have  said  that  the  error  by  the  judge  and  the  defense  counsel  doesn't  outweigh  the  outcome  of  the  case,"  he  said.Conversely,  former  state  Supreme  Court  Justice  Oliver  Diaz  Jr.,  who  favored  a  new  trial  for  Michelle  Byrom  when  he  was  on  the  bench,  told  CNN  that  it's  "atrocious"  that  her  conviction  has  not  been  overturned."The  majority  of  Mississippians  support  the  death  penalty  because  they  think  that  people  get  fair  trials  and  they  think  that  they  have  competent  attorneys  representing  them,"  he  said.  "In  this  case,  she  didn't  have  either  one."</TEXT></DOC>

He  said  it's  good  for  the  economy  and  good  for  the  country,  "regardless  of  your  politics."</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Washington  (CNN)  --  A  last-minute  enrollment  surge  enabled  the  White  House  to  meet  its  original  sign-up  target  for  the  Affordable  Care  Act,  a  surprising  victory  for  the  Obama  administration  after  a  rocky  rollout  of  the  program  that  has  become  a  political  hot  potato  for  Democrats  and  a  rallying  cry  for  Republicans.President  Barack  Obama  said  on  Tuesday  that  7.1  million  people  had  signed  up  on  federal  or  state  exchanges  for  coverage  under  the  health  care  law  now  often  known  as  Obamacare.The  enrollment  period  began  anemically  in  October  with  a  faltering  federal  website  and  ended  with  a  crush  of  people  trying  to  beat  Monday's  deadline  to  get  coverage.  Not  everyone  who  has  selected  a  health  plan  has  paid  for  it  yet,  officials  said.Nevertheless,  Obama  claimed  victory  at  a  White  House  ceremony,  saying  the  program  approved  by  Congress  in  2010  --  with  no  Republican  support  and  vilified  relentlessly  by  the  GOP  as  government  overreach  --  has  been  a  force  for  good.He  said  it  wasn't  perfect,  acknowledging  the  early  difficulties  in  selecting  a  policy  on  HealthCare.gov,  and  he  predicted  more  hurdles  in  carrying  it  out.But  the  overall  goal  of  starting  to  narrow  the  gap  between  those  with  health  coverage  and  those  without  it  has  begun,  and  millions  of  Americans  are  embracing  it,  Obama  said."That's  what  the  (law)  is  all  about,  making  sure  all  of  us  and  all  our  fellow  citizens  can  count  on  the  security  of  health  care  when  we  get  sick,"  he  said,  noting  that  the  "law  is  doing  what  it's  supposed  to  do.  It's  working."The  numbersThe  nonpartisan  Congressional  Budget  Office  originally  projected  the  7  million  enrollment  target  for  the  October  through  March  period,  which  was  adopted  by  the  administration.Expectations  plummeted  throughout  the  fall  and  into  this  year  after  the  early  website  problems,  which  Obama  called  "several  lost  weeks."But  signs  of  a  pickup  began  in  late  January  and  continued  into  February  and  early  March  despite  a  fierce  campaign  by  Republicans  to  demonize  the  law  as  unworkable.Administration  officials  said  an  absolute  crush  of  people  pushed  the  program  --  Obama's  chief  domestic  accomplishment  --  over  the  finish  line  at  the  11th  hour.  More  than  4.8  million  visits  were  made  to  HealthCare.gov  on  Monday  alone.Officials  stressed  that  the  7.1  million  figure  represents  only  those  who  signed  up  for  coverage.  Those  who  came  in  late  and  encountered  technical  problems  have  until  mid-April  to  complete  the  process.  Private  insurers  are  providing  the  coverage.Health  of  Human  Services  Secretary  Kathleen  Sebelius  told  an  Oklahoma  TV  station  on  Monday  that  insurers  were  reporting  that  80%  to  90%  had  paid  so  far.The  law  also  includes  expanded  Medicaid  insurance  for  the  poor  in  many  states,  but  those  participants  are  not  part  of  the  sign-up  total.The  politicsRepublicans,  especially  in  the  House,  have  waged  a  nonstop  campaign  to  repeal  or  roll  back  the  Affordable  Care  Act,  saying  it  was  rammed  through  Congress  without  their  input  and  now  is  another  illustration  of  big  government  at  its  worst.They  have  made  it  a  rallying  cry  of  their  fall  campaign  to  expand  their  majority  in  the  House  and  reclaim  the  Senate.  It  has  energized  the  base,  and  the  issue  informs  the  commentary  of  potential  GOP  candidates  for  president  as  well.Michael  Steel,  a  spokesman  for  House  Speaker  John  Boehner,  an  Ohio  Republican,  said  in  a  statement  that  the  law  "continues  to  harm  the  American  people"  despite  Obama's  "victory  lap."  He  said  costs  are  not  going  down,  as  Obama  contends,  and  people  are  losing  insurance  plans  they  preferred  and  small  businesses  are  chafing  under  the  law's  requirements."That's  why  we  must  replace  this  fundamentally  flawed  law  with  patient-centered  solutions  that  will  actually  lower  health  care  costs  and  help  create  jobs,"  Steel  said.Democrats  on  the  stump,  especially  those  who  voted  for  it  and  now  find  themselves  in  tight  races,  have  recalibrated  their  position  with  Obama's  presidency  not  much  help  to  them  with  voters  overall  in  their  states.But  Obama  said  at  the  White  House  that  the  law  is  good  for  the  country,  regardless  of  politics,  and  that  the  numbers  show  Americans  want  it  and  that  it's  "here  to  stay.""I  don't  get  it.  Why  are  folks  working  so  hard  for  people  not  to  have  health  insurance?  Why  are  they  so  mad  about  the  idea  of  people  having  health  insurance?"  he  asked.What  people  thinkAmericans  are  divided  over  how  they  view  the  law.  Last  month,  46%  said  they  viewed  it  unfavorably,  down  4  points  since  January,  and  38%  said  they  viewed  it  favorably,  up  4  points  over  the  same  time  period,  according  to  a  Kaiser  Family  Foundation  poll.Those  who  held  unfavorable  views  cited  concerns  about  costs  (23%),  opposition  to  the  individual  mandate  (17%),  and  concerns  about  government  intrusion  (10%).Those  with  favorable  views  cited  expanded  access  to  health  care  and  health  insurance  (61%),  followed  by  the  perception  that  it  will  control  health  care  costs  and  make  it  more  affordable  (10%)  and  that  it  will  be  good  for  the  country  (7%).The  telephone  survey  of  1,504  adults  was  conducted  March  11  to  17  and  had  a  sampling  error  of  plus  or  minus  3  points.Professor  Uwe  Reinhardt,  a  health  economist  at  Princeton  University,  said  he  was  not  surprised  at  the  last-minute  rush  to  sign  up."I  think  the  prayer  of  the  conservatives  that  this  would  collapse  just  didn't  get  answered,"  he  told  CNN.  "It  fills  a  need."He  predicted  conservatives  would  chip  away  at  whatever  the  number  proves  to  be."It's  all  just,  some  people  hate  Obama  and  anything  he  does,"  he  said.The  detailsThe  administration  did  not  release  details  about  the  numbers,  including  the  number  of  younger  Americans  who  signed  up.  That  metric  is  crucial  for  making  the  program  work  economically  because  premiums  from  younger,  healthier  participants  are  needed  to  make  the  program  work  for  older  people  who  use  the  health  care  system  more.An  official  briefing  reporters  on  the  condition  of  anonymity  said  insurance  companies  were  confident  the  percentage  of  young  people  was  sufficient  for  the  insurance  marketplaces  to  function  properly.Obamacare's  primary  goal  is  to  reduce  the  ranks  of  the  45  million  uninsured.Until  now,  many  Americans  with  pre-existing  conditions  had  to  pay  sky-high  prices  for  insurance,  if  they  could  get  any  at  all.  Often,  insurers  branded  them  "uninsurable."The  surgeThe  administration  pulled  out  all  the  stops  in  the  final  weeks  of  the  enrollment  period  --  an  effort  one  official  equated  to  a  "get  out  the  vote"  campaign  before  an  election.Administration  officials  took  to  the  radio  airwaves  by  participating  in  400  interviews,  enlisted  celebrities  and  athletes  to  promote  the  law,  and  engaged  people  on  social  media.  And  Obama's  interview  on  the  online  comedycast  "Between  Two  Ferns"  resulted  in  the  so-called  Zach  Galifianakis  effect,  resulting  in  33  million  views  of  his  mock  interview  with  the  comedian.The  interview  with  Galifianakis,  along  with  a  promotional  push  from  Miami  Heat  forward  LeBron  James,  were  cited  by  administration  officials  as  two  of  the  most  effective  components  in  the  push  to  enroll  young  Americans  on  the  health  care  exchanges.  The  overall  effort,  the  White  House  said,  surpassed  their  expectations  in  terms  of  last-minute  sign-ups.By  the  numbers:  The  final  Obamacare  pushRepublicans  hit  a  nerve  when  it  comes  to  Obamacare5  things  the  polls  tell  us  about  ObamacareThis  article  was  based  on  reporting  by  Jim  Acosta  in  Washington  and  was  written  by  Kevin  Liptak  and  Tom  Watkins.

Last  year  on  Salon.com,  she  said  the  show  --  a  modern-day  Western  in  which  characters  are  shot  on  a  routine  basis  --  had  a  "flip"  approach  to  violence."I  was  bothered  by  how  casually  'Justified'  wracked  up  a  body  count,  even  though  I  know  'Justified's'  willingness  to  do  violence  in  funny  and  casual  ways  reflects  what's  great  and  different  about  the  series,"  she  said.Fox's  "The  Following"  was  criticized  by  some  last  season  for  dwelling  on  violence  (one  critic  called  it  "numb  to  violence"),  and  just  before  its  second  season  premiere  on  Sunday,  producers  said  they  were  pulling  back  on  the  violence."This  year  it's  a  different  show.  It's  a  different  story,"  creator  Kevin  Williamson  told  reporters  at  the  Television  Critics  Association  press  tour  last  week.Williamson  said  the  premiere  was  bloody,  but  now  that  he's  shot  11  episodes,  he  sees  it  as  less  violent.On  the  other  hand,  NBC's  reboot  of  "Hannibal"  has  earned  praise  for  its  portrayal  of  violence  --  in  which  a  cannibalistic  serial  killer  turns  his  victims  into  "works  of  art"  when  they're  not  on  the  menu.The  series'  main  character,  criminal  profiler  Will  Graham,  starts  to  lose  his  grip  on  reality  as  the  first  season  progresses,  becoming  more  and  more  traumatized  by  the  horrors  he  witnesses.  Quite  a  difference  from  the  TV  detective  who's  seen  it  all  and  rarely  flinches."He's  able  to  lose  himself  in  the  story  implied  by  the  evidence,  and  as  the  show's  progressed,  he's  become  more  and  more  worried  he  can't  get  back  out,"  said  TV  critic  Alison  Willmore  on  Indiewire.comOne  of  critics'  favorite  shows  of  2013,  "Top  of  the  Lake"  also  deals  in  extreme  violence."From  the  get-go  it  dedicates  itself  to  something  other  than  the  ordinary  Missing  White  Girl  story  that  these  sorts  of  shows  traffic  in,"  said  Michelle  Dean  in  The  Nation,  one  of  several  critics  to  note  that  the  show  is  also  a  commentary  on  rape  culture.Even  so,  Andy  Greenwald  pointed  out  on  Grantland.com  how  stressful  such  violence  can  be  for  viewers  in  an  essay  he  wrote  last  year  on  TV  violence."Some  of  this  carnage  is  artistic  and  some  of  it  is  gratuitous,  but  eventually  all  of  it  takes  a  toll,"  he  said.  "A  simple  evening  unwinding  on  the  couch  can  now  be  as  relaxing  as  an  autopsy;  the  spots  dancing  in  front  of  your  eyes  after  a  DVR  binge  are  stained  red  and  they're  spreading."</TEXT></DOC>

A  man  said  that  his  ex-wife,  35-year-old  Connie  Villa,  had  stabbed  him  but  that  he  had  managed  to  escape  and  was  driving  himself  to  a  hospital.When  officers  arrived  at  the  home,  they  found  Villa  with  stab  wounds,  holding  a  knife  to  her  chest.  They  managed  to  subdue  her  and  conducted  a  sweep  of  the  home.  Police  found  the  body  of  Aniarael  Macias,  Villa's  daughter,  in  the  bathroom."Although  an  autopsy  for  Aniarael  was  conducted  ...  the  results  of  which  did  not  identify  a  cause  of  death,  investigators  feel  the  evidence  found  at  the  scene  of  the  crime  along  with  interviews  and  medical  information  of  the  surviving  children,  give  our  Department  cause  to  believe  Connie  Villa  was  attempting  to  end  the  lives  of  all  of  her  children  and  her  ex-husband,  Adam  Villa,"  police  said  in  a  statement.Connie  Villa  faces  one  count  of  first  degree  murder  in  the  death  of  her  daughter.  She  is  also  being  charged  with  four  counts  of  attempted  murder  of  her  ex-husband  and  her  three  surviving  children,  ages  3,  5  and  8.In  an  interview,  she  admitted  she  tried  to  kill  her  children  by  forcing  them  to  ingest  prescription  narcotic  drugs,  police  said.  The  kids  had  trace  amounts  of  opiates  in  their  systems.Police  also  said  that  she  told  them  she  was  unsuccessful  in  forcing  her  oldest  daughter  to  ingest  the  drugs,  and  so  she  suffocated  Aniarael.Connie  Villa  reportedly  told  investigators  she  wanted  to  kill  her  children  and  ex-husband  because  she  did  not  want  him  to  have  custody  of  them.The  surviving  children  are  all  in  good  condition  and  were  placed  with  the  family  of  their  father,  Adam  Villa,  33.  He  is  in  stable  condition.Connie  Villa  was  released  Sunday  from  Maricopa  Medical  Center,  where  she  was  treated  for  what  investigators  believe  were  self-inflicted  stab  wounds.  She  was  arrested  the  same  day.According  to  Thomas  Anderson,  a  police  spokesman,  she  has  made  an  initial  appearance  in  court.  No  bond  was  given.Aniarael's  father  released  a  statement  asking  for  privacy  and  prayers."On  behalf  of  Michael  Macias,  Ania's  father,  Vera  Macias,  Ania's  grandmother  and  extended  family,  we  request  that  the  focus  of  this  tragedy  be  a  celebration  of  our  precious  Ania's  life.  She  was  a  gentle,  kind  and  beautiful  spirit  who  was  taken  from  us  much  too  soon.  Michael  and  his  family  are  heartbroken,"  it  read."We  are  writing  this  statement  in  hopes  that  the  media  and  other  outlets  will  allow  Michael  and  our  family  to  grieve  peacefully.  We  thank  everyone  for  the  outpouring  of  support  for  our  family.  We  appreciate  your  prayers  and  positive  thoughts.  We  pray  that  justice  will  be  served."</TEXT></DOC>

He  and  his  wife,  Courtney,  have  three  children,  including  4-year-old  Ellie,  who  has  Down  syndrome.  Bowerman  serves  on  the  board  of  the  National  Down  Syndrome  Congress.  His  essay  first  came  to  CNN  through  iReport.(CNN)  --  "You've  probably  seen  them  bagging  groceries,"  said  the  geneticist  attempting  to  explain  to  my  wife  and  me  that  our  1-day-old  daughter,  Ellie,  had  Down  syndrome  and  what  that  meant  for  her  future.Her  age  was  measured  only  in  hours  and  already,  expectations  for  Ellie's  potential  had  been  capped.Earlier,  we  were  sitting  in  a  recovery  room  holding  Ellie,  hosting  visitors,  e-mailing  pictures  along  with  requisite  weight  and  length  statistics  and  basking  in  the  afterglow  of  a  seamless  delivery  and  the  addition  of  a  beautiful,  healthy  daughter.  Then  Ellie  was  carted  off  to  the  "well  baby"  nursery  for  a  routine  examination  by  a  pediatrician.  My  wife  and  I  exhaled  and  exchanged  a  silent  smile.  A  brief  window  of  unmitigated  joy.We  did  not  know  our  calm  would  soon  break.As  we  would  learn,  Ellie  had  been  relocated  to  the  hospital's  neonatal  intensive  care  unit  because  of  a  heart  condition  suspected  by  the  pediatrician.  Her  prognosis  was  encouraging,  but  her  immediate  condition  was  tenuous  --  she  needed  supplemental  oxygen  and  medication  to  help  her  heart  and  lungs  work  properly.  And,  we  were  told,  a  geneticist  would  visit  us  to  discuss  an  additional  diagnosis.That  "additional  diagnosis"  was  hardly  the  afterthought  it  sounded  at  the  time.What  is  Down  syndrome?Down  syndrome  is  a  chromosomal  condition  caused  by  the  presence  of  a  third  copy  of  the  21st  chromosome.  It  is  the  most  common  chromosomal  condition,  affecting  more  than  400,000  Americans,  according  to  the  National  Down  Syndrome  Society.  Down  syndrome  is  associated  with  delayed  cognitive  ability  and  physical  growth.I  secretly  hoped  that  it  was  all  just  a  bad  dream.  But  instead  of  awaking  to  relief,  each  morning  was  greeted  with  pounding  guilt  for  wishing  that  Ellie  was  any  different  than  the  miracle  she  was  destined  to  be.Learn  more  about  Down  syndromeWe  coped  with  the  stress  of  her  heart  complication,  from  which  she  recovered  by  the  time  she  was  3  months  old,  and  we  began  to  accept  the  challenges  associated  with  Down  syndrome  that  lay  ahead.  But  the  visual  painted  by  the  geneticist  of  Ellie  as  an  adult,  wearing  a  name  tag  and  struggling  to  load  a  milk  carton  into  a  grocery  bag,  was  etched  in  our  minds.That  description  of  Ellie's  diminished  outlook,  delivered  as  a  foregone  conclusion,  was  difficult  to  accept.  Her  promise,  stolen.  It  was  an  injustice  that  took  time  to  fully  appreciate  and  gnaws  at  me  even  today.Ellie,  now  almost  5,  has  tackled  life  head  on,  making  friends  and  enjoying  childhood  while  enduring  endless  hours  of  physical,  occupational  and  speech  therapies  to  track  milestones  that  come  naturally  for  her  older  brother.  Ellie  has  braved  "two-a-days"  her  entire  life,  showing  up  on  time  and  ready  to  play.A  dad's  confession:  I  almost  left  my  disabled  daughterNever  have  I  been  more  proud  than  witnessing  Ellie  walk  for  the  first  time.  Knees  wobbly  and  body  trembling,  she  reached  to  the  outstretched  arms  there  to  support  her  while  shooting  a  look  that  signaled,  "I've  got  this."In  the  nearly  five  years  since  Ellie's  birth,  we've  experienced  vast  misunderstandings  about  the  potential  for  individuals  with  Down  syndrome.  Too  often,  people  look  at  Ellie  and  see  "disability."  They  see  "can't."  Even  highly  educated  clinicians  are  not  immune  to  misconception,  electing  to  chart  her  against  diminished  benchmarks  of  success  and  suggest  that  Ellie  should  settle  for  less  because  "that's  just  the  way  most  kids  with  'Downs'  are."A  long  list  of  possible  accomplishmentsAnd  yet,  we've  met  adults  with  Down  syndrome  who  can  check  boxes  for  successful  student,  accomplished  athlete,  productive  employee,  prom  king  or  queen  or  husband  or  wife.  And  while  scientific  breakthroughs  and  novel  therapies  should  further  advance  the  potential  of  Ellie's  generation  in  the  long-term,  her  daily  accomplishments  demand  that  we  discount  her  disadvantages  now.  They  demand  that  we  focus  on  her  abilities  and  expect  more  from  her.The  contradiction  between  Ellie's  accomplishments  and  the  geneticist's  projection  has  shaped  how  we  parent  all  three  of  our  children  (Ellie  now  also  has  a  younger  brother).  We  believe  that  children,  whether  they  have  Down  syndrome  or  not,  tend  to  perform  to  the  level  of  expectations  placed  upon  them.Expectations  are  often  misconstrued  as  setting  a  floor  on  performance.  Rather,  we  believe  expectations  serve  as  a  ceiling,  so  we've  learned  the  trick  is  to  set  high  expectations  balanced  with  reassurances  that  it  is  OK  to  fail.  And  the  only  true  failure  is  not  testing  the  boundaries  of  our  capabilities,  wherever  that  may  be.From  early  on,  we've  educated  Ellie's  brothers  about  Down  syndrome  and  what  that  means  for  her  --  "Ellie  can  do  everything  you  can  do;  it  just  may  take  her  longer  or  require  extra  help,  but  she'll  get  there  eventually."  Her  older  brother,  then  3,  retorted,  "Can  she  go  to  the  moon?"  "Yes,"  we  responded.  "Maybe  someday  she  can  go  to  the  moon."Of  course,  it's  important  to  recognize  challenges  and  provide  resources  to  address  them.  It's  true,  Ellie  needs  support,  and  lots  of  it.  But,  too  often,  people  focus  on  her  disadvantages  and  lose  sight  of  her  strengths.Even  school  administrators  try  to  classify  her,  listing  her  deficits,  setting  expectations  low  and  building  a  case  to  separate  her  from  her  typically  developing  peers  despite  numerous  studies  that  would  suggest  including  her  with  her  peers  is  mutually  beneficial.  But  pigeonholing  her  is  the  path  of  least  resistance.  Low  expectations  are,  after  all,  the  easiest  to  meet.Behind  that  cute  face  is  steely  gritThe  people  closest  to  Ellie  know  the  truth.  They  know  that  she  is  capable  of  much  more  than  what  most  expect  of  her.  That  they  shouldn't  be  fooled  by  her  infectious  smile,  capable  of  lighting  up  a  room,  because  behind  that  cute  facade  is  a  fiercely  determined  girl.Ellie  proves  that  every  Saturday  during  her  rock  climbing  class.  Sure,  she  is  intimidated  by  the  30-foot  walls,  struggles  with  the  climb  and  rarely  makes  it  all  the  way  to  the  top.  But  after  a  brief  break,  she'll  look  at  me  and  say,  "Again,  Daddy."And,  equally  importantly,  the  people  closest  to  Ellie  also  know  she  is  just  like  most  of  the  4-year-old  girls  in  her  preschool  class.  She  is  a  princess  at  heart  who  loves  to  host  play  dates  and  go  swimming.  She  enjoys  playing  catch  with  her  brothers  and  occasionally  catches  flak  for  teasing  them.  She's  more  alike  than  different.Recently,  we  asked  Ellie's  older  brother,  "Do  you  remember  what  it  means  for  Ellie  to  have  Down  syndrome?"  "Yes,"  he  answered.  "It  means  she  can  go  to  the  moon.  But  it's  not  fair,  why  does  Ellie  get  the  extra  'chrome?'"  He  was  referring  to  Ellie's  extra  copy  of  chromosome  21,  the  defining  characteristic  of  Down  syndrome.  If  only  our  society  could  look  through  that  same  lens  and  focus  on  abilities  rather  than  disabilities.A  prenatal  screen  pegged  the  odds  of  Ellie  having  Down  syndrome  at  less  than  one  in  3,000,  so  we  like  to  think  Ellie  has  defied  expectations  from  the  very  beginning.  And  we  trust  she  will  continue  to  do  so  from  here  on  out.  Though  we  hope,  one  day,  she  won't  have  to.  We  hope  one  day  our  expectations  of  her,  as  a  society,  are  more  limitless  than  they  are  limited.Ellie  has  taught  us  many  lessons  about  parental  love,  but  perhaps  the  most  important  of  which  is  not  letting  societal  expectations  dictate  all  that  a  child  can  be.As  we  enter  the  new  year,  we  tend  to  make  lots  of  resolutions  --  most  of  which  are  forgotten  long  before  February.  I'm  hoping  Ellie's  story  can  help  us  make  a  more  lasting  resolution,  together,  to  recalibrate  our  societal  expectations.Let's  recognize  the  disadvantage,  but  not  overcompensate  for  it  by  setting  the  bar  too  low.  Let's,  for  this  new  year  and  all  that  follow  after,  see  the  "can"  in  those  children  affected  by  Down  syndrome.  In  fact,  let's  do  that  for  all  our  children  --  extra  chromosome  or  not.And,  as  for  Ellie,  she'll  see  you  on  the  moon.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Bret  Bowerman.</TEXT></DOC>

Here's  a  recap  of  the  love  story:1998:  Kutcher,  then  20,  landed  a  role  in  "That  '70s  Show,"  the  Fox  comedy  about  a  high  school  kid  growing  up  in  Wisconsin  during  the  late  1970s.  Kutcher  was  the  ditzy  pretty  boy  Kelso,  and  Mila  Kunis,  at  15,  was  Kelso's  on-again,  off-again  girlfriend,  Jackie.At  the  time,  Kutcher  was  in  a  relationship  with  a  pre-"Mad  Men"  January  Jones,  but  working  together  definitely  helped  Kutcher  and  Kunis  bond.The  actress  told  People  magazine  in  2001  that  Kutcher,  a  former  model,  was  her  first  kiss."I  was  so  nervous  and  uncomfortable,"  Kunis  recalled.  "I  had  the  biggest  crush  on  him."Kutcher,  on  the  other  hand,  insisted  in  2001  that  he  was  the  nervous  wreck."She  acted  so  cool.  She  seemed  as  if  she'd  done  it  a  thousand  times,"  Kutcher  told  the  magazine.  "I  was  the  one  with  the  butterflies  in  my  stomach.  I  mean,  here's  this  little  girl,  and  I  have  to  kiss  her.  It  was  nerve-racking."2002:  With  "That  '70s  Show"  turning  both  Kutcher  and  Kunis  into  household  names,  their  private  lives  became  the  interest  of  the  public.  Kutcher  moved  on  from  Jones  and  began  dating  actresses  such  as  Ashley  Scott  and  the  late  Brittany  Murphy.Meanwhile,  Kunis  struck  up  a  relationship  with  Macaulay  Culkin  of  "Home  Alone"  fame  in  2002,  and  their  relationship  lasted  for  eight  years.2005:  By  now,  Kutcher  had  fallen  for  Demi  Moore,  nearly  16  years  his  senior,  and  they  wed  in  a  private  Kabbalah  ceremony  in  2005.2006:  As  "That  '70s  Show"  came  to  an  end,  Kutcher  and  Kunis  had  apparently  forged  an  enduring  friendship.  When  they  were  first  spotted  spending  a  lot  of  time  together  in  2012,  Kunis'  rep  brushed  off  the  romance  reports  by  saying  that  "they  have  been  friends  for  years."2011:  Kutcher  and  Kunis  moved  on  personally  and  professionally  after  "That  '70s  Show."  Kutcher  had  been  trying  his  hand  in  films  with  romantic  comedies  such  as  "What  Happens  In  Vegas"  (2008),  "Valentine's  Day"  (2010)  and  "No  Strings  Attached"  (2011).In  2011,  Moore  released  a  statement  she  was  ending  her  marriage  to  the  star.  "It  is  with  great  sadness  and  a  heavy  heart  that  I  have  decided  to  end  my  six-year  marriage  to  Ashton,"  she  said  at  the  time.  "As  a  woman,  a  mother  and  a  wife  there  are  certain  values  and  vows  that  I  hold  sacred,  and  it  is  in  this  spirit  that  I  have  chosen  to  move  forward  with  my  life."April  2012:  The  April  following  his  separation  from  Moore,  Kutcher  and  Kunis  began  spending  a  large  amount  of  time  together.  They  were  seen  dining  out  and  going  furniture  shopping,  and  they  reportedly  went  on  a  weekend  trip.A  "Kutcher  source"  wasn't  surprised  by  the  turn  of  events,  telling  People  magazine  that  while  nothing  happened  during  "That  '70s  Show,"  Kutcher  "was  always  talking  about  how  beautiful  she  is.  But  she  was  with  Macaulay  (Culkin)  for  a  lot  of  that  time  and  also  just  generally  gave  off  a  not  interested  vibe."Yet  when  "Extra"  asked  Kunis  what  was  going  on  with  Kutcher,  the  actress  called  the  dating  rumors  "absurd"  and  said,  "A  friend  is  a  friend."September  2012:  At  some  point,  these  "friends"  found  something  more.  While  Kunis  insisted  she  was  having  a  hard  time  finding  a  date  in  July  2012,  paparazzi  photos  told  a  different  story.  She  was  seen  kissing  Kutcher  in  New  York's  Central  Park  that  September,  a  month  after  the  two  were  rumored  to  have  taken  a  vacation  to  Bali  and  two  months  after  they  seemed  very  into  each  other  at  a  wrap  party  for  his  Steve  Jobs  biopic,  "Jobs."December  2012:  As  their  relationship  became  more  apparent,  Kunis  and  Kutcher  headed  on  a  trip  to  his  hometown  in  Iowa  for  the  holidays.February  2013:  While  on  Ellen  DeGeneres'  talk  show,  Kunis  was  visibly  flustered  when  the  host  grilled  her  about  her  relationship  with  Kutcher."Have  you  talked  to  him  at  all?  When  was  the  last  time  you  talked  to  him?"  DeGeneres  asked.Kunis,  failing  to  keep  a  straight  face,  replied,  "Um,  you  know,  it's  been,  give  or  take,  a  couple  minutes."March  2013:  Last  spring,  Kutcher  explained  his  reluctance  to  talk  about  what  had  become  a  pretty  obvious  love  affair.  "You  know,  I've  learned  the  hard  way  how  valuable  privacy  is,"  he  told  Elle  magazine  in  its  March  2013  issue.  "And  I've  learned  that  there  are  a  lot  of  things  in  your  life  that  really  benefit  from  being  private.  And  relationships  are  one  of  them.  And  I  am  going  to  do  everything  in  my  power  to  have  this  relationship  be  private."November:  Following  rumors  that  Kutcher  and  Kunis  were  engaged  in  September  --  which  turned  out  not  to  be  true  --  Kutcher  became  officially  single  again.  Two  years  after  Moore  initially  announced  their  marriage  had  ended,  Kutcher's  attorney  filed  a  document  in  court  that  made  their  final  divorce  settlement  official.January  and  February:  As  cameras  kept  catching  Kutcher  and  Kunis  in  the  act  --  they  were  seen  kissing  courtside  at  a  Los  Angeles  Lakers  game  --  Kunis  began  to  open  up  a  bit  more  about  their  bond.

Special  forces  who  boarded  the  plane  took  him  into  custody  "in  a  swift  operation"  without  finding  a  "bomb  on  him,"  Gov.  Huseyin  Avni  Mutlu  later  told  reporters."The  operation  is  complete,"  the  governor  said.Mutlu  said  that  the  suspect  --  who  never  made  it  into  the  cockpit  and  at  one  point  apparently  thought  the  aircraft  was  destined  for  Sochi  --  "didn't  seem  to  have  consumed  alcohol,  (but)  he  may  have  used  some  other  substances."  He'd  brought  a  carry-on  bag  with  personal  electronics  and  other  items  onto  the  Pegasus  plane,  according  to  the  governor.The  incident  came  at  a  tense  time  given  the  various  threats  surrounding  the  Winter  Games,  which  kicked  off  in  earnest  Friday  night  with  its  opening  ceremony.Russian  security  forces  have  cracked  down  in  recent  weeks  on  suspected  militants  in  the  restive  North  Caucasus  republic  of  Dagestan  --  which  is  located  on  the  other  side  of  the  Caucasus  Mountains  from  Sochi  --  and  elsewhere  in  recent  weeks  after  twin  suicide  bombings  in  the  city  of  Volgograd  in  December.There  have  also  been  concerns  specifically  about  explosives-laden  airlines.  U.S.  Rep.  Michael  McCaul  said  Wednesday  night  that  the  his  nation's  Department  of  Homeland  Security  issued  a  bulletin  to  airlines  flying  into  Russia  warning  that  explosive  materials  could  be  concealed  in  toothpaste  or  cosmetic  tubes.Official:  Suspect  is  UkrainianThe  flight  started  in  Kharkov  in  Ukraine,  and  was  headed  to  Istanbul,  according  to  the  Transportation  Ministry.While  it  was  in  air,  "one  of  the  passengers  said  that  there  was  a  bomb  on  board  and  asked  the  plane  to  not  land  in  Sabiha  Gokcen  but  rather  to  land  in  Sochi,"  Transportation  Ministry  official  Habip  Soluk  said  on  CNNTurk.The  man  said  the  bomb  was  in  the  baggage  hold,  a  Transportation  Ministry  official  said.The  aircraft  ended  up  touching  down  at  the  Turkish  airport  at  at  6:04  p.m.,  according  to  Anadolu,  at  which  point  it  was  moved  to  a  safe  zone  on  the  tarmac.Cihan  News  Agency  of  Turkey  published  a  photograph  it  claimed  came  from  inside  the  plane  showing  a  man  standing  in  a  number  11  sports  jersey  with  empty  seats  around  him  and  two  people  in  uniform.Turkish  officials  have  not  confirmed  that  this  photograph  is  from  inside  the  Pegasus  airliner  or  that  the  man  at  the  center  of  it  is  the  alleged  hijacker.The  Ukrainian  foreign  ministry  issued  a  statement  identifying  the  suspect  as  one  of  its  citizens,  something  that  Soluk  also  said  was  the  case.  The  Ukrainian  ministry  said  no  explosives  or  guns  were  found  aboard  the  plane  and  that  the  suspect  "voluntarily  turned  himself  into  police."Mutlu,  Istanbul's  governor,  offered  a  different  take  on  how  the  alleged  hijacker  was  detained."We  had  to  use  force  because  we  were  trying  to  persuade  him  and  he  wasn't  persuaded,"  said  Mutlu,  adding  Turkish  authorities  did  not  use  guns  and  that  the  suspect  suffered  "a  light  injury."The  suspect  never  said  anything  about  Circassians  --  the  residents  in  the  volatile  region  around  the  North  Caucasus  mountains  --  or  having  lived  in  the  region,  according  to  the  governor.CNN's  Gul  Tuysuz  reported  from  Turkey,  and  Michael  Martinez  reported  and  wrote  from  Los  Angeles.

So  do  the  setbacks  and  frustrations.Monday's  search  ended  without  finding  anything  significant,  Australian  officials  said.  Four  orange  objects  spotted  by  search  aircraft  and  earlier  described  as  promising  turned  out  be  nothing  more  than  old  fishing  gear,  they  said.Underscoring  the  difficulty  of  the  search,  U.S.  Navy  officials  loaded  underwater  locating  gear  aboard  an  Australian  naval  support  vessel  and  set  out  to  sea  Monday  evening,  but  won't  be  able  to  make  use  of  the  equipment  until  searchers  narrow  the  search  zone.U.S.  Navy  Cmdr.  William  Marks  told  CNN's  "State  of  the  Union"  that  his  team  needs  a  conclusive  piece  of  debris  to  narrow  down  the  search  area  before  deploying  the  equipment."We  have  to  be  careful  not  to  send  it  in  the  wrong  place,"  he  said.  "But  we  also  wanted  to  get  it  out  there  as  close  as  we  can  to  what  we  believe  is  the  right  place."The  gear  includes  a  pinger  locator  that's  towed  behind  a  ship  and  scans  for  the  sound  of  the  locator  beacon  attached  to  the  plane's  flight  data  recorder.  Also  on  board  is  a  remotely  operated  submersible  that  can  look  for  wreckage  on  the  ocean  floor.It  will  take  the  ship,  the  Ocean  Shield,  three  days  just  to  get  to  the  search  zone,  leaving  precious  little  time  to  locate  the  plane's  flight  data  recorders  before  the  batteries  on  its  locator  beacon  run  out.  The  batteries  are  designed  to  last  30  days;  the  plane  has  been  missing  23  days.Under  favorable  sea  conditions,  the  pingers  can  be  heard  2  nautical  miles  away.  But  high  seas,  background  noise,  wreckage  or  silt  can  all  make  pingers  harder  to  detect.In  this  case,  searchers  barely  know  where  to  look  at  all."We  are  searching  a  vast  area  of  ocean,  and  we  are  working  on  quite  limited  information,"  Australian  Prime  Minister  Tony  Abbott  told  reporters  Monday.  "Nevertheless,  the  best  brains  in  the  world  are  applying  themselves  to  this  task.  ...  If  this  mystery  is  solvable,  we  will  solve  it."And  he  vowed  to  keep  looking."The  intensity  of  our  search  and  the  magnitude  of  our  operations  is  increasing,  not  decreasing,"  he  said.Ten  aircraft  and  11  ships  scouted  more  than  98,000  square  miles  (254,000  square  kilometers)  of  Indian  Ocean  on  Monday  looking  for  the  missing  plane,  Malaysia's  acting  Transportation  Minister  Hishammuddin  Hussein  said  Monday.Flight  370  vanished  March  8  while  flying  from  Kuala  Lumpur  to  Beijing.A  new  Australian  Joint  Agency  Coordination  Center  is  being  formed  to  synchronize  search  efforts  among  Australian  agencies  and  other  countries  taking  part  in  the  search,  Hishammuddin  said.And  Malaysia  will  ask  the  United  States  about  the  possibility  of  deploying  more  military  assets,  he  said.U.S.  Secretary  of  Defense  Chuck  Hagel  said  Monday  that  he  will  consider  any  additional  requests  from  Hishammuddin."I  don't  know  what  additional  requests  he  will  make  of  me,"  he  said.  "I  certainly  will  listen  carefully  to  whatever  those  are.  ...  We're  providing  everything  that  we  can  provide,  as  are  other  countries."New  details  on  handoffOn  Monday,  Malaysia's  Transport  Ministry  said  the  final  voice  transmission  from  the  cockpit  of  Flight  370  was  "Good  night  Malaysian  three  seven  zero."That's  a  departure  from  earlier  language  in  which  Malaysian  authorities  said  the  final  transmission  was  "All  right,  goodnight."The  new  language  is  routine  and  is  not  a  sign  of  anything  untoward  occurring  aboard  the  flight,  said  CNN  aviation  analyst  Mary  Schiavo.But  she  said  it  does  raise  questions  about  how  Malaysian  officials  have  handled  the  investigation."Well,  it  speaks  to  credibility  issues,  unfortunately,"  she  said.Get  up  to  speedRelatives'  demandsFamily  members  of  people  on  board  Flight  370  have  accused  Malaysian  officials  of  giving  them  confusing,  conflicting  information  since  the  plane  vanished  more  than  three  weeks  ago.On  Monday,  dozens  of  Chinese  family  members  visited  a  Kuala  Lumpur  temple.  They  chanted,  lit  candles  and  meditated."Chinese  are  kindhearted  people,"  said  Jiang  Hui,  the  families'  designated  representative.  "But  we  can  clearly  distinguish  between  the  good  and  evil.  We  will  never  forgive  for  covering  the  truth  from  us  and  the  criminal  who  delayed  the  rescue  mission."Jiang  asked  Malaysia  to  apologize  for  announcing  March  24  that  the  plane  had  crashed,  despite  the  lack  of  any  "direct  evidence."At  the  daily  press  briefing,  Hishammuddin  responded,  saying  Malaysian  Prime  Minister  Najib  Razak  had  not  used  the  word  "crash"  or  mentioned  a  lack  of  survivors  in  his  announcement  that  the  plane's  flight  had  "ended"  in  the  southern  Indian  Ocean.And,  he  said,  Malaysian  authorities  were  not  hiding  anything  by  declining  to  release  some  details  of  the  missing  flight.  Some  details  are  part  of  ongoing  investigations  into  what  happened  to  the  plane,  he  said."We  are  not  hiding  anything.  We  are  just  following  the  procedure  that  is  being  set."  he  said.He  described  a  meeting  Saturday  between  Malaysian  authorities  and  Flight  370  relatives  as  "the  most  difficult  meeting  I've  ever  attended.""The  families  are  heartbroken.  For  many,  the  strain  of  the  past  few  weeks  has  been  unbearable,"  he  said.He  said  Malaysia  will  hold  a  high-level  briefing  for  families  where  experts  will  explain  some  of  the  data  and  methodology  used  to  guide  the  search.He  also  said  authorities  have  discussed  with  the  families  what  happens  if  they  are  unable  to  find  debris  from  the  missing  plane.  But  he  declined  to  discuss  it  with  reporters  Monday,  saying  "to  be  fair  to  the  families,  that  is  something  I  would  not  want  to  share  with  the  public  at  the  moment."Beijing  has  also  publicly  slammed  Malaysia's  efforts  to  find  the  Boeing  777.  Of  the  239  people  aboard  the  jetliner,  154  were  Chinese.  But  Malaysia  says  it's  done  its  best  with  what  it  has."History  will  judge  us  as  a  country  that  has  been  very  responsible,"  Hishammuddin  said.Flight  attendant's  husband  has  no  answers  for  childrenCNN's  Barbara  Starr,  Dana  Ford,  Mitra  Mobasherat,  Kyung  Lah,  Yuli  Yang  and  Paula  Hancocks  contributed  to  this  report.

It's  a  digital  calling  card,  a  way  to  sum  up  our  very  essence  within  Twitter's  160-character  limit  and,  presumably,  tell  people  why  they  might  want  to  follow  us.So  how  did  there  end  up  being  so  many  self-proclaimed  ninjas,  mavens,  rock  stars,  gurus  and  experts  on  the  site?Those  terms,  often  delivered  in  a  series  of  short,  punchy  sentences,  have  become  copycat  cliches  in  the  Twitter  age.  And  as  Josh  Schultz  sees  it,  they're  worthy  of  parody."I'd  noticed  that  a  lot  of  Twitter  bios  tended  to  be  pretty  samey,"  said  Schultz,  a  Web  developer  and  creator  of  the  Twitter  Bio  Generator.  "When  that  occurred  to  me,  I  crawled  the  bios  of  all  my  Twitter  acquaintances  and  saw  that  ...  yep  ...  some  patterns  were  used  a  lot."His  generator  is  a  jokey  tool  that  mashes  together  a  bunch  of  overused  words  and  phrases,  creating  bios  that  will  look  impressively  familiar  to  most  Twitter  users:  "Professional  zombie  geek."  "Unapologetic  Internet  maven."  "Social  media  evangelist."  "Coffee  guru."It's  no  accident  that  a  lot  of  the  phrases  come  off  as  blatantly  self-promotional."This  was  early  Twitter  days,  when  it  seemed  like  half  the  folks  using  the  service  were  self-described  'social  media  experts,'  "  Schultz  said.  "Plenty  of  the  rest  of  us  were  of  the  opinion  that  those  folks  might  benefit  from  taking  themselves  a  bit  less  seriously.  So  if  the  generator  came  across  as  poking  a  little  fun  at  them,  I'd  be  OK  with  that."Schultz  isn't  the  only  one  who  thought  that  overdone  bio  style  needed  a  little  skewering.  This  month,  digital  marketing  firm  Digiday  worked  up  a  similar,  if  significantly  more  profane,  version  called  "What  the  F---  is  my  Twitter  Bio?".  (Fair  warning:  Lots  of  profanity.  As  if  the  name  didn't  give  that  away.)"The  idea  was  meant  to  be  a  way  for  people  to  realize  the  ridiculous  lengths  others  --  and,  alas,  themselves  --  go  to  to  craft  their  Twitter  bio  as  neatly  and  perfectly  as  a  Wes  Andersen  movie,"  Digiday  staffer  Jack  Marshall  said  in  a  blog  post.Digiday's  combination  of  about  300  words  and  phrases  renders  bios  largely  similar  to  Schultz's  generator:  "Bluetooth  pundit."  "Tech  warlock."  "Interwebz  scholar."  Some  tweak  another  bio  that's  become  commonplace:  A  series  of  factual  information  followed  by  a  final  zinger  to  show  that  you're  a  serious  person  --  just  not  *that*  serious.If  users  don't  like  the  result,  they  can  click  a  reliably  foul-mouthed  link  to  try  again.Some  of  the  results  also  play  on  Twitter  users'  seemingly  limitless  fondness  for  bacon  and  booze  in  their  bios.So,  if  being  a  bacon  buff  or  beer  trailblazer  won't  necessarily  make  for  a  great  bio,  what  will?  Schultz  says  just  be  yourself."It's  an  honest  reflection  of  what  you're  going  to  be  tweeting  about,"  he  said.  "For  some  people,  that  will  be  the  sort  of  straightforward  list  thing  the  Twitter  Bio  Generator  pokes  a  little  fun  at.  For  others,  it'll  be  something  more  abstract  or  poetic.  Maybe  they're  more  abstract  or  poetic  people,  harder  to  pin  down."Writing  for  Mashable,  a  CNN  content  partner,  Amy-Mae  Elliott  offered  a  few  suggestions  of  her  own.--  Your  bio  is  searchable,  so  make  sure  it  includes  keywords  about  what  you  tweet  about.--  Avoid  those  generator-style  cliches.--  Double-check  your  spelling  and  grammar.--  Look  at  other  bios  and  imitate  the  style  of  the  ones  you  like."Most  importantly,"  she  wrote,  "use  your  bio  to  let  people  know  what  you're  going  to  bring  to  their  Twitter  streams  --  how  following  you  is  going  to  enrich  their  Twitter  experience."Of  course,  as  with  many  things,  if  you're  famous  some  rules  don't  apply  to  you.Does  Shaquille  O'Neal  really  need  to  let  you  know  he  was  a  basketball  player?  And  if  you're  considering  following  Conan  O'Brien  or  Jimmy  Fallon,  there's  a  pretty  good  chance  you  already  knew  they  were  talk  show  hosts.The  creative  freedom  in  being  famous  has  led  to  some  of  our  favorite  bios:Oscar-winning  actor  Kevin  Spacey:  "Former  shoe  salesman  now  making  a  go  at  film  and  theater.  Wish  me  luck...  "Actress  Ellen  Page:  "I  am  a  tiny  Canadian."Comedian  Will  Arnett:  "Jason  Bateman's  sponsor"Jason  Bateman:  "Friend  of  Will  Arnett's."The  Twitter  bios  of  some  celebs,  like  Oprah  and  Kanye  West,  go  one  step  further  --  they're  blank.  She's  Oprah!  What  more  can  you  say?And  then  there's  Hillary  Clinton.  The  former  first  lady,  U.S.  senator  and  secretary  of  state  joined  Twitter  last  year  and  promptly  wrote  what's  been  called  the  "best  bio  of  all  time"  --  a  combination  of  informative  and  playful.It  reads:  "Wife,  mom,  lawyer,  women  &  kids  advocate,  FLOAR,  FLOTUS,  US  Senator,  SecState,  author,  dog  owner,  hair  icon,  pantsuit  aficionado,  glass  ceiling  cracker,  TBD..."</TEXT></DOC>

This  recipe  offers  a  healthy  twist  on  the  original  with  easy,  do-it-yourself  chips,  mashed  avocados,  veggies  and  my  aforementioned  new  love,  Greek  yogurt  (mixed  with  taco  seasoning  for  flavor).Trade  up  your  standard  refried  beans  for  nutritionally  awesome  black  beans  and  you've  got  a  real  winner  on  your  plate.Loaded  nachos  from  Living  Well  KitchenLet's  face  facts  here.  Most  of  the  time,  melted  cheese  is  what  turns  nachos  into  a  cholesterol-fest.So  instead  of  saturating  your  tortilla  chips  with  copious  amounts  of  the  beloved  dairy  product,  choose  alternate  toppings  for  a  leaner,  more  flavorful  approach.This  super-yummy  (not  to  mention  attractive)  option  uses  quality  ingredients  like  lean  ground  beef  or  turkey,  roma  tomatoes,  onions,  bell  peppers,  jalapeños  and  salsa  to  create  an  appetizer  that'll  have  your  guests  doing  touchdown-style  dances  of  their  own.Of  course,  if  you  really  love  cheesy  nachos,  you  can  always  sparingly  sprinkle  the  dish  with  a  low-fat  variety.upwave:  5  health  benefits  of  cheeseChipotle  chicken  sweet  potato  skins  from  Half  Baked  HarvestA  Super  Bowl  party  without  potato  skins  is  pretty  much  a  sacrilege.  This  year,  trade  regular  potatoes  for  brightly  colored  sweet  potatoes!Although  regular  spuds  certainly  have  their  health  benefits,  sweet  potatoes  are  lower  in  calories,  higher  in  fiber  and  vitamin  C  and  are  practically  bursting  with  vitamin  A.Mixed  with  zesty  chipotle  chicken,  sharp  low-fat  cheddar  cheese  and  various  seasonings,  this  fiber-rich  dish  will  surely  become  an  often-requested  specialty.Black  bean  &  quinoa  chili  from  Fit  Foodie  FindsChili  is  a  staple  in  many  homes  during  the  frosty  winter  months,  and  its  versatile  nature  makes  it  a  ton  of  fun  to  experiment  with.This  recipe  incorporates  the  current  darling  of  the  foodie  world  --  nutritional  superstar  quinoa  --  along  with  many  traditional  chili  ingredients,  such  as  black  beans,  diced  tomatoes  and  various  herbs  and  spices.If  you're  looking  for  a  leaner,  meat-free  version  of  this  piping-hot  favorite,  take  this  recipe  for  a  spin!  Although  to  chili  purists  it  may  seem  like  a  Hail  Mary  pass,  it'll  wind  up  being  a  tight  spiral  right  into  the  end  zone  of  yumminess  for  everyone.upwave:  Why  quinoa  is  good  for  youBuffalo  chicken  wings  from  Snack  GirlBuffalo  chicken  wings  are  almost  as  delicious  as  they  are  messy.This  fan  favorite  is  usually  deep  fried,  though,  making  the  delicacy  chock-full  of  fat  and  calories  --  about  479  for  only  three  ounces!  This  fitter  option  from  Snack  Girl  is  only  240  calories  for  four  or  five  wings,  which  is  plenty  to  satisfy  your  craving  without  killing  your  diet.The  nutritional  difference  comes  via  the  preparation:  These  wings  are  boiled  and  baked  rather  than  fried.

Millions  of  them.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Washington  (CNN)  --  The  Obama  administration's  got  some  good  news  on  Obamacare.Scratch  that.  It  was  arguably  great  news.Despite  the  jumbo  embarrassment  of  a  flawed  rollout,  a  website  that  barely  worked  for  more  than  a  month,  and  hellfire  and  brimstone  headlines  that  impacted  public  perceptions  of  the  law,  it  turns  out  people  are  signing  up.  Millions  of  them.According  to  data  released  Wednesday,  more  than  1  million  people  signed  up  for  private  health  insurance  under  the  Obamacare  exchanges  during  January.  That  raised  the  open  enrollment  total  during  the  first  four  months  to  3.3  million.Obamacare  sign-ups  jump  to  3.3  millionWith  six  weeks  left  for  people  to  enroll  under  current  deadlines,  there  is  an  outside  chance  the  Obama  administration  could  hit  its  goal  of  7  million  by  the  end  of  March.Seems  like  a  big  deal,  right?You  wouldn't  know  it  from  the  way  the  White  House  rolled  out  the  news,  quietly  on  a  media  conference  call  with  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services.There  was  no  TV-friendly  event  featuring  President  Barack  Obama.  Instead,  he  appeared  in  public  on  Wednesday  only  to  sign  an  executive  order  raising  the  minimum  wage  for  the  employees  of  contractors  entering  into  new  agreements  with  the  federal  government.Read  the  new  reportSure,  that's  a  big  symbolic  move.  But  its  impact  is  fractional  compared  to  those  affected  by  a  fully  functioning  health  law.Plus,  the  ratio  of  sign  ups  18  to  34  ticked  up  in  the  last  reporting  month  to  25%  of  the  total.  And  they're  buying  mid-range  plans  that  are  more  generous  but  cost  more  with  higher  monthly  premiums.It's  not  the  40%  young  people  ratio  that  government  economists  have  said  will  be  needed  to  make  the  program  financially  workable.But  the  administration's  argument  has  always  been  younger  enrollees  --  less  interested  in  the  law  and  less  in  need  of  benefits  --  would  generally  be  the  last  to  sign  up.New  system  system  to  measure  payments  for  Obamacare  coverageSo  why  then,  as  National  Review  points  out,  is  the  Political  Action  Committee  controlled  by  House  Minority  Leader  Nancy  Pelosi  running  TV  ads  for  Democratic  Rep.  Joe  Garcia  in  Florida  that  don't  brag  about  how  the  law  is  turning  around?  Instead,  Garcia  is  promising  to  stand  up  to  insurance  companies  to  fix  it.Obama,  in  his  State  of  the  Union  address  in  January,  implored  Republicans  to  work  with  Democrats  on  the  law  instead  of  continuing  the  years  long  political  game  of  finding  ways  to  vote  against  it.  A  strategy  that  Democrats  quickly  found  ways  to  squelch  in  the  Senate."Let's  not  have  another  40-something  votes  to  repeal  a  law  that's  already  helping  millions  of  Americans,"  Obama  said.  "The  first  40  were  plenty."Republicans,  even  as  they  clearly  move  away  from  a  strategy  of  trying  to  repeal  the  law,  will  still  use  it  as  a  political  bludgeon  against  Democrats  in  the  run  up  to  midterm  elections.It  remains  an  issue  that  is  important  to  the  GOP  base.  Democrats,  for  their  part,  will  try  to  frame  Republican  assaults  on  the  law  as  attempts  to  take  something  tangible  --  cancer  treatment,  say,  or  health  insurance  --  away  from  people.Talking  to  Democratic  strategists,  you  won't  hear  any  of  them  telling  candidates  to  run  on  Obamacare  no  matter  how  good  the  numbers  look  and  no  matter  if  it  starts  to  appear  that  the  law  is  working.And  you  can't  blame  them.  For  all  the  talk  of  Obamacare  as  Obama's  signature  --  literally,  his  name  is  in  the  colloquial  title  --  achievement,  the  law  dominated  the  political  conversation  for  years.The  backlash  cost  Democrats  their  majority  in  the  House.  Public  support,  never  strong,  is  still  below  50%  for  the  Affordable  Care  Act  even  as  millions  sign  up  for  coverage.New  delay  ensures  Obamacare  to  be  issue  in  2014,  2016  electionsThat's  why  even  as  portions  of  the  law  seem  ready  to  finally,  potentially,  work,  Democrats  seem  keen  to  move  on  even  as  they  try  not  to  run  away  from  the  politics  of  Obamacare."There's  a  disconnect  between  talking  about  numbers  in  the  exchanges  and  how  this  law  affects  people  in  their  every  day  lives,"  said  Matt  Canter,  spokesman  for  the  Democratic  Senate  Campaign  Committee."Democratic  candidates  are  going  to  be  talking  about  preexisting  conditions,  consumer  protections,  protecting  Medicare  benefits.  These  are  health  care  issues  that  relate  to  people  in  (their)  every  day  lives  and  Republicans  are  on  the  wrong  side  of  these  issues,"  he  said.</TEXT></DOC>

They  were  the  voices  of  proud  newsmen.  They  were  the  voices  of  crass  corporate  executives,  conniving  revolutionaries,  wounded  wives  and,  above  all,  a  "mad  prophet  of  the  airwaves."He  put  them  together  and  came  up  with  "Network."The  1976  film,  starring  Peter  Finch  as  disintegrating  news  anchor  Howard  Beale,  William  Holden  as  veteran  news  exec  Max  Schumacher,  Faye  Dunaway  as  programmer  Diana  Christensen  and  Robert  Duvall  as  network  honcho  Frank  Hackett,  was  a  scathing  satire  on  news  and  television  in  a  country  that  the  mercurial  Chayefsky  saw  in  rapid  decline.And  why  not?  As  Beale  ranted  in  the  film's  most  famous  speech,  "Everybody's  out  of  work  or  scared  of  losing  their  job.  The  dollar  buys  a  nickel's  worth.  Banks  are  going  bust.  Shopkeepers  keep  a  gun  under  the  counter.  Punks  are  running  wild  in  the  street  and  there's  nobody  anywhere  who  seems  to  know  what  to  do,  and  there's  no  end  to  it."He  concluded  by  imploring  his  audience  to  yell  some  of  the  most  famous  words  in  movie  history:  "I'm  as  mad  as  hell,  and  I'm  not  gonna  take  this  anymore!"In  his  new  book,  "Mad  as  Hell,"  author  and  New  York  Times  reporter  Dave  Itzkoff  chronicles  the  making  of  the  Sidney  Lumet-directed  film  --  which  won  Oscars  for  Finch,  Dunaway,  supporting  actress  Beatrice  Straight  and  Chayefsky  --  and  how  it  proved  eerily  prescient  in  forecasting  our  modern  age  of  infotainment,  reality  shows,  corporate  takeovers  and  the  commodification  of  anger.As  writer  Aaron  Sorkin  --  who  has  channeled  Chayefsky  in  characters  from  his  series  "Studio  60  on  the  Sunset  Strip"  and  "The  Newsroom"  --  put  it  to  Itzkoff,  "You  wish  Chayefsky  could  come  back  to  life  long  enough  to  write  'The  Internet.'  "Itzkoff  spoke  to  CNN  about  Chayefsky's  personality,  what  journalists  thought  of  the  film  and  its  impact  on  pop  culture.  The  following  is  an  edited  and  condensed  version  of  the  interview.CNN:  What  did  you  think  of  the  film  before  doing  the  book?Dave  Itzkoff:  I  appreciated  the  film,  (but)  I've  learned  so  much  more  about  it  over  the  last  three  years  and  have  come  to  appreciate  it  in  so  many  more  ways.  But  also,  that  period  of  filmmaking  history  is  especially  fascinating  to  me.  You  still  have  a  lot  of  tremendously  talented  people  working  within  the  Hollywood  system  to  create  these  really  subversive  films,  films  that  have  strong  messages  and  polarizing  messages.  To  be  able  to  tell  a  tale  of  a  movie  from  that  period,  and  a  story  that  would  touch  on  both  the  history  of  TV,  the  history  of  film  and  the  present  history  of  media,  all  of  that  was  irresistible  for  me.CNN:  It's  surprising  that  Chayefsky,  coming  off  an  Oscar  for  (1971's)  "The  Hospital,"  had  nothing  lined  up,  no  clamor  for  his  services.  Was  it  because  he  was  a  difficult  man?Itzkoff:  I  don't  think  he  had  burnt  all  of  his  bridges.  But  Chayefsky  did  not  work  with  an  agent  or  a  manager,  he  just  had  a  lawyer  at  that  point,  so  he  didn't  have  the  kind  of  mechanism  of  people  who  would  set  up  your  next  five  gigs  so  you  have  your  next  10  years  planned  out.Also,  he  was  very  particular  about  what  he  would  take  on,  and  was  really  only  looking  for  situations  where  he  could  exercise  an  unprecedented  degree  of  control.  And  once  you  stipulate  that,  you're  really  narrowing  what's  available  to  you.CNN:  "Network"  is  often  called  a  Paddy  Chayefsky  film  but  Sidney  Lumet  seems  to  have  put  his  stamp  on  it.Itzkoff:  Absolutely.  He  entered  into  this  knowing  he  was  going  to  be  a  collaborator,  if  not  a  subordinate,  in  a  way  a  director  often  is  not.By  all  accounts,  Lumet  was  an  easygoing  and  hospitable  guy  and  really  did  foster  a  spirit  of  collaboration  on  his  movies.  The  dynamism  of  all  the  in-studio  scenes  --  the  Howard  Beale  on-camera  scene  --  that's  all  Lumet.  Some  of  the  scenes  are  more  static,  more  a  function  of  the  screenplay  itself  --  it's  hard  to  be  truly  inventive  when  you're  basically  filming  a  person  standing  and  speaking.  But  he  still  finds  ways.CNN:  Chayefsky  was  also  very  funny  and  charming.  How  much  was  he  driven  by  his  anger?Itzkoff:  Among  people  he  worked  with,  (he  was)  very  congenial  and  very  funny,  liked  to  crack  jokes.  But  there  was  that  side  that  wanted  to  be  in  control  of  things  and  the  side  that  was  genuinely  pessimistic  about  the  fate  of  humanity  and  the  direction  the  country  was  going.  There  were  TV  appearances  he  would  do,  just  kind  of  draining  the  life  out  of  conversation.If  you  look  across  the  breadth  of  writing  he  did,  going  all  the  way  back  to  the  TV  plays  like  "Marty,"  you  see  this  recurrence  of  characters  who  are  very  wound  up  and  not  given  opportunities  to  express  themselves,  and  they  get  this  one  moment  to  cut  loose  and  it  all  explodes  out  of  them.  I  think  there's  a  lot  of  him  in  those  kinds  of  people.CNN:  What  were  some  of  the  surprises  you  found?Itzkoff:  I  think  the  whole  perception  that  the  movie  was  written  as  an  act  of  revenge,  or  it  was  a  big  salvo  at  television  because  it  had  somehow  spurned  him  back  in  the  day  --  I  think  that's  pretty  much  disproved.  When  you  really  look  at  the  evolution  of  the  screenplay  it's  clearly  not  the  case.  He  didn't  know  what  he  was  going  to  write.  He  certainly  couldn't  have  gone  into  it  with  the  design  of  writing  the  specific  movie  that  comes  out  at  the  other  end.But  it's  also  interesting  for  me  to  see  the  very  polarized  reaction  that  it  elicited.  Certainly  the  news  industry  itself  completely  disowned  the  film,  and  that's  what  necessitates  his  letters  of  apology  to  (Walter)  Cronkite  and  John  Chancellor.  Even  among  the  film  critics  who  reviewed  it,  there  were  some  who  were  proud  supporters  of  it,  and  there  were  some  who  were  fiercely  negatively  opposed  to  it.  You  look  at  some  of  the  reviews  and  it's  one  thing  to  say  you  don't  particularly  find  the  movie  entertaining,  but  the  vitriol  with  which  people  were  pushing  against  it  I  find  surprising.  It's  as  if  they  have  to  defend  TV  from  Chayefsky.CNN:  In  retrospect,  it's  surprising  the  journalists  who  protested  the  film  didn't  see  what  was  coming  down  the  pike  --  that  news  could  be  a  profit  center  and,  critics  have  charged,  another  form  of  entertainment.Itzkoff:  To  give  the  people  of  that  era  the  benefit  of  the  doubt,  there  was  also  a  feeling  that,  to  the  extent  they'd  helped  Chayefsky  conduct  the  research  for  the  film,  I  can  understand  if  they  felt  he  stabbed  them  in  the  back.  But  I  think  there's  truth  in  what  you're  saying.  They  had  this  kind  of  faith  (that)  their  industry  would  preserve  its  own  dignity  out  of  a  sense  of  knowing  it  was  the  right  thing  to  do.  Those  firewalls  between  news  and  entertainment  would  always  exist  because  news  would  always  be  run  by  upstanding  people.  Chayefsky  understood  it  was  human  nature  to  eventually  do  away  with  that.CNN:  If  you  look  at  the  history  of  newspapers  --  in  the  '20s  the  tabloids  put  an  electric  chair  victim  on  the  front  page  --  it  seems  natural.Itzkoff:  You  don't  even  have  to  reach  as  far  back.  In  the  '70s  in  the  local  news  markets,  the  ones  who  would  emerge  victorious  were  the  ones  who  went  tabloid  --  who  ran  with  more  salacious  segments  and  drifted  away  from  hard  national  or  international  reporting.  So  it  was  very  easy  to  extrapolate  and  figure,  if  it's  happening  at  the  local  level,  why  shouldn't  it  happen  at  the  network  level?CNN:  Your  last  chapter  deals  with  the  impact  of  the  movie  and  the  people  who  love  it.  Colbert  gets  it.  But  how  about  Bill  O'Reilly?Itzkoff:  His  reading  of  the  film  as  not  only  an  indictment  of  news  personalities  but  an  indictment  of  the  audience  is  very  perceptive  and  I  think  very  true.  There  is  that  element  of  commentary  on  the  viewing  public  --  they  are  in  some  ways  at  fault  for  being  led  along  so  easily  and  giving  into,  or  going  along  with,  whatever  the  person  on  the  box  tells  them  to  do.  I  thought  O'Reilly  brought  that  out  well.CNN:  True.  There's  one  point  in  the  movie  when  Beale's  asked  to  go  on  the  air  and  rant  and  Max  doesn't  object.  They're  in  the  game,  too.Itzkoff:  One  thing  I've  come  to  appreciate  is  there  is  a  kind  of  gradual  corrupting  that  takes  place  over  the  course  of  the  movie.  In  those  very  opening  scenes,  when  Holden  and  Finch  are  drunkenly  sitting  about  the  bar,  there's  almost  this  gallows  humor  as  they  laugh  about  the  terrible  things  TV  could  turn  into,  and  little  by  little  it  starts  to  come  true.There  is  agency  in  the  movie.  These  events  don't  just  happen  by  accident.  People  want  them  to  occur,  people  allow  them  to  occur.  There's  definitely  plenty  of  blame  cast  around  in  the  world  of  the  film.  We  can  decide  for  ourselves  if  that  blame  should  be  shared  by  people  in  the  viewing  audience.</TEXT></DOC>

It  set  off  a  national  debate  resulting  in  significant  backlash  for  SeaWorld.SeaWorld  has  long  called  "Blackfish"  one-sided  and  claimed  it  is  the  product  of  animal  activists.A  spokesman  for  the  Department  of  Labor's  inspector  general  said  the  office  had  received  the  complaint  but  could  issue  no  further  comment.  Attempts  to  reach  Padgett  were  not  immediately  successful  Friday.Department  of  Labor  spokesman  Jesse  Lawder  said  OSHA  referred  the  matter  to  the  inspector  general  in  January,  immediately  after  allegations  first  surfaced,  and  that  the  agency  is  awaiting  the  results  of  that  investigation.In  the  complaint,  SeaWorld  alleges  Padgett  attended  the  2013  Sundance  Film  Festival  with  "Blackfish"  producers  and  accepted  lodging  free  of  charge.SeaWorld  provided  CNN  with  several  purported  photos  of  Padgett,  lifted  from  what  appear  to  be  her  personal  social  media  accounts,  showing  the  federal  employee  in  various  photos  with  the  film's  cast  and  crew  --  including  a  picture  of  the  group  in  a  "Charlie's  Angels"  pose,  complete  with  air  guns,  at  the  film's  premiere  in  New  York.The  company  also  accused  Padgett  of  disclosing  confidential  information."Blackfish"  associate  producer  Tim  Zimmermann  asked  to  borrow  a  witness'  thumb  drive  and  was  subsequently  seen  working  with  Padgett  on  a  laptop  computer,  the  complaint  says.The  witness  then  found  new  documents  related  to  OSHA's  investigation  on  the  drive  after  it  was  returned  --  documents,  the  complaint  states  were  clearly  labeled  as  SeaWorld  trade  secrets.  The  complaint  does  not  identify  the  witness.Zimmermann  told  CNN  no  confidential  documents  were  shared  with  him."I  have  no  idea  what  to  make  of  these  accusations,"  he  said.  "Lara  Padgett  never  shared  documents  with  'Blackfish.'  There  are  no  documents  in  the  film."What's  more,  Padgett  was  not  invited  to  Sundance  by  the  "Blackfish"  crew,  Zimmermann  said.  She  stayed  in  the  house  where  the  crew  stayed  for  a  few  nights  due  to  a  lodging  shortage  in  the  area,  but  she  "came  on  her  own  dime,"  he  said."  'Blackfish'  does  not  have  any,  did  not  use  any  confidential  documents,"  Zimmermann  said.  "We  obviously  knew  who  she  was.  We  tried  to  interview  her,  but  ...  all  of  OSHA  declined  to  participate."He  added,  "Any  feelings  she  had  on  SeaWorld,  it  was  on  her  own."Government  employees  are  prohibited  from  divulging  trade  secrets.  They  face  imprisonment,  fines  or  termination  if  found  in  violation."We  believe  that  this  conduct  demonstrates  that  she  was  influenced  by  improper  considerations,  and  failed  to  bring  the  appropriate  objectivity,  in  the  investigation  of  the  death  of  whale  trainer  Dawn  Brancheau,"  the  complaint  states."SeaWorld  further  believes  that  Ms.  Padgett's  disclosure  of  confidential  information  and  other  conduct  reflect  an  intense  bias  and  a  desire  to  assist  those  in  the  animal  rights  community  who  have  publicly,  and  for  many  years,  demonstrated  a  desire  to  damage  SeaWorld  as  a  viable  business."</TEXT></DOC>

And  yet,  many  of  Sunday  night's  biggest  winners  were  honored  for  roles  and  films  based  on  real  life.Recent  films  such  as  "Argo"  and  "Lincoln"  racked  up  awards  last  year,  but  the  2014  Golden  Globes  were  especially  good  to  those  who  honored  the  past  by  recreating  it.Both  of  this  year's  best  pictures,  "12  Years  a  Slave"  and  "American  Hustle,"  were,  as  they  say,  "based  on  actual  events,"  with  Amy  Adams  and  Jennifer  Lawrence  picking  up  individual  honors  for  "Hustle."  Leonardo  DiCaprio  earned  a  Golden  Globe  for  playing  real-life  convicted  fraudster  Jordan  Belfort  in  "The  Wolf  of  Wall  Street,"  and  Matthew  McConaughey  and  Jared  Leto  received  trophies  for  another  true  tale,  "Dallas  Buyers  Club."Complete  coverage  of  the  2014  Golden  GlobesThe  trend  even  extended  to  television,  where  the  Golden  Globes  honored  the  Liberace  biopic  "Behind  The  Candelabra"  and  its  star,  Michael  Douglas.  And  to  music,  as  U2  effusively  praised  the  late  Nelson  Mandela  when  the  group  accepted  its  award  for  a  song  from  "Mandela:  Long  Walk  To  Freedom."  In  all,  10  Golden  Globes  went  to  films  and  actors  that  brought  drama  rooted  in  reality  to  the  screen.As  if  to  underscore  the  power  that  real-life  stories  can  bring  to  film  and  television,  two  of  the  night's  biggest  ovations  went  not  to  actors  or  directors,  but  to  people  portrayed  on  film  this  year:  Philomena  Lee,  the  woman  searching  for  her  long-lost  son,  played  by  Dame  Judi  Dench  in  "Philomena,"  and  Niki  Lauda,  the  legendary  Formula  One  racer  played  by  Daniel  Bruhl  in  "Rush."As  he  spoke,  Lauda  removed  his  cap  to  show  his  head,  scarred  by  the  fiery,  near-fatal  crash  at  the  movie's  center.  The  audience  at  the  Beverly  Hilton  Hotel  cheered  him,  and  "Rush"  star  Chris  Hemsworth  beamed  --  the  man  who  plays  "Thor"  obviously  thrilled  to  share  the  stage  with  a  real-life  action  hero.</TEXT></DOC>

But  the  tensions  there  in  fact  hit  very  close  to  home  for  the  United  States.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Washington  (CNN)  --  The  names  involved  in  the  escalating  crisis  in  Ukraine  --  Crimea,  Sevastopol,  Simferopol  --  make  it  sound  far  away  and  far  removed  from  America's  allies  and  its  interests.  But  the  tensions  there  in  fact  hit  very  close  to  home  for  the  United  States.First,  Ukraine  is  not  a  distant  empire  but  an  integral  part  of  Europe.  Its  capital,  Kiev,  is  just  a  short  flight  from  cities  Americans  visit  all  the  time:  Rome,  Frankfurt,  Paris.And,  it  is  neighbors  with  some  of  America's  closest  allies.Just  along  its  western  border  are  Poland,  Hungary,  Slovakia,  and  Romania.  All  four  are  members  of  NATO  and,  as  a  result,  the  United  States  is  obligated  to  defend  them  militarily  if  they  come  under  threat.Ukraine  is  not  a  NATO  member,  but  there  had  been  discussions  in  recent  years  of  enhancing  ties.Second,  a  tug  of  war  is  playing  out  inside  Ukraine  between  East  and  West.President  Barack  Obama  has  said  the  Ukraine  crisis  is  not  part  of  "some  Cold  War  chessboard,"  but  Cold  War-era  divisions  are  evident  on  the  ground.Ukraine's  east  is  predominantly  ethnic  Russian  and  Russian  speaking.  The  percentage  is  as  high  as  75%  in  the  easternmost  areas.  Ukraine's  west,  by  contrast,  is  dominated  by  ethnic  Ukrainians.  In  the  westernmost  areas,  fewer  than  5%  speak  Russian.Obama:  U.S.  weighing  steps  to  'isolate  Russia'  over  Ukraine  crisisThose  cultural  and  historic  divisions  pull  western  Ukraine  toward  the  West  and  Europe,  and  eastern  Ukraine  into  the  arms  of  Russia.Now,  it  is  not  black  and  white.Even  in  the  hotly  contested  Crimean  peninsula,  two  out  of  five  residents  are  not  Russian.  But  Ukraine's  demographic  map  displays  a  clear  division,  which  is  now  playing  out  in  cities  and  towns  and  --  it  appears  --  even  inside  military  bases."To  be  sure,  there  is  an  East-West  divide  in  Ukraine,  but  I  think  it's  often  overstated  in  the  West,"  said  Steven  Pifer,  a  former  U.S.  ambassador  to  Ukraine."Certainly  in  the  last  two  decades  of  Ukraine's  independence,  that  line  has  blurred  a  lot,"  Pifer  said.  "Bear  in  mind,  in  eastern  Ukraine,  while  the  majority  of  the  people  there  may  speak  Russian,  it's  still  a  majority  population  that  are  ethnic  Ukrainian.  The  only  place  in  Ukraine  where  Russians  are  an  ethnic  majority  is  Crimea.""My  sense  is  that  in  eastern  Ukraine  while  they  might  not  be  wholly  comfortable  with  what  has  happened  in  Kiev  in  the  last  10  days,  they  are  not  talking  about  separatism.  It's  a  very  big  distinction  between  eastern  Ukraine  and  Crimea.Third,  as  Secretary  of  State  John  Kerry  said  Sunday,  Russia's  military  intervention  violates  international  law,  the  United  Nations  charter  and  several  post-war  military  agreements  --  all  of  which  designed  to  keep  the  peace  in  Europe  following  several  20th  century  wars.Russia's  violation  of  those  agreements  calls  into  question  its  ability  to  keep  the  peace  going  forward  as  well  as  basic  principles  such  as  the  sanctity  of  international  borders.Kerry  rebukes  Russia's  'incredible  act  of  aggression'  in  move  into  UkraineRussia  is  claiming  that  ethnic  Russians  in  Ukraine  are  calling  for  Russian  help,  a  claim  with  little  so  far  to  support  it  on  the  ground.And,  looking  forward,  experts  note  there  are  many  more  Russians  in,  for  instance,  the  Baltic  state  of  Latvia,  which,  unlike  Ukraine,  is  a  NATO  ally.  What  would  happen  if  Russia  did  the  same  there?So  what  are  Russia's  interests?  Why  would  it  risk  so  much  for  a  seemingly  tiny  corner  of  Ukraine.  The  answer  lies  with  one  of  those  distant-sounding  places  mentioned  at  the  start  of  the  piece:  Sevastopol.Crimea  caught  in  a  'war  of  information'Sevastopol  is  home  to  the  base  of  Russia's  Black  Sea  Fleet.  It  is  Russia's  only  warm-water  port,  the  only  port  Russia  has  that  provides  access  to  the  Black  Sea,  the  Mediterranean  and  the  Atlantic  year-round.This  is  an  essential  tool  for  projecting  Russian  military  power  abroad.  When  Ukraine's  government  abruptly  shifted  from  pro-Russian  to  pro-European  following  protests  in  Kiev,  Russia  appeared  to  identify  a  threat  to  its  core  interests."I  think  what  were  really  seeing  are  the  initial  steps  in  some  form  —  maybe  premature  on  my  part,  but  that's  OK  --  of  an  annexation  by  Russia,"  said  retired  Army  Gen.  James  "Spider"  Marks,  a  CNN  contributor.Its  response  is  the  massive  military  intervention  the  world  is  witnessing  right  now.Marks  said  the  key  thing  is  to  ensure  that  the  crisis  doesn't  escalate.  And  to  accept  reality."I  think  the  United  States  and  the  international  community  is  probably  going  to  have  to  accept  a  half  a  loaf  --  in  other  words,  the  annexation  of  Crimea  may  be  a  fait  accompli.  We  have  to  accept  that  and  have  to  acknowledge  that  if  (Russian  President  Vladimr)  Putin  is  not  going  to  act  against  Ukraine,  it's  certainly  in  our  best  interest,"  Marks  said.  "This  might,  in  fact,  be  Version  Two  of  containment  --  in  fact  I'd  suggest  it  is."</TEXT></DOC>

He  was  never  on  investigators'  radar  at  the  time  of  the  killing,  Early  said.Two  seemingly  unrelated  events  led  to  the  DNA  match,  he  said.Now-dead  convict  likely  linked  to  Florida  woman's  '89  disappearanceIn  Massachusetts,  investigators  resubmitted  evidence  from  the  1974  crime  scene  to  a  lab  to  re-evaluate  it  for  any  traces  of  DNA.Separately,  Guthrie  violated  parole  for  a  crime  he  committed  in  Los  Angeles  and  was  required  to  provide  a  DNA  sample,  Early  said.These  two  sources  of  DNA  provided  the  break  that  had  eluded  investigators  for  years,  he  said.Douglas  County,  Georgia,  authorities  arrested  Guthrie  without  incident  following  questioning  by  Massachusetts  State  Police  officers,  Douglas  sheriff's  Sgt.

Follow  him  on  Twitter.Vancouver,  British  Columbia  (CNN)  --  Charmian  Gooch,  the  anti-corruption  crusader  who  co-founded  Global  Witness,  called  Tuesday  night  for  action  to  lift  the  veil  on  who  owns  corporations  around  the  world.  She  made  that  wish  as  she  accepted  the  $1  million  TED  Prize  at  the  TED2014  conference."My  wish  is  for  us  to  know  who  owns  and  controls  companies  so  that  they  can  no  longer  be  used  anonymously  against  the  public  good.  Let's  ignite  world  opinion,  change  the  law,  and  together  launch  a  new  era  of  openness  in  business."Her  call  to  expose  criminals  and  corrupt  officials  came  at  the  end  of  the  first  full  day  of  TED's  30th  anniversary  conference.  Earlier,  another  speaker  on  transparency,  Edward  Snowden,  argued  his  case  that  NSA  surveillance  programs  infringe  privacy  for  no  real  benefit.In  her  TED  Prize  wish,  Gooch  made  the  case  that  the  identity  of  corporate  owners  shouldn't  be  kept  private.She  said  the  development  of  a  public  registry  of  corporate  ownership  would  enable  the  exposure  of  tax  evasion,  terrorism,  drug  trafficking,  conflict  minerals,  sanctions  busting  and  political  corruption.  "This  truly  is  a  scandal  of  epic  proportions  hidden  in  plain  sight,"  Gooch  said.  In  states  such  as  Delaware,  she  said,  it's  easier  to  set  up  a  company  than  to  get  a  library  card,  and  in  10  minutes  of  online  shopping  you  can  have  a  corporation  to  shield  your  identity.As  examples  of  the  need  to  ferret  out  the  true  ownership  of  companies,  she  cited  the  investigation  of  the  assets  owned  by  the  ousted  regime  of  Viktor  Yanukovych  in  Ukraine  and  said  the  impoverished  people  of  the  Democratic  Republic  of  Congo  had  been  cheated  of  a  billion  dollars  by  anonymous  companies.  Gooch  and  her  two  Global  Witness  co-founders  have  also  received  the  $1  million  Skoll  Award  for  Social  Entrepreneurship.Global  Witness  was  founded  20  years  ago  and  gained  fame  in  part  from  its  reporting  on  how  the  diamond  trade  was  fueling  conflict  in  Africa.She  says  the  UK  government  and  the  European  Parliament  are  "on  board"  in  support  of  the  public  registry,  and  that  her  group  is  working  to  get  support  from  the  administration  of  U.S.  President  Barack  Obama.  "America  is  the  next  big  target,"  Gooch  said.  "It  has  to  come  on  board."  She  said  the  United  States  and  United  Kingdom  account  for  a  majority  of  the  cases  in  which  shielded  corporate  ownership  is  used  to  hide  crime.Two  U.S.  senators,  Democrat  Carl  Levin  of  Michigan  and  Republican  Chuck  Grassley  of  Iowa  have  introduced  a  bill  that  would  require  states  to  ask  people  seeking  to  set  up  corporations  to  disclose  their  true  owners.  "Today,  money  launderers,  arms  dealers,  drug  lords,  terrorists  and  tax  evaders  are  too  often  able  to  conceal  their  misconduct  behind  a  wall  of  corporate  secrecy,"  Levin  said  in  a  statement.The  topics  of  secrecy  and  privacy  came  up  in  a  different  context  when  Snowden  told  the  TED2014  conference  from  an  undisclosed  location  in  Russia  on  Tuesday  that  "we  don't  have  to  give  up  our  liberty  to  have  security."Appearing  on  a  small  screen  mounted  on  a  rolling,  swiveling  robot  that  looked  a  bit  like  an  upright  vacuum  cleaner,  the  former  National  Security  Agency  contractor  said,  "I  am  proof  that  you  can  go  up  against  the  most  powerful  intelligence  agencies  in  the  world  and  win."Snowden  said  he  doesn't  think  of  himself  as  a  hero,  but  TED  curator  Chris  Anderson  asked  the  audience  of  1,200  whether  he  had  performed  a  heroic  act,  and  many  agreed.  Tim  Berners-Lee,  the  inventor  of  the  World  Wide  Web,  was  asked  to  come  on  stage  and  also  said  he  would  classify  Snowden  as  a  hero.  A  minority  of  those  in  the  audience  raised  their  hands  to  say  they  considered  Snowden's  release  of  classified  government  information  a  "reckless"  act.Snowden  endorsed  Berners-Lee's  argument  that  this  year's  25th  anniversary  of  the  Web  should  be  the  occasion  for  a  new  "magna  carta"  establishing  the  right  to  online  freedom.He  said  people  deserve  a  right  to  privacy  when  they  order  a  book  online,  call  their  families  or  travel  and  shouldn't  be  subject  to  how  the  government  will  interpret  their  acts  later.  Snowden  argued  that  surveillance  hasn't  prevented  terrorist  acts  and  that  the  fight  against  terrorism  is  a  cover  for  intrusive  government  agencies.The  most  important  thing  private  companies  can  do  to  protect  consumers  is  to  encrypt  their  data,  Snowden  said.  He  said  the  action  of  someone  ordering  a  copy  of  the  book  "1984"  on  Amazon  can  be  discovered  by  intelligence  agencies  because  the  data  is  not  encrypted.Asked  about  criticism  by  former  Vice  President  Dick  Cheney  that  he  has  done  enormous  damage  to  America's  national  security,  Snowden  said  that  "going  to  war  with  people  who  are  not  our  enemies,  in  places  that  aren't  threats,  doesn't  make  us  safe."Snowden,  who  has  worked  with  journalists  to  reveal  the  secrets  he  obtained  from  his  work  with  the  NSA,  said  there  will  be  more  revelations.  "Some  of  the  most  important  reporting  to  be  done  is  yet  to  come,"  he  said.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinionJoin  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinion</TEXT></DOC>

And  the  success  of  Johnson's  war  on  poverty  has  been  heavily  debated.  Here's  a  look  at  the  war  on  poverty  over  the  years.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Washington  (CNN)  --  Fifty  years  ago,  in  his  State  of  the  Union  address,  President  Lyndon  B.  Johnson  declared  a  "war  on  poverty.""This  administration  today,  here  and  now,  declares  unconditional  war  on  poverty  in  America,"  he  proclaimed,  speaking  to  Congress  and  the  nation.Johnson  worked  with  Congress  to  pass  more  than  200  pieces  of  legislation  that  attempted  to  address  the  more  than  37  million  people  living  in  poverty  at  the  time.Johnson's  policies  are  considered  the  largest  expansion  of  social  safety  net  programs  in  history.  He  created  Medicare  and  Medicaid,  which  provided  health  care  to  millions  of  low-income  people  and  seniors.  He  also  launched  the  Head  Start  early  education  program  and  made  housing  available  for  low-income  people.  On  top  of  that,  Johnson  successfully  expanded  funding  for  K-12  education,  passed  the  Voting  Rights  Act  and  provided  money  for  artists  through  the  National  Endowment  for  the  Arts.The  programs  began  to  immediately  reduce  the  number  of  people  living  in  poverty,  especially  seniors.  The  poverty  rate  dropped  to  12.1%  by  the  time  he  left  office.  While  an  improvement,  poverty  still  existed.Johnson  saw  problems  with  his  agenda  almost  immediately.  Most  notably,  funding  and  focus  turned  to  another  war  --  the  Vietnam  War  --  hampering  Johnson's  vision.Fifty  years  later,  partisan  battles  over  the  size,  efficiency  and  worth  of  government  assistance  programs  persist.  And  the  success  of  Johnson's  war  on  poverty  has  been  heavily  debated.  The  poverty  rate  has  followed  a  hilly  path  that  reached  as  low  as  11.1%  in  1973  and  hit  a  high  of  more  than  15%  in  1983,  1993  and  2010,  and  it's  still  at  that  level  today.Why  'war  on  poverty'  not  overHere's  a  look  at  the  war  on  poverty  and  the  men  who  guided  it:Richard  NixonPresident  Nixon  detested  Johnson's  "Great  Society."  He  called  the  welfare  system  "a  hopeless  failure."But  Nixon  didn't  dismantle  Johnson's  anti-poverty  agenda.  While  he  altered  some  of  it,  many  programs  expanded.Nixon  tightened  eligibility  requirements  of  the  welfare  system  that  included  job  training  programs,  but  he  added  assistance  for  child  care.  He  called  his  welfare  reform  bill  the  "single  most  significant  piece  of  social  legislation  to  be  considered  by  the  Congress  in  decades."He  also  expanded  the  Social  Security  program  to  allow  for  cost  of  living  adjustments  and  for  disabled  Americans  to  receive  benefits.  And  it  doesn't  stop  there.  He  expanded  the  food  stamp  program  and  low-income  housing  assistance.  Nixon  also  created  the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration,  credited  for  improving  conditions  for  workers.Nixon  did,  however,  begin  to  dismantle  the  Office  of  Economic  Opportunity  (OEO),  which  Johnson  created  to  head  the  anti-poverty  programs.  And  he  heavily  altered  the  Community  Action  Agencies,  which  worked  to  involve  community  organizations  in  anti-poverty  programs.While  the  poverty  rate  increased  at  the  beginning  of  Nixon's  term  to  12.6%  in  1970,  which  was  during  a  recession,  it  ticked  back  down  to  11.1%  but  rose  again  slightly  by  the  time  he  resigned  in  1974.Gerald  FordWatergate  sunk  Nixon,  forcing  him  to  resign  --  making  Gerald  Ford  the  only  president  never  popularly  elected  to  the  executive  branch.From  the  outset,  regaining  the  public's  trust  was  Ford's  primary  focus.  In  his  first  press  conference,  Ford  said  he  wanted  to  "heal  the  wounds  throughout  the  United  States"  and  address  the  "turmoil  and  divisiveness"  brought  on  by  the  Watergate  scandal.Opinion:  What  the  inequality  debate  leaves  outBut  in  1975,  Ford  signed  the  Earned  Income  Tax  Credit,  a  Nixon  idea  that  provides  a  tax  rebate  for  low  or  middle  class  working  families  with  children.  The  conservative  Hoover  Institute  at  Stanford  University,  which  advocates  tax  cuts  as  poverty  reduction  measures,  said  it  is  "probably  the  most  cost-effective  anti-poverty  program  the  federal  government  operates."Jimmy  CarterBy  the  mid-1970s,  aided  by  a  market  crash  in  1973  and  oil  crises  throughout  the  decade,  economic  pessimism  gripped  America.  This,  along  with  the  end  of  the  Vietnam  War  and  the  unraveling  of  the  Watergate  saga,  led  Americans  to  sour  on  government.President  Jimmy  Carter  took  cues  from  this  anti-government  sentiment  and  was  critical  of  the  war  on  poverty,  saying  it  --  much  like  Vietnam  --  was  an  unwinnable  endeavor.  Carter  ran  as  an  outsider  and  someone  who  would  shake  up  government  in  1976,  and  his  position  on  poverty  helped  bolster  that  image."Government  cannot  solve  our  problems,  it  can't  set  our  goals,  it  cannot  define  our  vision,"  Carter  said  in  his  1978  State  of  the  Union  Address.  "Government  cannot  eliminate  poverty  or  provide  a  bountiful  economy  or  reduce  inflation  or  save  our  cities  or  cure  illiteracy  or  provide  energy."Julian  Zelizer,  a  professor  of  history  and  public  affairs  at  Princeton  University,  said  that  while  Carter  was  a  Democrat,  "he  still  supported  a  lot  of  what  the  war  on  poverty  aimed  to  achieve,  but  like  some  Democrats,  he  thought  the  programs  had  unintended  consequences."Ronald  ReaganIf  Carter  began  to  scale  back  the  war  on  poverty,  President  Ronald  Reagan  attempted  to  expedite  the  process,  comparing  many  of  the  programs  started  by  Johnson  as  "misguided  welfare  programs"  that  have  "actually  helped  turn  a  shrinking  problem  into  a  national  tragedy."He  entered  office  in  1981  during  a  multi-year  recession,  when  the  poverty  rate  rose  to  its  highest  level  since  the  60s,  and  it  remained  above  13%  for  his  entire  presidency.Reagan,  a  vigorous  opponent  of  welfare,  famously  said  Johnson  "declared  a  war  on  poverty  and  poverty  won."After  running  on  a  campaign  that  pledged  to  reform  government  entitlements  --  the  40th  president  had  mixed  results.He  did  continue  to  deride  welfare  --  "We're  in  danger  of  creating  a  permanent  culture  of  poverty  as  inescapable  as  any  chain  or  bond,"  Reagan  said  during  a  radio  address  in  1986  --  but  by  the  end  of  his  administration  in  1988,  spending  on  entitlements  had  only  slightly  slowed.Obama  calls  for  unemployment  extension  as  measure  clears  key  Senate  hurdlePolitics  at  play  under  the  surface  of  unemployment  benefits  debate"Most  of  the  welfare  state  survives  Ronald  Reagan,"  said  Zelizer.  "Reagan  shifts  the  debate  but  is  not  someone  who  dismantles  the  government.  One  of  the  big  problems  he  finds  is  that  a  lot  of  these  programs  are  more  popular  than  he  expected."Reagan  did,  however,  greatly  expand  the  Earned  Income  Child  Credit,  which  he  called  "the  best  anti-poverty,  the  best  pro-family,  the  best  job  creation  measure  to  come  out  of  Congress."  Some  conservatives  still  agree.George  H.W.  BushBy  the  time  President  George  H.W.  Bush  became  president  in  1988,  his  hands  were  somewhat  tied  economically.  With  the  federal  budget  debt  at  $2.8  trillion  --  three  times  larger  than  it  had  been  in  1980  --  the  economic  situation,  as  well  as  a  lack  of  political  will,  did  not  lend  itself  to  increasing  the  fight  on  poverty.Like  Carter,  Bush  is  also  consumed  with  other  issues:  The  recession,  deficit  reduction  and  the  war  in  the  Persian  Gulf,  to  name  a  few.  He  doesn't  seem  to  harangue  welfare  as  much  as  Reagan.What's  more,  after  eight  years  working  under  Reagan,  Bush  had  a  firsthand  view  of  the  difficulties  in  slashing  the  social  safety  net.  He  saw  how  vocal  his  predecessor  had  been  --  and  how  little  actually  changed  in  those  eight  years."Welfare  and  the  war  on  poverty  just  weren't  on  the  top  of  his  agenda"  said  Zelizer.  "Bush  is  also  from  an  era  of  Republicans  that  are  generally  fine  with  the  social  safety  net."In  Bush's  four  years  in  office,  the  percentage  of  Americans  in  poverty  rose  to  about  15%.Bill  ClintonPresident  Bill  Clinton  served  his  entire  term  without  the  cloud  of  recession  hanging  over  him.  But  even  the  economic  boom  of  the  1990s  did  not  eliminate  poverty.  The  poverty  rate  was  15%  when  Clinton  entered  office,  when  the  country  was  recovering  from  another  recession,  and  continued  to  decline  to  11.3%  during  his  last  year  in  2000.Clinton's  moderate  take  on  governing  disappointed  liberals,  especially  when  he  worked  with  Republicans  to  drastically  alter  the  welfare  system.  The  controversial  reforms  tightened  work  requirements.  It  was  hailed  by  conservatives  as  one  of  the  most  important  changes  to  the  safety  net  and  denounced  by  some  liberals  as  harsh  and  limiting.Clinton  did,  however,  implement  the  greatest  expansion  of  health  care  since  Johnson's  creation  of  Medicare  and  Medicaid.  He  created  the  Children's  Health  Insurance  Program,  enabling  children  in  families  just  above  the  poverty  line  to  receive  health  care  for  the  first  time.George  W.  BushOnly  a  few  years  out  of  office,  Bush's  presidency  is  decried  by  both  liberals  and  conservatives  --  for  different  reasons.  Conservatives  denounced  Bush's  government  spending,  which  dramatically  increased  under  the  43rd  President.Bush  increased  spending  from  $1.79  trillion  in  2000  to  $2.98  trillion  in  2008,  a  60%  hike,  according  to  the  libertarian  Cato  Institute.  The  wars  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan  had  a  lot  to  do  with  it,  but  so  did  an  expensive  expansion  to  Medicare.Bush  created  Medicare  Part  D,  a  prescription  drug  program  for  seniors,  subsidizing  the  cost  of  seniors'  expensive  prescription  drugs.  The  program  fit  in  line  with  his  campaign  promise  of  compassionate  conservatism.The  political  war  over  povertyGuian  McKee,  a  professor  of  public  policy  at  the  University  of  Virginia,  said  the  program  is  "an  anathema"  for  conservatives."If  you  are  a  progressive,  it  is  a  pretty  significant  expansion  of  the  social  policy  system,"  McKee  added.In  addition,  Bush  greatly  expanded  corporate  welfare  with  major  tax  cuts  at  the  beginning  of  his  term  and  spending  hundreds  of  billions  of  dollars  bailing  out  Wall  Street  at  the  end  of  it.Barack  ObamaPresident  Obama  has  governed  through  a  deep  recession  and  a  slow  recovery.  During  this  time,  government  spending  on  anti-poverty  programs  continued  on  an  upward  trajectory.  Then  major  cuts  were  made  with  the  sequester,  which  cut  some  of  the  most  popular  of  Johnson's  programs,  including  Head  Start,  the  National  Endowment  for  the  Arts  and  food  stamps,  just  to  name  a  few.While  many  social  programs  have  been  cut  during  the  Obama  administration,  the  current  President  has  seen  a  major  expansion  of  health  care,  especially  for  low  income  people.  Through  the  Affordable  Care  Act,  people  living  above  the  poverty  line  are  receiving  government  assistance  to  purchase  health  care  and  millions  of  low-income  families  are  gaining  health  care  through  the  expansion  of  Medicaid.There's  still  dispute  over  the  safety  net.  Congress  is  debating  how  much  more  to  cut  the  food  stamp  program  and  Obama  has  indicated  he's  open  to  slight  reductions  to  Social  Security.  Additionally,  he  has  launched  a  campaign  to  address  income  inequality  by  raising  the  minimum  wage  and  passing  immigration  reform.While  his  term  has  been  plagued  with  a  relatively  high  poverty  rate  --  about  15%  in  a  post  war-on-poverty  era  --  Obama  still  has  time  in  his  administration  to  make  his  mark.Battles  continue  over  the  right  mix  of  policies  to  address  poverty,  but  people  of  all  stripes  agree  on  one  thing:  The  country  has  not  yet  achieved  Johnson's  goal.</TEXT></DOC>

Andrew  Cuomo  formally  announced  Wednesday."Research  suggests  that  medical  marijuana  can  help  manage  pain  and  treatment  of  cancer  and  other  serious  illnesses,"  Cuomo  said  in  the  annual  State  of  State  speech  in  Albany."We  will  establish  a  program  allowing  up  to  20  hospitals  to  prescribe  medical  marijuana,  and  we  will  monitor  the  program  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  and  the  feasibility  of  a  medical  marijuana  system,"  Cuomo  added,  without  elaborating.Medical  marijuana  advocates  briefed  on  Cuomo's  plan  earlier  this  week  said  an  executive  action  would  allow  certain  hospitals  to  dispense  the  drug  to  certain  patients.  The  governor's  office  did  not  return  calls  seeking  comment.State  Assemblyman  Richard  Gottfried,  a  Democrat  from  Manhattan  and  a  leading  proponent  of  comprehensive  legislation  for  medical  marijuana,  said  he  learned  about  the  executive  action  in  a  conversation  Saturday  with  members  of  the  governor's  staff.  He  said  the  move  paved  the  way  for  a  "limited  and  cumbersome  program"  but  called  it  a  step  forward.Other  New  Yorkers  welcomed  the  news.  Missy  Miller  of  Long  Island  said  she  considered  moving  to  California  to  gain  access  to  a  special  strain  of  marijuana  called  charlotte's  web  oil,  a  derivative  that  may  help  cease  her  son  Oliver's  seizures.Oliver,  14,  had  a  stroke  in  utero  that  resulted  in  a  brain  stem  injury.  Among  several  other  life-threatening  consequences  are  seizures,  sometimes  more  than  a  dozen  a  day."It's  scary  every  day,"  she  said.  "Every  seizure  that  he  has,  I  get  anxious,  every  seizure  I  worry,  is  this  going  to  be  the  seizure  that  doesn't  stop."Miller  has  hoped  for  comprehensive  legislation  that  would  specify  the  sources  and  strains  of  the  drug  available.  Access  is  "a  huge  question  mark,"  she  said,  adding  that  while  other  states  have  legalized  marijuana,  "they  do  not  have  the  strain  that  will  help  these  children."Miller  said  that  while  Cuomo's  announcement  is  "a  huge  step  and  a  step  in  the  right  direction  and  we're  applauding  it,  it  isn't  enough.  It  needs  to  include  access  and  coverage  to  the  people  that  need  it,  all  the  people  that  need  it."An  opponent  of  the  governor's  action  said  it  was  driven  by  politics."I  think  serious  questions  can  be  raised  about  using  a  political  vehicle  to  achieve  the  use  of  a  prescribable  medication  in  America,"  said  William  Foster,  president  of  the  National  Council  on  Alcoholism  and  Drug  Dependency.Medical  marijuana  is  not  unprecedented  in  the  United  States.  Twenty  states  and  the  District  of  Columbia  now  allow  it  in  some  form  --  among  them  Colorado,  where,  as  of  January  1,  it's  legal  to  sell  marijuana  to  those  21  or  older  --  according  to  information  compiled  by  the  National  Conference  of  State  Legislatures.  (In  addition,  Maryland  has  a  limited  program  for  research.)  The  momentum  has  picked  up  recently,  with  most  of  these  efforts  taking  effect  over  the  past  decade.Among  the  states  that  allow  medical  marijuana  are  Connecticut,  Vermont  and  New  Jersey,  each  of  which  border  New  York.  And  yet  the  Empire  State  has  not  joined  them.  Versions  of  the  Compassionate  Care  Act  pushed  by  Gottfried  have  passed  the  state  Assembly,  only  to  stall  in  the  Senate.Cuomo  is  acting  without  the  legislature's  OK,  though  what  he's  doing  is  legal,  according  to  Gottfried.  He  explained  that  the  governor  is  acting  on  powers  granted  through  a  law  passed  in  1980  in  setting  the  stage  for  a  highly  regulated  system  that's  less  liberal  than  many  other  medical  marijuana  setups  nationwide.Here's  how  it  would  work,  according  to  Gottfried:  Under  Cuomo's  directive,  the  state  health  department  would  take  charge  by  setting  up  the  guidelines  and  picking  the  hospitals  that  would  participate.  These  hospitals  would  then  have  panels  of  people  who  decide,  on  a  person-by-person  basis,  which  patients  qualify  for  medical  marijuana.It  has  yet  to  be  determined  where  the  medical  marijuana  --  or  the  elements  of  it  that  might  be  dispensed  --  will  come  from,  including  who  might  produce  it.Gottfried  estimated  that  tens  of  thousands  of  people  could  get  medical  marijuana  by  virtue  of  this  policy  change,  though  he  insisted  it  is  no  substitute  for  a  more  complete,  far-reaching  program."(Cuomo)  can  take  (this  step)  without  the  need  for  further  legislation,"  the  Manhattan  legislator  said.  "But  to  have  a  truly  comprehensive  and  well-working  system  will  take  legislation."CNN's  Rosa  Flores  and  Yon  Pomrenze  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

At  a  briefing  for  relatives  in  Beijing,  some  were  overcome  and  had  to  be  taken  from  a  hotel  on  stretchers.  In  Kuala  Lumpur,  a  woman  walked  out  of  a  briefing  for  families  in  tears."My  son,  my  daughter-in-law  and  granddaughter  were  all  on  board.  All  three  family  members  are  gone.  I  am  desperate!"  a  woman  said  outside  the  Beijing  briefing.Another  woman  came  out  of  the  briefing  room  screaming,  expressing  doubts  about  the  Malaysian  conclusion."Where  is  the  proof?"  she  said.  "You  haven't  confirmed  the  suspected  objects  to  tell  us  no  one  survived."Sarah  Bajc,  the  partner  of  one  of  three  Americans  aboard  the  flight,  Philip  Wood,  canceled  all  media  interviews  after  the  announcement."I  need  closure  to  be  certain,  but  cannot  keep  on  with  public  efforts  against  all  odds,"  she  wrote.  "I  still  feel  his  presence,  so  perhaps  it  was  his  soul  all  along."A  committee  representing  some  of  the  families  of  the  154  Chinese  and  Taiwanese  passengers  aboard  the  missing  aircraft  sharply  criticized  the  Malaysian  government  in  a  statement,  accusing  authorities  of  deliberate  search  delays  and  cover-ups,  China's  state-run  CCTV  reported."If  our  154  relatives  aboard  lost  their  lives  due  to  such  reasons,  then  Malaysia  Airlines,  the  Malaysian  government  and  the  Malaysian  military  are  the  real  murderers  that  killed  them,"  the  statement  said,  according  to  CCTV.Malaysian  police  have  interviewed  more  than  50  people  in  their  investigation  into  the  missing  plane,  Inspector-General  of  Police  Tan  Sri  Khalid  Abu  Bakal  told  Malaysia's  national  news  agency  Bernama.He  said  police  are  still  focusing  on  four  possibilities  about  what  happened:  a  potential  hijacking,  sabotage,  psychological  issues  or  personal  problems  of  the  passengers  and/or  crew."Such  cases  may  take  up  to  a  year,"  Khalid  said,  "so  please  don't  jump  to  conclusions  that  the  police  are  slow."While  investigators  have  yet  to  find  even  a  piece  of  the  plane,  the  Prime  Minister  based  his  announcement  on  what  he  described  as  unprecedented  analysis  of  satellite  data  by  British  satellite  provider  Inmarsat  and  the  British  Air  Accidents  Investigation  Branch.  He  didn't  describe  the  nature  of  the  analysis.But  he  said  the  data  --  drawn  from  satellite  pings  the  ill-fated  airliner  continued  to  send  throughout  its  final  flight  --  made  it  clear  that  the  plane's  last  position  was  in  the  middle  of  the  remote  southern  Indian  Ocean,  "far  from  any  possible  landing  sites."He  begged  reporters  to  respect  the  privacy  of  relatives."For  them,  the  past  few  weeks  have  been  heartbreaking,"  he  said.  "I  know  this  news  must  be  harder  still."The  Prime  Minister's  statement  came  after  the  airline  sent  a  text  message  to  relatives  saying  it  "deeply  regrets  that  we  have  to  assume  beyond  any  reasonable  doubt  that  MH370  has  been  lost  and  that  none  of  those  onboard  survived."The  airline  said  it  was  making  plans  to  fly  families  to  Australia  once  wreckage  is  found.How  'groundbreaking'  number  crunching  found  path  of  Flight  370Debris  spotted  in  Indian  OceanThe  announcement  came  the  same  day  as  Australian  officials  said  they  had  spotted  two  objects  in  the  southern  Indian  Ocean  that  could  be  related  to  the  flight,  which  has  been  missing  since  March  8  with  239  people  aboard.One  object  is  "a  grey  or  green  circular  object,"  and  the  other  is  "an  orange  rectangular  object,"  the  Australian  Maritime  Safety  Authority  said.Hishammuddin  Hussein,  Malaysia's  acting  transportation  minister,  said  Monday  that  Australian  authorities  hoped  to  retrieve  the  objects  by  Tuesday  morning.  The  Australian  naval  ship  HMAS  Success  was  steaming  toward  the  location  at  last  word  Monday  evening.The  objects  are  the  latest  in  a  series  of  sightings,  including  "suspicious  objects"  reported  earlier  Monday  by  a  Chinese  military  plane  that  was  searching  in  the  same  region,  authorities  said.A  U.S.  surveillance  plane  sent  to  follow  up  was  unable  to  find  the  objects,  and  so  far,  none  of  the  sightings  has  been  definitively  linked  to  Flight  370.Ten  aircraft  --  from  Australia,  China,  the  United  States  and  Japan  --  searched  the  area  Monday.China  said  Monday  after  the  Prime  Minister's  announcement  that  it  would  be  sending  more  ships  to  help  search  for  the  aircraft.China  has  a  particularly  large  stake  in  the  search:  Its  citizens  made  up  about  two-thirds  of  the  passengers  on  the  missing  Boeing  777.Beijing,  which  has  repeatedly  called  on  Malaysian  authorities  to  step  up  efforts  to  find  the  plane,  repeated  those  calls  Monday  after  the  Prime  Minister's  announcement.China  is  paying  "high  attention"  to  the  Malaysian  announcement  that  the  plane  had  gone  down  in  the  ocean,  and  asked  authorities  there  for  "all  information  and  evidence  leading  up  to  such  a  conclusion,"  according  to  a  statement  posted  on  the  Chinese  Foreign  Ministry's  website.Satellites  focus  searchAmid  a  vast  regional  search  that  at  one  point  spanned  nearly  3  million  square  miles,  searchers  have  homed  in  on  the  southern  Indian  Ocean  in  recent  days  following  satellite  images  that  have  spotted  a  variety  of  unknown  objects  in  an  area  roughly  1,500  miles  southwest  of  Perth,  Australia.Australia  reported  the  first  images  in  the  area,  followed  by  China  and  France.The  area  also  lies  on  a  projected  flight  path  for  the  aircraft  calculated  in  part  from  the  satellite  pings  sent  by  the  plane  after  other  communications  systems  had  shut  down.Australian  officials  have  repeatedly  warned  that  the  objects  may  not  be  from  the  missing  plane.  They  could  be  containers  that  have  fallen  off  cargo  ships,  for  example.On  Saturday,  searchers  found  a  wooden  pallet  as  well  as  strapping  belts,  Australian  authorities  said.  Hishammuddin  said  Monday  that  wooden  pallets  were  among  the  items  on  Flight  370.  But  such  pallets  are  also  common  in  the  ocean  shipping  industry,  so  it  they  may  be  unrelated  to  the  flight.The  investigation  into  the  passenger  jet's  disappearance  has  already  produced  a  wealth  of  false  leads  and  speculative  theories.  Previously,  when  the  hunt  was  focused  on  the  South  China  Sea  near  where  the  plane  dropped  off  civilian  radar,  a  number  of  sightings  of  debris  proved  to  be  unrelated  to  the  search.How  they're  searching  for  debrisPlane  said  to  have  flown  lowMonday's  dramatic  developments  came  after  a  weekend  during  which  other  nuggets  of  information  emerged  about  the  movements  of  the  errant  jetliner  on  the  night  it  vanished.Military  radar  tracking  shows  that  after  making  a  sharp  turn  over  the  South  China  Sea,  the  plane  changed  altitude  as  it  headed  toward  the  Strait  of  Malacca,  an  official  close  to  the  investigation  into  the  missing  flight  told  CNN.The  plane  flew  as  low  as  12,000  feet  at  some  point  before  it  disappeared  from  radar,  according  to  the  official.  It  had  reportedly  been  flying  at  a  cruising  altitude  of  35,000  feet  when  contact  was  lost  with  air  traffic  control.The  sharp  turn  seemed  to  be  intentional,  the  official  said,  because  executing  it  would  have  taken  the  Boeing  777  two  minutes  --  a  time  period  during  which  the  pilot  or  co-pilot  could  have  sent  an  emergency  signal  if  there  had  been  a  fire  or  other  emergency.Authorities  say  the  plane  didn't  send  any  emergency  signals,  though  some  analysts  say  it's  still  unclear  whether  the  pilots  tried  but  weren't  able  to  communicate  because  of  a  catastrophic  failure  of  the  aircraft's  systems.The  official,  who  is  not  authorized  to  speak  to  the  media,  told  CNN  that  the  area  the  plane  flew  in  after  the  turn  is  a  heavily  trafficked  air  corridor  and  that  flying  at  12,000  feet  would  have  kept  the  jet  well  out  of  the  way  of  that  traffic.Was  plane's  route  reprogrammed?Also  over  the  weekend,  Malaysian  authorities  said  the  last  transmission  from  the  missing  aircraft's  reporting  system  showed  it  heading  to  Beijing  --  a  revelation  that  appears  to  undercut  the  theory  that  someone  reprogrammed  the  plane's  flight  path  before  the  co-pilot  signed  off  with  air  traffic  controllers  for  the  last  time.That  reduces,  but  doesn't  rule  out,  suspicions  about  foul  play  in  the  cockpit.Last  week,  CNN  and  other  news  organizations,  citing  unnamed  sources,  reported  that  authorities  believed  someone  had  reprogrammed  the  aircraft's  flight  computer  before  the  sign-off.CNN  cited  sources  who  believed  the  plane's  flight  computer  must  have  been  reprogrammed  because  it  flew  directly  over  navigational  way  points.  A  plane  controlled  by  a  human  probably  would  not  have  been  so  precise,  the  sources  said.Malaysian  authorities  never  confirmed  that  account,  saying  last  week  that  the  plane's  "documented  flight  path"  had  not  been  altered.On  Sunday,  they  clarified  that  statement  further,  saying  the  plane's  automated  data  reporting  system  included  no  route  changes  in  its  last  burst,  sent  at  1:07  a.m.  --  12  minutes  before  the  last  voice  communication  with  flight  controllers.Analysts  are  divided  about  what  the  latest  information  could  mean.  Some  argue  it's  a  sign  that  mechanical  failure  sent  the  plane  suddenly  off  course.  Others  say  there  are  still  too  many  unknowns  to  eliminate  any  possibilities.CNN  aviation  analyst  Miles  O'Brien  called  the  fresh  details  about  the  flight  a  "game  changer.""Now  we  have  no  evidence  the  crew  did  anything  wrong,"  he  said.  "And  in  fact,  now,  we  should  be  operating  with  the  primary  assumption  being  that  something  bad  happened  to  that  plane  shortly  after  they  said  good  night."If  a  crisis  onboard  caused  the  plane  to  lose  pressure,  he  said,  pilots  could  have  chosen  to  deliberately  fly  lower  to  save  passengers."You  want  to  get  down  to  10,000  feet,  because  that  is  when  you  don't  have  to  worry  about  pressurization.  You  have  enough  air  in  the  atmosphere  naturally  to  keep  everybody  alive,"  he  said.  "So  part  of  the  procedure  for  a  rapid  decompression  ...  it's  called  a  high  dive,  and  you  go  as  quickly  as  you  can  down  that  to  that  altitude."Authorities  have  said  pilot  Zaharie  Ahmad  Shah  was  highly  experienced.  On  Monday,  Malaysian  authorities  said  Flight  370  was  co-pilot  Fariq  Abdul  Hamid's  sixth  flight  in  a  Boeing  777,  and  the  first  time  when  he  was  not  traveling  with  an  instructor  pilot  shadowing  him."We  do  not  see  any  problem  with  him,"  said  Malaysia  Airlines  CEO  Ahmad  Jauhari  Yahya.Whole  world  listens  for  slowly  fading  pingsOcean  search  has  many  challengesClues  lead  to  new  theoriesMichael  Pearson  wrote  and  reported  from  Atlanta;  Mitra  Mobasherat  reported  from  Kuala  Lumpur;  CNN's  Pauline  Chiou,  David  McKenzie  and  Yuli  Yang  contributed  from  Beijing;  CNN's  Jim  Sciutto,  Will  Ripley,  Sara  Sidner,  Catherine  E.

Further  investigation  confirmed  where  Chafe  was  living  and  working,  ultimately  leading  to  his  arrest.</TEXT></DOC>

Love,  best  known  as  a  musician,  actress  and  wife  of  the  late  Nirvana  front  man  Kurt  Cobain,  tweeted  a  picture  of  a  body  of  water  with  the  caption  "really?  look  closer?  check  it  out  @DR24  #MH370  and  its  like  a  mile  away  Pulau  Perak,  where  they  'last'  tracked  it."The  "it"  would  be  the  Boeing  777-200  that  has  been  missing,  along  with  all  aboard,  for  more  than  a  week.  The  picture  Love  tweeted  features  drawn  lines  meant  to  point  to  what  appears  to  be  discolorations  in  the  water  and  possible  debris.Another  tweet  from  Love  says  "I'm  no  expert  but  up  close  this  does  look  like  a  plane  and  an  oil  slick.  ...  prayers  go  out  to  the  families  #MH370"  with  a  link  to  Tomnod.com,  a  crowdsourcing  site  that  has  enlisted  participants  to  scour  satellite  imagery  for  clues.Love  told  New  York  Magazine's  Daily  Intelligencer  that  "Yeah  I  went  to  the  satellite  site  and  just  uploaded  tons  and  tons  of  pictures.  I  really  doubt  aliens  took  it.  It's  got  to  be  somewhere.  I'm  a  little  obsessive."The  Daily  Intelligencer,  however,  pointed  out  that  Tomnod  ruled  out  the  theory  before  Love  even  offered  it."Although  it  is  still  an  interesting  clue,  it  is  looking  much  more  like  the  other  boats  operating  in  the  region,"  they  reported  Tomnod  as  saying.

But  it's  not  a  hook-up  site,  its  creator  says.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Remember  that  old  tune  "Friday,  I'm  in  Love"?  Well,  some  daters  are  looking  to  make  it  a  reality."I  have  found  a  wonderful  weekend  lover,"  reads  a  testimonial  by  "Leah,  38"  on  the  new  dating  website,  parttimelove.co.uk.  "He  asks  for  no  more,  and  the  times  we  spend  together  are  magical."The  site,  launched  in  early  January,  is  the  brainchild  of  relationship  author  and  blogger  Helen  Croydon.  Its  target  demographic  is  people  who  want  to  be  independent  but  also  want  to  fall  in  love,  she  says.Some  may  wonder  whether  Part  Time  Love  is  simply  the  newest  in  a  line  of  dating  sites  where  users  troll  for  one-night  stands.  But  the  site  isn't  just  Tinder  with  a  romantic  sheen,  if  you  believe  its  marketing  spiel."We  are  not  a  no-strings  website.  We  are  for  singles  looking  for  regular  partners  with  mutual  attraction,  genuine  friendship,  respect  and  a  magical  spark  but  whom  have  no  expectations  of  moving  in  after  three  months  and  value  their  free  time  and  independence,"  claims  the  site,  which  users  must  opt  into  via  other,  more  established  dating  sites.Croydon  asserts  that  a  low-maintenance  or  part-time  relationship  is  distinctively  different  than  the  eloquently  named  "booty  call,"  or  the  even  more  lucid  "casual  encounter"  in  that  the  goal  is  lasting  love.Croydon  admits  it's  not  for  everyone.  She  envisions  her  demographic  as  users  in  their  mid-to-late  30s  and  early  40s  who  are  set  in  their  ways  and  might  find  it  difficult  to  adapt  domestically  to  a  new  partner."They're  realistic  on  the  fairytale,"  she  says.In  2011,  writer  Laura  Tennant  wrote  a  column  "We're  happily  semi-detached"  in  a  British  newspaper  about  her  part-time  cohabitation  with  boyfriend,  Sean  Walsh.  She  had  just  completed  a  difficult  divorce  --  "aren't  they  all?"  she  joked  in  an  e-mail  with  CNN  --  and  wasn't  sure  she  ever  wanted  to  get  married  again.  What  she  was  sure  of  was  that  she  and  Walsh  worked  really  well  together  as  the  relationship  stood.They  were  "living  apart  together,"  as  she  called  it.Fast  forward  to  2014,  and  now  Tennant  is  engaged  to  marry  Walsh."Over  time,  Sean  and  I  have  become  more  and  more  sure  that  we  are  each  other's  soulmate  and  life  partner,"  she  says.  "And  we  have  slowly  but  surely  got  to  the  point  where  we  are  ready  to  make  the  ultimate  commitment  to  each  other."But,  that  doesn't  mean  they  each  won't  have  their  alone  time.The  couple  is  planning  for  Walsh  to  have  a  pied-à-terre,  but  not  in  the  Ernest  Hemingway  sense."As  it  is,  it  is  totally  workable,  albeit  somewhat  unusual,"  she  says.  "We  are  working  out  logistics  at  the  moment,  but  I  reckon  we  will  live  together  and  Sean  will  rent  a  work-live  space  nearby  where  he  can  write,  sometimes  sleep,  and  recharge  his  batteries."Croydon  explores  what  she  calls  "low-maintenance  relationships"  in  her  new  book  "Screw  the  Fairytale:  A  Modern  Girl's  Guide  to  Sex  and  Love,"  in  which  she  debunks  the  traditional  ideal  of  the  omnipresent  partner.  Croydon  says  she  never  wants  to  get  married  or  have  kids.  (She's  also  quite  familiar  with  unorthodox  dating  styles;  her  first  book,  "Sugar  Daddy  Diaries,"  was  about  her  penchant  for  older  men.)"You  don't  have  to  see  someone  three  to  four  nights  a  week  to  express  love,"  she  told  CNN  over  the  phone  from  London."In  every  other  aspect  of  life,  we've  gone  for  convenience,  independence  and  where  individualism  is  promoted,"  she  says.  "Yet,  you  have  this  socially  approved  model  of  relationship  that  you  live  together."Croydon  says  for  it  to  work,  the  partners'  emphasis  is  still  on  a  genuine  relationship,  in  that  there  is  romance  and  sparks  but  "without  all  the  monotony  and  obligation  of  a  full-time  relationship."Jill  Weber,  a  Virginia-based  clinical  psychologist  and  author  of  "Having  Sex,  Wanting  Intimacy:  Why  Women  Settle  for  One-Sided  Relationships"  says  this  particular  style  of  dating  can  certainly  feel  empowering  as  it  allows  daters  to  compartmentalize  the  relationship."It  protects  you;  there's  less  vulnerability,"  she  says.Sooner  or  later,  though,  she  says  one  or  both  partners  might  catch  stronger  feelings  and  want  something  more."Ultimately,  what  connects  us  with  one  another  is  being  vulnerable,"  she  asserts.On  the  opposite  end  of  the  spectrum,  Weber  says  it's  also  important  for  each  partner  to  feel  like  they  have  their  own  life."You  should  feel  safe  and  at  ease  in  your  relationship,"  she  says,  meaning  that  you  aren't  constantly  worrying  where  your  partner  is  and  vice  versa.  If  that's  not  the  case,  a  conversation  about  space  is  in  order.  Failing  that,  it  might  be  time  to  re-evaluate  the  healthiness  of  the  relationship.As  for  Croydon,  she's  still  single  and  ready  to  mingle  part-time.Would  you  use  a  website  to  find  a  part-time  lover?

It  will  either  put  you  to  sleep  or  get  you  thinking.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Washington  (CNN)  --  It  might  not  have  had  the  drama  of  a  Sen.  Ted  Cruz  overnight  talk-a-thon,  but  some  Senate  Democrats  hope  their  all-night  effort  draws  similar  attention  to  their  issue  that  has  been  stalled  in  Congress:  climate  change.Mirroring  a  tactic  employed  by  Cruz  during  his  marathon  effort  aimed  at  derailing  Obamacare,  Sen.  Ed  Markey  of  Massachusetts  read  from  Dr.  Seuss  during  his  turn  speaking  just  before  midnight  Tuesday.He  chose  the  children's  book  "The  Lorax,"  which  touches  on  the  environment."But  now  says  the  Once-ler,  now  that  you're  here,  the  word  of  the  Lorax  seems  perfectly  clear.  Unless  someone  like  you  cares  a  whole  awful  lot,  nothing  is  going  to  get  better,"  Markey  read,  then  added  his  own  thoughts:  "So  to  my  colleagues  here  in  the  Senate  and  everyone  watching  and  following  tonight  thank  you  for  caring  a  whole  awful  lot."Twenty-eight  Dems  participateThe  effort  by  28  Democratic  senators  was  launched  in  part  by  Rhode  Island's  Sheldon  Whitehouse,  who  credits  warming  oceans  for  the  state's  disappearing  idyllic  and  populated  coastline.Whitehouse  has  spoken  about  the  issue  every  week  the  Senate  has  been  in  session  for  the  past  two  years,  culminating  in  60  speeches  that  have  gone  largely  unnoticed  by  the  public.He  and  fellow  Democratic  members  of  the  climate  change  caucus  hope  their  all-night  session  propels  the  issue  back  into  the  spotlight  since  it  has  been  on  the  back  burner  for  several  years."There's  a  group  of  senators  who  have  not  given  up  on  getting  something  done  on  climate  change  and  aren't  willing  to  just  sit  quietly  through  the  current  status  quo,"  Whitehouse  told  CNN  in  a  phone  interview  on  Monday.After  climate  change  legislation,  one  of  President  Barack  Obama's  top  three  priorities  entering  office,  failed  in  2010,  the  issue  fell  off  the  radar.  The  President  rarely  talked  about  it.  Congress  did  little  to  address  it."If  you  were  looking  for  reassurance  that  somebody  took  this  seriously  in  Washington,  you  weren't  finding  much,"  Whitehouse  said.Why  the  renewed  focus  on  climate  change?The  third  railClimate  change  turned  into  an  issue  that  few  wanted  to  touch,  especially  those  facing  difficult  reelection  campaigns.When  Democrats  tried  to  pass  legislation  that  would  have  capped  carbon  emissions,  skepticism  around  climate  change  reached  an  all-time  high.According  to  Gallup,  48%  of  respondents  said  the  issue  on  its  face  is  exaggerated.Opponents,  led  by  organizations  and  businesses  involved  in  the  fossil  fuel  industry,  successfully  turned  public  opinion  and  stopped  any  efforts  in  its  tracks.The  death  of  climate  changeOpponents  successfully  renamed  cap  and  trade,  which  referred  to  legislation  that  placed  limits  on  carbon  emissions  by  power  plants  and  other  major  polluters,  to  "cap  and  tax."Amid  recession,  they  argued  the  proposal  would  kill  jobs  and  raise  energy  prices.Key  players  in  changing  the  dynamic  of  the  debate  were  the  Koch  Brothers,  billionaire  businessmen  who  made  their  fortune  in  the  oil  and  gas  industry  and  have  also  spent  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  trying  to  defeat  Democrats.Cap  and  trade  would  have  cut  into  Koch  industries'  revenue,  which  is  estimated  to  hover  around  $100  billion  per  year.Tim  Phillips,  the  President  of  Americans  for  Prosperity,  the  political  organization  backed  by  the  Kochs,  said  that  killing  climate  change  legislation  in  a  Democratic-controlled  Washington  was  his  organization's  major  accomplishment."Stopping  cap  and  trade  was  a  crucial  policy  victory  that  most  folks  would  have  thought  impossible  at  the  time,"  he  said  during  a  recent  interview.  "Defeating  that  was  an  enormous  policy  victory  that  has  lasting  policy  repercussions  in  a  good  way."Not  only  did  they  kill  the  legislation,  they  successfully  helped  to  elect  a  crop  of  new  lawmakers  who  don't  believe  that  human  activity  is  the  cause  of  global  warming.According  to  the  League  of  Conservation  Voters,  100  lawmakers  currently  fall  into  their  ranks.Whitehouse  had  this  response:  It's  "something  that  his  grandchildren  will  be  very  ashamed  of."Opinion:  Why  are  we  still  debating  climate  change?The  top  Republican  in  the  Senate,  Sen.  Mitch  McConnell,  took  to  the  floor  Monday  afternoon  to  deride  the  climate  change  talkers  as  "cruel.""Families  are  losing  work  because  of  government  attacks  on  the  coal  industry,"  McConnell  said,  referring  to  his  home  state  of  Kentucky.  "And  tonight  you're  going  to  hear  30  hours  of  excuses  from  a  group  of  people  who  think  that's  OK.  Well  it's  not  OK.  It's  cruel."A  revival?The  death  of  cap  and  trade  triggered  new  fears  among  environmentally  friendly  legislators."It  is  unfortunate,"  Whitehouse  said.  "History  will  look  back  at  the  propaganda  effort  of  the  carbon  polluters  as  one  of  the  most  sophisticated  and  complex  propaganda  efforts  that  human  kind  had  to  withstand."But  since  then,  the  public  has  started  to  shift  its  opinion.According  to  Gallup,  41%  now  say  that  climate  change  is  exaggerated  --  7  points  lower  than  its  high  in  2010.  And  the  number  of  those  who  say  the  seriousness  of  the  issue  is  underestimated  is  on  the  rise.Now  Whitehouse  thinks  it's  his  side's  turn  to  make  a  move.  He  has  buy  in  from  the  Senate  Majority  Leader  Harry  Reid  who  told  reporters  last  week  that  it  is  "the  worst  problem"  the  world  faces.But  they  have  to  start  at  Square  One  by  working  to  convince  the  public  that  climate  change  is  real.The  Senate's  all-night  session  is  well-timed.Wealthy  former  hedge  fund  manager  Tom  Steyer  is  willing  to  spend  Koch-like  money  to  push  the  issue  of  climate  change  and  defeat  skeptics  in  the  2014  midterms.Whitehouse,  who  has  known  Steyer  since  college,  said  if  he  can  make  good  on  his  pledge  to  infuse  the  effort  with  $100  million,  he  would  "help  to  neutralize  an  incredibly  one-sided  spending.""We  can  change  the  conversation  very  quickly."The  absenteesBut  not  all  Democrats  -  and  no  Republicans  -  are  on  board.  Notable  senators  were  absent  from  the  overnight  session  Monday  into  Tuesday.They  include  those  who  have  difficult  election  campaigns,  including  Sens.  Mary  Landrieu  of  Louisiana,  Kay  Hagan  of  North  Carolina,  Mark  Pryor  of  Arkansas  and  Mark  Begich  of  Alaska.Republicans  aren't  letting  Landrieu's  absence  go  unnoticed.The  National  Republican  Senatorial  Committee,  which  aims  to  get  Republicans  elected  to  the  Senate,  put  out  a  web  video  Tuesday,  criticizing  Landrieu  for  allowing  the  talk-a-thon  to  take  place.  The  video  also  argues  she  doesn't  stand  up  enough  for  American  energy.Tiernan  Sittenfeld,  a  senior  vice  president  of  the  League  of  Conservation  Voters,  said  the  fact  that  just  over  half  of  the  Democratic  caucus  is  willing  to  speak  in  the  wee  hours  of  the  night  about  climate  change  is  "incredibly  exciting"  and  "good  politics."In  fact,  Whitehouse  is  working  to  ensure  that  climate  change  is  a  topic  in  the  2016  presidential  race  by  traveling  to  Iowa  next  week  to  talk  to  voters  and  activists.He  insists  he  is  not  running  for  President  but  wants  to  make  sure  those  who  do  talk  about  the  impact  of  climate  change.Obama's  engagementAfter  a  hiatus  post  2010,  the  Obama  administration  is  also  back  in  the  climate  change  game.President  Barack  Obama  proposed  his  Climate  Action  Plan  this  past  summer  that  would  create  carbon  pollution  standards  for  power  plants  and  expand  renewable  energy  production.  And  in  his  new  budget  plan,  the  President  proposed  funding  to  study  the  impacts  of  climate  change.Secretary  of  State  John  Kerry  said  last  month  that  climate  change  is  the  "greatest  challenge  of  our  generation."Whitehouse  is  optimistic  that  the  tide  is  turning.  So  much  so  that  he  traveled  to  Sea  Island,  Georgia,  this  past  weekend  to  speak  at  the  conservative  American  Enterprise  Institute  conference."I  think  it  went  pretty  well,"  he  said.Is  it  time  to  agree  on  climate  change?CNN's  Ted  Barrett,  Ashley  Killough  and  Jonathan  Helman  contributed  to  this  story.</TEXT></DOC>

Travelers  who  buy  alcohol  or  other  liquids  at  those  duty-free  airport  shops  abroad  can  bring  them  into  the  United  States  on  an  international  flight  and  carry  them  onto  a  connecting  flight.This  slight  relaxing  of  the  TSA's  3-1-1  rule  affects  only  some  people  returning  home  to  the  United  States  from  other  countries.Before  January  31,  a  traveler  who  purchased  wine  at  the  Paris  airport  duty-free  shop  before  flying  to  New  York  and  on  to  Omaha,  Nebraska,  faced  a  dilemma.  Once  he  cleared  U.S.  Customs  in  New  York,  the  TSA  required  him  to  pack  any  liquids  into  his  checked  luggage  before  clearing  TSA  security  to  fly  to  Nebraska.Now,  the  TSA  will  permit  international  travelers  to  carry  liquids  in  excess  of  100  mL  in  their  carry-on  baggage,  "provided  they  were  purchased  in  duty-free  shops  and  placed  in  secure,  tamper-evident  bags  (STEBs),"  according  to  the  TSA  website.The  liquids  must  be  screened  and  cleared  by  TSA  checkpoint  security  officers,  utilizing  the  same  bottled  liquid  scanner  technology  that  is  used  to  screen  medically  necessary  liquids  in  quantities  greater  than  3.4  ounces,  according  to  a  TSA  official.Just  don't  drink  your  duty-free  booze  on  that  flight  to  celebrate.  That's  still  not  allowed.The  safest  bet  is  still  to  check  your  liquids.  That's  because  the  agency  still  reserves  the  right  to  not  clear  your  favorite  drink  or  lotion.  Liquids  in  metallic,  opaque  or  ceramic  bottles  or  other  containers  that  cannot  be  scanned  properly  will  not  be  allowed  in  carry-on  luggage.</TEXT></DOC>

Then  he  wounded  two  more  deputies  while  running  from  the  law.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  A  deputy  stopped  to  help  a  motorist  in  Utah  on  Thursday,  and  the  motorist  allegedly  shot  him  dead.  Then  he  wounded  two  more  deputies  while  running  from  the  law.That's  how  Utah  County  Sheriff  Jim  Tracy  described  a  high-speed,  bullet-riddled  rampage  that  went  on  for  50  miles  across  two  counties,  until  officers  were  able  to  corner  a  suspect.They  critically  wounded  him  in  a  shootout  --  it  was  the  fourth  time  the  man  opened  fire  while  on  the  run,  the  sheriff  said.The  slain  officer  was  Sgt.  Cory  Wride,  a  deputy  who  had  been  on  the  force  for  19  years.  Tracy  knew  him  well  and  thought  highly  of  him,  he  told  journalists  at  a  news  conference.  Wride  worked  directly  under  him  for  three  years."He  was  a  very  helpful  person,  and  that's  what  he  was  doing,"  Tracy  said,  visibly  moved.  "He  was  helping  people  when  he  stopped."The  wounded  deputies  were  hospitalized  and  underwent  operations.  One  is  expected  to  recover;  the  other  is  in  critical  condition  in  an  intensive  care  unit.The  suspect,  whom  Tracy  declined  to  name,  is  also  expected  to  recover.  He  has  a  "significant"  criminal  history,  Tracy  said.Ambush?Wride  called  in  a  "motorist  assist"  when  he  decided  to  pull  off  the  road  to  aid  what  he  thought  was  a  disabled  vehicle,  Tracy  said.The  suspect  shot  Wride,  while  he  was  still  in  his  squad  car,  with  what  "appears  to  be  a  high-powered  rifle,"  Tracy  said.Then  he  fled  the  scene.When  other  officers  got  the  news,  they  took  up  positions  at  strategic  posts  to  try  to  intercept  the  car  on  the  run.Tracy  fears  the  suspect  may  have  set  up  the  situation  on  purpose  as  a  roadside  ambush."He  may  have  very  well  parked  by  the  side  of  the  road,  hoping  that  some  officer  would  stop  behind  him,"  he  said.Tragic  chaseAfter  the  suspect  fled,  a  deputy  called  in  to  say  that  he  was  pursuing  him.  Seconds  later,  the  officer  was  shot  in  his  vehicle,  wounded  in  the  head,  Tracy  said.The  suspect  raced  away  but  later  wrecked  the  car  he  was  driving.He  looked  for  a  vehicle  to  carjack,  approaching  multiple  people  and  cars,  before  finding  one.  He  later  crashed  it,  too,  Tracy  said.Along  the  way,  he  continued  shooting.When  deputies  caught  up  with  him,  the  man  fired  at  them,  critically  wounding  yet  another  deputy,  the  sheriff's  office  said.  The  officers  wounded  the  suspect  in  the  gunfight  and  took  him  into  custody.The  sheriff's  office  plans  to  obtain  a  warrant  to  search  the  suspect's  home  to  try  to  establish  a  motive  for  the  shooting  rampage.Tracy  personally  the  broke  news  of  Sgt.  Wride's  killing  to  his  family."He  was  a  good  man,"  the  sheriff  said.Wride  leaves  behind  a  wife  and  five  children.CNN's  Suzanne  Presto  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Who'd  want  THAT  job?</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Lisa  Camooso  Miller  is  a  partner  at  Blueprint  Communications  based  in  the  Washington,  D.C.,  area.  She  is  the  former  RNC  communications  director,  worked  for  two  New  Jersey  Republican  governors  and  served  as  the  political  director  for  the  New  Jersey  GOP.(CNN)  --  Governor  of  New  Jersey?  Who'd  want  THAT  job?It's  a  state  where  politics  have  long  been  considered  a  bloodsport,  where  corrupt  politicians  are  as  common  as  slices  of  pizza,  where  fights  can  quickly  get  personal,  and  where  the  top  politician  lives  a  life  constantly  on  the  edge.It's  a  state  whose  politics  have  been  awash  in  scandals  for  decades,  particularly  within  its  towns  and  communities.  In  the  past  20  years,  the  state's  biggest  cultural  exports  have  been  a  show  about  organized  crime  and  "Jersey  Shore"  --  a  show,  as  most  New  Jersey  residents  will  be  quick  to  tell  you  starred  mostly  New  Yorkers.But,  in  spite  of  this,  New  Jerseyans  take  great  pride  in  their  state  and  have  taken  great  pride  in  their  governor.Before  taking  the  state's  highest  office,  Chris  Christie  toppled  corrupt  New  Jersey  mayors  like  they  were  dominoes,  sending  them  to  jail  one  after  another.  It  was  one  of  the  most  impressive  demonstrations  of  good  government  in  the  state's  history.Borger:  Is  Chris  Christie  presidential?As  governor,  he  was  lauded  for  his  leadership  and  his  outspokenness,  and  he  was  criticized  by  some  in  his  own  party  for  his  praise  of  President  Obama  after  Hurricane  Sandy.  But  what  never  wavered  was  Christie's  commitment  to  taking  on  the  big  issues.So  for  many  New  Jerseyans,  it's  disappointing  to  see  Christie  now  focused  on  answering  for  the  actions  of  staff.  What  they  did  was  wrong,  but  if  you  stop  and  look  more  closely,  those  attacking  him  most  harshly  clearly  have  their  own  agendas.Take  Democratic  Sen.  Loretta  Weinberg.  She'd  love  to  make  Christie's  downfall  her  legacy.Prior  to  this  current  drama,  Weinberg  is  best  known  for  being  a  victim  of  the  Bernie  Madoff  scam,  and  then  for  drawing  on  a  pension  system  to  supplement  her  legislative  salary.  She  and  Christie  have  been  battling  for  years,  and  she's  seeing  an  opportunity  for  payback.Meanwhile,  Democratic  Assemblyman  Jon  Wisniewski,  another  Christie  foe,  is  dying  for  a  better  position  in  leadership,  even  though  he's  deputy  speaker,  a  powerful  chairman  and  the  new  head  of  an  investigative  committee.  He's  certainly  got  an  eye  on  the  front  office  himself.And  Congressman  Frank  Pallone?  He's  only  spent  decades  trying  to  run  for  statewide  office.  He'd  love  to  take  down  Christie  and  ignore  the  fact  that  tourism  ads  are  regular  practice  in  New  Jersey  or  any  other  state  with  an  abundant  coastline.  The  congressman  certainly  never  complained  about  tourism  ads  during  the  25  years  he's  represented  a  district  that  benefited  from  those  very  tourist  dollars.Ad  firm  head:  We  were  asked  about  using  Christie  in  ad  campaignIt's  not  just  New  Jersey  Democrats  who  are  playing  politics  with  the  outspoken  governor  and  possible  candidate  for  president  in  2016.  Democrats  on  the  national  level  are  sending  fundraising  letters  and  raising  money  on  the  backs  of  the  popular  governor.  They'll  do  whatever  it  takes  to  clear  the  field  for  Hillary  Clinton.But  the  most  disappointing  attacks  are  coming  from  the  right  wing  of  the  Republican  Party.  After  two  crushing  presidential  elections  and  a  paralyzed  Congress,  our  party  is  badly  in  need  of  leadership.  With  a  strong,  outspoken  candidate,  Republicans  could  be  right  back  on  top.  Demonstrated  leadership  is  what  will  be  needed  in  the  big  domestic  fights  that  are  right  over  the  horizon,  as  well  as  those  brewing  overseas.  Just  don't  let  the  candidate  be  from  New  Jersey.They  say  that  if  everyone  hates  you,  you  must  be  doing  something  right.Can  Christie  change  the  subject?Last  week  Christie  held  an  exhausting  two-hour  press  conference  to  answer  questions  about  Fort  Lee.  It  could  not  have  been  easy  to  distance  himself  from  his  two-time  campaign  manager  --  the  man  who  would  have  run  Christie's  presidential  campaign  should  he  choose  to  run.  Try  to  remember  the  last  time  you  saw  a  politician  separate  himself  from  someone  that  powerful  in  the  organization.  I'm  hard  pressed  to  find  one.This  week  in  his  speech,  Christie  again  addressed  the  issue.  But  what  he  did  next  took  great  leadership.  He  proposed  longer  school  days.  He  proposed  changes  to  the  state  tax  code.  He  took  on  the  pension  system.Christie  still  isn't  afraid  to  do  big  things.  The  guy  is  gearing  up  for  the  next  big  fight.  The  fight  for  New  Jersey.  For  now,  anyway.The  long  shadow  of  politics,  both  Democrat  and  Republican  will  keep  hovering  --  as  will  the  national  media  --  waiting  for  his  next  move,  eyeing  his  fundraising  trips,  watching  for  early  signs  of  2016  interest.  None  of  which  is  going  to  deter  the  governor  from  doing  what  is  necessary.There's  something  to  be  said  for  a  politician  who  makes  tough  decisions.  What  also  should  be  said  is,  governor,  thanks  for  taking  the  job.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Lisa  Camooso  Miller.</TEXT></DOC>

The  charges  against  him  include  two  counts  of  aggravated  assault,  a  weapons  violation  and  reckless  endangerment."The  male  that  turned  himself  in  ...  has  been  deemed  the  shooter  based  on  the  investigation  thus  far,"  said  Lt.  John  Stanford,  a  police  spokesman.The  shooting  occurred  about  3:30  p.m.  Friday  in  the  gymnasium  at  Delaware  Valley  Charter  High  School.Detective  Don  Suchinsky  said  Saturday  that  a  second  male  held  for  questioning  was  released  to  his  mother.  Another  juvenile  was  questioned  and  released  Friday.The  shooter  was  in  the  school  gym  with  seven  other  students,  city  police  Commissioner  Charles  Ramsey  said.  Some  were  playing  basketball  and  others  standing  in  a  corner  when  he  pulled  a  gun  and  fired.The  victims  were  an  18-year-old  female  and  17-year-old  male,  police  said.  She  was  struck  in  the  rear  of  the  left  arm,  with  the  bullet  perforating  her  bicep  and  striking  the  boy  in  the  shoulder.  They  were  taken  to  a  local  hospital,  police  said,  and  their  wounds  are  not  life-threatening.The  incident  was  at  least  the  second  shooting  at  or  near  a  school  this  week  in  the  Olney  neighborhood.Lockdown,  searchThe  school  went  into  lockdown  as  law  enforcement  officers  searched  students  and  let  them  out  of  the  school,  said  Stanford.  They  determined  that  it  wasn't  an  active  shooter  incident.The  shooter  had  left  the  scene.Not  long  after  the  lockdown,  Philadelphia  police  posted  a  message  on  Twitter,  saying  they  had  a  suspect  in  custody.  They  later  released  the  15-year-old  male,  who  was  "completely  cleared  by  investigators,"  Stanford  said.On  Saturday,  police  said  school  security  officials  provided  inaccurate  information  about  the  teen  who  was  cleared  and  released.What  exactly  happened  in  the  gym  remains  unclear."We  don't  know  the  motives,"  Ramsey  said,  "don't  know  if  it  was  an  accident,  don't  know  if  it  was  intentional."Many  unknownsSurveillance  video  captured  the  incident,  Stanford  said.  But  police  do  not  know  how  many  shots  were  fired,  Ramsey  said.  No  shell  was  found  at  the  scene.Police  searched  for  the  weapon  late  Friday  in  trash  cans,  along  railroad  tracks  and  other  spots  around  a  nearby  major  urban  transit  station,  transit  spokesman  Andrew  Busch  said.Commissioner  Ramsey  seemed  frustrated  about  school  shootings  reported  across  America."People  send  their  kids  to  school;  they  shouldn't  have  to  pick  them  up  at  the  hospital,"  he  said.  "These  kind  of  things  just  absolutely  should  not  happen."CNN's  Greg  Botelho  and  Susan  Candiotti  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Send  us  your  photos  and  videos  of  the  newest  tech  trends  you've  seen.Las  Vegas  (CNN)  --  Some  people  think  wearable  gadgets  look  cool.  Perhaps  they  rock  their  Google  Glass  while  out  at  happy  hour,  or  flash  the  latest  crowd-funded  smart  watch  at  the  office.While  the  devices  are  undoubtedly  conversation  starters,  and  the  look  may  be  coveted  in  some  circles,  for  the  most  part  wearable  technology  has  a  fashion  problem.  At  the  Consumer  Electronics  Show  in  Las  Vegas  this  week,  wearable  devices  are  everywhere,  and  some  are  finally  trying  to  break  out  of  the  gadget  world  and  into  the  fashion  world.Wearables  is  a  broad  and  fast-growing  category  that,  as  the  name  implies,  includes  any  small  piece  of  technology  that  can  be  worn.  Research  firm  ABI  estimates  the  wearables  market  will  hit  $6  billion  by  2018.There  are  "smart"  glasses,  watches,  bracelets,  brooches,  visors,  necklaces  and  even  bras.  Straps  secure  small  sensors  against  arms,  chest,  head  or  legs.  There  are  even  wearables  for  dogs,  cats  and  children.  The  tasks  wearables  accomplish  are  as  varied  as  the  body  parts  they  adorn.The  technology  inside  these  devices  is  moving  ahead  while  the  design  side  stagnates.  Sensors  are  getting  smaller,  cheaper  and  more  advanced.  It's  possible  that  the  technology  will  become  so  advanced  that  trackers  could  bypass  the  design  problem  altogether  by  shrinking  down  electronic  elements  enough  that  they  can  be  invisibly  embedded  in  regular  clothing,  hats,  shoes  and  belts.But  not  every  company  sees  that  on  the  horizon."We  don't  think  the  trackers  we  see  today  are  going  to  go  away  in  favor  of  a  sensor-laden  shirt  or  bra,"  said  Woody  Scal,  the  chief  revenue  officer  at  fitness  tracker  company  Fitbit.Fitness  trackers  embrace  the  funThe  most  popular  wearables  are  fitness  trackers,  which  use  sensors  to  detect  movement,  heart  rate,  body  temperature,  breathing,  sleep  patterns,  location  and  speed.  In  the  fitness  area  at  CES,  low-profile  and  colorful  bracelets  inspired  by  the  Nike  FuelBand  and  Fitbit  Flex  and  Force  are  the  most  common.  There  are  the  Garmin  Vivofit  and  Jaybird  Reign  trackers,  and  the  LG  Lifeband  Touch  and  Razer  Nabu,  which  add  in  notifications  from  smartphones.The  new  Sony  Core,  a  small  stick  that  will  fit  in  wrist-wear  like  the  Sony  SmartBand,  acts  as  a  fitness  tracker  but  also  branches  out  into  life  logging.  It  will  be  able  to  track  mundane  daily  activities,  weather,  what  movies  you  watch  and  what  music  you  listen  to,  and  notable  events.  It  can  also  receive  notifications  from  a  paired  smartphone,  will  likely  cost  around  $135,  and  pops  in  and  out  of  various  brightly  colored  wrist  bands.The  traditional  wearable  look  is  passable  for  fitness  gear,  which  is  expected  to  be  bold  and  sporty.  Unfortunately  the  esthetic  doesn't  always  translate  into  everyday  wear.  Most  adults  have  moved  beyond  rocking  brightly  colored  plastic  baubles.  They  want  sleekly  designed  accessories  and  brand  names.Early  stabs  at  jewelrySome  companies  have  smartly  started  to  outsource  the  design  process  to  people  who  know  about  fashion.  Intel  announced  that  it  was  teaming  up  with  hipster  design  label  Opening  Ceremony  on  a  bracelet  that  will  be  sold  at  Barneys,  though  specific  design  and  pricing  details  are  still  unknown.Chip-maker  CSR  worked  with  jeweler  Cellini  to  create  a  surprisingly  nice  Bluetooth  pendant  that  has  a  single,  customizable  light  for  receiving  notifications.  On  the  odd  side,  the  necklace  can  also  be  programmed  to  release  perfume  throughout  the  day.Fitbit  announced  it  was  dabbling  in  jewelry  and  partnering  with  Tory  Burch  on  a  Fitbit  necklace  and  a  bracelet.  The  products  are  still  in  the  design  stage,  but  drawings  show  decent  gold  jewelry  that  would  look  good  even  if  it  didn't  contain  a  tracker.Not  every  company  is  getting  outside  help.  Ezio  makes  gaudy  $129  necklaces  that  pair  with  a  smartphone  and  have  stones  that  light  up  when  someone  calls  or  texts."The  whole  idea  here  is  that  people  --  not  everyone,  but  lots  of  people,  we  believe  --  want  their  fitness  trackers  to  be  even  more  fashionable,"  said  Fitbit's  Scal.  "In  the  male-focused  technology  industry,  we  didn't  think  people  were  paying  enough  attention  to  women,  to  be  honest."Everyone's  making  a  smart  watchAppealing  to  women  is  an  issue  with  one  of  the  most  hyped  wearable  categories:  smart  watches.Gadgets  calling  themselves  smart  watches  range  from  regular  watch  faces  with  light-up  notifications  to  full  featured  Android  phones  worn  on  the  wrist.  The  most  appealing  are  designed  to  look  like  everyday  analog  watches,  while  others  look  like  touch  screens  with  a  strap  tossed  on.  When  well  done,  a  watch  with  a  face  big  enough  to  accommodate  smart  features  can  pass  as  a  nice  men's  accessory,  but  the  majority  are  still  far  too  bulky  and  awkward  for  women.The  focus  on  the  watch  form  factor  has  been  oddly  intense,  with  rumors  of  an  Apple  smart  watch  swirling  for  the  past  year  and  major  companies  like  Samsung  pushing  out  glitchy,  undercooked  technology  like  the  Galaxy  Gear.At  CES,  Intel,  Qualcomm  and  indie  darling  Pebble  all  announced  new  smart  watches,  and  there  was  a  dedicated  area  for  the  wrist  wear.  The  Burg  ($149  to  $399)  takes  a  SIM  card  and  can  make  calls.  The  $130  Cogito  Pop  looks  like  a  classic  watch  but  adds  notifications  from  a  paired  smartphone.  Qualcomm's  $349  Toq  is  similar  to  the  Pebble  but  with  a  full  color  screen  and  fewer  apps.  The  new  Pebble  Steel  is  a  proper  stainless  steel  smart  watch  for  $250.The  most  egregiously  oversized  smart  watch  on  the  CES  floor  is  the  Neptune  Pine,  a  2.4-inch  touchscreen  rectangle  running  Android  Jelly  Bean  that  will  cost  between  $335  and  $395  when  released  in  March.  Technically,  it  has  all  the  features  of  a  fully  functioning  Android  phone,  but  the  cramped  screen  means  it  works  better  as  a  secondary  screen  for  viewing  notifications,  paired  with  a  regular  Android  smartphone  stashed  in  your  bag  or  large  pocket.One  of  the  more  clever  smart  watches  at  CES  is  the  Filip,  a  simple  and  sturdy  phone  and  location  tracker  for  kids  five  to  11  years  old.  Parents  can  program  in  five  phone  numbers  and  the  child  can  make  and  receive  calls  from  those  contacts,  and  receive  but  not  send  texts.  An  accompanying  iOS  or  Android  app  can  be  used  to  pinpoint  the  kid's  location  on  a  map.  The  $199  device  will  be  sold  through  AT&T  stores  and  service  will  cost  just  $10  a  month  without  a  contract.On  your  face  but  out  of  the  wayFor  the  most  part,  wearables  offer  a  limited  selection  of  the  features  already  available  on  smartphones.  The  idea  is  to  save  people  from  the  distracting  task  of  pulling  out  a  phone,  looking  at  it,  tapping  on  it  and  returning  it  safely  to  a  pocket.  At  the  Cogito  booth,  Andres  Muguira  said  a  smart  watch  would  help  wearers  filter  incoming  notifications  so  they  would  "get  to  spend  more  time  with  loved  ones."That's  the  idea  behind  wearable  glasses,  either  the  most  or  least  distracting  wearable  depending  on  your  point  of  view.  There  were  a  number  of  Google  Glass-like  products  at  CES.  GlassUp  shows  e-mails,  texts,  tweets  and  other  messages  on  a  display  directly  in  front  of  the  eye.  The  GlassUp  design  currently  resembles  safety  glasses,  but  a  mockup  of  the  final  version  could  almost  pass  for  a  regular  pair  of  black  thick-framed  specs.Epson's  Moverio  BT-100  glasses  look  like  the  disposable  sunglasses  you  get  after  a  trip  to  the  eye  doctor.  The  industrial  Vuzix  glasses  don't  even  attempt  to  pass  as  normal  glasses,  looking  more  like  a  futuristic  monocle,  but  that  could  change  if  the  company  decides  to  make  a  commercial  product.The  best  outcome  for  smart  glasses,  and  all  other  wearable  tech,  is  blending  in  by  looking  like  products  people  already  want  to  wear.They  could  follow  Google's  lead.  The  company  was  reportedly  talking  to  hip  glasses  company  Warby  Parker  about  possible  design  partnerships  for  future  versions  of  Google  Glass.</TEXT></DOC>

He  was  wearing  shorts  and  a  T-shirt,  his  eyeglasses  still  resting  on  his  head,  according  to  law  enforcement  sources  familiar  with  the  inquiry.Investigators  discovered  close  to  50  envelopes  of  what  they  believed  was  heroin  in  the  apartment,  the  law  enforcement  sources  said.

"That's  when  he  learned  that  his  case  was  accelerated."Though  it  may  seem  like  a  coincidence  of  extraordinary  odds  that  three  young  brothers  would  be  stricken  with  retinitis  pigmentosa,  it  really  isn't.  Though  rare,  the  disease  is  hereditary.Faced  with  the  grim  reality  that  Louie  will  soon  lose  the  ability  to  see  the  world  around  him,  the  Corbetts  decided  to  embark  on  an  international  sightseeing  tour.  "This  year  we're  going  to  try  and  fill  his  world  with  as  many  beautiful  images  as  we  can,"  his  mother  told  CNN.Instructed  to  make  something  of  an  ocular  bucket  list  --  things  and  places  he'd  like  to  see  for  the  first,  only  and  likely  last  time  --  Louie  picked  places  like  the  Grand  Canyon,  Niagara  Falls,  the  Empire  State  Building  and,  in  a  sign  of  the  times,  Google  headquarters  in  California.But  the  thing  Louie  wanted  to  see  the  most  with  his  own  eyes  wasn't  a  landmark  or  a  national  park;  Louie  wanted  to  take  in  a  game,  because  like  many  young  boys  his  age,  Louie  is  a  sports  fan.  But  unlike  most  of  his  Kiwi  peers  who  would  favor  nationally  popular  sports  such  as  rugby  and  cricket,  Louie's  sport  of  choice  is  a  bit  out  of  the  ordinary."For  some  reason  he  really  got  hooked  on  American  basketball,"  his  mom  said.  "He  cares  about  nothing  else.  He  is  really  quite  passionate  about  it."Louie's  number  one  wish  was  to  go  to  Boston  to  see  his  beloved  Celtics  play  a  game.Making  the  list  was  the  easy  part.  Getting  there,  however,  would  be  trickier.  With  Louie's  eyesight  rapidly  fading  --  by  50%  in  the  last  year  alone  --  the  trip  was  going  to  have  to  be  soon.  Like,  matter-of-weeks  soon.That's  when  Warren  Casey,  the  CEO  of  a  Boston-based  software  firm,  stepped  in  with  a  hefty  donation  and  the  promise  to  raise  even  more.  The  fact  that  Casey's  company  is  based  in  Boston  --  the  very  place  Louie  was  headed  --  had  nothing  to  do  with  why  Casey  got  involved.  "That  was  a  random  coincidence,"  he  told  CNN.  "I  did  it  because  the  Corbetts  are  my  next  door  neighbors."Casey  makes  the  24-hour-plus  trek  from  his  Auckland  home  to  his  office  in  downtown  Boston  every  six  weeks.  He  got  Air  New  Zealand  to  pick  up  Louie's  airfare  tab,  and  donated  his  own  points  as  well.Thanks  to  the  generosity  of  Casey  and  his  partners  at  Ceiba  Solutions  --  who  agreed  to  pay  for  the  trip  no  matter  how  much  was  raised  --  as  well  as  the  generosity  of  friends  and  strangers  from  opposite  sides  of  the  planet,  more  than  $25,000  was  raised  in  just  four  weeks."It  is  so  touching,"  Catherine  Corbett  said.  "People  are  just  so  supportive."The  fund-raising  campaign  soon  picked  up  steam  on  social  media,  and  that's  how  Corinne  Grousbeck  heard  about  Louie  two  weeks  ago."Somebody  Tweeted  me  an  article  about  this  boy  in  New  Zealand  and  told  me  I  should  read  it,"  said  Grousbeck,  who  lives  outside  of  Boston.  Grousbeck  is  the  incoming  chair  of  the  trustees  at  the  Perkins  School  for  the  Blind,  the  oldest  school  for  the  visually  impaired  in  the  country.  Her  own  son,  21-year-old  Campbell,  was  blinded  by  a  condition  similar  to  Louie's."I  completely  understood  where  the  Corbetts  were  coming  from  in  wanting  to  build  a  visual  memory  bank  for  (Louie),"  Grousbeck  said.  "It's  an  incredibly  difficult  thing  to  have  to  go  through."But  that  wasn't  the  only  coincidence;  Grousbeck's  husband  just  so  happens  to  own  the  Boston  Celtics."Of  course  when  I  read  about  how  he  was  a  big  Celtics  fan  I  knew  that  we  had  to  have  him  come  for  a  game,"  she  said.The  coincidences  didn't  end  there.When  Grousbeck  learned  that  the  Corbetts  would  be  coming  to  Boston  for  their  game  on  March  5,  she  realized  that  she  would  unfortunately  not  be  able  to  give  Louie  the  best  seats  in  the  house  --  her  seats  --  because  she  had  already  given  them  away."March  5th  had  coincidentally  been  scheduled  as  Perkins  School  for  the  Blind  Night  at  the  TD  Garden  (home  of  the  Celtics),"  she  said.  "We'd  already  given  away  our  seats  to  the  school's  students,  families,  and  donors."While  Grousbeck  will  see  to  it  that  Louie  will  indeed  be  given  great  seats  to  watch  the  Celtics  play  for  the  first  time,  she  thinks  the  real  show  will  take  place  before  tipoff;  the  Perkins  chorus  is  singing  the  national  anthem  that  night."I  think  for  a  12-year-old  like  Louie,  for  him  to  be  able  to  watch  visually  impaired  kids  perform  the  national  anthem  on  a  national  stage,  for  him  to  see  what  blind  people  can  achieve,  that's  going  to  give  him  the  lasting  memory,"she  said.And  if  there  is  room  for  one  final  coincidence  for  young  Louie  on  the  final  leg  of  his  tour,  the  Celtics  won't  be  his  only  stop  while  in  Boston.  He'll  spend  a  day  at  the  world-renowned  Massachusetts  Eye  and  Ear  Infirmary,  where  cutting-edge  ocular  research  is  being  done  that  one  day  might  turn  Louie's  "farewell  to  vision"  tour  into  simply  one  heck  of  a  trip  he  took  when  he  was  12.Those  odds  might  be  long,  but  smart  money  wouldn't  bet  against  Louie  --  he  seems  to  have  serendipity  on  his  side.Sochi  Paralympics:  Skiing  blindTexas  couple  pen  a  'bucket  list'  for  their  baby  with  fatal  illness</TEXT></DOC>

Here  are  14  of  our  favorites.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Kat  Kinsman  is  the  managing  editor  of  CNN  Eatocracy.(CNN)  --  I  was  the  first  one  to  say  "I  love  you."I  couldn't  hold  back  any  longer.  Since  the  moment  I'd  met  my  now-husband  in  the  flesh,  the  words  had  been  thrumming  in  my  thoughts  so  constantly,  I  was  surprised  they  hadn't  manifested  in  3-inch  letters  across  my  forehead.It  was  too  soon.  This  man  was  too  lovely  to  be  true.  I  should  wait  for  him  to  say  it.But  that  night,  half-awake  under  the  covers,  curled  together  as  a  single  creature,  basking  in  the  afterglow  of  having  met  his  longtime  friends  (who  clearly  adored  him  as  much  as  I  did),  the  words  kicked  so  hard  at  the  back  of  my  teeth,  they  just  came  clattering  out.Then  I  held  my  breath  and  waited.  Three  words.  Eight  letters.  My  whole  self  at  stake.It  costs  something  to  say  "I  love  you"  for  the  first  time,  mostly  because  you're  taking  a  risk  on  the  exchange  rate.  Those  words  don't  hold  the  same  worth  for  everyone.  Some  hesitate  to  spend  them  --  either  holding  them  in  reserve  so  as  not  to  devalue,  staving  off  buyer's  remorse  or  just  not  having  much  extra  to  spare.I  spent  several  years  with  a  man  who  never  said  it  once.  I  was  never  sure  if  I  hadn't  earned  the  words,  or  if  his  account  was  simply  running  at  a  permanent  deficit.  Another  cashed  them  in  at  calculated  intervals.  Another  chastised  me  for  too  frequent  use,  saying  it  cheapened  their  meaning.But  I  was  raised  by  people  with  seemingly  endless  stocks  of  both  language  and  affection.  "I  love  you,"  was  said  with  the  casualness,  oftenness  and  ease  of  "good  morning,"  "good  night,"  and  "please  pass  the  butter"  --  and  it  was  genuine  each  and  every  time.  I  was  taught  that  the  sentiment  earned  interest,  compounding  into  a  surplus  to  dip  into  when  we  were  apart  from  each  other.I  knew  I  was  loved,  because  I  was  lucky  enough  to  have  been  told.  I  learned  both  to  share  the  wealth  where  it  was  welcomed,  and  the  chagrin  of  discovering  where  my  currency  was  no  good.But  that  night,  I  put  it  all  on  the  table.  I  held  my  breath  and  before  I  could  release  it,  he  responded,  "Oh  my  God,  I  love  you,  too.  I'd  been  wanting  to  say  it."And  we  have,  probably  tens  of  thousands  of  times  over  the  past  nine  years,  at  parting,  at  greeting,  at  texting,  at  breathing  and  it  only  accrues  in  meaning.And  now  we'd  love  to  know  about  how  you  say  those  three  special  words  --  and  the  biggest  risk  you've  ever  taken  saying  them.

Rand  Paul  argues  that  NSA  surveillance  of  U.S.  citizens  is  a  violation  of  the  Constitution  and  is  suing  the  Obama  administration  to  end  the  "the  blanket  collection  of  Americans'  telephone  metadata  without  reasonable  cause."</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Rand  Paul  is  a  Republican  senator  representing  Kentucky.

Paul  will  be  on  Erin  Burnett  Out  Front  Wednesday  night  at  7  p.m.  ET  .(CNN)  --  The  right  of  the  people  to  be  secure  in  their  persons,  houses,  papers,  and  effects,  against  unreasonable  searches  and  seizures,  shall  not  be  violated.This  is  the  beginning  of  the  Fourth  Amendment  to  the  U.S.  Constitution,  and  defines  one  of  the  most  important  rights  we  have  against  a  potentially  tyrannical  government.Throughout  history,  governments  have  used  the  confiscation  of  private  property,  as  well  as  bullying  and  surveillance  techniques,  to  keep  populations  under  control  and  maintain  a  continuous  threat  against  those  who  would  dare  criticize  them.The  explicit  enshrinement  of  the  right  to  be  left  alone  is  one  of  the  crucial  features  that  has  defined  America  as  such  a  unique  and  moral  nation.Rand  Paul  to  sue  Obama  administration  over  NSAIn  recent  years,  however,  this  right,  like  so  many  others,  has  come  under  attack  by  the  overzealous  powers  that  be  in  Washington,  eager  to  sacrifice  liberty  in  the  name  of  security,  and  using  fear  as  a  weapon  to  make  us  forget  the  importance  of  being  free.In  2013,  the  revelation  that  the  National  Security  Agency  was  collecting  and  storing  the  metadata  from  the  phone  calls  and  e-mails  of  millions  of  American  citizens  --  without  any  suspicion  of  criminal  activity  --  served  as  a  striking  wake-up  call  for  the  country.Americans  do  not  like  to  think  of  their  government  as  some  Orwellian  leviathan,  engaging  in  surveillance  tactics  that  we  only  expect  to  see  in  oppressive  autocracies.  That  such  surveillance  could  be  going  on  in  what  is  ostensibly  the  freest  nation  in  the  world  is  a  chilling  thought  indeed.Since  2006,  the  NSA  has  been  spying  on  us,  treating  American  citizens  as  no  more  than  common  criminals,  casting  suspicion  on  honest  people  with  not  even  a  whisper  of  criminal  activity  about  them.  These  are  not  the  actions  befitting  a  country  that  was  once  held  up  as  a  paragon  of  freedom  and  a  model  for  the  rest  of  the  world.Online,  live  protests  target  NSA  surveillanceWe  are  told  that  these  intrusive  and  unconstitutional  measures  are  necessary  to  protect  us  from  the  forces  of  international  terrorism.  We  are  told  that  a  surrender  of  our  privacy  rights  is  a  small  price  to  pay  for  the  knowledge  that  we  can  sleep  safe  and  secure  in  our  beds.We  reject  this  premise.  We  are  committed  to  a  safe  America,  but  we  do  not  accept  the  notion  that  a  surveillance  state  is  necessary  to  safeguard  the  lives  and  liberty  of  American  citizens.These  assurances  of  the  necessity  to  give  up  a  little  privacy  for  the  sake  of  safety  are  made  all  the  less  convincing  by  the  fact  that,  after  more  than  seven  years,  the  NSA  has  been  unable  to  provide  any  evidence  that  the  collection  of  telephone  metadata  from  Americans  has  led  to  the  prevention  of  even  a  single  terrorist  attack.There  can  be  no  justification  for  the  preservation  of  a  domestic  surveillance  program  that  has  utterly  failed  in  its  stated  goals.In  addition  to  the  NSA's  privacy  violations,  the  existence  of  government  spying  serves  as  a  significant  obstacle  toward  citizens  exercising  their  First  Amendment  rights  to  free  speech.We  have  already  seen  government  agencies  like  the  IRS  specifically  target  law-abiding  citizens  for  their  political  views.  The  willingness  of  ordinary  people  to  criticize  the  government  will  be  greatly  compromised  by  being  under  the  constant,  watchful  eye  of  the  government,  and  anyone  deemed  guilty  of  suspicious  activity  may  consider  an  audit  the  least  of  their  worries.For  all  these  reasons,  we  have  elected  to  file  a  class  action  suit  on  behalf  of  all  Americans  whose  rights  have  been  violated  by  the  NSA's  unconstitutional  spying  programs.We  are  requesting  a  ruling  confirming  that  the  blanket  collection  of  Americans'  telephone  metadata  without  reasonable  cause  violates  the  Fourth  Amendment  of  the  U.S.  Constitution,  and  requiring  that  these  programs  be  halted  immediately  and  that  all  previously  collected  data  be  purged  from  government  databases.It's  time  to  hold  government  officials  accountable  for  their  habitual  trampling  on  the  Constitution  and  on  our  rights  as  individuals.  Our  case  will  be  an  important  step  down  the  road  of  restoring  our  Constitution  and  reining  in  our  own  overreaching  federal  government.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Sen.

The  number  of  new  cancer  cases  is  expected  to  increase  nearly  45%  by  2030,  from  1.6  million  cases  to  2.3  million  cases  annually.This  influx  of  new  patients  will  place  a  bigger  burden  on  a  field  of  medicine  already  stretched  by  physician  shortages  and  financial  difficulties,  says  the  report,  which  highlights  growing  problems  for  cancer  care  in  the  United  States.Dr.  Jeffery  Ward  knows  these  issues  well.  When  he  joined  a  community  oncology  practice  in  Seattle,  it  had  three  doctors.  A  few  years  later  the  group  merged  with  another  practice,  and  connected  with  a  national  network  of  community  doctors  that  enabled  them  to  invest  in  new  technologies  and  receive  group  discounts  on  cancer  drugs.In  return,  they  paid  a  percentage  of  their  practice's  profit  to  the  network.Over  time,  the  doctors'  profit  margins  became  slimmer.  They  couldn't  compete  with  hospitals  in  the  area  for  radiation  therapy  and  other  services  that  would  have  diversified  their  practice,  and  insurers  had  the  upper  hand  in  contract  negotiations.It  became  obvious,  as  Ward  said,  "that  0%  of  zero  would  be  zero."  So  Ward  and  his  colleagues  decided  to  leave  the  community  oncology  network  and  join  a  large  hospital  system  in  Seattle.Nearly  two-thirds  of  the  small  oncology  practices  surveyed  said  they  were  likely  to  merge,  sell  or  close  in  the  upcoming  year,  according  to  the  oncology  group's  inaugural  report,  "The  State  of  Cancer  Care  in  America."  And  as  community  practices  disappear,  patients  are  paying  more  and  traveling  farther  for  quality  care."If  you  can't  get  care,  you  can't  get  good  care,"  said  American  Society  of  Clinical  Oncology  President  Dr.  Clifford  Hudis,  chief  of  Breast  Cancer  Medicine  Service  at  Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center  and  a  professor  at  Weill  Cornell  Medical  College.WHO:  Imminent  global  cancer  "disaster"Adding  to  the  burden  will  be  an  increase  in  the  number  of  cancer  survivors.  Fifty  years  ago,  only  a  handful  of  "minimally  effective"  treatments  for  cancer  existed,  according  to  the  report.  Today,  there  are  more  than  170  FDA-approved  anti-cancer  drugs.Two-thirds  of  Americans  now  live  at  least  five  years  after  a  cancer  diagnosis,  up  from  about  half  in  the  1970s,  the  report  authors  write.  Survivors  need  ongoing  care,  as  they're  at  higher  risk  for  other  types  of  cancer  and  conditions  such  as  diabetes,  cardiovascular  disease  and  osteoporosis.The  Affordable  Care  Act  will  also  increase  the  need  for  oncologists,  as  millions  of  Americans  get  newly  covered  by  health  insurance.Taking  these  future  patients  into  consideration,  the  oncology  society  expects  demand  for  oncology  services  to  grow  42%  by  2030.  Yet  the  number  of  oncologists  is  expected  to  grow  only  28%,  leading  to  a  shortage  of  more  than  1,400  physicians.A  large  part  of  this  is  because  of  the  aging  physician  population,  according  to  the  report.  In  2008,  the  proportion  of  oncologists  older  than  64  surpassed  the  proportion  younger  than  40  for  the  first  time.  A  large  number  of  communities  in  central  and  Midwestern  states  are  covered  solely  by  these  older  doctors.  When  they  retire,  more  patients  will  have  to  travel  farther  to  find  care."The  shortage  of  oncologists  is  a  real  problem,"  said  Dr.  Otis  Brawley,  chief  medical  officer  of  the  American  Cancer  Society.  "Many  smaller  practices  actually  provide  a  lot  of  uncompensated  care  to  those  who  do  not  have  insurance  or  have  insurance  that  does  not  pay  well."The  report  also  highlights  the  need  to  lower  costs,  for  both  doctors  and  patients.  Right  now,  the  system  is  designed  to  compensate  doctors  for  how  much  they  do,  rather  than  how  well  they  do  it.  That  goes  against  the  oncology  society's  recommendations,  which  encourage  physicians  to  avoid  performing  unnecessary  tests  and  treatments."One  of  the  reasons  that  so  many  patients  are  harmed  in  medicine  is  they  are  over-treated,"  Brawley  said.How  doctors  do  harmDrug  prices  are  another  big  concern.  When  Ward  started  practicing,  the  average  cancer  drug  cost  $1,000  per  month.  Today,  he  said,  the  average  is  $10,000  per  month."If  we  don't  begin  to  control  these  prices  in  one  way  or  another,  in  20  more  years,  the  average  cost  of  a  cancer  drug  will  be  $100,000.  That's  not  sustainable,"  he  said.  "Twenty  percent  copay  on  $10,000  (per  month)  is  not  in  the  pocketbook  for  most  of  my  patients."Brawley  said  price  is  one  of  the  biggest  reasons  there  is  such  a  disparity  in  cancer  outcomes;  research  shows  minorities  are  more  likely  to  develop  cancer  and  more  likely  to  die  from  cancer.To  combat  some  of  the  issues  raised  in  the  report  and  improve  patient  care,  the  society  is  working  on  several  projects  involving  "big  data."  These  projects  will  help  physicians  "distill  massive  volumes  of  data  into  meaningful  information,"  according  to  the  report  authors.Shoppers  have  Amazon.  Students  have  Google.  Oncologists  will  have  CancerLinQ."Medicine  has  lagged  behind  the  rest  of  society  in  adopting  and  benefiting  from  these  remarkable  and  ubiquitous  technological  improvements,"  Hudis  said.CancerLinQ  is  an  electronic  health  system  that  will  collect  and  analyze  data  from  millions  of  patients  and  provide  feedback  to  providers  in  terms  of  standards  of  care  and  best  practices.  Its  goal,  Hudis  said,  is  to  prevent  mistakes  before  they  happen."I'd  rather  have  a  doctor  who  avoids  mistakes  than  one  who  learns  from  them,"  he  said.The  oncology  society  said  it  expects  to  roll  out  some  components  of  the  system  in  early  2015.Most  cancer  cases  are  preventable</TEXT></DOC>

Both  would  be  below  the  general  .08%  legal  limit  for  drivers  and  Florida's  .02%  limit  for  drivers  under  the  legal  drinking  age  of  21.  Bieber  is  19.It's  not  clear  how  soon  after  the  arrest  the  tests  were  given.  And  an  alcohol  level  by  itself  wouldn't  necessarily  clear  a  defendant  of  DUI,  as  Florida  law  also  says  people  can  be  convicted  if  controlled  substances  --  not  just  alcohol  --  impair  the  driver's  "normal  faculties."Police  said  Bieber  admitted  to  drinking,  using  marijuana  and  taking  prescription  pills  before  his  arrest  early  Thursday  in  Miami  Beach.  He  also  failed  a  field  sobriety  test,  Miami  Beach  police  said.Bieber  was  pulled  over  after  a  Miami  Beach  officer  saw  him  driving  a  yellow  Lamborghini  in  a  race  against  a  red  Ferrari  in  a  residential  area  of  Miami  Beach,  city  Police  Chief  Raymond  Martinez  said.Thursday's  incident  marks  the  first  time  the  teen  singer  has  been  arrested,  although  he  is  the  subject  of  a  felony  vandalism  probe  on  allegations  of  egging  his  California  neighbor's  home.Officers  suspended  in  Bieber  escort  probeBieber's  arrest  came  three  days  after  he  arrived  in  the  Miami  area  --  a  visit  that  also  has  put  the  behavior  of  a  separate  police  department's  officers  in  the  spotlight.Three  Opa-Locka  police  officers  have  been  suspended  in  connection  with  allegations  that  officers  escorted  Bieber's  caravan  early  in  the  week,  the  city's  manager  said  Friday.The  city  has  been  investigating  reports  that  Opa-Locka  officers  escorted  Bieber  from  the  city's  airport  to  Miami  strip  clubs  Monday.Opa-Locka  Deputy  City  Manager  David  Chiverton  said  the  three  officers  would  be  suspended  with  pay,  pending  an  investigation.Chiverton  said  he  didn't  know  how  the  escort  arrangement  was  initiated.The  arrestBieber  was  pulled  over  just  after  4  a.m.  Thursday  after  a  police  officer  saw  Bieber  and  the  other  driver  speeding  at  about  55  to  60  mph  in  a  30  mph  zone,  said  Martinez,  the  Miami  Beach  police  chief.The  officer  stopped  Bieber's  car,  but  the  singer  was  "was  not  cooperating  with  the  officer's  instructions,"  Martinez  said."At  first,  he  was  a  little  belligerent,  using  some  choice  words  questioning  why  he  was  being  stopped  and  why  the  officer  was  even  questioning  him,"  he  said."What  the  f***  did  I  do?  Why  did  you  stop  me?"  Bieber  asked  the  police  officer  who  stopped  him,  according  to  the  arrest  reportHe  allegedly  ignored  a  police  officer's  request  to  keep  his  hands  on  the  car  while  he  did  "a  cursory  patdown  for  weapons,"  the  report  said."I  ain't  got  no  f***ing  weapons,"  the  arresting  officer  quoted  Bieber  as  saying.  "Why  do  you  have  to  search  me?  What  the  f***  is  this  about?"The  arrest  report  describes  Bieber  as  having  a  "flushed  face,  bloodshot  eyes,  and  the  odor  of  alcohol  on  his  breath."Two  black  SUVs  blocked  the  traffic  at  26th  and  Pine  Tree  Drive,  which  "facilitated  an  open  road"  for  the  two  cars  to  race  on  Pine  Tree,  the  report  said.Bieber  was  booked  into  jail  after  failing  the  field  sobriety  test,  police  said.  Police  said  a  urine  test  was  taken;  results  are  expected  in  two  to  three  weeks.The  Ferrari's  driver,  identified  as  19-year-old  Def  Jam  recording  artist  Khalil  Sharieff,  was  also  arrested  on  a  drunken  driving  charge,  police  said.Bieber  was  released  Thursday  from  a  Miami  jail  an  hour  after  he  made  a  brief  appearance  through  a  video  link  before  a  Miami  judge,  who  set  a  "standard"  $2,500  bond  that  afternoon.CNN's  Alan  Duke  and  Jason  Hanna  and  CNN  en  Espanol's  Adriana  Hauser  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Follow  him  on  Twitter:  @rubennavarretteSan  Diego,  California  (CNN)  --  Clarence  Thomas  has  an  abundance  of  two  things  that  are  often  in  short  supply  whenever  Americans  talk  about  race:  courage  and  common  sense.The  only  African-American  on  the  Supreme  Court  displayed  both  this  week  in  speaking  to  a  small  gathering  of  students  and  faculty  at  Palm  Beach  Atlantic  University,  a  nondenominational  Christian  school  in  Florida.In  a  series  of  provocative  and  insightful  comments  about  race  that  were  first  reported  by  Yahoo!  News  and  confirmed  by  several  people  who  attended  the  talk  and  heard  the  remarks  firsthand,  Thomas  dropped  a  few  bombshells.This  got  people's  attention  because  --  nearly  25  years  after  his  bitter  confirmation  battle  --  Thomas  remains  a  lightning  rod  for  controversy,  and  because  he  rarely  speaks  while  on  the  bench.  Apparently,  he  has  been  saving  the  best  stuff  for  the  public  remarks  that  he  delivers  in  more  casual  settings.Like  this  one:"My  sadness  is  that  we  are  probably  today  more  race  and  difference-conscious  than  I  was  in  the  1960s  when  I  went  to  school,"  Thomas  told  the  audience.  "To  my  knowledge,  I  was  the  first  black  kid  in  Savannah,  Georgia,  to  go  to  a  white  (Catholic)  school.  Rarely  did  the  issue  of  race  come  up."He  went  on  to  note  that,  these  days,  many  Americans  talk  about  race  a  lot  and  have  a  hair  trigger  on  the  subject."Now,  name  a  day  (race)  doesn't  come  up,"  Thomas  said.  "Differences  in  race,  differences  in  sex,  somebody  doesn't  look  at  you  right,  somebody  says  something.  Everybody  is  sensitive."The  sensitive  include  Samuel  L.  Jackson.  In  a  cringe-inducing  confrontation,  Jackson  scolded  an  entertainment  reporter  at  a  Los  Angeles  television  station  after  the  journalist,  in  asking  about  a  Super  Bowl  commercial,  appeared  to  confuse  Jackson  for  another  African-American  actor  --  Laurence  Fishburne.  Both  actors  had  appeared  in  Super  Bowl  commercials,  and  the  reporter  seemed  to  get  them  mixed  up."You're  as  crazy  as  the  people  on  Twitter.  I'm  not  Laurence  Fishburne!"  Jackson  said  during  a  live  TV  interview  with  KTLA's  Sam  Rubin.  "We  don't  all  look  alike.  We  may  be  all  black  and  famous,  but  we  all  don't  look  alike.  You're  busted."Rubin  immediately  apologized  for  the  mistake,  but  Jackson  kept  razzing  him.  It  was  overkill."I'm  the  other  guy,"  the  actor  said.  "There's  more  than  one  black  guy  doing  a  commercial.  I'm  the  'What's  in  your  wallet?'  black  guy.  He's  the  car  black  guy.  Morgan  Freeman  is  the  other  credit  card  black  guy.  You  only  hear  his  voice,  though,  so  you  probably  won't  confuse  him  with  Laurence  Fishburne."It  seemed  to  be  all  in  good  fun,  but  it  was  still  hard  to  watch.  Rubin  made  a  mistake.  But  it  looked  like  Jackson  was  the  one  with  the  problem.Rubin  did  have  some  defenders.  They  include  CNN's  Don  Lemon,  who  --  after  a  contentious  exchange  between  guests  on  a  show  he  was  hosting  --  seemed  to  agree  with  Thomas  that  "people  are  really  sensitive  when  it  comes  to  race."Finally,  Thomas  took  aim  at  a  group  that  often  gets  a  pass  for  its  mistreatment  of  minorities  that  it  claims  to  be  helping."The  worst  I  have  been  treated  was  by  northern  liberal  elites,"  he  said.  "The  absolute  worst  I  have  ever  been  treated,  the  worst  things  that  have  been  done  to  me,  the  worst  things  that  have  been  said  about  me,  are  by  northern  liberal  elites,  not  by  the  people  of  Savannah,  Georgia."Only  Thomas  can  speak  to  how  he  has  been  treated  in  his  life,  and  who  treated  him  worse.  That  is  a  personal  matter.  As  one  of  the  most  conservative  members  of  the  High  Court,  he  obviously  has  little  respect  for  liberals.  And  the  feeling  is  entirely  mutual.And  yet,  we  can  expect  Thomas'  observation  about  "northern  liberal  elites"  to  resonate  with  many  other  African-Americans  and  Latinos  who  have  been  criticized,  attacked,  or  disparaged  by  this  bunch  for  veering  off  the  script  of  how  minorities  are  supposed  to  think,  speak  and  behave.  Those  minorities  are  often  treated  as  defective  in  some  way  and  certainly  not  representative  of  their  respective  communities.  They're  an  aberration,  an  anomaly,  a  mistake.Make  no  mistake.  The  friction  here  isn't  about  politics.  It's  about  something  more  primal:  control.  Liberals  wanted  to  give  people  like  Clarence  Thomas  every  right  except,  it  turns  out,  the  right  to  think  for  themselves.  If  you  forget  that,  you'll  be  labeled  a  "sellout,"  a  "traitor,"  a  "right  wingnut"  or  worse.Most  Americans  probably  look  back  on  Thomas'  confirmation  hearings  in  the  fall  of  1991,  and  think  that  what  made  them  so  messy  were  those  unseemly  accusations  of  sexual  harassment  by  Anita  Hill.  That  was  a  sideshow.  The  real  reason  for  the  tension  in  those  hearings  was  that  Thomas  represents  something  liberals  can't  stand:  a  black  conservative.Those  on  the  left  see  conservatives  of  color  as  a  kind  of  sociological  experiment  gone  bad  --  these  are  people  who  are  ungrateful  for  the  many  opportunities  they  were  provided  by  the  liberal  establishment  which,  in  return,  asked  for  only  three  things:  undying  loyalty,  constant  agreement,  and  lifelong  subservience.Thomas  doesn't  play  that  game.  He  never  has.  And  that's  why  he  is  always  at  the  center  of  the  storm.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Ruben  Navarrette.</TEXT></DOC>

Chris  Christie  and  Bridgegate:One,  that  he  was  explicitly  involved  in  the  shutting  down  of  three  lanes  feeding  the  George  Washington  Bridge  in  Fort  Lee,  New  Jersey,  as  political  retribution  against  a  no-name  mayor  who  didn't  endorse  him  in  an  election  Christie  ran  away  with.Two,  that  he  was  marginally  involved,  in  that  he  told  staffers  to  "take  care  of"  the  problem  mayor  but  wasn't  specific  about  the  actions  to  take.And  three,  that  he  wasn't  involved  at  all;  that  an  appointee  at  the  Port  Authority  and  staffers  in  his  office  cooked  this  up  unbeknownst  to  him,  didn't  tell  him  and  repeatedly  lied  to  him  about  their  involvement  until  e-mails  proved  otherwise.Wednesday,  many  assumed  the  third  option  impossible,  admittedly  including  me.It's  Christie,  we  said.  It's  politics,  we  said.  It's  ...  New  Jersey,  we  said.Nonetheless,  that's  exactly  the  story  Christie's  going  with,  and  in  his  two-hour  news  conference,  he  did  a  tremendous  job  convincing  me,  at  least,  that  he  really  was  blindsided  by  the  news.And  as  apologies  go,  he  hit  all  the  right  notes:I'm  sorry.I'm  responsible.I'm  sad.I'm  embarrassed.He  stuck  around  for  an  hour  and  a  half  answering  reporter  questions.  He  admitted  the  buck  stops  with  him.  He  fired  two  staffers  immediately.  He  said  he  planned  on  meeting  with  the  jilted  Fort  Lee  mayor  and  with  Fort  Lee  residents  to  apologize  directly  to  them.  In  contrast  to  other  well-known  news  conferences,  it  was  one  of  the  best  mea  culpas  in  recent  memory.But  he's  not  out  of  the  woods  yet.Democrats  would  very  much  like  to  hang  Christie  on  this,  and  they  will  not  be  satisfied  with  the  "it  wasn't  me"  defense.  If  there's  any  dirt,  any  inkling  that  he  had  knowledge  of  this,  they'll  find  it  and  destroy  him  over  it.  This  is  sure  to  be  a  sideshow  for  the  next  few  weeks,  if  not  months,  as  investigators  look  into  exactly  how  this  happened.  And  even  if  it  turns  out  Christie's  hands  are  clean,  it  still  won't  paint  a  pretty  picture  of  politics  in  Trenton.He's  also  heading  up  the  Republican  Governors  Association,  a  post  that  requires  him  to  regularly  raise  funds  and  speak  alongside  other  Republican  governors.  Christie  said  in  his  news  conference  that  this  wouldn't  affect  his  job  at  the  RGA,  but  that's  pretty  naive.  What  governor  wants  to  share  a  stage,  at  least  in  the  short  term,  with  a  guy  embroiled  in  a  seedy,  petty  political  scandal?In  the  long  term,  however,  if  Christie  is  telling  the  truth,  this  is  perfectly  survivable.

Follow  him  on  Twitter  @PaulRieckhoff.(CNN)  --  Just  how  awful  has  Washington  dysfunction  become?  America's  military  members  and  veterans  --  once  immune  to  political  sniping  --  are  caught  in  the  crossfire.Last  week,  members  of  the  U.S.  Senate  again  engaged  in  their  usual  political  games,  and  this  time,  veterans  lost  out  on  critical  support.Almost  all  Veterans  Service  Organizations  strongly  supported  the  Veterans  Omnibus  Bill,  including  Iraq  and  Afghanistan  Veterans  of  America  (IAVA),  The  American  Legion,  Veterans  of  Foreign  Wars,  and  Disabled  American  Veterans.It  is  a  transformative  bill  that  includes  critical,  longstanding  priorities  for  veterans.  The  bill  would  provide  additional  advance  funding  for  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs,  help  the  V.A.  end  the  disability  claims  backlog,  improve  health  care  services,  strengthen  the  new  G.I.  Bill,  support  veterans  hiring  programs  and  expand  survivor  benefits.Each  of  these  provisions  has  garnered  bipartisan  support.  But  when  the  legislation,  introduced  by  Senate  Veterans  Affairs  Committee  Chairman  Bernie  Sanders,  reached  the  Senate  floor,  Republicans  objected  to  the  scope  of  the  bill.Democrats  wouldn't  allow  amendments.  Republicans  wouldn't  provide  the  votes  to  move  forward.  Nobody  would  compromise  and  veterans  were  left  getting  the  shaft.The  Senate  shenanigans  capped  a  winter  of  discontent  for  our  community  in  which  Washington  continually  attacked  military  members,  veterans  and  their  families.  It  used  to  be  that  vets  could  count  on  bipartisan  support  in  Congress.  But  clearly,  no  more.In  December,  Congress  cut  military  retirement  benefits  as  part  of  a  bipartisan,  backroom  budget  deal.  Reducing  the  annual  cost-of-living  adjustment  for  most  military  retirees  and  survivors  would  have  led  to  a  20%  cut  to  retirement  benefits  over  the  course  of  their  lives.  For  a  retired  Army  sergeant  first  class  (E-7)  that  would  have  meant  the  loss  of  $83,000  in  retirement  savings.After  massive  protests  and  pressure  from  veterans  and  supporters,  Congress  finally  reversed  course  and  restored  the  benefits  for  veterans  who  served  or  enlisted  before  January  1,  2014.Last  week,  Congress  forced  the  Pentagon  to  make  budget  cuts  that  increased  living  costs  for  our  service  members.  Our  service  members  are  faced  with  a  budget  that  would  raise  their  grocery  prices  at  commissaries  by  at  least  20%  and  force  military  families  to  pay  an  additional  5%  out-of-pocket  for  housing.CNN  reported  that  members  of  the  military  redeemed  nearly  $104  million  in  food  stamps  at  commissaries  in  the  fiscal  year  that  ended  September  30.  The  Defense  Department  budget  would  cut  subsidies  that  service  members  use  to  pay  for  diapers  for  their  kids  and  to  put  bread  on  the  table.And  then  Thursday  the  Senate  leadership  put  partisanship  ahead  of  helping  veterans.Veterans  and  those  active  in  the  armed  forces  don't  have  time  for  this  nonsense.  Iraq  and  Afghanistan  Veterans  of  America  will  be  going  to  the  Hill  next  month  to  demand  Congress  stop  the  attacks  and  put  veterans  ahead  of  petty  politics.  Washington  needs  to  do  much  more  to  support  those  who  sacrificed  for  their  country.  There  are  many  deep  problems:About  22  veterans  die  by  suicide  every  day.  And  according  to  a  new  study,  the  suicide  rate  for  young  male  vets  has  skyrocketed,  up  44%  from  2009  to  2011.The  V.A.  disability  claims  backlog  has  hovered  near  400,000  for  months.  These  are  veterans  whose  lives  are  on  hold,  waiting  for  the  benefits  they  have  earned.The  unemployment  rate  for  post-9/11  veterans  remains  higher  than  the  national  average.Congress  and  the  administration  still  have  not  truly  reformed  the  broken  military  justice  system,  which  has  failed  tens  of  thousands  of  survivors  of  military  sexual  assault.I  had  the  honor  of  attending  the  State  of  the  Union  a  month  ago,  when  every  member  of  Congress  stood  up  to  applaud  Sgt.  1st  Class  Cory  Remsburg,  an  Army  Ranger  who  was  wounded  in  a  roadside  bombing  in  Afghanistan  during  his  10th  deployment  overseas.  The  sustained,  thundering  applause  was  an  incredibly  moving  gesture.  But  ultimately,  it  was  just  that:  a  gesture.What  has  Congress  done  since  the  State  of  the  Union  to  help  veterans  like  Cory  who  put  on  a  uniform  to  defend  our  country?  Aside  from  fixing  its  own  mess  on  military  retirement  benefits,  Congress  has  done  nothing.  Absolutely  nothing.Veterans  have  taken  notice.  And  we're  not  going  to  sit  by  idly  as  Congress  fails  to  act  on  our  priorities  and,  worse,  attacks  the  benefits  we've  earned.Winter  mercifully  is  ending.  We  await  a  spring  of  hope  for  veterans  and  their  families.Follow  @CNNOpinion  on  Twitter.Join  us  at  Facebook/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Paul  Rieckhoff.</TEXT></DOC>

"And  it  hurts.  It  hurts  us  all."Police  were  still  looking  for  at  least  four  individuals  who  they  say  might  be  responsible.Elzey  said  "we  are  pulling  together  as  a  community,"  announcing  that  counselors  would  be  made  available  to  grieving  students."Our  first  order  of  business  is  to  make  sure  that  our  students  are  safe,"  the  school  president  said.Campus  police  were  called  to  the  Andrew  Hugine  Suites  Living  and  Learning  community  about  1:30  p.m.  and  found  the  injured  student,  the  university  said.  Police  said  eyewitnesses  identified  four  suspects  who  had  left  the  campus,  the  university  said.The  school  was  initially  put  on  lockdown;  those  restrictions  were  lifted  a  few  hours  later.  Nonetheless,  South  Carolina  State's  Facebook  page  still  urged  people  to  "remain  cautious  and  report  any  suspicious  activity  to  police."South  Carolina  State  is  a  historically  black  university  with  about  4,000  students,  according  to  the  school  website.  The  campus  is  about  40  miles  south  of  Columbia.CNN  first  learned  about  the  incident  via  Twitter.This  is  the  third  campus  shooting  this  week.On  Tuesday,  a  gunman  shot  and  killed  another  student  inside  Purdue  University's  electrical  engineering  building.  Police  said  Cody  Cousins,  23,  an  engineering  student,  killed  Andrew  Bolt,  21,  of  West  Bend,  Wisconsin.  Cousins  was  charged  with  murder.On  Monday,  a  student  was  shot  and  critically  injured  near  a  gym  at  Widener  University  near  Philadelphia.  Police  were  looking  for  a  suspect.On  Wednesday,  the  University  of  Oklahoma  in  Norman  briefly  shut  down  after  a  report  of  a  possible  shooting  that  apparently  turned  out  to  be  a  false  alarm,  the  university's  president  said.</TEXT></DOC>

Coffee  was  in  order.  The  two  photographers  were  still  trying  to  shake  off  their  morning  tiredness,  having  just  arrived  at  the  coastal  city  after  cycling  some  1,600  kilometers  from  Kimberley,  a  town  at  the  heart  of  South  Africa."Just  as  the  coffee  arrived,  I  saw  this  guy  fly  by  with  no  shirt  on,  riding  this  strange-looking  bike,"  recalls  Engelbrecht.  "Nic  and  I  just  looked  at  each  other  and  it  was  like,  'we've  got  to  get  this  guy!'  Nic  just  said  'go,  go,  go,'  so  I  jumped  on  my  bike  and  started  chasing  him  in  the  rain."It  took  more  than  seven  kilometers  and  several  screams  before  Engelbrecht  finally  managed  to  catch  up  with  the  shirtless  rider  --  named  Brandan  Searle  --  and  talk  to  him.  "He  stopped  and  allowed  me  to  get  his  photograph  and  do  a  quick  interview  with  him,"  says  Engelbrecht.  "He  was  on  his  way  to  work  --  he  works  as  a  gym  instructor  --  but  he  told  me  an  amazing  story;  he'd  been  traveling  the  world  with  that  exact  bike."That  story  and  photograph  can  be  found  in  "Bicycle  Portraits,"  an  image-led  three-book  series  by  Engelbrecht  and  Grobler  documenting  South  Africa's  bicycle  commuter  culture.  Starting  in  2010,  the  two  friends  and  bike  enthusiasts  were  keen  to  explore  who  cycles  in  the  country  and  how  their  bicycles  fit  into  their  daily  life."We  decided  just  to  get  on  our  bikes  and  cycle  around  and  see  who  we  would  meet,"  says  Engelbrecht.  "It  happened  organically,"  adds  Grobler,  34.  "We  didn't  set  out  with  a  strict  plan  of  what  we  wanted  to  do...We  were  thinking  maybe  we'll  working  on  it  for  six  months."Read  this:  Cape  Town  draped  in  color  for  'slave'  carnivalInstead,  Grobler  and  Engelbrecht  ended  up  spending  over  three  years  on  the  project,  cycling  thousands  of  kilometers  across  South  Africa  --  from  big  urban  centers,  through  steep  hills  and  mountains,  to  small  towns  and  rural  areas.Along  their  journeys,  they'd  speak  to,  photograph  and  sometimes  even  ride  together  with  the  cyclists  they'd  meet  on  the  road,  people  who  used  their  bikes  not  for  recreation  but  as  an  everyday  way  of  transport  --  everyone  from  die-hard  commuters  to  people  making  a  living  from  their  makeshift  bicycles.Engelbrecht  and  Grobler  say  these  "brave"  and  "inspirational"  individuals,  are  defying  dangerous  roads  and  social  prejudices  by  making  the  everyday  decision  to  use  bicycles  to  get  around."In  South  Africa  there's  no  culture  of  commuting  by  bicycle,"  says  Engelbrecht.  "Some  of  the  friends  that  we  made  were  really  colorful  and  interesting  people,  very  eccentric  I  would  say,"  he  adds."It's  really  an  alternative  choice  to  ride  a  bicycle  --  it's  often  a  choice  that  comes  out  of  necessity  because  of  the  rising  costs  of  transport  and  in  fact  people  have  to  travel  long  distances  to  get  to  work.  Often  people  live  in  townships  and  they  work  in  the  cities  where  it's  actually  very  far  from  their  home."Read:  Star  Wars  town  being  swallowed  by  SaharaGrobler  and  Engelbrecht,  who  turned  to  crowdsourcing  website  Kickstarter  to  fund  their  project,  say  that  riding  a  bicycle  themselves  helped  them  create  an  instant  bond  with  the  cyclists  they'd  encounter,  allowing  different  people  from  all  walks  of  life  to  open  up  to  them  and  have  a  friendly  discussion."There  is  a  pride  around  having  and  using  a  bicycle,  especially  because  in  South  Africa  it's  not  being  used  as  much  for  commuting,"  says  Grobler.  "It  kind  of  felt  like  you  get  a  different  holistic  image  of  the  country,  after  hanging  out  one  on  one  with  everyday  people,"  he  adds.  "A  very  different  image  of  the  country,  of  the  situation  and  the  state  of  racial  interactions  and  political  interactions  ...  than  you  get  from,  say,  reading  the  newspaper  or  always  being  aware  of  the  extremes."The  photographic  project  was  published  in  December  2012,  yet  that  didn't  signal  the  end  of  Grobler  and  Engelbracht's  journey.  Since  then,  they  have  been  on  their  bikes  again,  cycling  back  to  meet  the  people  featured  in  the  books  in  order  to  give  them  a  copy."It  was  a  very  natural  thing  to  do,"  explains  Grobler.  "We  never  felt  that  the  right  thing  was  to  pay  anybody  for  their  time  or  taking  their  photo  --  that'd  be  kind  of  compromising  the  integrity  of  it,"  he  adds.  "As  far  as  our  project  goes,  it's  probably  the  best  part  of  the  experience."Engelbrecht  agrees.  "It's  very  rewarding  being  able  to  go  back  to  someone  and  say,  'remember  I  met  you  two  years  ago,  I  took  your  photo  and  this  is  what  I  did  with  it,'"  he  says.The  two  photographers  have  so  far  gone  back  to  about  70%  of  the  people  they'd  photographed  and  are  still  planning  to  visit  the  remainder  30%."People's  reactions  are  always  very  positive,"  says  Engelbrecht.  "They  feel  very  proud,  they  really  love  it,  it's  a  nice  feeling  to  make  someone  feel  so  proud  and  also  ...  when  you're  able  to  give  them  a  copy  of  the  book,  they  can  see  themselves  amongst  other  South  Africans  that  have  a  similar  interest  to  them.  And  also  the  stories  --  you  can  read  a  lot  about  other  people's  personal  history  and  culture  and  socioeconomic  background,  it's  just  very  interesting  for  these  people."Click  through  the  gallery  above  to  read  excerpts  of  stories  by  the  cyclists  featured  in  the  "Bicycle  Portraits."Read:  Climbing  South  Africa's  leafy  summitsRead:  Tribal  beauty  -  Photographer  gives  snapshot  of  vanishing  way  of  life</TEXT></DOC>

Richards  IV  was  convicted  of  raping  his  daughter  but  avoided  prison  in  2009  because  he  would  "not  fare  well"  behind  bars,  documents  reveal</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Though  Robert  H.  Richards  IV  was  convicted  of  rape,  the  wealthy  heir  to  the  du  Pont  family  fortune  was  spared  prison  by  a  Delaware  court  in  2009  because  he  would  "not  fare  well"  behind  bars,  according  to  court  documents  CNN  obtained  Tuesday.Richards  is  a  great-grandson  of  the  chemical  magnate  Irenee  du  Pont.He  received  an  eight-year  prison  sentence  in  2009  for  raping  his  toddler  daughter,  but  the  sentencing  order  signed  by  a  Delaware  judge  said  "defendant  will  not  fare  well"  in  prison  and  the  eight  years  were  suspended.Richards  was  placed  on  eight  years'  probation  and  ordered  to  get  treatment  and  register  as  a  sex  offender,  the  documents  show.  He  was  also  prohibited  from  having  contact  with  children  under  16,  including  his  own  children.The  documents  were  never  sealed,  yet  the  ruling  managed  to  go  unnoticed  until  March,  when  Richards'  former  wife,  Tracy  Richards,  filed  a  lawsuit  in  Delaware  Superior  Court  on  behalf  of  their  children  alleging  "personal  injuries  arising  from  the  childhood  sexual  abuse."  The  11-page  suit  alleges  that  not  only  was  their  daughter  abused,  but  Richards  abused  their  son,  too.  The  suit  seeks  unspecified  monetary  damages.While  he  was  convicted  of  raping  his  daughter,  Richards  has  never  been  charged  with  sexually  molesting  his  son,  according  to  Jason  Miller,  a  spokesman  for  the  Delaware  attorney  general's  office.CNN  tried  repeatedly  to  reach  Richards  and  Eugene  Maurer,  the  attorney  who  represented  him  in  2009.  Maurer  is  no  longer  representing  Richards,  his  assistant  told  CNN  on  Wednesday.  CNN  asked  if  he  had  a  comment;  he  has  not  offered  one.Attorney  John  C.  Balaguer  is  representing  Richards  in  the  civil  case,  his  assistant  told  CNN.  Balaguer  has  not  returned  e-mails  or  voice  mail  messages  CNN  has  left  for  him.This  week,  after  news  of  Richards'  2009  case  came  to  light,  many  took  to  Twitter  to  criticize  the  judge  in  the  case,  saying  that  it  echoed  a  recent  Texas  case  in  which  a  wealthy  teenager  driving  drunk  killed  four  people  but  received  no  jail  time.  Ethan  Couch  was  sentenced  last  year  to  10  years'  probation.A  witness  in  Couch's  case  claimed  the  teenager  was  a  victim  of  "affluenza"  --  the  product  of  wealthy,  privileged  parents  who  never  set  limits  for  the  boy.READ:  Judge  orders  Texas  teen  to  rehab  for  driving  drunk,  killing  4Delaware's  Judicial  Code  of  Conduct  prohibits  Judge  Jan  R.  Jurden  from  discussing  the  2009  ruling  with  reporters,  court  spokeswoman  Amy  Quinlan  told  CNN.But  at  least  one  member  of  the  Delaware  legal  community  came  to  Jurden's  defense  Tuesday."It's  wrong  to  attribute  (the  'defendant  would  not  fare  well'  comment)  to  Judge  Jurden,"  said  Richard  Kirk,  a  lawyer  who  is  chairman  of  a  Delaware  State  Bar  Association  committee  that  he  says  steps  up  to  respond  "when  judges  are  criticized  and  unable  to  speak  for  themselves."Kirk  says  the  argument  that  Richards  would  not  do  well  in  prison  could  have  been  the  recommendation  of  probation  or  parole  officers.  However,  he  said,  "common  sense  suggests  that  it  came  from  defense  counsel."As  for  the  prosecutor's  side,  the  attorney  general's  spokesman  gave  CNN  a  written  statement."Cases  of  child  sexual  abuse  are  extremely  complicated  and  difficult,"  it  read.  The  objective  is  to  "secure  justice  in  every  case  to  the  best  of  its  ability  given  the  unique  facts  and  circumstances  presented  in  each  case  --  sometimes  that  results  in  a  resolution  that  is  less  than  what  prosecutors  would  want,"  the  statement  read."In  this  particular  case,  the  facts  and  circumstances  made  it  unlikely  that  a  conviction  could  be  secured  at  trial.  ...This  resolution  protected  the  victim  and  imposed  conditions  that  would  make  it  less  likely  the  defendant  could  harm  others."</TEXT></DOC>

 Commission  at  the  time.In  1911,  River  Road  in  Trenton,  Wayne  County,  became  the  first  road  in  the  world  to  be  marked.The  inspiration  reportedly  came  from  watching  a  milk

flight.More  info:  Person  of  the  Year:  Charles  Lindbergh1937:  Hindenberg  disaster  ends  era  of  airship  travelWhen  the  hydrogen-filled  Hindenburg  airship  burst  into  flames  and  crashed  to  the  ground  in  New  Jersey  in  1937,  killing  36  people,  the  era  of  intercontinental  zeppelin  travel  came  to  a  horrifying  end.Though  the  crash  of  the  Hindenburg  wasn't  the  worst  airship  disaster  in  history,  the  shocking  newsreels  and  chilling  live  radio  commentary  --  "Oh,  the  humanity!"  --  broadcast  around  the  world  shattered  public  confidence  in  airship  travel.More  info:  Could  airships  make  a  comeback?1946:  Credit  cards  createdCash  was  king  until  John  Biggins  invented  a  novel  method  of  payment  in  1946  for  Flatbush  National  Bank  in  Brooklyn,  New  York.Customers  could  buy  items  in  local  shops  with  their  cards,  the  business  owners  would  present  the  sales  receipts  for  cash  from  the  bank,  which  would,  in  turn,  bill  the  customer  for  the  amount.Thanks  to  his  convenient  invention,  travelers  today  enjoy  unrestricted  access  to  hotels,  rental  cars  and  online  booking  engines  around  the  world.And  banks  enjoy  the  high  interest  rates  when  we  overspend  or  flub  a  payment.More  info:  World's  12  best  shopping  cities1947:  Chuck  Yeager  breaks  sound  barrierCould  a  plane,  or  a  person,  withstand  the  pressure  of  exceeding  the  speed  of  sound?That  was  the  question  for  the  United  States  Air  Force  in  the  mid-20th  century.Selected  by  the  Air  Force  Flight  Performance  School  to  provide  the  answer,  Chuck  Yeager  became  the  most  famous  test  pilot  in  U.S.  history  when  he  hid  two  broken  ribs  (he'd  been  thrown  from  a  horse  two  days  before  his  flight)  and  flew  a  bullet-shaped,  rocket-powered  plane  faster  than  the  speed  of  sound  (767  miles  per  hour)  on  October  14,  1947.More  info:  Chuck  Yeager  fast  facts1948:  Transistors  inventedOften  called  the  most  important  invention  of  the  20th  century,  transistors  are  what  all  modern  computing  technology  is  based  on.They  made  space  travel  possible  and  today  are  the  building  blocks  of  smart  phones,  computer  terminals,  radios  and  other  electronic  devices  that  make  world  travel  a  comparative  breeze.They  were  created  by  John  Bardeen,  Walter  Brattain  and  William  Shockley  at  Bell  Laboratories,  and  act  as  a  switch  in  a  circuit  or  to  amplify  currents.So,  "Flappy  Bird"  fans  --  you  know  whom  to  thank.Or  blame.More  info:  The  Nobel  Prize  in  physics1949:  Crash  test  dummy  bornSafety  tests  on  cars,  planes  and  other  vehicles  would  be  a  lot  less  meaningful  without  the  crash  test  dummy.The  first  of  its  kind  was  Sierra  Sam,  created  in  1949  to  test  ejection  seats  on  aircraft.Over  the  years,  the  crash  test  dummy  has  been  increasingly  refined  to  be  more  human-like  in  shape,  size,  weight  and  even  fitted  with  sensors  to  allow  better  interpretation  of  results.More  info:  Inside  the  world  of  professional  car  crashing1952:  First  commercial  jet  flightIt  may  have  been  Americans  who  flew  the  first  aircraft  (Wright  brothers,  1903)  and  the  first  commercial  flight  (a  23-minute  flight  between  Tampa  and  St.  Petersburg  in  Florida  in  1914),  but  the  Brits  launched  the  first  commercial  jetliner  service  in  the  world  --  the  closest  thing  to  today's  air  travel.In  1952,  the  de  Havilland  Aircraft  Company  debuted  the  first  commercial  jetliner  flight  --  on  a  plane  called  the  de  Havilland  Comet  --  between  London  and  Johannesburg,  a  trip  that  took  23  hours.The  jet  shortened  the  London-New  York  flight  from  18  to  12  hours.Due  to  a  series  of  accidents  after  its  initial  success,  the  Comet's  fleet  was  grounded  in  1954  and  the  jet  was  redesigned,  including  replacing  the  square  windows  and  panels  with  the  rounded  versions  we  see  today.More  info:  A  century  of  romance  with  flying1959:  Three-point  seat  belt  createdThe  first  seatbelt  was  invented  at  the  beginning  of  the  19th  century  by  Sir  George  Cayley  for  his  glider.It  was  a  strap  that  went  across  the  lap  to  hold  down  the  pilot  during  flight.Effective,  but  rudimentary.More  than  150  years  later,  Nils  Bohlin  came  up  with  the  three-point  seat  belt  found  on  almost  all  vehicles  today.Bohlin's  design  allowed  users  to  put  the  seat  belt  on  using  only  one  hand  and  it  was  more  secure,  holding  down  the  driver  by  the  shoulder.It's  estimated  the  three-point  seat  belt  has  saved  more  than  a  million  lives.More  info:  Three-point  seatbelt

was  deemed  apt  for  Japan's  "shinkansen"  trains,  which  hit  speeds  of  210  kilometers  per  hour  and  brought  high-speed  rail  to  the  masses.After  the  first  three  years  of  service  more  than  100  million  passengers  had  been  aboard.The  term  "bullet  train"  is  a  direct  translation  of  the  Japanese  term  "dangan  ressha,"  a  nickname  given  to  the  shinkansen  prototype.More  info:  Hayabusa  bullet  train  hotfoots  it  up  Honshu1967:  ATMs  rolled  outIf  the  trauma  of  forgetting  your  PIN  or  losing  your  debit  card  makes  you  question  the  benefits  of  the  ATM,  consider  what  this  process  used  to  involve:  walking  around  with  pieces  of  radioactive  paper  in  your  pocket.The  world's  first  ATM  was  unveiled  in  1967  at  Barclays  Bank  in  Enfield,  London.Created  by  John  Shepherd  Barron,  who  headed  the  invention  team  at  De  La  Rue  Instruments,  the  original  machine  was  initiated  when  it  detected  radioactive  isotope  carbon  14  on  a  check.Thankfully,  we've  moved  on  to  the  card  and  PIN  system,  giving  travelers  easy  access  to  their  cash  in  hundreds  of  countries.More  info:  The  world's  first  ATM1969:  First  747  flightThe  queen  of  the  sky,  the  jumbo  jet,  or  simply  the  Boeing  747  --  whatever  you  call  this  icon  of  mass  transit,  it  was  a  game-changer.It  was  the  first  wide-body  plane  (carrying  up  to  490  passengers)  and  it  traveled  almost  twice  as  far  as  any  other  commercial  aircraft  of  the  day;  13,450  kilometers  (8,350  miles)  with  a  747-400.It's  often  hailed  as  the  plane  that  brought  air  travel  to  the  masses,  making  flying  cheap  enough  for  more  people.More

symbol  for  wealthy  jetsetters.After  test  flights  started  in  1969,  the  plane  entered  commercial  service  in  1976  with  London-Bahrain  and  Paris-Rio  (via  Dakar)  routes.Concorde  later  flew  travelers  from  London  to  New  York  in  about  3.5  hours  --  twice  as  fast  as  any  other  commercial  airliner.When  an  Air  France  Concorde  crashed  in  France  in  2000,  killing  113  people,  the  plane's  already  waning  luster  faded  out  entirely.All  Concordes  were  retired  in  2003  by  British  Airways  and  Air  France,  the  airlines  blaming  high  operating  costs  and  sinking  demand.But  a  few  companies,  including  Aerion  and  Spike  Aerospace,  are  in  the  process  of  bringing  supersonic  travel  back.More  info:  Celebrating

(now  Briggs  &  Riley  Travelware),  developed  his  in  1970,  he  had  trouble  selling  the  idea.It  was  thought  people  wouldn't  want  to  pull  their  luggage  around  behind  them.Thankfully  Sadow  stuck  with  it,  and  we  can  all  now  transport  our  oversized,  overweight  bags  to  check-in  with  ease.More  info:  Happy  anniversary,  wheeled  luggage1972:  Lonely  Planet  first  publishedBroke  but  happily  married  young  hippie  couple  Tony  and  Maureen  Wheeler  created  what  became  the  world's  most  successful  travel  guides  when  they  published  their  accounts  of  how  to  travel  across  Asia  on  a  shoestring  in  1972.Their  books,  most  popular  with  backpackers,  recommend  handfuls  of  places  across  the  world  and  have  often  been  the  source  of  intense  competition  among  hostel  owners,  to  the  extent  that  it  has  occasionally  proved  problematic  to  travelers.One  unconfirmed  report  from  India  illustrates:  when  Lonely  Planet  gave  a  positive  review  to  a  hostel  named  "Green's  Hotel,"  several  other  hotels  on  the  street  renamed  themselves  "Green's  Hotel."The  company  made  headlines  last  year  when  the  BBC  sold  it  to  reclusive  Kentucky  billionaire  Brad  Kelley.More  info:  Tony  Wheeler's  top  5  edgy  destinations1972:  Security  measures  improvedA  world  without  queue-swelling  security  searches  did  once  exist.Then,  in  the  early  1970s,  a  spate  of  "skyjackings"  occurred,  triggering  a  chain  of  events  that  led  to  the  modern  airline  security  we  experience  today.The  first  reported  plane  hijacking  can  be  traced  to  Peru  in  the  1930s.But  it  was  a  Southern  Airways  hijacking,  in  which  hijackers  threatened  to  crash  into  a  nuclear  reactor  at  Oak  Ridge  National  Laboratory  in  Tennessee  in  the  United  States  in  November  1972,  that  prompted  authorities  to  finally  install  strong  counter  measures.More  info:  Skyjacked:  A  nation  with  no  airline  security1973:  First  call  from  handheld  mobile  phoneA  little  more  than  40  years  ago  a  call  was  made  from  the  first  handheld  mobile  phone  by  its  creator,  Martin  Cooper,  an  American  inventor.Thanks  to  Cooper  and  his  brick-sized  prototype,  the  door  was  opened  to  an  unprecedented  era  of  communication,  turning  people  into  callable  numbers,  contactable  any  time,  anywhere.So,  enjoy  that  holiday  totally  away  from  work  when  ...  wait,  sorry  we

been  saved  (and  their  wallets  thinned)  thanks  to  one  Hilton  executive  and  Siegas,  the  German  company  that  invented  the  refrigerated  minibar  in  the  1960s.In  1974,  an  executive  from  the  since-closed  Hong  Kong  Hilton  was  inspired  to  stock  overpriced  liquors  in  all  840  rooms,  and  lo  the  loved/hated  minibar  was  globalized.The  minibar  led  to  a  500%  increase  for  in-room  drink  sales  and  a  5%  boost  to  the  company's  net  income  that  year,  according  to  the  Atlantic.More  info:  Hotel  minibars:  In  need  of  being  refreshed?1974:  GPS  hits  the  roadWhen  you're  lost  on  the  back  roads  of  a  small  town  and  your  GPS  comes  to  the  rescue,  think  of  Roger  L.  Easton.And  when  you're  lost  on  the  back  roads  of  a  small  town  because  your  GPS  "came  to  the  rescue,"  blame  Roger  L.  Easton.Easton,  an  American  scientist  and  inventor,  worked  with  a  team  at  Naval  Air  Systems  Command  in  the  United  States  to  develop  and  track  satellites.His  work  ultimately  led  to  the  invention  of  GPS,  with  the  patent  awarded  in  1974.Easton  was  inducted  into  the  Inventor's  Hall  of  Fame  for  his  work.More  info:  GPS  inventor1975:  First  digital  camera  appearsDigital  cameras  have  come  a  long  way  since  Kodak  engineer  Steven  Sasson  screwed  together  a  bunch  of  misfit  parts,  including  the  lens  from  a  movie  camera  and  a  digital  cassette  recorder,  in  1975.That  hefty  bit  of  kit  weighed  eight  pounds  and  displayed  its  images  using  a  separate  TV  set.More  info:  9  great  cameras  for  travelers1978:  First  list  of  UNESCO  World  Heritage  SitesAnnounced  in  1978,  the  inaugural  list  of  UNESCO  World  Heritage  Sites  provided  the  world  with  an  officially  sanctioned  travel  bucket  list.A  dozen  "properties"  were  given  the  heritage  treatment  on  debut,  including  the  Galápagos  Islands  in  Ecuador,  Aachen  Cathedral  in  Germany  and  Yellowstone  National  Park  in  the  United  States.Strangely,  for  such  a  wide  area  from  which  to  take  their  choices  (the  entire  planet),  10  of  the  entries  came  from  five  countries.  Asia  and  Australasia  had  no  inscriptions.There  are  now  981  properties  on  the  list,  covering  every  continent  except  Antarctica.More  info:  20  of  the  world's  most  beautiful  UNESCO  World  Heritage  Sites1979:  Sony  Walkman  launchedLaunched  in  1979,  the  Sony  Walkman's  transportable  music  playback  system  was  revolutionary.Gone  were  the  days  of  trunk-like  boom  boxes  and  other  unwieldy  stereos.Opened  was  the  door  to  music  anytime,  anywhere.The  Sony  Walkman  sold  a  total  of  around  200  million  units  while  it  was  being  made,  and  spawned  later  models  that  were  waterproof,  solar-powered  and  one  model  with  two  cassette  drives.CDs,  MiniDiscs  and  now  MP3  players  have  since  usurped  the  Walkman,  but  this  was  the  device  that  made  "music  on  the  go"  an  integral  part  of  travel  for  millions.More  info:  12  best  travel  songs  of  all  time1985:  Schengen  visa  createdSigned  in  1985,  the  Schengen  Agreement  made  possible  the  free  movement  of  people  within  the  Schengen  states  --  26  countries  in  Europe.A  byproduct  is  the  Schengen  visa.International  tourists  now  need  just  one  visa  and  can  take  their  pick  of  destinations.More  info:  Schengen  visa  services1996:  Internet  travel  booking  takes  offExpedia.com's  launch  in  1996  meant  travel  agents  no  longer  held  the  only  keys  to  hotel  and  airline  reservation  channels,  allowing  travelers  themselves  to  research,  compare  prices  and  book  trips.So  many  booking  sites  have  been  launched,  we've  even  started  seeing  the  creation  of  aggregator  sites  that  search  these  booking  sites.More  info:  12  websites  that'll  make  you  a  smarter  traveler1998:  Smoking  ban  on  planesBreathing  someone  else's  expelled  air  inside  a  confined  metal  tube  is  bad  enough;  breathing  their  expelled  smoke  was,  for  many,  dreadful.In  1998,  the  late  Senator  Frank  Lautenberg  of  New  Jersey  helped  ban  smoking  on  planes  in  the  United  States,  allowing  non-smokers  to  breathe  a  sigh  of  relief.Smokers  got  grumpy,  and  still  are  --  those  little  ashtrays  in  the  armrests,  still  included  for  some  reason,  reminding  them  how  good  the  traveling  life  used  to  be.More  info:  10  ways  to  improve  the  travel  industry  right  now1999:  Introduction  of  the  euroWhile  the  benefits  of  being  in  the  euro-zone  are  always  up  for  debate,  one  thing  is  clear  --  Europe's  single  currency  is  useful  for  travelers.The  singular  currency  works  in  17  countries.More  info:  Bored  with  Europe?

If  the  Republican  Party  hopes  to  revive  the  Bush-era  idea  of  "compassionate  conservatism,"  this  isn't  the  way  to  do  it.The  bill  was  the  culmination  of  a  three-year  battle  over  food  stamps,  also  called  the  Supplemental  Nutrition  Assistance  Program,  or  SNAP.  House  Democrats  who  supported  the  measure  said  they  compromised.  This  version,  they  said,  was  better  than  previous  ones;  Tea  Party  Republicans  had  wanted  a  5%  cut,  not  1%.  The  White  House  has  signaled  that  President  Obama  will  sign  the  bill.He  shouldn't,  but  this  is  a  pragmatic  president.  So  he  probably  will.That  the  legislation  slashes  aid  to  hungry  children  might  be  justifiable  if  it  didn't  also  hand  out  $90  billion  over  10  years  --  $7  billion  more  than  before  --  in  subsidized  crop  insurance  to  farmers,  which  virtually  guarantees  revenue.  The  agribusiness  lobby,  which  includes  large  farming  concerns  as  well  as  publicly  traded  corporations  like  Monsanto  and  Kroger,  spent  $111  million  pressing  lawmakers,  according  to  Bloomberg.  That's  more  than  the  defense  and  union  lobbies  combined.  Connecticut  Rep.  Rosa  DeLauro,  a  Democrat  who  voted  against  the  measure,  called  it  "nothing  more  than  reverse  Robin  Hood  legislation  that  steals  food  from  the  poor  in  favor  of  crop  subsidies  for  the  rich."If  not  for  the  hungry  children,  there  might  be  a  bright  side.  It's  not  every  day  that  the  real  constituency  of  establishment  Republicans  is  revealed  so  clearly.Typically,  the  GOP's  representation  of  big  business  is  shrouded  by  rhetorical  expressions  of  concern  for  workaday  Americans.  For  instance,  after  President  Obama  announced  he  would  use  his  executive  authority  to  raise  the  base  wage  of  workers  employed  by  companies  with  federal  contracts,  House  Speaker  John  Boehner  accused  Obama  of  hurting  workers  by  hurting  their  employers."We  know  from  increases  in  the  minimum  wage  in  the  past  that  hundreds  of  thousands  of  low-income  Americans  have  lost  their  jobs,  and  so  the  very  people  the  President  purports  to  help  are  the  ones  who  are  going  to  get  hurt  by  this,"  Boehner  told  reporters  last  week  on  Capitol  Hill.While  it  may  sound  credible  to  argue  that  paying  workers  $3  and  some  change  more  per  hour  actually  hurts  them  in  the  long  run  (because  businesses  hiring  them  shed  workers  to  avoid  paying  more),  it's  completely  incredible  to  say  feeding  hungry  Americans  more  hurts  them.The  most  extreme  wing  of  the  Republican  Party,  including  those  who  opposed  the  farm  bill,  claims  that  it  spends  money  the  government  doesn't  have.  If  so,  such  moments  of  scarcity  demand  tough  and  moral  decisions  be  made  according  to  priorities.  With  this  bill,  the  Republicans  have  said  loudly  that  corporations  with  billions  in  revenue  are  more  important  than  children.The  Republicans'  real  constituency  isn't  the  only  thing  exposed.  So  is  their  opposition  to  "redistribution."  That's  movement  conservatism's  core  complaint  with  the  welfare  state:  They  say  government  takes  money  from  hard-working  Americans,  who  play  by  the  rules  and  strive  to  succeed,  and  gives  it  to  the  undeserving  poor.  Another  variation  comes  from  talk-radio  show  host  Rush  Limbaugh:  "Redistribution  is  theft,"  he  said  last  month.  "It  is  a  powerful  government  taking  from  people  they  deem  to  have  too  much,  or  more  than  they  need,  and  then  just  giving  it  to  people  they  deem  worthy  of  receiving  it."But  as  this  farm  bill  reveals,  Republicans  are  not  opposed  to  redistribution  at  all.  Quite  the  contrary.  The  question  isn't  whether  the  government  should  redistribute.  The  question  is  who  should  get  the  distributions.Republicans  have  argued  for  years  that  help  should  only  be  given  to  those  who  help  themselves.During  a  fundraising  event,  Lee  Bright,  a  Republican  state  senator  of  South  Carolina  who  is  challenging  U.S.  Sen.  Lindsey  Graham,  said:  "Able-bodied  people,  if  they  don't  work,  they  shouldn't  eat."That  argument  is  exposed  as  fundamentally  bankrupt  in  light  of  the  fact,  as  journalist  Sasha  Abramsky  reported  last  year,  that  "22%  of  children  in  America  live  in  poverty  --  a  number  far  higher  than  that  in  any  other  peer  nation.  More  than  47  million  Americans  avoid  hunger  only  because  of  the  existence  of  the  federal  food  stamp  program."But  of  course  this  is  about  hungry  children.  Lots  of  them.  Perhaps  worst  of  all  is  the  moral  climate  created  and  maintained  by  Limbaugh  &  Co.  in  which  depriving  children  of  food  is  permissible.Case  in  point:  In  Utah  recently,  around  40  students  in  one  of  Salt  Lake  City's  elementary  schools  watched  as  food-service  workers  seized  their  lunches  and  threw  them  into  the  trash.  The  reason?  Unpaid  meal  accounts.  Said  one  outraged  mother:  "These  are  young  children  that  shouldn't  be  punished."Amen  to  that.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  John  Stoehr.</TEXT></DOC>

"When  it  comes  to  these  guys  being  here,  all  the  hotels  in  the  surrounding  areas  are  full.  They  eat  here.  They  sleep  here.  From  an  economic  standpoint,  there  will  be  some  loss."So  lawmakers  like  Missouri  Sen.  Roy  Blunt  and  his  Democratic  colleague,  Sen.  Claire  McCaskill,  will  do  what  they  often  to  when  faced  with  steep  budgetary  cuts  that  will  cause  pain  back  home:  fight.Both  senators  and  10  other  lawmakers  wrote  Defense  Secretary  Chuck  Hagel  expressing  their  "deep  concern  with  the  Department  of  the  Army's  proposal  to  cut  Army  National  Guard  combat  aviation  assets  and  force  structure."Most  of  the  senators  --  many  of  whom  sit  on  powerful  funding  or  defense-related  committees  and  subcommittees  --  represent  states  with  military  bases  with  aviation  components.  In  addition  to  Blunt  and  McCaskill,  the  lawmakers  include  Senate  Minority  Whip  John  Cornyn,  R-Texas;  Sen.  Lamar  Alexander,  R-Tennessee;  and  Sen.  Lindsey  Graham,  R-South  Carolina,  who  all  sit  on  the  appropriations  committee.Hagel  cuts  would  reshape  military  after  longest  warSen.  Patrick  Leahy,  D-Vermont,  a  co-chairman  of  the  Senate  National  Guard  Caucus  who  sits  on  the  appropriations  defense  subcommittee,  also  signed  the  letter."While  we  are  aware  that  the  Army's  budget  request  for  fiscal  year  2015  is  pre-decisional,  every  indication  including  public  statements  and  briefings  from  Army  leadership  on  Capitol  Hill  suggests  the  decision  was  made  without  meaningful  consultation  with  the  Army  National  Guard,"  the  senators  wrote.  "The  shortsighted  approach  creates  unnecessary  risk  to  our  national  security  at  the  expense  of  incredibly  capable  attack  aviation  assets  in  the  Army  National  Guard."The  Pentagon's  leaner  budget  proposals,  unveiled  Monday,  include  a  scale-back  that  will  whittle  the  nation's  Army  to  its  lowest  level  since  before  World  War  II  and  do  away  with  the  Warthogs  as  well  as  U-2  spy  planes,  among  other  cuts.Fight  brewingThose  kinds  of  cuts  are  guaranteed  to  spark  a  fight  pitting  lawmakers  against  Department  of  Defense  officials  and  state  against  state  in  a  scramble  to  keep  such  things  as  aircraft  carriers  and  their  crews'  economic  impact  on  a  community,  said  Mieke  Eoyang,  national  security  program  director  at  the  Third  Way,  a  centrist  policy  organization."What  you'll  see  is  a  fight  at  the  lowest  levels  of  public  awareness  where  they'll  try  to  restore  some  of  those  cuts,"  Eoyang  said,  adding  that  there's  little  political  incentive  for  members  of  Congress  to  offer  full-throated  support  of  Hagel's  proposal  to  trim  the  Army  to  a  level  of  440,000  to  450,000  troops  --  the  lowest  level  in  more  than  70  years.Last  year,  when  it  looked  as  if  the  A-10s  were  on  the  chopping  block,  Blunt,  who  sits  on  the  Senate  appropriations  defense  subcommittee,  offered  an  amendment  to  the  Pentagon  spending  measure  to  save  the  planes.Defense  policy  experts  say  that  these  types  of  military  cuts  usually  affect  surrounding  communities.  As  troops  and  the  civilian  workers  who  maintain  military  equipment  are  either  reassigned  or  move  on,  the  towns  that  depend  on  them  struggle.The  Pentagon  says  the  cuts  are  simply  a  reflection  of  the  harsh  realities  of  this  era  of  federal  budget  cutbacks  and  a  shift  away  from  fighting  expensive,  extended  land  wars  abroad."These  recommendations  will  adapt  and  reshape  our  defense  enterprise  so  that  we  can  continue  protecting  this  nation's  security  in  an  era  of  unprecedented  uncertainty  and  change,"  Hagel  said  at  his  briefing.Many  defense  policy  experts  also  say  the  cuts  are  practical."Cutting  to  450,000  is  significant  but  within  reason.  It  is  a  cut  of  less  than  10%  from  typical  1990s  levels,  or  from  what  was  recently  already  planned,"  said  Michael  O'Hanlon,  a  defense  and  foreign  policy  expert  at  the  Brookings  Institution.  "And  with  Saddam  (Hussein)  gone  in  Iraq,  the  portfolio  of  threats  and  likely  missions  has  shifted  at  least  modestly  away  from  large-scale  ground  combat,  in  my  eyes."United  against  the  cutsBut  if  mounting  pushback  from  such  lawmakers  as  Graham  and  Sen.  John  McCain,  R-Arizona,  among  others,  and  a  number  of  military  advocacy  groups  is  any  indication,  the  Pentagon  will  have  a  hard  time  preserving  the  proposed  cuts.Gov.  Haley:  Cuts  to  National  Guard  a  'slap  in  the  face'South  Carolina  Gov.  Nikki  Haley  said  a  White  House  meeting  of  a  bipartisan  group  of  governors  Monday  largely  had  a  respectful  tone  until  the  discussion  turned  toward  military  cuts  at  the  end."It  automatically  went  into  an  aggressive  nature  by  (President  Obama),  implying  that  'many  of  you  have  asked  for  cuts,  this  is  what  you  said  you  wanted  ...  now  you're  going  to  get  it,  you're  going  to  have  to  live  with  it.'  Completely  different  change  in  tone,"  said  Haley,  who's  up  for  re-election  this  year  and  who  made  her  remarks  at  a  news  conference  by  the  Republican  Governors  Association  after  the  gathering  at  the  White  House."It  chilled  the  room  quite  a  bit,"  she  added.Groups  like  the  National  Guard  Association,  an  advocacy  group,  are  also  urging  their  members  to  pressure  their  congressional  lawmakers  to  reject  many  proposed  cuts,  such  as  trimming  Army  National  Guard  numbers  and  shifting  Apache  helicopters  from  the  Guard  to  the  active-duty  Army."The  National  Guard  is  a  commonsense  solution  to  the  challenges  facing  the  U.S.  military,"  said  John  Goheen,  director  of  communications  for  the  National  Guard  Association.  "Congress  and  the  nation's  governors  see  it.  Unfortunately,  the  Pentagon  does  not  or  will  not.  We  are  disappointed,  but  we  are  hardly  defeated."Chairman  of  the  Homeland  Security  Committee  Rep.  Michael  McCaul,  whose  Texas  district  neighbors  the  congressional  district  housing  Fort  Hood,  says  he  too  is  deeply  concerned  about  the  impact  of  the  proposed  cuts."This  president  is  sacrificing  our  most  important  responsibility,  our  national  defense,  on  the  altar  of  entitlements,"  he  told  CNN  in  a  prepared  statement.  "Instead  of  taking  on  mandatory  spending  and  reforming  our  entitlement  programs,  he's  proposing  dangerous  cuts  that  could  greatly  affect  our  military  readiness  and  national  security.  The  proposed  troop  levels  and  cuts  are  yet  another  retreat  by  this  president  when  it  comes  to  the  ability  of  our  armed  forces  to  effectively  do  their  jobs  and  to  the  safety  and  security  of  our  borders."Kermick,  the  Knob  Noster  city  administrator,  said  he'll  leave  the  debates  about  what  members  of  Congress  should  cut  regarding  the  A-10s  to  those  elected  officials.But  he  knows  one  thing  for  sure:  When  it  comes  to  getting  rid  of  the  A-10s,  he  says,  "I  don't  think  it's  a  good  idea,  personally.  But  that's  just  my  opinion."Food  stamp  use  among  military  rises  againCNN's  Tom  Cohen  and  Ashley  Killough  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

That's  an  increase  of  2.2%  over  2012.London's  Heathrow  Airport  remained  in  third  place  with  more  than  72  million  passengers,  an  increase  of  3.3%,  according  to  Airports  Council  International,  the  worldwide  association  of  airports.There  were  no  changes  to  fourth,  fifth  and  sixth  places.  They  remained  Tokyo  International  Airport  (Haneda),  Chicago  O'Hare  International  Airport  and  Los  Angeles  International  Airport.  With  66.4  million  passengers  last  year  and  a  15%  increase  in  traffic,  Dubai  jumped  from  10th  place  to  seventh  place."With  double-digit  growth  rates  in  passenger  traffic  for  2013,  Dubai  is  likely  to  move  up  several  spots  again  in  the  2014  rankings,  solidifying  its  status  as  the  major  hub  connecting  the  east  and  west,"  ACI  World's  Economics  Director  Rafael  Echevarne  said  in  a  press  release."Aviation's  nucleus  appears  to  be  moving  eastward,"  he  said.  "Other  emerging  markets  such  as  Turkey,  China  and  South  East  Asia  that  have  a  critical  mass  of  traffic  also  remain  major  contributors  to  the  upward  surge  in  air  transport  demand.  This  trend  will  continue  into  2014."Paris  dropped  from  seventh  to  eighth  place,  Dallas/Fort  Worth  remained  in  ninth  place  and  Jakarta  dropped  to  10th  place.Behind  the  scenes  at  the  world's  busiest  airportPassenger  traffic  continued  to  grow  around  the  world,  with  the  world's  airports  serving  nearly  5.4  billion  passengers  in  2013,  growing  by  4%  from  2012,  according  to  the  report.Atlanta's  airport  still  topped  the  rankings  in  airplane  movements  (takeoffs  and  landings),  with  911,000  movements  last  year.  Chicago  O'Hare  International  Airport  came  in  second  place  with  883,000  movements  and  Dallas/Fort  Worth  was  third  with  678,000.  Rounding  out  that  list  were  Los  Angeles  International  Airport,  Denver,  Beijing,  Charlotte,  Las  Vegas,  Houston  and  Paris.Hong  Kong's  airport  is  still  the  busiest  cargo  airport  in  the  world,  transporting  nearly  4.2  million  metric  tons  of  cargo  last  year.  Memphis,  Tennessee,  home  to  FedEx,  came  in  second  place  with  4.1  million  metric  tons  and  Shanghai  was  third  with  2.9  million  metric  tons.  (One  metric  ton  equals  2,205  pounds.)Rounding  out  the  top  10  were  cargo  airports  in  Incheon,  South  Korea;  Dubai;  Anchorage,  Alaska;  Louisville,  Kentucky;  Frankfurt,  Germany;  Paris;  and  Tokyo  (Narita).The  Airports  Council  International  preliminary  traffic  report  was  based  on  reports  from  over  1,105  airports  worldwide.

The  show  has  the  imprimatur  of  Sagan's  widow,  Ann  Druyan,  and  is  being  produced  by  "Family  Guy"  mogul  Seth  MacFarlane,  an  avowed  "Cosmos"  geek.Through  it  all,  Tyson  has  maintained  his  good  humor  as  he's  promoted  the  show."The  universe  is  hilarious!"  he  told  GQ  in  a  recent  interview.  "Like,  Venus  is  900  degrees.  I  could  tell  you  it  melts  lead.  But  that's  not  as  fun  as  saying,  'You  can  cook  a  pizza  on  the  windowsill  in  9  seconds.'

"I  find  it  odd  that  we  live  in  a  time  where  people  who  are  strongly  religious  want  to  make  everyone  else  the  same  kind  of  religious  way  they  are,  and  break  down  the  door  of  the  science  classroom  to  put  their  religious  philosophies  in  there."Though  there  was  some  tweaking  of  religion  on  social  media  --  "SPOILER  ALERT:  apparently  the  earth  is  not  6000  years  old...

He  also  mentions  how  his  wife,  Rebecca,  and  their  two  daughters  "anchored  his  life  and  gave  him  the  freedom  to  live  it.""Without  them  always  at  the  center  of  his  being,"  the  obituary  continues,  "(Rebhorn's)  life  would  have  been  little  more  than  a  vapor.  Rebecca  loved  him  with  all  his  flaws,  and  in  her  the  concept  of  ceaseless  love  could  find  no  better  example."Rebhorn  was  born  in  September  1948  in  Philadelphia.  After  graduating  from  Ohio's  Wittenberg  University  and  earning  a  Master  of  Fine  Arts  from  Columbia,  he  soon  found  his  way  to  both  the  stage  and  the  screen.If  his  name  isn't  familiar,  his  face  probably  is:  Rebhorn  played  the  headmaster  in  1992's  "Scent  of  a  Woman,"  a  district  attorney  on  the  series  finale  of  "Seinfeld"  and  the  secretary  of  defense  alongside  Will  Smith  in  1996's  "Independence  Day."Most  recently,  he  was  on  television  as  "Homeland's"  Frank  Mathison,  the  father  of  Claire  Danes'  Carrie.Throughout  his  life,  Rebhorn's  obituary  says,  he  was  "fortunate  enough  to  earn  his  living  doing  what  he  loved.  ...  A  lucky  man  in  every  way."Although  his  representative  did  not  specify  Rebhorn's  cause  of  death,  she  said  he  died  "at  home  with  his  loving  family  in  attendance."In  addition  to  his  wife  and  daughters,  whom  he  says  "made  him  immensely  proud,"  Rebhorn  noted  the  numerous  family  members  and  friends  he's  leaving  behind."He  loved  them  all,"  Rehborn  said,  "and  he  knows  they  loved  him."People  we've  lost  in  2014CNN's  Alan  Duke  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

"I  cannot  take  this  anymore."Nguyen,  a  Vietnamese  developer  with  a  studio  called  DotGears,  did  not  reply  to  CNN's  request  for  an  interview  last  week  and  has  stayed  mostly  quiet  in  the  wake  of  the  game's  recent  and  sudden  success.His  no-frills  game  gave  players  a  chance  to  steer  a  tiny  bird  through  an  obstacle  course  of  metal  pipes.  But  it's  unclear  why  it  shot  to  the  top  of  the  most  downloaded  charts.Although  new  players  can  no  longer  download  "Flappy  Bird,"  the  game  remains  playable  for  those  who  had  already  added  it  to  their  devices.Hundreds  of  phones  with  "Flappy  Bird"  installed  have  suddenly  appeared  for  sale  on  eBay  at  prices  up  to  $15,000."Flappy  Bird"  was  originally  released  for  the  iPhone  in  May  but  didn't  become  the  top  free  iPhone  app  until  mid-January,  following  a  surge  in  popularity  that  seems  to  have  kicked  off  in  early  December.  Observers  have  voiced  several  unproven  theories  about  the  game's  sudden  success,  including  the  use  of  bots  to  get  it  on  Top  10  lists  artificially,  organic  enthusiasm  on  social  media  and  a  surge  in  amusing  user  reviews  in  the  Apple  App  and  Google  Play  stores.Nguyen  told  Chocolate  Lab  Apps  he  created  the  game  in  two  to  three  days  and  says  he  did  not  promote  the  app  in  any  way  after  its  release.In  a  series  of  Twitter  posts  Saturday,  he  said  he  wouldn't  sell  "Flappy  Bird"  and  would  continue  to  make  games."It  is  not  anything  related  to  legal  issues,"  he  said.  "I  just  cannot  keep  it  anymore."Last  week,  "Flappy  Bird"  had  an  average  four-star  rating  from  more  than  543,000  reviews  in  the  Apple  App  Store  and  228,000  on  Android.  Many  of  the  reviews  were  lengthy,  tongue-in-cheek  tales  of  time  lost,  marriages  ended  and  people  going  cuckoo  after  playing  the  game.CNN's  Heather  Kelly,  Nick  Valencia  and  Maegan  Ahern  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Joe  meets  Rick  againJust  when  it  almost  seemed  like  Rick's  trio  had  it  all  figured  out  (he  even  created  a  new  way  to  trap  game),  they  were  set  upon  by  Joe  and  his  up-to-no-good  crew  of  "rule  followers"  with  Daryl  in  tow.Despite  Daryl  begging  for  mercy,  Joe's  men  started  to  beat  him  to  death,  while  others  set  upon  Carl  and  Michonne.2.  Rick  fights  back,  big  timeWhen  Rick  saw  his  son  in  trouble,  he  moved  his  head  back  and  injured  Joe,  whose  gun  went  off.  Rick  --  well,  there's  no  other  way  to  put  this  --  then  bit  Joe  on  the  neck  and  went  after  the  rest  of  his  crew,  including  the  man  who  attacked  Carl,  repeatedly  stabbing  him  to  death.The  other  survivors  couldn't  believe  what  they  were  seeing.  Needless  to  say,  don't  mess  with  Carl.On  the  bright  side,  Daryl  is  back.  He  and  Rick  are  like  brothers  now,  too.The  post-racial  revolution  will  be  televised3.  Welcome  to  TerminusRick,  Daryl,  Michonne  and  Carl  finally  arrived  at  Terminus  --  sneaking  in  through  the  back,  of  course.The  moment  Rick  noticed  one  of  the  denizens  of  Terminus  wearing  Hershel's  watch  (now  owned  by  Glenn),  he  pulled  a  gun  on  someone  --  and  wait,  isn't  that  woman  wearing  Maggie's  poncho,  too?It  just  wouldn't  be  a  finale  without  a  shootout,  and  we  certainly  got  one  as  Rick  and  crew  fired  against  Gareth  and  the  rest  from  Terminus.4.  What  is  this  place?Entrails  seen  in  a  courtyard?  A  room  where  the  words  "Never  again"  are  painted  on  the  walls?  Something's  just  not  right  with  Terminus.  Unfortunately,  we  didn't  find  out  too  much  more  about  this.  ...5.  ReunitedGareth  finally  gets  the  upper  hand  and  orders  Rick,  Daryl  and  Michonne  (the  "ringleader,  archer  and  samurai")  to  enter  a  train  car.  An  enraged  Rick  asks  about  his  son,  and  Gareth  tells  Carl  to  walk  over  to  the  car.When  they  make  their  way  in,  they  soon  realize  that  Glenn,  Maggie,  Abraham  and  others  in  their  group  are  alive.Carol,  Tyrese  and  Judith  are  still  making  their  way  to  Terminus,  as  far  as  we  know,  but  Beth's  whereabouts  remain  unknown.Rick  delivers  one  of  the  best  lines  in  the  series'  history  when  he  tells  Glenn,  "They're  going  to  feel  really  stupid  when  they  find  out  ...  they're  screwing  with  the  wrong  people."Rick  certainly  proved  that  with  his  actions  this  week.  He's  gone  from  a  lawman  to  the  "Ricktator"  to  something  of  a  go-for-broke  violent  avenger  over  the  years.Were  you  happy  to  see  so  many  of  the  survivors  reunited  and  find  out  that  no  one  died  in  this  finale?

This  story  is  adapted  from  a  New  America  Foundation  policy  paper.(CNN)  --  On  Friday  President  Obama  will  address  the  nation  about  the  NSA's  controversial  surveillance  programs.  He  is  expected  to  announce  some  substantive  changes  to  those  programs  which  collect  data  about  the  phone  calls  of  every  American.After  the  first  leaks  by  former  NSA  contractor  Edward  Snowden  were  published  in  June,  Obama  defended  the  NSA's  surveillance  programs  during  a  visit  to  Berlin,  saying:  "We  know  of  at  least  50  threats  that  have  been  averted  because  of  this  information  not  just  in  the  United  States,  but,  in  some  cases,  threats  here  in  Germany.  So  lives  have  been  saved."Similarly,  Gen.  Keith  Alexander,  the  director  of  the  NSA,  testified  before  Congress  that  "the  information  gathered  from  these  programs  provided  the  U.S.  government  with  critical  leads  to  help  prevent  over  50  potential  terrorist  events  in  more  than  20  countries  around  the  world."Rep.  Mike  Rogers,  R-Michigan,  chairman  of  the  House  Permanent  Select  Committee  on  Intelligence,  said  on  the  House  floor  in  July  that  54  times  the  NSA  programs  "stopped  and  thwarted  terrorist  attacks  both  here  and  in  Europe  --  saving  real  lives."However,  a  New  America  Foundation  review  of  the  government's  claims  about  the  role  that  NSA  "bulk"  surveillance  of  phone  and  e-mail  communications  records  has  had  in  keeping  the  United  States  safe  from  terrorism  found  that  these  claims  are  overblown  and  even  misleading.An  in-depth  analysis  of  225  individuals  recruited  by  al  Qaeda  or  a  like-minded  group,  or  inspired  by  al  Qaeda  ideology,  and  charged  in  the  United  States  with  an  act  of  terrorism  since  9/11,  demonstrated  that  traditional  investigative  methods,  such  as  the  use  of  informants,  tips  from  local  communities,  and  targeted  intelligence  operations,  provided  the  initial  impetus  for  investigations  in  the  majority  of  cases,  while  the  contribution  of  NSA's  bulk  surveillance  programs  to  these  cases  was  minimal.(Click  on  the  link  to  go  to  a  database  of  all  these  225  individuals  and  additional  details  about  them  and  the  government's  investigations  of  these  cases.  )The  controversial  bulk  collection  of  American  telephone  metadata,  which  includes  the  telephone  numbers  that  originate  and  receive  calls,  as  well  as  the  time  of  those  calls  but  not  their  content,  under  Section  215  of  the  PATRIOT  Act,  appears  to  have  played  an  identifiable  role  in,  at  most,  1.8%  of  these  cases.This  finding  corrobrated  that  of  the  Obama-appointed  White  House  review  group  who  had  access  to  classified  materials  that  concluded  in  December  that  "section  215  telephony  meta-data  was  not  essential  to  preventing  attacks."Our  study  also  found  that  NSA  programs  involving  the  surveillance  of  non-U.S.  persons  outside  of  the  United  States  under  Section  702  of  the  FISA  Amendments  Act  played  a  role  in  4.4  percent  of  the  terrorism  cases  we  examined,  and  NSA  surveillance  under  an  unidentified  authority  played  a  role  in  1.3  percent  of  cases  we  examined.In  27  percent  of  the  cases  we  reviewed,  court  records  and  public  reporting  do  not  identify  which  specific  methods  initiated  the  investigation.  These  cases,  involving  62  individuals,  may  have  been  initiated  by  an  undercover  informant,  an  undercover  officer,  a  family  member  tip,  other  traditional  law  enforcement  methods,  CIA-  or  FBI-generated  intelligence,  NSA  surveillance  of  some  kind,  or  any  number  of  other  methods.Furthermore,  our  examination  of  the  role  of  the  database  of  U.S.  citizens'  telephone  metadata  in  the  single  plot  the  government  uses  to  justify  the  importance  of  the  program  --  that  of  Basaaly  Moalin,  a  San  Diego  cabdriver  who  in  2007  and  2008  provided  $8,500  to  Al-Shabaab,  al  Qaeda's  affiliate  in  Somalia  --  calls  into  question  the  necessity  of  the  Section  215  bulk  collection  program.According  to  the  government,  the  database  of  American  phone  metadata  allows  intelligence  authorities  to  quickly  circumvent  the  traditional  burden  of  proof  associated  with  criminal  warrants,  thus  allowing  them  to  "connect  the  dots"  faster  and  prevent  future  9/11-scale  attacks.  Yet  in  the  Moalin  case,  after  using  the  NSA's  phone  database  to  link  a  number  in  Somalia  to  Moalin,  the  FBI  waited  two  months  to  begin  an  investigation  and  wiretap  his  phone.This  undercuts  the  government's  theory  that  the  database  of  Americans'  telephone  metadata  is  necessary  to  expedite  the  investigative  process,  since  it  clearly  didn't  expedite  the  process  in  the  single  case  the  government  uses  to  extol  its  virtues.In  sum,  the  surveillance  of  American  phone  metadata  has  had  no  discernible  impact  on  preventing  acts  of  terrorism  and  only  the  most  marginal  of  impacts  on  preventing  terrorist-related  activity,  such  as  fundraising  for  a  terrorist  group.Given  that,  what  should  the  Obama  administration  do  about  the  NSA's  phone  data  collection  program,  which  keeps  the  phone  data  of  all  Americans  for  five  years?President  Obama  has  a  number  of  potential  choices.  The  first  is  to  continue  the  program  as  is.  Another  is  to  give  the  phone  collection  program  to  some  kind  of  private  third  party  entity,  and  another  is  to  mandate  that  the  phone  companies  keep  the  data.There  are  problems  with  all  these  approaches.The  status  quo  is  open  to  legal  challenges.  Judge  Richard  J.  Leon  of  the  District  of  Columbia  ruled  in  December  that  the  program  likely  violates  the  Constitution.  Another  federal  judge,  in  New  York,  ruled  in  favor  of  the  program  a  week  later,  so  its  legal  fate  might  have  to  be  determined  by  higher  courts.Giving  the  data  collection  program  to  some  kind  of  government-nominated  private  third  party  will  likely  be  seen  as  just  another  way  for  the  government  to  store  the  data.  And  the  phone  companies  don't  want  the  costs  and  headaches  of  storing  five  years  of  data.There  is  another  approach  that  should  be  considered,  which  is  to  abandon  the  bulk  phone  data  collection  program  entirely  and  go  back  to  the  tried  and  true  approach  of  having  the  government  get  a  court  order  to  look  at  a  suspect's  phone  records,  rather  than  leaving  that  decision  to  the  discretion  of  a  group  of  anonymous  officials  at  NSA,  as  is  now  the  case.This  hardly  seems  onerous.  After  all,  since  1979  judges  have  only  turned  down  0.3%  of  the  requests  they  have  received  for  warrants  involving  cases  of  suspected  espionage  or  terrorism.  But  such  a  move  would  assure  Americans  that  there  was  some  sort  of  due  process  going  on  whenever  their  phone  records  are  examined  by  the  government.  And  this  seems  closer  to  the  spirit  of  the  Fourth  Amendment,  which  guards  against  "unreasonable  searches,"  than  does  the  present  system.Thanks  to  David  Sterman  and  Emily  Schneider  for  their  research  help.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinion.</TEXT></DOC>

He  says  he  began  making  wigs  for  her  which  she  would  then  select  for  her  appearances.At  the  time  Minaj  was  a  burgeoning  star  who  had  steadily  built  her  fan  base  by  appearing  as  a  guest  rapper  on  mix  tapes  and  projects  by  her  label  mates  at  Young  Money  Entertainment.  She  quickly  became  known  as  the  first  lady  of  Young  Money,  which  includes  superstar  rappers  Drake  and  Lil  Wayne.The  female  rapper  also  became  well  known  for  her  sense  of  style,  including  a  multitude  of  wigs  ranging  from  platinum  blonde  to  pink.  She  poses  in  an  ensemble  which  includes  a  pink  wig  on  the  cover  of  her  platinum-selling  debut  album  "Pink  Friday,"  released  in  November  2010.Both  Davidson  and  his  attorney,  Christopher  Chestnut,  talked  to  CNN  about  his  influence  on  crafting  Minaj's  image  as  well  as  the  fact  that  the  rapper  now  sells  wigs  on  her  site  based  on  the  designs  Davidson  says  he  created.  The  stylist  said  he  discovered  the  wigs  were  being  marketed  and  sold  after  someone  sent  him  a  picture  and  he  began  researching."I  see  these  wigs  online,"  said  Davidson,  who  has  also  worked  with  others  in  the  industry,  including  singer  Patti  LaBelle  and  rapper  Remy  Ma.  "People  are  basically  duplicating  what  I  created  for  Nicki  Minaj.""Nicki  Minaj  is  reaping  great  success  and  financial  bounty  reward  for  Terrence's  creative  expertise,  and  he  is  entitled  to  participate  in  that,"  Chestnut  said.  "Someone's  got  to  stand  up  for  the  artist.  We  applaud  the  fact  that  she's  making  millions,  but  she's  also  got  to  pay  bounty  to  those  whose  creative  designs  she's  making  millions  off  of."In  his  suit,  Davidson  says  he  designed  several  wigs  for  Minaj,  including  the  "Pink  Upper  Bun  Wig,"  the  "Fox  Fur  Wig,"  and  the  "Half  Blonde-Half  Pink  Wig"  that  she  wore  in  appearances,  including  the  2010  MTV  Video  Music  Awards  preshow.  He  says  there  were  plans  for  he  and  Minaj  to  launch  a  wig  line  and  discussions  about  a  possible  reality  show.But  by  2012,  the  suit  claims,  "Minaj  and  her  agents  became  mum  about  the  business  ventures  and  took  active  steps  to  isolate  Mr.  Davidson  and  preclude  him  from  the  notoriety  he  deserved  for  his  wig  designs.""On  its  face  you  might  think,  what  this  guy  is  suing  over  wigs,"  Davidson's  attorney  Chestnut  said.  "But  we  really  have  to  consider  this  in  context.  Hair  is  a  multibillion-dollar  industry,  but  moreover  these  are  not  your  grandma's  wigs.  These  are  eclectic.  They  are  decadent,  and  they  are  creative.  This  is  about  a  brand  that  Terrence  has  built."CNN  has  reached  out  to  Minaj  and  her  representatives  for  comment.</TEXT></DOC>

"It's  called  stacking.  You  can  stack  the  same  drug  too  close  together,  or  you  can  start  to  stack  other  drugs,  one  on  top  of  the  other.  That's  how  people  get  into  trouble.  They  do  call  it  accidental  death  as  well."Police  found  nearly  50  envelopes  branded  "Ace  of  Spades"  filled  with  what  they  believe  was  heroin  in  the  actor's  Manhattan  apartment,  two  law  enforcement  sources  familiar  with  the  inquiry  said.Used  syringes,  prescription  drugs  and  empty  bags  that  authorities  suspect  were  used  to  hold  heroin  also  were  found  in  the  apartment  where  Hoffman,  46,  was  found  dead,  sources  said.He  was  expected  to  pick  up  his  children  that  day  but  didn't  show  up,  the  official  said.  Playwright  David  Katz  and  another  person  went  to  the  apartment  and  found  him  dead,  the  official  said.Police  officers  found  him  in  a  T-shirt  and  shorts  with  his  eyeglasses  still  on  his  head.Robert  Vineberg,  a  57-year-old  musician,  was  arrested  in  connection  with  Hoffman's  death  and  released  on  bail  earlier  this  month.  Vineberg  was  among  four  people  arrested  in  Manhattan  in  the  days  after  Hoffman's  death.Prosecutors  said  Vineberg,  who  was  arrested  on  a  felony  charge  of  criminal  possession  of  a  controlled  substance,  had  just  under  50  small  bags  of  heroin  as  well  as  packaging  paraphernalia  in  his  apartment  during  a  raid.  In  another  one  of  his  apartments  in  the  same  Mott  Street  building,  prosecutors  said,  250  small  bags  of  heroin  were  found.Vineberg  was  found  to  have  the  actor's  phone  number  stored  in  his  cell  phone,  a  law  enforcement  official  told  CNN.Two  other  people  arrested  in  connection  with  Hoffman's  death  --  Juliana  Luchkiw  and  Max  Rosenblum,  both  22  --  were  released  earlier  this  month  until  their  next  court  dates.Prosecutors  did  not  file  charges  against  a  fourth  person  arrested  in  the  raid.Hoffman  was  mourned  in  New  York  February  7  in  a  star-studded  private  funeral  attended  by  family  and  close  friends.Hoffman,  who  was  nominated  for  Academy  Awards  four  times,  won  the  Oscar  for  best  actor  in  2006  for  his  portrayal  of  writer  Truman  Capote  in  "Capote."  He  earned  Academy  Award  nominations  for  roles  in  "Charlie  Wilson's  War,"  "Doubt,"  and  "The  Master."</TEXT></DOC>

And  we  have  great  conversations  although  mostly  it's  about  history  more  than  about  what's  going  on  right  now,"  Obama  told  CNN  in  an  exclusive  interview  airing  Friday."But  it's  true.  Look,  they're  teenagers.  They're  fully  absorbed  with  their  lives,  what's  going  on  at  school."Still,  the  girls  have  managed  to  meet  a  great  number  of  people  who  will  have  a  place  in  history.That  includes  the  former  Pope,  Pope  Emeritus  Benedict  XVI.It  was  Obama's  first  year  in  office,  when  he  took  his  daughters  --  Sasha  and  Malia  --  with  him  to  the  Vatican."Sasha  was  still  pretty  young  at  the  time,"  Obama  said.  "...They  see  the  Sistine  Chapel,  and  they're  going  through  the  various  chambers.  Each  time  she'd  she  somebody  dressed  up  in  the  cloth,  she'd  say  'Is  that  the  pope?  Is  that  the  pope?'  How  'bout  that  guy  over  there?'"His  answer:  "No,  no,  you'll  know  when  it  is  finally  the  Pope."Obama  doesn't  know  if  the  girls  will  be  with  him  when  he  meets  the  new  leader  of  the  Catholic  Church,  Pope  Francis,  later  this  year."I  have  been  really  impressed  so  far  with  the  way  he  has  communicated  what  I  think  is  the  essence  of  the  Christian  faith,  and  that  is  a  true  sense  of  brotherhood  and  sisterhood  and  a  true  sense  of  regard  for  those  who  are  less  fortunate,"  Obama  said.Asked  if  he  might  have  some  advice  for  the  Pope  on  setting  expectations  a  little  lower,  the  president  laughed."My  suspicion  is  based  on  what  I've  seen  of  him  so  far,  he's  a  pretty  steady  guy.  I  don't  think  he  needs  any  advice  from  me  on  staying  humble."Pope  Francis  may  not  need  any  help  with  that  from  the  President,  but  Seattle  Seahawks  cornerback  Richard  Sherman  might.Sherman's  rant  following  the  Seahawks'  win  over  the  San  Francisco  49ers,  a  game  that  earned  him  a  spot  in  the  Super  Bowl,  caused  a  brouhaha  after  he  declared  he  was  the  best.He  was  ultimately  fined  more  than  $7,800  for  unsportsmanlike  conduct  after  he  made  a  choking  sign  at  49er  quarterback  Colin  Kaepernick."My  sense  is  he's  taking  a  page  out  of  Muhammad  Ali's  playbook,  which  is,  I  think  he  said  explicitly,  this  is  a  good  way  to  get  attention.  In  fact,  Ali  said  he  got  his  schtick  from  wrestlers  he  used  to  watch,"  Obama  said."...So  I  think  it's  part  of  the  tradition  'let  me  get  some  attention.'  Obviously,  it's  worked.  I  suspect  he's  going  to  have  a  lot  more  endorsement  contracts  and  more  jersey  sales  after  that."CNN  gave  the  President  two  options  of  competitions  that  we  wanted  him  to  weigh  in  on:  Former  Secretary  of  State  Hillary  Clinton  vs.  Vice  President  Joe  Biden  for  the  2016  Democratic  presidential  nomination  or  the  Seattle  Seahawks  vs.  the  Denver  Broncos  in  Sunday's  Super  Bowl."I  think  it's  going  to  be  a  lot  like  the  Seahawks-49ers  game.  I  think  it's  going  to  come  down  to  the  last  play,"  Obama  said.  "...I'm  not  going  to  pick  because  I  don't  want  to  offend  any  of  the  great  cities  participating."Okay  so  if  he's  not  going  to  pick  in  the  Super  Bowl  than  what  about  Clinton  versus  Biden?"I'm  too  smart  for  that,"  the  President  said.Jake  Tapper  reported  from  Waukesha,  Wisconsin;  and  Chelsea  J.

And  that's  why  Justice  Department  officials,  including  the  (Drug  Enforcement  Administration),  and  other  key  federal,  state,  and  local  leaders,  are  fighting  back  aggressively,"  Holder  said,  adding  that  heroin  overdoses  increased  by  45  percent  between  2006  and  2010.Are  heroin  death  probes  created  equal?One  of  the  main  efforts,  Holder  said,  was  to  attack  the  problem  by  combating  highly  addictive  prescription  pills,  which  studies  show  often  lead  to  heroin  use."With  DEA  as  our  lead  agency,  we  have  adopted  a  strategy  to  attack  all  levels  of  the  supply  chain  to  prevent  pharmaceutical  controlled  substances  from  getting  into  the  hands  of  non-medical  users,"  Holder  said.As  an  example  of  the  growing  problem,  the  Justice  Department  says  there  was  a  320%  increase  in  heroin  seized  along  the  southwest  U.S.  border  from  2008  through  2013.The  attorney  general  is  also  asking  that  first  responders  be  equipped  with  a  overdose-reversing  drug  called  Naloxone.

But  it's  a  new  year  --  time  to  toss  the  acid  wash  denim,  crop  tops  and  flatform  sandals  you  loved  last  year.  They're  not  coming  back.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Last  year,  it  seemed  like  Miley  Cyrus  didn't  own  a  single  shirt  that  was  longer  than  her  rib  cage.  Peplums  were  the  ultimate  in  waist  definition.  Skinny,  colored  jeans  were  the  Spandex-filled  answer  to  every  girl's  denim  dreams.When  a  fashion  trend  takes  hold,  it  seems  like  it's  everywhere,  from  red  carpets  to  fashion  magazines  to  paparazzi  snapshots  to  your  local  department  store.  Of  course,  even  consumers  know  that  what  seems  like  a  great  idea  at  the  time  will  probably  have  an  expiration  date.  But  how  do  you  know  when  it's  time  to  purge  your  closet?"The  thing  about  fashion  is  it's  completely  cyclical,"  said  Lilliana  Vazquez,  the  author  of  "The  Cheap  Chica's  Guide  To  Style:  Secrets  to  Shopping  Cheap  and  Looking  Chic."One  of  the  boldest  runway  statements  last  year  was  the  "punk/grunge"  look  by  designer  Hedi  Slimane  for  Yves  Saint  Laurent's  fall  2013  ready-to-wear  collection.  Almost  20  years  earlier,  Marc  Jacobs  debuted  a  grunge  music-inspired  Perry  Ellis  collection  full  of  punky  plaid,  ready-for-a-fight  Doc  Martens  and  and  layers  upon  layers  of  attitude.  (Jacobs  was  fired  from  Perry  Ellis  shortly  after.)When  she  saw  punk  and  grunge  re-emerge  in  fall  2013  collections,  Vazquez  confessed  she  had  a  "cringe"  moment."I  was  like,  'Oh,  is  that  really  happening?'"  she  said.  "You  saw  it  the  first  time,  and  it  didn't  look  good  on  anyone,  and  then  you're  seeing  it  again."Does  that  mean  that  you  should  have  popped  those  MC  Hammer  pants  into  a  time  capsule,  or  held  on  to  your  Baby  Spice-style  platform  sneakers  from  1996?Um,  no,  fashion  experts  say.Young  people  who  didn't  experience  the  trend  20  years  ago  might  have  fun  experimenting  with  these  looks,  Style.com's  executive  editor  Nicole  Phelps  said,  but  that  doesn't  mean  they're  going  to  flatter  the  majority  of  body  types.  Some  of  the  1980s-inspired  looks  that  seemed  on-trend  last  year  "feel  more  like  a  fling,"  she  said.In  fact,  here  are  the  fads  of  last  year  that  fashion  experts  agree  should  no  longer  take  up  space  in  your  closet.Peplum  waists"One  (trend)  that  we've  seen  kind  of  making  its  way  out  is  the  peplum,"  Vazquez  said.  The  peplum  was  everywhere  last  year,  she  said  --  on  dresses,  shirts  and  jackets.  "Those  are  so  2013.  I  would  get  rid  of  those,"  said  SheFinds  founder  Michelle  Madhok.Colored,  chemically  washed,  ripped  or  skinny  denimRaw  denim  in  mid-toned  blue  and  the  occasional  unfinished  hem  is  looming  on  the  fashion  horizon  for  jeans,  Phelps  said.  It's  a  look  that's  more  accessible  than  the  almost  universally  unflattering  high-waisted,  acid-washed  cutoff  jeans  that  had  many  a  (cringeworthy)  moment  in  2013.  When  Sasha  Obama  wore  a  pair  this  summer,  Vazquez  said  she  thought,  "Oh  my  gosh,  what?!  How  did  you  let  her  out  of  the  house  like  that?"Wedge  sneakersGo  ahead  and  call  it:  Wedge  sneakers  were  the  "Ugg  of  2013,"  Madhok  said.  Designer  Isabel  Marant  put  them  on  the  map  last  year,  and  the  entire  Style.com  office  was  crazy  about  them,  Phelps  said,  but  now  "they  feel  played  out."CutoutsThe  revealing  cutout  details  of  2013  dresses  have  been  replaced  by  sheer  fabric,  said  Sheila  Aimette,  the  vice  president  of  fashion  trend  forecasting  company  WGSN.  In  2014,  she  said,  sheer  paneling  and  insets  are  going  to  appear  for  the  the  spring  season,  she  said,  harkening  back  to  the  1990s,  "Clueless"-styled  fashion  statements.FlatformsSorry,  these  high-soled  shoes  just  don't  look  good  on  anyone.  "They  make  your  legs  look  chunky  and  they're  hard  to  walk  in,"  Madhok  said.  "They're  not  doable."Neon"Fashion  certainly  seems  to  be  moving  away  from  that  flashy  sensibility,"  Phelps  said.  There  is  a  quietness  to  the  spring  and  pre-fall  collections  of  2014,  with  light  pastels  instead  of  Day-Glo-type  yellows  and  pinks.Crop  topsThe  barely-there  crop  tops  that  Miley  Cyrus  and  Rihanna  helped  popularize  in  2013  turned  out  to  look  good  only  on  them,  and  a  few  runway  models.  Nobody  else  bought  them.For  spring,  they're  morphing  into  something  longer  and  boxier.  Sure,  you  could  attempt  to  layer  a  2013-style  crop  top  with  sweaters  during  the  colder  months  of  2014,  but  as  Phelps  points,  out,  there's  already  a  backlash  to  fashions  that  leave  little  to  the  imagination."In  music,  we  really  miss  the  '90s  rock  girls,"  Phelps  said.  "They  weren't  stripping  down  to  their  bra  and  underwear  like  the  Miley  Cyruses  of  today.  There  was  a  real,  strong,  almost  feminist  message  to  a  lot  of  their  music  and  we're  longing  for  that  in  terms  of  pop  culture.  Maybe  that  will  reflect  back  on  fashion."But  stop  right  there  --  don't  shove  everything  in  the  trash  bag.  Just  because  it's  2014  doesn't  mean  all  of  last  year's  trends  have  magically  disappeared.If  you  picked  up  a  1940s/1950s  look  --  hyper-feminine  silhouettes  in  dresses  and  skirts,  or  more  masculine  blazers  and  pantsuits  --  try  slipping  those  into  your  office  wear.Young  women  are  still  gravitating  toward  glamorous  takes  on  athletic  wear  --  embellished  sweatshirts  and  vintage-styled  sneakers,  for  example.And  don't  give  up  on  grunge  just  yet,  Phelps  said:  Those  slouchy  shirts  seem  trendy,  but  they're  "classic  casual."</TEXT></DOC>

That's  how  David  Wildstein  was  introduced  to  the  Port  Authority  of  New  York  and  New  Jersey  in  2010,  according  to  a  former  employee  with  extensive  knowledge  of  the  agency's  hiring  practices.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Give  him  a  position  at  the  top  of  the  agency;  he's  a  good  friend  of  the  governor.That's  how  David  Wildstein  was  introduced  to  the  Port  Authority  of  New  York  and  New  Jersey  in  2010,  according  to  a  former  employee  with  extensive  knowledge  of  the  agency's  hiring  practices.Soon  after,  Wildstein  was  named  the  director  of  Interstate  Capital  Projects,  a  title  that  previously  had  not  existed  at  the  bi-state  agency,  setting  in  motion  a  career  that  would  eventually  place  the  former  political  blogger  at  the  center  of  the  lane  closures  controversy  at  the  George  Washington  Bridge.Wildstein  catapulted  into  the  national  spotlight  with  his  response  to  the  infamous  e-mail  from  New  Jersey  Gov.  Chris  Christie's  aide:  "Time  for  some  traffic  problems  in  Ft.  Lee,"  Bridget  Kelly  wrote.  Wildstein  responded,  "Got  it."Read  the  emailsA  former  Port  Authority  employee  told  CNN  that  agency  officials  were  told  in  2010  they  had  to  find  a  place  for  WIldstein  at  the  executive  level  and  the  directive  was  coming  from  Christie's  office.  Soon  after,  the  position  was  created  specifically  for  WIldstein.  When  Wildstein  started,  Deputy  Executive  Director  Bill  Baroni,  Christie's  top  appointee  at  the  agency,  introduced  him  to  people  as  a  good  friend  of  the  governor.Who  is  David  Wildstein?CNN  examined  documents  from  the  Port  Authority  showing  the  names,  titles  and  salaries  of  nearly  7,000  employees.  The  reports  show  that  prior  to  Christie's  first  term  in  office  there  were  four  people  working  in  the  deputy  executive  director's  office,  the  highest  position  on  the  New  Jersey  side  of  the  agency.  When  Christie  came  into  office  the  number  increased  to  six.  The  documents  show  that  Wildstein's  position  was  created  in  May  2010.Port  Authority  payroll  records  from  2012Port  Authority  payroll  records  from  2009Sources,  including  several  current  and  former  employees  at  various  levels  of  the  Port  Authority  who  did  not  want  their  names  used,  told  CNN  it  was  assumed  that  when  David  Wildstein  was  involved  in  any  discussions  at  the  agency,  the  information  was  being  passed  back  to  Christie's  office.Wildstein's  role  included  scrutinizing  the  agency's  business  for  the  governor  and  that's  why  he  was  given  such  a  broad  title,  sources  said.  Those  current  and  former  employees  said  people  were  careful  about  what  they  said  when  Wildstein  was  in  the  room,  always  assuming  it  would  get  back  to  Christie.Christie  spokesman  Colin  Reed  said  the  idea  that  Wildstein  was  the  governor's  eyes  and  ears  is  "inaccurate"  and  "has  been  mischaracterized  by  the  media.""As  the  governor  made  clear  last  week,  David  Wildstein  is  not  a  childhood  friend  and  his  interactions  with  him  over  the  last  four  years  have  been  limited.  Last  month,  he  appointed  a  new  leader  at  the  Port  Authority  with  a  proven  record  of  rooting  out  corruption  and  reforming  government  agencies  to  help  lead  the  agency,"  Reed  said.Neither  Baroni  nor  Wildstein  responded  to  requests  for  comment  from  CNN.Wildstein  personally  directed  the  infamous  lane  closures  on  the  George  Washington  Bridge  in  September.  The  revelations  come  in  new  Port  Authority  documents  released  on  Thursday  by  the  U.S.  Senate  Commerce  Committee.  They  paint  a  picture  of  a  man  who  went  rogue,  closing  lanes  without  following  proper  procedures,  despite  warnings  of  traffic  backups  and  safety  risks.  The  governor  is  at  the  center  of  multiple  investigations  over  whether  the  closure  was  political  retaliation  for  the  Democratic  mayor  of  Fort  Lee's  failure  to  endorse  Christie  in  his  re-election  campaign.Fort  Lee  mayor  takes  more  measured  tone  after  meeting  with  ChristieChristie  distanced  himself  from  Wildstein  after  the  story  broke.  While  he  and  Wildstein  attended  the  same  high  school,  Christie  said,  "David  and  I  were  not  friends  in  high  school.  We  were  not  even  acquaintances  in  high  school."High  school  acquaintances  contacted  by  CNN  backed  up  the  governor.  Christie  was  on  Livingston  High  School's  baseball  team.  Wildstein  was  the  team's  statistician.  The  former  coach  of  the  team,  Tony  Hope,  said  the  two  could  not  have  been  more  different."Nobody  could  ever  say  a  bad  thing  about  Chris,  they  loved  him.  David  was  the  extreme  opposite,"  Hope  said.  "David  was  very  quiet,  also  extremely  intelligent,  but  he  didn't  have  great  social  skills  ...  he  kept  to  himself,  a  nice  individual  but  never  really  related  to  his  peers."Wildstein  had  a  different  reputation  throughout  the  Port  Authority.  Several  sources  said  he  would  sometimes  yell  and  threaten  to  have  employees  fired  when  they  repeatedly  contradicted  him  or  pushed  back  on  his  initiatives.The  Newark  Star  Ledger  reported  in  February  2012  that  critics  accused  Christie  of  turning  the  Port  Authority  into  a  patronage  mill.  Citing  a  document  titled  "NY/NJ  Executive  Referrals"  the  newspaper  showed  there  were  35  new  Port  Authority  hires  directed  by  Christie  during  his  first  year  in  office.  That's  more  than  the  last  four  governors  combined,  according  to  the  paper.</TEXT></DOC>

Daniel  Tammet's  relationship  to  this  number  is  special:  At  age  25,  he  recited  22,514  digits  of  pi  from  memory.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  This  piece  was  originally  published  in  2013.  Happy  Pi  Day  from  the  CNN  Health  team!(CNN)  --  In  Daniel  Tammet's  mind,  three  is  a  dotted  green  crescent  moon  shape,  one  is  a  sort  of  white  sunburst  and  four  is  a  blue  boomerang.  Every  number  has  a  distinct  color  and  shape,  making  the  number  pi,  which  begins  with  3.14,  unfold  like  a  beautiful  poem.For  math  enthusiasts  around  the  world,  March  14  (3-14)  is  Pi  Day,  honoring  the  number  pi,  which  is  the  ratio  of  circumference  to  diameter  of  a  circle.  On  Thursday,  Tammet  is  promoting  France's  first  Pi  Day  celebration  at  the  Palace  of  Discovery  science  museum  in  Paris.Tammet's  relationship  to  this  number  is  special:  At  age  25,  he  recited  22,514  digits  of  pi  from  memory  in  2004,  scoring  the  European  record.  For  an  audience  at  the  Museum  of  the  History  of  Science  in  Oxford,  he  said  these  numbers  aloud  for  5  hours  and  9  minutes.  Some  people  cried  --  not  out  of  boredom,  but  from  sheer  emotion  from  his  passionate  delivery."What  my  brain  was  doing  was  inventing  a  meaning,  like  a  story,"  Tammet  said.  "What  I  did  was  make  a  poem  or  a  novel  out  of  pi,  and  took  those  colors  and  those  emotions  and  used  them  to  perceive  patterns,  or  at  least  to  perceive  patterns  in  my  mind  that  were  memorable,  that  were  meaningful  to  me."Many  people  around  the  world  --  including  me  --  have  been  interested  enough  in  this  number,  or  in  memorization  itself,  to  see  how  many  digits  they  can  bank.  Pi  has  infinitely  many  digits  with  no  discernible  pattern,  yet  it  mathematically  explains  the  shape  of  all  circles.  This  makes  memorizing  it  a  difficult,  yet  somehow  meaningful,  challenge.Serious  pi  memorizers  such  as  Tammet  have  become  fascinating  subjects  of  study  for  scientists,  too.  They  bring  up  fundamental  questions  about  innate  ability  vs.  learned  skills.  Are  the  brains  of  people  with  superior  memory  somehow  different?  Or  can  anyone  learn  thousands  of  random  digits?How  pi  is  used  in  real  scienceMaking  meaning  out  of  numbersSuperior  memorizers,  according  to  the  research  of  K.  Anders  Ericsson,  professor  of  psychology  at  Florida  State  University,  have  three  special  skills.  They  use  knowledge  and  patterns  that  they  already  know  to  encode  information  in  their  long-term  memory.  They  associate  that  information  with  retrieval  cues,  so  that  they  can  trigger  the  information  again.  They  also  get  faster  at  all  this  by  becoming  better  at  encoding  and  retrieval  through  intense  practice  and  effort.This  theory  appears  to  explain  Chao  Lu,  who  set  the  current  world  record  for  pi  recitation  at  67,890  digits  in  2005,  at  age  23.  Creating  associated  meanings  in  numbers  played  a  big  part  of  that.  He  used  mnemonics  relating  to  the  sounds  of  numbers  as  well  as  the  shapes  or  meanings  of  particular  digits  and  images,  according  to  a  2009  study  by  Ericsson  and  colleagues.Strangely,  if  presented  with  one  number  at  a  time,  at  one  digit  per  second,  Lu's  recall  is  no  better  than  the  average  person's,  Ercisson  and  colleagues  found.  With  that  rate  of  presentation  of  numbers,  he  is  forced  to  rehearse  numbers  in  his  head  just  like  everyone  else,  Ericsson  said.Sweet  recipes  for  national  pi(e)  dayBut  with  large  blocks  of  numbers,  it's  a  different  story.  Lu  and  a  previous  pi-memorizing  record  holder,  Hideaki  Tomoyori,  who  recited  40,000  digits  of  pi,  have  said  they  linked  words  or  images  to  groups  of  two,  three  or  four  numbers.  Then  they  created  stories  connecting  them.  Tomoyori  practiced  daily,  spending  between  9,000  and  10,000  hours  total  memorizing  before  his  recitation.A  rare  case  was  Rajan  Mahadevan,  who  set  a  record  at  31,811  digits  of  pi  and  did  not  report  using  any  mnemonics.  When  tested  by  researchers,  it  appeared  he  sequentially  memorized  numbers  in  blocks  of  10.  While  some  argued  that  Mahadevan  may  have  an  innate  ability  to  memorize,  Ericsson  and  colleagues  found  in  their  experiments  with  Mahadevan  that  he  learned  his  unusual  methods  for  memorizing  numerical  patterns  after  a  thousand  hours  of  practice.Amateurs  have  their  own  methods  and  perceptions.  Lulis  Leal,  47,  of  New  York,  is  also  getting  in  on  the  pi  memorization  action.  Inspired  by  a  CNN  iReport  assignment,  she  is  up  to  314  digits  and  recorded  herself  reciting  them."It's  a  visual  thing,"  she  said  of  pi.  "It's  just  a  picture  that  I  see  --  a  line  going  up  and  down."Listening  to  Leal's  recitation  is  jarring  for  me  because  I  hear  it  in  a  different  rhythm,  as  though  it  were  a  song  with  the  down-beat  on  every  other  digit.  When  I  was  a  teenager  I  saw  a  website  suggesting  pi  could  be  a  song,  with  one  as  middle  C,  two  as  D,  three  as  E,  etc.  This  helped  me  get  up  to  178  digits  in  college,  winning  me  a  T-shirt.A  Pi  Day  song:  'American  Pi'The  neuroscience  of  expert  memoryThere's  no  straightforward  control  over  what  we  remember  and  what  we  forget;  we  all  wish  we  could  remember  some  things  and  forget  others.  But  it  is  possible  to  train  as  a  mental  athlete,  and  there  are  entire  competitions  around  that,  said  Joshua  Foer,  author  of  "Moonwalking  With  Einstein"  and  memory  championship  winner."Why  do  people  memorize  pi?  Why  do  people  climb  Mount  Everest?  You  don't  need  to  do  it,"  Foer  said.  "There's  something  about  wanting  to  see  how  far  you  can  go  and  how  much  you  can  push  yourself."Foer:  How  to  train  your  mind  to  remember  anythingFor  memorization,  it  helps  to  find  meaning  in  the  information  and  tie  it  to  multiple  senses,  such  as  auditory  and  visual,  said  Dara  Manoach,  associate  professor  of  psychology  at  Harvard  Medical  School  and  researcher  at  Massachusetts  General  Hospital.An  area  of  the  brain  called  the  dorsal  lateral  prefrontal  cortex  gets  activated  when  you're  holding  information  online  --  for  instance,  keeping  a  phone  number  in  your  head  until  you  can  write  it  down  or  call  it.  Associating  a  number  with  sensations,  and  integrating  it  with  existing  knowledge,  engages  more  neural  systems  and  helps  you  store  the  information.Studies  of  people  with  exceptional  memory  have  not  found  any  structural  differences  between  their  brains  and  those  of  people  with  average  memory,  Ericsson  said.But  researchers  have  found  differences  in  the  activation  of  certain  brain  areas  in  exceptional  memorizers.  The  patterns  reveal  at  the  neurological  level  how  people  with  "good  memory  performance"  are  associating  new  information  with  things  they  already  know,  such  as  familiar  numbers  like  area  codes  or  other  semantic  information.Ericsson's  take  on  becoming  an  expert  at  something,  such  as  memorizing  pi,  is  deliberate  practice.  His  research  basis  for  the  idea,  popularized  by  Malcolm  Gladwell,  is  that  it  takes  10,000  hours  to  achieve  expertise.  But  Ericsson  pointed  out  that  this  was  based  on  studies  of  musicians  in  top  groups  who  spent  an  average  of  10,000  hours  at  practice.  That  means  some  spent  more  time  and  some  spent  less."To  win  an  international  piano  competition,  I  calculated  that  you  need  about  25,000  hours  of  piano  training,"  Ericsson  said.That  doesn't  mean  there  aren't  people  who  can  just  memorize  numbers  without  connecting  them  with  anything  else  --  but,  said  Ericsson,  "so  far  I've  yet  to  see  anybody  who  is  willing  to  be  tested."On  Pi  Day,  is  'pi'  under  attack?A  coincidence  of  sensesThere  are,  however,  ways  in  which  Tammet  may  inherently  have  a  different  approach  to  numbers  than  most  pi  memorizers.Tammet  has  high-functioning  autism,  a  developmental  condition  associated  with  impaired  social  communication  and  repetitive  behaviors  or  fixated  interests.  On  top  of  that,  he  has  synesthesia,  meaning  he  experiences  a  mixing  of  senses  and  perceptions  --  specifically,  he  sees  words  and  numbers  as  colors  and  shapes.With  autism,  no  longer  invisibleIn  an  analysis  of  Tammet's  case,  published  by  Simon  Baron-Cohen  and  colleagues  in  the  Journal  of  Consciousness  Studies  in  2007,  researchers  wrote  that  both  autism  and  synesthesia,  while  different,  are  associated  with  an  excess  of  neural  connections;  it's  possible  they  have  a  "common  neural  abnormality."  They  also  proposed  the  idea  that  autism  and  synesthesia  together  may  have  increased  the  likelihood  of  Tammet's  savant  memory.  More  research  is  needed  to  support  both  these  ideas.Foer's  book  questions  whether  Tammet  has  used  mnemonic  methods  to  memorize  digits  of  pi  and  other  information,  just  like  everyone  else  without  synesthesia.  But  Julian  Asher  at  the  Autism  Research  Centre  at  the  University  of  Cambridge,  who  studied  Tammet,  said  synesthesia  is  "fundamental  to  his  feats  of  memory."  Recalling  pi  for  Tammet  is  like  "walking  through  a  synaesthetic  landscape  in  which  different  numbers  are  represented  by  geographical  features,  and  'reading'  them  off  as  he  goes,"  Asher  said  in  an  e-mail.Tammet  grew  up  as  the  oldest  of  nine  children.  The  stimulation  he  received  from  his  large  family  probably  helped  him  develop  social  skills,  he  said."If  I  hadn't  had  that  love  and  that  patience  and  that  support  from  an  early  age,  I  might  not  be  where  I  am  today,  certainly,"  he  said.As  a  child,  he  was  called  "private,"  "shy"  and  "timid."  He  also  had  epileptic  seizures,  and  took  medication  until  he  grew  out  of  them."When  he  sat  on  the  carpet  during  story  time,  with  his  eyes  tight  shut  and  his  fingers  in  his  ears,  picturing  numbers  in  his  mind  and  their  shapes  and  colors,  whilst  the  other  children  looked  at  each  other  or  at  the  teacher  and  listened  to  the  story,  (Tammet)  was  in  some  sense  in  a  world  of  his  own,"  Baron-Cohen  and  colleagues  wrote.Geekiness  and  autism:  Is  there  a  connection?In  high  school,  Tammet  learned  about  pi  and  thought  it  was  beautiful.  But  when  he  talked  about  it  with  his  classmates,  they  didn't  understand.  For  them,  pi  was  just  a  number.  It  didn't  have  any  color  or  beauty  or  emotion."That's  when  I  had  a  perception  of  the  world,  of  words,  of  numbers,  that  was  different,"  he  said.  Secretly,  he  started  memorizing  digits  of  pi.San  Francisco  museum  celebrates  25  years  of  Pi  DayFinding  life  through  piAt  age  25,  Tammet  finally  felt  confident  enough  to  "share  all  those  years  of  loneliness,  all  those  years  of  battling  with  this  condition,  with  my  autism,  all  the  years  of  also  experiencing  this  tremendous  beauty,  this  emotion."He  spent  about  three  months  learning  thousands  of  digits  of  pi,  which  he  saw  as  an  emotional  experience,  being  transported  into  another  world.Tammet's  achievement  of  the  European  record  for  pi  recitation  wasn't  about  showing  off,  he  said.  First  and  foremost,  he  wanted  to  accomplish  something  that  meant  something  to  him  personally.  He  was  able  to  reach  out  to  people  without  autism,  without  synesthesia,  and  communicate  to  them  in  a  new  way.  The  event  also  benefited  an  epilepsy  charity."When  the  digits  darken  in  my  mouth  —  heavy  eights  and  nines  packed  together  —  the  tense  distant  faces  grow  tenser  still.  When  a  sudden  three  emerges  from  a  series  of  zeroes  and  sevens,  I  hear  something  like  a  faint  collective  pant.  Silent  nods  greet  my  accelerations;  warm  smiles  welcome  my  slowdowns,"  he  wrote  in  his  book  "Thinking  in  Numbers,"  which  comes  out  in  the  United  States  in  July.At  the  pi  recitation,  Tammet  realized  he  had  a  gift  of  communicating,  and  that  set  him  on  the  path  to  becoming  a  full-time  writer.The  pi  memorization  event  also  led  Tammet  to  Baron-Cohen  and  colleagues,  who  made  the  diagnosis  of  high-functioning  autism.  It  explained  the  difficulties  he  had  with  communication  and  social  skills  as  a  child.He  has  not  recited  pi  since  the  2004  event,  but  still  appreciates  the  beauty  and  wonder  of  the  number  enough  to  promote  Pi  Day  in  France."You  can  find  a  lover's  telephone  number.  Your  date  of  birth.  Your  Social  Security  code.  You  can  find  everything  in  pi,"  he  said.  "It's  big  enough  to  have  all  of  life  inside  of  it."Want  to  memorize  pi?  Here  are  10,000  digits.More  space  and  science  news  from  CNN  Light  Years</TEXT></DOC>

Etiquette  expert  Anna  Post  is  here  to  help.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  From  what  to  wear  to  what  to  register  for,  planning  and  preparing  for  an  upcoming  wedding  can  sometimes  be  tricky.  Navigating  through  each  and  every  sticky  situation  with  a  smile  can  be  hard  work.  Enter  Anna  Post.  The  etiquette  expert  and  co-author  of  "Emily  Post's  Etiquette,  18th  edition"  is  here  to  set  the  record  straight  on  some  of  the  most  frequently  asked  wedding  dilemmas.Who  should  be  the  first  to  know  about  my  engagement?Avoid  broadcasting  the  news  (photos  included)  to  social  networks  before  sharing  your  engagement  with  family  and  friends.  If  you  have  any  children  from  a  previous  marriage,  they  should  be  told  first.  Parents,  family  members,  godparents,  and  anyone  you  are  particularly  close  with  should  also  be  told  before  the  news  is  public  knowledge.Am  I  supposed  to  bring  a  gift  to  an  engagement  party?Traditionally  gifts  were  not  expected  at  the  engagement  party  but,  some  guests  opt  to  bring  a  small  token  --  like  Champagne  flutes  --  for  the  couple.  Because  engagement  gifts  aren't  a  standard  everywhere,  don't  expect  presents  to  be  opened  at  the  event.Real  Simple:  Splitting  the  Wedding  TabCan  I  have  someone  besides  my  father  walk  me  down  the  aisle?The  bride's  father  traditionally  walks  her  down  the  aisle,  but  you  can  have  anyone  who  is  significant—mom  or  stepdad,  brother  or  sister—walk  you  down  the  aisle.  You  can  even  walk  alone  or  with  more  than  one  person.No  matter  who  walks  you  down  the  aisle,  don't  let  it  be  a  last-minute  decision.  The  most  important  thing  is  to  maintain  an  open  and  honest  dialogue  with  anyone  impacted  by  your  choice.How  do  I  get  my  guests  to  RSVP?Give  guests  at  least  15  days  between  the  invitation's  arrival  and  the  RSVP  deadline  to  figure  out  the  logistics.  Sending  pre-stamped  enclosure  cards  or  permitting  RSVP  via  email  may  also  encourage  guests  to  respond  faster.Approximately  one  week  before  the  numbers  are  due  to  vendors,  make  follow-up  calls  to  guests  who  have  yet  to  reply.  This  is  a  great  time  to  ask  your  wedding  party  or  family  for  some  help.Real  Simple:  Wedding  Fashion  101If  I  know  someone  can't  attend,  do  I  need  to  send  an  invitation  anyway?Because  an  invitation  comes  with  the  expectation  of  a  gift,  you  don't  want  people  to  think  they  have  to  give  a  gift  even  though  they  cannot  attend.  If  someone  lets  you  know  that  they  have  a  conflict,  don't  follow  up  with  an  invitation.  In  the  case  of  very  close  friends  and  family,  you  may  want  to  send  an  invitation  anyway  with  a  note  that  explains  you  are  sending  it  as  a  keepsake.How  can  I  back  out  of  my  duties  as  a  bridesmaid  if  I  can't  afford  it  or  no  longer  want  to  do  it?If  you  think  financials  might  be  a  problem,  talk  with  the  bride  about  what  expenses  you  might  incur  before  accepting.  Bridesmaids  typically  pay  for  their  own  attire  (including  any  alterations),  hair,  makeup,  and  any  travel  expenses.  Though  the  maid  of  honor  may  have  a  bigger  time  commitment,  there  is  not  necessarily  a  greater  monetary  obligation.Other  than  illness,  family  emergency,  or  an  iron-clad  work  demand,  it's  not  acceptable  to  back  out  once  you've  committed.  If  you  have  no  choice  but  to  cancel,  it's  important  to  let  the  bride  know  as  soon  as  possible.Real  Simple:  How  to  Address  Wedding  InvitationsWhat  are  my  duties  as  a  bridesmaid?Bridesmaids  generally  assist  in  the  planning  of  the  wedding,  help  the  bride  choose  her  dress,  attend  fittings  for  their  own  dresses,  and  attend  any  parties  they  are  invited  to.  Though  it  often  makes  sense  for  bridesmaids  to  throw  the  bridal  shower,  they  are  not  required  to  do  so.During  the  wedding  festivities,  bridesmaids  act  as  an  ambassador  of  sorts  to  the  couple  and  may  be  expected  to  help  with  the  little  details  that  keep  the  day  running  smoothly.  They  should  also  participate  in  any  activities  like  a  receiving  line  or  a  bouquet  toss.Can  I  skip  the  cake?There  are  certain  traditions,  like  cutting  the  cake,  that  are  okay  to  omit.  Instead  of  cake,  you  may  opt  for  something  that  provides  more  variety  such  as  a  candy  bar  or  a  selection  of  pies  --  it's  up  to  you.If  you  do  skip  the  cake,  be  aware  that  the  cake  cutting  ceremony  and  serving  of  dessert  is  typically  the  signal  to  guests  that  it  is  OK  to  leave  without  being  rude.Real  Simple:  How  to  Include  Your  Dog  in  Your  Wedding  DayWho  hosts  the  bridal  shower?Anyone  from  the  bridesmaids  to  the  mother  of  the  bride  to  the  mother  of  the  groom  can  host  a  bridal  shower.  In  any  case,  the  hostess  should  consult  with  the  bride  about  the  guest  list,  because  shower  guests  should  also  be  invited  to  the  wedding.Is  it  OK  to  use  mobile  devices  to  upload  pictures  during  the  wedding?When  in  doubt,  it's  better  to  ask  the  couple's  permission  before  posting  photos  to  any  social  media  outlet  --  especially  during  the  ceremony.  Uploading  photos  not  only  distracts  you  from  participating  in  the  moment,  but  it  also  broadcasts  details  of  the  event  to  people  who  may  not  have  been  invited.Real  Simple:  Help!  My  Sister  Copied  My  Ring!How  do  I  decide  who  can  bring  a  date?You  should  extend  a  plus  one  to  anyone  who  is  in  a  committed  relationship,  whether  married,  engaged,  or  in  a  live-in  partnership  --  even  if  you  haven't  met  the  other  half.  You  are  not  obligated  to  give  single  guests  and  guests  who  are  involved  in  more  casual  relationships  the  option  to  bring  a  date.  You  do,  however,  want  to  be  consistent  and  avoid  making  exceptions.If  the  invitation  does  not  say,  for  example,  Anna  and  guest,  guests  can  assume  they  cannot  bring  a  date.  If  someone  does  show  up  with  an  uninvited  guest,  avoid  an  uncomfortable  situation  by  finding  a  place  for  them  and  follow  up  with  the  invited  guest  via  a  polite  phone  call  afterward.How  much  should  I  spend  on  a  wedding  gift?There  is  no  minimum  or  maximum.  When  shopping  for  a  wedding  gift  you  should  consider  two  things:  your  personal  budget  and  your  relationship  with  the  couple.  It's  not  necessary  to  pay  for  the  cost  of  your  dinner,  but  rather  spend  what  you  can  afford  and  feel  comfortable  spending  on  something  that  suits  the  couple.  Don't  be  afraid  to  diverge  from  the  registry  if  you  need  to.Real  Simple:  The  Best  Wedding  Gift  I  Ever  ReceivedIf  someone  asks  me  to  be  in  their  wedding,  do  I  have  to  ask  them  to  be  in  mine?You  shouldn't  feel  obligated  to  reciprocate.  If  you  feel  uncomfortable  about  the  situation,  ask  them  to  be  a  reader  or  to  fulfill  some  other  role  in  the  wedding.  Similarly,  it's  a  nice  gesture  to  include  your  fiancé's  siblings  in  the  wedding  party,  but  you  are  not  required  to  do  so.Do  I  need  to  invite  someone  I  casually  mentioned  the  wedding  to?Talking  about  the  wedding  is  OK,  but  don't  extend  an  invitation  unless  you  know  a  formal  invitation  will  follow.  It's  impolite  to  uninvite  someone,  even  if  it  was  a  verbal  commitment.  If  the  topic  arises,  you  can  diplomatically  skirt  around  the  issue  by  saying  you  haven't  finalized  the  guest  list.I'm  paying  for  the  wedding  myself,  how  can  I  tell  my  parents  I  don't  want  to  invite  certain  people?It  may  be  best  to  give  your  parents  an  allotted  amount  of  spots  they  can  fill  as  they  wish.  If  there  are  certain  people  you  do  not  want  in  attendance,  it's  best  to  have  a  private  and  honest  conversation  when  you  first  discuss  the  guest  list.  Don't  insist  your  parents  feel  comfortable  with  the  situation,  but  be  clear  about  your  wishes.Am  I  expected  to  invite  all  of  my  coworkers?You  do  not  have  to  invite  everyone  you  work  with,  but  try  to  pick  a  logical  dividing  line,  like  your  division  or  team,  so  people  don't  feel  excluded.  Treat  any  invited  coworkers  as  you  would  friends,  and  invite  them  outside  of  work.  Mail  invitations  to  their  home  addresses  and  discuss  wedding  plans  outside  of  the  office.Can  I  tell  my  bridesmaids  what  kind  of  shower  I  want?It's  a  good  idea  to  discuss  the  shower  with  bridesmaids  --  or  whoever  is  hosting  --  but  avoid  demands,  especially  those  that  dictate  the  budget.  For  example,  if  you  really  don't  want  games,  you  may  express  that  sentiment  but  shy  away  from  requests  that  add  extra  expenses.How  do  I  deal  with  guests  who  ask  to  bring  kids  even  after  we've  made  it  clear  they're  not  invited?You  have  to  nip  this  in  the  bud.  Call  the  guest  (even  if  they've  contacted  you  through  another  medium,  like  email)  and  kindly,  but  firmly  explain  that  the  invitation  was  just  for  the  adults  and  that  you  hope  they  can  still  attend.  Don't  make  exceptions  --  it's  not  fair  to  other  guests  who  respect  your  wishes.  You  can,  however,  invite  the  flower  girl  and  the  ring  bearer  without  being  hypocritical.Can  I  register  for  gifts  if  it's  my  second  marriage?Whether  it's  your  first  marriage  or  your  third,  you  can  still  register.  There  are  plenty  of  people  who  may  want  to  give  you  a  gift,  including  those  who  have  attended  a  prior  wedding.If  you  feel  uncomfortable  about  receiving  gifts,  it's  a  good  time  to  get  creative  and  sign  up  for  a  honeymoon  registry.  It's  also  perfectly  fine  to  request  guests  do  not  bring  gifts.What  is  the  correct  way  to  address  a  wedding  gift  check?There  is  no  hard  and  fast  rule  about  which  party  should  be  addressed.  Unless  you  know  the  couple  has  a  joint  bank  account,  pay  to  the  order  of  either  the  bride  or  the  groom  --  not  both  --  to  make  the  check  easier  to  cash.Who  should  host  the  rehearsal  dinner?Traditionally,  the  groom's  family  hosts  (and  pays  for)  the  rehearsal  dinner  and  arranges  a  guest  list  in  conjunction  with  the  bride's  family.  Though  some  families  now  choose  to  split  the  cost  or  let  the  bride  and  groom  host  their  own  rehearsal  dinner,  the  groom's  family  should  get  "first  dibs."Am  I  obligated  to  invite  a  guest's  date  to  the  rehearsal  dinner?Because  the  rehearsal  dinner  is  traditionally  a  close-knit  event  for  wedding  participants  and  family,  it  is  not  necessary  to  extend  an  invitation  to  an  attendee's  wedding  guest.How  much  should  I  tip  my  wedding  vendors?You  do  not  have  to  tip  vendors  with  whom  you  have  a  contract.  Depending  on  service  and  relationship,  a  small  gift  or  a  cash  tip  is  at  your  discretion.  You  should,  however,  distribute  tips  to  non-contracted  staff  like  musicians  and  servers.Meals  for  vendors  are  typically  included  in  your  contract,  but  you  should  plan  to  pay  for  their  dinner  regardless.  Discuss  meal  options  with  your  venue  or  caterer  to  find  something  that  works  with  your  budget.How  long  do  I  have  to  send  a  thank-you  note?Though  it's  best  to  send  a  thank-you  note  as  soon  as  possible,  you  have  approximately  three  months  to  express  your  gratitude.  If  the  three-month  timeframe  has  elapsed,  send  any  lingering  thank-you  notes  as  soon  as  possible.  Sending  an  email  or  putting  a  generic  thanks  on  social  media,  your  wedding  website,  or  anywhere  else  does  not  replace  a  handwritten  note.To  save  time,  the  bride  and  groom  can  both  write  thank-you  notes  and  simply  sign  each  one.  In  a  serious  time  crunch,  it's  acceptable  to  send  an  email  that  acts  as  a  digital  placeholder  to  say  you  received  the  gift  and  a  thank-you  a  note  will  follow.Have  you  run  into  a  sticky  wedding  etiquette  situation?

For  those  fortunate  enough  to  watch  the  episode,  there  was  plenty  of  debate  as  to  whether  it  was  a  satisfying  ending  to  a  thrilling  eight  episodes.EW  writer  Darren  Franich  noted  that  "It  was  a  lot  to  take  in  --  an  hour  that  veered  more  towards  philosophy  than  final-act  thrills  (although  it  had  plenty  of  that,  as  well)."  That  publication's  TV  critic,  Jeff  Jensen,  wrote,  "Culminating  a  remarkable  first  season  in  fine,  moving  form,  'True  Detective's'  finale,  titled  'Form  and  Void,'  took  us  to  the  heart  of  darkness  at  the  vortex  center  of  its  weird  fiction  --  as  well  as  the  final  stage  of  its  meta-commentary  on  the  stories  we  tell  ourselves,  about  ourselves,  for  better  and  worse."Time's  James  Poniewozik  found  some  flaws  in  the  ending  even  as  he  said,  "True  Detective  was  an  artfully  written,  remarkably  acted,  stunningly  visualized  portrait  of  Marty  and  Rust  trying  to  find  the  path  in  an  overgrown  world  of  decay.""  'True  Detective'  was  the  closest  thing  American  TV  has  done  in  a  while  to  the  British  model  of  drama,  a  story  told  in  one  season,  from  the  keyboard  of  a  single  writer  (and  the  lens  of  one  director),"  Poniewozik  wrote.  "There  was  nobody  to  dilute  the  creator's  perspective,  or  to  call  b.s.  on  it.  A  more  collaborative  show,  in  the  typical  American  model,  might  have  fixed  many  of  its  problems."The  Atlantic  took  the  approach  of  having  a  "round  table"  of  writers  discuss  the  season  finale.  Spencer  Kornhaber,  Christopher  Orr  and  Amy  Sullivan  each  weighed  in  with  their  thoughts  on  the  show's  wrapup.  Sullivan  said  she  "vowed  to  watch  the  finale  as  a  fan,  not  as  someone  trying  to  figure  it  all  out.""But  even  as  a  fan,  I  still  found  these  dangling  threads  and  implausibilities  frustrating  because  the  show  practically  begged  us  to  get  into  the  weeds,  to  wade  into  swampy  waters,"  Sullivan  wrote.  "That's  okay  if  it  winds  up  giving  viewers  some  extra  insight.  But  it's  another  thing  entirely  if  the  show  is  just  messing  with  us."The  show  attracted  plenty  of  famous  fans  also.Mario  Lopez  tweeted,  "I  can  now  say  that  True  Detective  had  the  best  first  season  of  any  show  I've  ever  seen..."  And  according  to  his  Twitter  account,  actor  Colin  Hanks  was  scrambling  to  find  somewhere  to  watch  the  show  in  Canada  and  finally  lucked  out.  "Major  thanks  to  @sarajeanhughes  and  @josiahhughes  for  opening  up  their  home  to  me  so  I  could  watch  the  True  Detective  finale,"  he  tweeted.What  did  you  think  of  the  finale?</TEXT></DOC>

But  there  is  much  more  to  her  story  than  how  she  captivates  the  cameras  on  the  red  carpet.CNN's  Stephanie  Elam  caught  up  with  Nyong'o  to  speak  about  her  journey  from  Kenya  to  Hollywood.  An  edited  version  of  the  interview  follows.CNN:  How  did  you  end  up  being  born  in  Mexico?Lupita  Nyong'o:  My  father  is  a  politician.  At  the  time  he  was  also  a  professor  of  political  science  and  he  was  organizing  for  democracy  in  Kenya.  We  were  under  an  autocratic  regime  and  after  a  series  of  unfortunate  events,  including  the  disappearance  of  his  brother,  he  went  into  political  exile  in  Mexico.  I  was  born  in  his  last  year  there.Read  more:  10  things  to  know  about  Lupita  Nyong'oCNN:  So  you  were  born  in  Mexico  but  grew  up  in  Kenya.LN:  Yes,  all  my  conscious  memories  are  in  Kenya  until  when  I  was  16  my  parents  sent  me  back  to  Mexico  to  learn  Spanish.  I  grew  up  in  Nairobi,  which  is  the  capital  of  Kenya,  so  it's  hustle  and  bustle  and  there's  always  something  going  on.  I  come  from  a  very  big  family  and  we're  very  close  knit  so  I  had  lots  of  time  with  me  family.My  parents  raised  all  of  us  to  just  pursue  our  hearts'  desires.  They  were  like  "figure  out  what  your  purpose  is  on  this  world  and  then  do  it  and  do  it  to  excellence;  no  matter  what  it  is,  whether  it's  being  a  janitor  or  a  doctor,  as  long  as  you're  filling  your  life's  purpose  then  we're  good."  No  pressure  to  pursue  one  thing  or  another,  although  I  will  say  my  father  was  very  upset  when  I  dropped  physics  though.Review:  '12  Years  A  Slave'  agonizingly  magnificentCNN:  Not  too  long  after  you  arrived  to  Mexico  you  decided  to  go  to  school  in  the  United  States.  One  of  the  things  I  read  about  was  your  discovery  of  race  in  America  and  how  it's  treated.LN:  I  grew  up  in  a  world  where  the  majority  of  people  were  black  so  that  wasn't  the  defining  quality  of  anyone.  When  you're  describing  someone,  you  don't  start  out  with  "he's  black,  he's  white."  No,  I  was  a  girl,  I  was  my  ethnic  group  Luo,  I  was  middle  class,  I  was  many  things  before  I  was  black,  so  it  was  like  a  rearrangement  when  I  came  here  and  realized  that  in  America  that's  the  first  thing  that  people  notice  about  me.  You  don't  hear  that  word,  "black,  black"  very  often  in  Kenya  to  tell  you  the  truth,  so  that  was  definitely  jarring.CNN:  "12  years  A  Slave"  is  your  first  feature  film.  Where  do  you  go  inside  yourself  to  play  a  role  like  that  of  Patsey  with  such  generosity  of  spirit?LN:  I  don't  believe  that  we  are  really  as  individual  as  we  think  we  are  and  that's  what  makes  the  profession  of  acting  possible  --  that  we  can  empathize  with  things  that  are  more  than  our  personal,  limited  experience.  And  I  think  that  you  do  work  and  like  Oprah  [Winfrey]  said  to  me,  "you  let  God  walk  in  the  door."  I  think  it's  less  about  going  into  myself  than  opening  myself;  just  opening  myself  to  the  research,  the  script,  the  autobiography,  the  other  things  that  I  read,  the  other  things  I  saw  and  just  trying  to  immerse  myself  in  a  world  that  I  personally  don't  know  --  but  I  know  that  my  spirit  does  --  and  can  know  if  I  allow  myself  to  open  up  to  it.There  is  something  about  acting  that's  mysterious  and  magical  because  there  is  only  so  much  I  can  do  to  prepare  and  then  I  have  to  just  let  go  and  breathe  and  believe  that  it  will  come  through.Because  I  think  if  I  had  been  required  to  play  Patsey  in  any  sort  of  methodical  way  where  I  go  in  and  I  never  go  out  until  we  wrap  the  picture,  I  don't  think  I  would  have  survived  emotionally  because  it's  heavy.  But  having  those  moments  of  lightness  and  separation  from  the  work  we  were  doing  on  set  was  very  important,  even  to  fortifying  our  trust  for  each  other  while  we  were  doing  the  work..Read  more:  Have  you  seen  the  year's  best  film?CNN:  How  do  you  feel  about  all  the  hype  surrounding  you  since  you  since  "12  Years  A  Slave"?LN:  I  didn't  know  how,  and  we  all  didn't  know  how  the  world  would  take  this  film.  It's  not  easy  subject  matter.  It's  heavy  but  it's  beautiful  and  you  hope  that  people  would  at  least  open  their  eyes  to  see  it  --  and  then  they  did.  So  my  first  feeling  was  relief  that  it  had  been  so  well  received  and  then  they  just  kept  receiving  it  and  celebrating  it  and  the  conversation  has  been  developing  and  shifting;  it's  been  so  exciting  and  for  me  to  be  part  of  that  celebration  and  my  work  to  be  lauded  in  all  these  ways  has  been  amazing.And  I've  felt  relief  as  well  that  people  are  registering  Patsey's  loftiness  --  in  praising  me  I  feel  like  her  spirit  is  being  uplifted,  really,  because  what  I  met  in  those  pages  of  Solomon  Northrup's  book  was  heartbreaking  --  and  it  still  breaks  my  heart  --  and  inspiring,  and  I  had  the  privilege  of  bringing  her  back  to  life.  I'm  just  happy  and  filled  with  gratitude  to  have  had  the  experience  in  the  first  place  and  for  it  to  be  so  well  received.READ  THIS:  The  CNN  10  -  The  hottest  rising  stars</TEXT></DOC>

He  is  the  author  of  "The  Crusader:  The  Life  and  Times  of  Pat  Buchanan."(CNN)  --  The  U.S.  abortion  rate  is  at  its  lowest  point  since  1973.  In  2011,  there  were  fewer  than  17  terminations  for  every  1,000  women;  a  fall  of  13%  since  2008  and  only  a  little  higher  than  when  the  Supreme  Court  handed  down  Roe  v.  Wade.  You  might  not  guess  that's  the  way  things  are  trending  from  what  politicians  have  to  say  about  the  issue,  given  that  they  tend  to  prefer  to  discuss  morals  or  rights  rather  than  practicalities  and  realities.  These  numbers  confirm  that  politics  and  mass  culture  are  drifting  further  and  further  apart.What's  caused  the  fall  in  abortions?  Some  might  be  tempted  to  assume  it's  the  various  Republican-led  state  measures  to  restrict  access  to  abortion;  these  include  compelling  abortion  clinics  to  maintain  the  same  standards  as  ambulatory  surgical  centers,  which  is  for  many  clinics  almost  impossible  to  achieve.  But  most  of  those  state  efforts  only  started  recently,  so  they  can't  explain  a  long-term  trend  against  abortion  since  a  peak  of  29  terminations  per  1,000  women  in  1980.According  to  researchers  from  the  Guttmacher  Institute,  which  released  the  new  study,  the  latest  decline  is  largely  the  result  of  improved  birth  control.  In  tough  economic  times,  they  argue,  people  tend  to  pay  greater  attention  to  contraception  because  they  are  more  aware  of  the  potential  material  costs  of  becoming  pregnant.  Also,  the  arrival  of  new  kinds  of  contraceptives  on  the  market,  such  as  long-term  intrauterine  devices,  means  people  aren't  relying  on  pills  and  condoms  that  can  fail.Abortion  rates  lowest  in  40  yearsBut,  surely,  equally  important  is  a  quiet  revolution  in  popular  attitudes  toward  abortion.  According  to  Gallup,  in  1996  some  56%  of  Americans  self-identified  as  pro-choice  and  33%  as  pro-life.  By  2013,  only  45%  called  themselves  pro-choice  while  48%  said  pro-life.  Part  of  the  reason  may  be  greater  awareness  of  what  a  termination  involves.  Improvements  in  technology  have  made  it  easier  to  visualize  and  comprehend  the  fetus  early  on  in  development.  The  debate  over  late-term  abortion  has  encouraged  some  to  think  of  that  fetus'  potential.Ironically,  Hollywood,  which  is  expressly  liberal,  may  have  helped.  Anti-abortion  activists  have  talked  about  a  "Juno  effect,"  crediting  the  movie  Juno,  which  is  about  a  pregnant  teenager  who  chooses  to  keep  the  child,  with  persuading  many  girls  to  see  adoption  or  motherhood  as  better  options  than  termination.  Likewise,  the  Twilight  series  (bear  with  me  here)  promotes  chastity,  a  borderline  terror  of  male  sexuality  (if  a  vampire  bites  you,  he  just  can't  stop)  and  its  lead  character  chooses  to  keep  her  baby  even  though  the  pregnancy  nearly  kills  her.Meanwhile,  movies  like  "The  Ides  of  March"  present  abortion  as  something  that  occurs  entirely  for  the  convenience  of  men  (a  political  handler  learns  that  an  intern  with  whom  he's  just  had  a  one-night  stand  already  is  pregnant  from  a  one-night  stand  with  his  candidate  boss,  drops  her  off  to  have  an  abortion  and  she  later  kills  herself).It's  uneven,  to  be  sure,  but  youth  culture  is  witnessing  at  least  some  blending  of  conservative  and  feminist  values  that  encourage  --  not  necessarily  pressure  --  girls  to  choose  either  to  hold  out  or  embrace  motherhood.There  is  no  one  explanation  but  rather  a  synthesis  of  medical,  cultural  and  economic  forces  at  work  here.  All  of  which  paints  a  far  more  complex  picture  than  the  one  we  find  in  politics.  Which  is  disappointing.Many  liberals  speak  of  the  need  for  abortion  to  be  "safe,  legal  and  rare,"  and  even  Hillary  Clinton  has  called  it  "sad"  and  "tragic."  But  liberal  legislators  have  consistently  voted  against  even  the  most  reasonable  attempts  to  make  it  rarer;  witness  the  partisan  voting  in  the  House  on  the  recently  proposed  20-week  abortion  ban.  Many  conservatives,  at  a  national  level,  still  talk  in  terms  of  a  hypothetical  federal  ban  that  would  put  them  up  against  the  Supreme  Court  and  potentially  outlaw  abortion  in  the  cases  when  many  voters  would  regard  it  as  a  tragic  necessity.  You  may  recall,  with  understandable  disgust,  Republican  conversations  about  degrees  of  rape  during  the  last  election.  It's  one  of  the  reasons  so  many  lost.Most  Americans  do  not  see  abortion  in  these  stark,  simplistic  terms.  If  they  have  slowly  trended  toward  identifying  themselves  as  pro-life,  it  is  probably  because  the  label  reflects  the  flowering  of  a  strong  ideal  ("I'd  like  there  to  be  no  abortions")  tempered  by  a  quiet  acceptance  of  reality  ("But  I  know  they  will  continue").  Who,  then,  should  these  citizens  vote  for?As  a  pro-lifer,  I'd  love  to  see  a  presidential  candidate  who  better  reflects  the  subtleties  of  what  is  one  of  the  most  painful,  nuanced  matters  of  our  age  --  be  it  a  Republican  who  talks  more  about  making  having  a  child  a  positive,  affordable  decision  thanks  to  better  health  care  or  educational  opportunities,  or  a  Democrat  who  says  "safe,  legal  and  rare"  and  actually  means  it.  In  the  absence  of  that,  we  have  to  trust  the  people.  And  it's  heartening  to  see  so  many  more  than  ever  before  choosing  life.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Timothy  Stanley.</TEXT></DOC>

"It's  a  respectful  sighting,  the  type  that  I  really  enjoy."READ:  9  not-in-the-guidebook  Africa  safari  tipsThe  next  day  at  6  a.m.  the  rangers  and  I  leave  Wilderness  Safaris'  Desert  Rhino  Camp.After  an  hour's  drive  we  see  fresh  rhino  tracks  on  a  riverbed  and  follow  on  foot.Tracking  soon  becomes  difficult,  as  there  are  no  footsteps  anymore,  just  rocks  that  have  been  moved.Finding  them  is  an  exercise  in  mindfulness.Tracking  epitomizes  abilities  that  humans  have  almost  completely  lost:  to  read  the  landscape  and  be  aware  of  its  smallest  details.As  they  walk,  the  rangers  wave  their  hands  as  if  in  an  ancient  dance:  open  hands,  palm  forward,  indicating  each  track  or  to  inform  others  of  a  new  direction.Nobody  talks,  just  a  gentle  whistle  to  attract  attention.Then  we  find  fresh  dung.One  of  the  rangers,  Martin  Nawaseb,  squats  to  check  its  temperature.  It's  still  hot.Feeling  close,  we  increase  our  pace  and  come  to  view  a  riverbed.The  rhino  is  there,  grazing.He  raises  his  head  toward  us;  he  knows  something's  up.Keeping  ourselves  at  a  distance,  we  sit  in  silence  and  enjoy  the  tranquil  landscape.Martin  writes  down  the  GPS  position  in  his  logbook.Tracking  is  an  effective  way  to  understand  animal  behavior.The  importance  of  prideRangers  in  Damaraland  are  proud  of  their  job  and  the  community  looks  up  at  people  like  Martin."Poaching  is  essentially  not  an  issue  anymore  in  Namibia  because  conservation  efforts  put  local  communities  at  the  center,"  says  Jeff  Muntifering,  a  scientific  advisor  at  SRT."It's  become  socially  unacceptable;  poachers  are  viewed  as  stealing  from  the  community."He  says  in  Mozambique  it's  the  opposite:  poachers  crossing  the  border  to  kill  animals  in  South  Africa  are  considered  Robin  Hoods,  risking  their  lives  to  bring  back  to  the  community  the  little  money  paid  by  international  syndicates  trading  in  illegal  ivory.How  to  keep  it  goingWhile  examples  like  STR  in  Namibia  and  tourism  ventures  such  as  the  Rhino  Desert  Camp  are  the  success  stories  of  conservation,  their  effectiveness  is  being  threatened  again  by  a  recent  surge  in  poaching.Fueled  by  a  growing  demand  for  rhino  horn  in  Asia,  1,004  rhino  were  killed  in  2013,  up  from  668  killed  in  2012  and  just  13  killed  in  2007.In  response  to  these  alarming  figures,  46  countries  agreed  in  London  earlier  this  year  on  a  declaration  to  tackle  wildlife  crimes.The  hope  is  that  this  is  the  turning  point  for  the  fight  against  poaching.</TEXT></DOC>

Confronting  a  life  obstacle  --  injury,  illness  or  other  hardship  --  they  tapped  their  inner  strength  and  found  resilience  they  didn't  know  they  possessed.  This  week  we  meet  Julia  Clukey,  who  made  the  2010  U.S.  Olympic  team  in  luge  and  is  the  first  alternate  for  the  2014  team  in  Sochi.  Off  the  ice,  she's  faced  many  challenges,  including  surviving  brain  surgery.(CNN)  --  When  I  was  first  diagnosed  with  Arnold-Chiari  malformation  syndrome  --  a  brain  disorder  involving  structural  defects  --  I  was  shocked.After  learning  more  about  it,  and  then  after  successful  surgery  in  2011,  I  realized  that  I  could  emerge  a  stronger  person,  both  mentally  and  physically.Today  I  am  able  to  continue  to  compete  at  the  highest  level  in  the  sport  of  luge  and  continue  to  live  life  to  the  fullest.  I  remain  committed  to  my  sport  as  well  as  to  sharing  my  story  about  overcoming  challenges.During  my  surgery,  and  in  times  of  adversity,  the  most  important  thing  for  me  has  been  the  support  of  my  awesome  family  and  friends.I  had  a  new  outlook  on  the  sport  when  I  returned  to  competition  in  2012.  While  I  knew  my  ACS  was  never  going  to  be  gone  completely,  I  was  healthier  than  I  had  ever  been  and  ready  to  see  what  I  could  do  as  an  athlete,  free  of  my  symptoms.I  never  wanted  to  use  my  ACS  as  an  excuse  not  to  do  something,  and  I  am  thankful  to  my  medical  team  for  encouraging  and  supporting  me  to  continue  my  athletic  endeavors.In  my  first  season  back,  I  had  my  best  results  ever.  I  won  my  first  national  title,  scored  eight  top-10  finishes  in  the  World  Cup  --  including  my  first-ever  silver  medal  in  front  of  a  home  crowd  in  Lake  Placid,  New  York.  I  also  achieved  a  personal  best,  placing  sixth  in  the  overall  World  Cup  rankings.I  refuse  to  let  my  ACS  define  or  limit  me  as  a  person.  From  the  very  first  day  I  was  diagnosed,  I  decided  that  I  was  going  to  recover  from  this  and  I  set  to  work  making  a  plan  on  how  I  was  going  to  do  it.In  addition  to  recovering  physically,  I  am  extremely  proud  of  the  work  I  have  done  in  my  home  state  of  Maine  by  reaching  out  to  youth  on  an  emotional  level,  educating  them  about  my  personal  challenges  and  encouraging  them  to  go  after  their  dreams.Since  2010,  I've  been  the  spokeswoman  for  the  Maine  Beer  &  Wine  Distributors  Association.During  the  past  four  years,  I've  been  reaching  out  to  Maine  high  school  students.  My  presentations  are  20  minutes  long,  and  include  a  video  and  my  personal  story  of  overcoming  challenges,  including  my  neck  surgery  and  the  passing  of  my  father  and  sister,  as  well  as  the  athletic  challenges  I  have  faced  in  my  life.  I  also  share  with  them  the  importance  of  individual  responsibility  and  good  decision-making.As  part  of  my  work  with  the  MBWDA,  I  have  been  to  34  high  schools  in  Maine  and  reached  more  than  9,000  students.  My  goal  is  to  reach  as  many  as  10,000  students  in  the  next  few  months,  and  perhaps  develop  the  MBWDA  responsibility  initiative  into  a  national  model.Some  of  the  most  rewarding  experiences  of  my  life  have  come  from  my  work  to  inspire  young  people.  This  is  one  of  the  biggest  reasons  that  I  am  proud  to  host  Julia  Clukey's  Camp  for  Girls  each  summer.The  camp  is  designed  for  young  girls  ages  8  to  11  as  a  place  to  develop  self-confidence  and  a  healthy  lifestyle.  I  have  been  blessed  with  the  opportunity  to  share  my  experiences  with  young  girls  and  give  them  the  strength  and  confidence  to  go  after  their  dreams.</TEXT></DOC>

China  responded  to  those  meetings  with  similarly  angry  comments.Beijing  accuses  the  Dalai  Lama  of  being  a  separatist  who  foments  unrest  in  Tibet,  a  region  it  claims  has  been  part  of  China  since  "ancient  times."The  Dalai  Lama,  who  fled  to  India  in  1959  after  a  failed  uprising,  has  long  denied  China's  assertion  that  he's  seeking  Tibetan  independence.  He  says  he  wants  only  enough  autonomy  to  protect  its  traditional  Buddhist  culture.The  Obama  administration  says  it  supports  the  Dalai  Lama's  "Middle  Way"  approach  to  the  political  tensions  over  protests  for  Tibetan  independence.The  White  House  said  Obama  stressed  that  he  encourages  "direct  dialogue  to  resolve  long-standing  differences  and  that  a  dialogue  that  produces  results  would  be  positive  for  China  and  Tibetans."Obama  reiterated  the  U.S.  position  that  Tibet  "is  part  of"  China  and  that  the  United  States  does  not  support  Tibet  independence.The  Dalai  Lama  stated  that  he  is  not  seeking  independence  for  Tibet  and  hopes  that  dialogue  between  his  representatives  and  the  Chinese  government  will  resume.Concerns  over  human  rightsOver  the  past  five  years,  at  least  125  Tibetans  have  set  themselves  on  fire,  most  of  them  fatally,  to  protest  Chinese  rule,  according  to  Tibetan  advocacy  groups.Beijing  has  taken  a  tough  line  on  Tibetan  self-immolators,  their  associates  and  other  forms  of  protest.  Tibetans  have  been  convicted  of  murder  in  Chinese  courts  for  "inciting"  people  to  set  themselves  on  fire.The  frequency  of  self-immolations  declined  during  2013,  according  to  the  London-based  advocacy  group  Free  Tibet.China  rejects  accusations  of  oppression,  saying  that  under  its  rule,  living  standards  have  greatly  improved  for  the  Tibetan  people.Beijing  "lodged  solemn  representations"  with  the  United  States  before  Friday's  meeting,  saying  "Tibet-related  affairs  fall  entirely  within  the  internal  affairs  of  China  which  allow  no  foreign  interference,"  Hua  of  the  Chinese  foreign  ministry  said.A  meeting  between  British  Prime  Minister  David  Cameron  and  the  Dalai  Lama  last  year  cast  a  chill  over  relations  between  London  and  Beijing,  delaying  a  visit  to  China  by  Cameron.CNN's  Steven  Jiang  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

"Using  the  building-block  world  of  LEGO  to  parody  the  creeping  conformity  of  our  world,  'The  LEGO  Movie'  proves  even  more  biting  than  'WALL-E,'  because  it  has  the  sauciness  to  send  up  its  own  rise-of-a-hero  story  line,"  writes  EW's  Owen  Gleiberman.EW  review:  'The  LEGO  Movie'"Parks  and  Rec's"  Chris  Pratt  voices  Emmet,  a  typical  LEGO  drone  who  accidentally  stumbles  upon  a  LEGO  piece  that  makes  a  band  of  Matrix-like  revolutionaries  think  he's  the  Special,  the  one  who  can  save  their  world  from  the  fascist  President  Business  (Will  Ferrell).Emmet  has  some  high-profile  allies,  including  Batman  (Will  Arnett),  Superman  (Channing  Tatum),  Abraham  Lincoln  (Will  Forte),  Wonder  Woman  (Cobie  Smulders),  and  Shaquille  O'Neal,  as  well  as  the  beautiful  rebel  Wyldstyle  (Elizabeth  Banks)  and  the  sage  mystic  Vitruvius  (Morgan  Freeman).Written  and  directed  by  Phil  Lord  and  Christopher  Miller,  the  duo  behind  the  first  "Cloudy  With  a  Chance  of  Meatballs"  and  "21  Jump  Street,"  "The  LEGO  Movie"  is  a  clever  combination  of  stop-motion  animation  and  ingenuous  CG  effects  —  fire,  water  —  all  made  to  resemble  stop-motion.

Here,  at  last,  is  an  animated  comedy  that  never  stops  surprising  you."A.O.  Scott  (New  York  Times)"The  overt  message  is  that  you  should  throw  out  the  manuals  and  follow  the  lead  of  your  own  ingenuity,  improvising  new  combinations  for  the  building  blocks  in  front  of  you.

Unlike  'Battleship,'  'G.I.

The  restaurant  at  Cardiff  is  attached  to  the  prison,  rather  than  within  its  walls.Chefs  and  servers  involved  in  these  projects  are  all  prisoners  with  between  six  and  18  months  of  their  sentences  remaining.Trainees  work  full-time  --  a  40-hour  week  --  studying  toward  nationally  recognized  City  &  Guilds  National  Vocational  Qualifications  (NVQ)  in  food  preparation,  front-of-house  service  and  industrial  cleaning,  before  returning  to  their  cells  in  the  evening.The  Brixton  addition  is  the  third  of  what  will  eventually  be  10  prison  restaurants  across  the  UK  within  the  next  three  years."The  Clink  Charity,  in  partnership  with  HMPS,  plans  to  have  10  training  sites  in  operation  across  the  prison  estate  by  2017,"  says  Moore.So  far  they're  working.According  to  the  December  2012  edition  of  Bromley  Briefings  Prison  Factfile,  in  2011  12.5%  of  graduates  of  The  Clink  program  re-offended.  The  national  average  was  47%.But  it's  not  cheap.Crisci  raised  more  than  £300,000  ($500,000)  in  private  funding  to  start  the  project.And  it's  not  yet  profitable."Each  Clink  restaurant  operates  at  a  loss  of  circa  £150,000  ($250,000)  per  year  due  to  them  being  training  restaurants  and  the  mentoring  work  which  is  provided  to  the  graduates  for  six  to  12  months  after  their  release,"  says  Moore."We  receive  financial  support  from  philanthropic  individuals,  HMPS  and  the  government."This,  and  the  money  from  people  dining  in  the  restaurant  and  the  purchasing  of  Clink  products,  helps  to  reduce  the  deficit."MORE:  Juna  Rorimpandey  --  world's  baddest  chef?The  foodLocally  grown  and  sourced  ingredients  are  used  whenever  possible.The  meats  at  Brixton  Prison  come  from  a  local  butcher,  for  example,  while  High  Downs  Prison  supplies  many  of  the  vegetables  used  in  the  project  from  its  own  farm.Prisoners  at  High  Down  also  get  to  apply  to  work  toward  an  NVQ  in  Horticulture  and  Gardening.Dishes  are  contemporary  and  European  in  provenance,  and  the  menu  changes  every  quarter  or  for  special  events.Sample  dishes  for  Brixton  Prison  include  hot  crab  and  smoked  mackerel  pancake  rolls,  herb  crusted  pork  chops  and  woodland  wild  mushroom  and  artichoke  lasagne.MORE:  10  best  French  restaurants  in  ParisFurther  rehabilitation  projectsGuardian  columnist  and  convicted  murderer  Erwin  James  supports  the  charity.James  was  released  in  2004  after  serving  20  years  of  a  life  sentence."For  me,  there  can  never  be  enough  rehabilitative  initiatives  in  our  prisons.  Rehabilitation  means  fewer  potential  victims  of  released  prisoners,"  he  tells  CNN  via  email."It's  just  a  shame  the  government  relies  on  charities  such  as  The  Clink  to  provide  those  initiatives."The  Clink  restaurants  vastly  increase  the  likelihood  that  those  who  take  part  will  discover,  or  rediscover,  the  satisfaction  of  having  a  skill  to  provide  a  service  that  makes  them  feel  good  about  themselves."There  are  other  charity  restaurant  schemes  in  the  UK.In  2002,  Jamie  Oliver  opened  his  first  Fifteen  restaurant  in  London  to  train  unemployed  young  people  as  apprentice  chefs.Fifteen  restaurants  have  subsequently  opened  in  Amsterdam  and  Cornwall.The  Brigade  seeks  to  help  those  who  have  experienced  or  are  at  risk  of  homelessness  in  London.But  for  some,  the  cost  of  running  these  schemes  is  too  high.The  Hoxton  Apprentice,  opened  in  London  in  2004,  closed  in  2012  as  the  charity  behind  the  project  went  into  administration.The  Clink  Charity  has  no  plans  to  expand  beyond  the  UK.The  Clink  Restaurants  (Brixton,  Cardiff  and  High  Downs)  are  available  for  booking  at  The  Clink  Charity.MORE:  World's  50  best  foods</TEXT></DOC>

Most  are  generally  recognized  as  safe,  as  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration  likes  to  say,  but  a  few  have  given  scientists  cause  for  concern.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Anyone  who's  ever  read  a  nutrition  label  knows  that  our  food  supply  is  full  of  hard-to-pronounce  chemicals.  Most  are  generally  recognized  as  safe,  as  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration  likes  to  say,  but  a  few  have  given  scientists  cause  for  concern.Azodicarbonamide,  for  instance.  Subway  announced  last  week  that  it  would  be  removing  the  controversial  chemical  from  its  bread.  Generally  used  for  strengthening  dough,  azodicarbonamide  is  also  found  in  yoga  mats  and  shoe  soles,  according  to  the  Centers  for  Science  in  the  Public  Interest.  One  of  the  breakdown  products  is  a  recognized  carcinogen.Though  Subway  is  going  to  remove  azodicarbonamide,  there's  a  long  list  of  other  chemicals  used  in  its  bread:  calcium  carbonate,  calcium  sulfate,  ammonium  sulfate,  DATEM,  sodium  stearoyl  lactylate,  potassium  iodate  and  ascorbic  acid,  according  to  the  restaurant's  website  (PDF).And  Subway  certainly  isn't  alone.  What  other  chemical  additives  are  commonly  found  in  your  food?  Here  are  seven,  picked  at  random  as  good  practice  for  the  upcoming  CNN  Spelling  Bee  (just  kidding).1.  Tartrazine  and  other  food  dyesWhen  Kraft  announced  last  year  that  it  would  be  removing  Yellow  No.  5  (tartrazine)  and  No.  6  from  certain  varieties  of  its  Macaroni  &  Cheese  products,  advocates  rejoiced.  Blue  1,  Green  3,  Red  40  and  others  have  been  loosely  linked  to  everything  from  hyperactivity  in  children  to  cancer  in  lab  animals.  Generally  found  in  candy,  beverages  and  baked  goods,  color  additives  are  also  used  in  cosmetics.But  you  knew  that,  right?  Did  you  also  know  about  the  ground-up  insects  in  your  drinks?  Cochineal  extract  is  an  approved  artificial  dye  derived  from  a  small  bug  that  lives  on  cactus  plants  in  Mexico  and  South  America.  As  long  as  you're  not  allergic,  you're  safe  to  drink  up,  according  to  the  Centers  for  Science  in  the  Public  Interest.  Mmmm  ...2.  Butylated  hydroxyanisole  (BHA)Well,  that's  a  mouthful.  BHA  is  used  to  preserve  some  cereals,  chewing  gum  and  potato  chips,  according  to  the  centers.  It's  also  used  in  rubber  and  petroleum  products.Butylated  hydroxyanisole  is  "reasonably  anticipated  to  be  a  human  carcinogen,"  according  to  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  (PDF),  because  of  animal  studies  that  have  shown  that  the  chemical  can  cause  tumors  in  rats'  and  hamsters'  forestomachs  (something  humans  don't  have)  and  fish  livers.3.  Propyl  gallatePropyl  gallate  is  often  used  in  conjunction  with  BHA  and  a  chemical  called  butylated  hydroxytoluene,  or  BHT.  These  antioxidant  preservatives  protect  oily  products  from  oxidation,  which  would  otherwise  cause  them  to  go  bad.  Propyl  gallate  can  be  found  in  mayonnaise,  dried  meats,  chicken  soup  and  gum,  as  well  as  hair-grooming  products  and  adhesives.Some  scientists  believe  that  propyl  gallate  is  an  "endocrine  disruptor  (PDF),"  meaning  it  can  interfere  with  humans'  hormones.  Endocrine  disruptors  can  lead  to  developmental,  reproductive  and/or  neurological  problems,  according  to  the  National  Institutes  of  Health,  including  fertility  issues  and  an  increased  risk  of  some  cancers.  But  the  link  between  propyl  gallate  and  the  endocrine  system  needs  to  be  studied  further.4.  Sodium  nitriteSodium  nitrite  is  most  often  used  in  the  preservation  and  coloring  of  meats,  such  as  bacon,  ham,  hot  dogs,  lunch  meat  and  smoked  fish.  Without  it,  these  products  would  look  gray  instead  of  red.Sodium  nitrite  is  also  found  naturally  in  many  vegetables,  including  beets,  celery,  radishes  and  lettuce.  But  the  nitrite  found  in  vegetables  comes  with  ascorbic  acid,  which  prevents  our  bodies  from  turning  nitrite  into  nitrosamines.Nitrosamines  are  considered  potentially  carcinogenic  to  humans.  So  some  companies  are  adding  ascorbic  acid  to  their  meat  products  to  inhibit  nitrosamine  formation,  according  to  the  Centers  for  Science  in  the  Public  Interest.However,  the  American  Meat  Institute  points  out  the  National  Toxicology  Program  conducted  a  multi-year  review  in  which  rats  and  mice  were  fed  high  levels  of  nitrate  and  nitrite  in  drinking  water,  and  a  panel  reviewed  the  findings  and  concluded  that  nitrite  is  safe  at  the  levels  used  and  not  a  carcinogen.5.  TBHQ  (tert-Butylhydroquinone)This  chemical  preservative  is  a  form  of  butane  that  is  used  in  crackers,  potato  chips  and  some  fast  food.  It  can  also  be  found  in  varnish,  lacquer  and  resin.  It  helps  prolong  the  shelf  life  of  food  and,  if  it's  consumed  at  low  levels,  is  considered  safe.In  higher  doses  --  above  what  the  FDA  says  manufactures  can  use  in  food  prep  --  TBHQ  has  been  found  to  cause  "nausea,  vomiting,  ringing  in  the  ears,  delirium,  a  sense  of  suffocation,  and  collapse,"  according  to  "A  Consumer's  Dictionary  of  Food  Additives."  It  may  also  cause  restlessness  and  vision  problems.6.  Silicon  dioxide,  silica  and  calcium  silicateSilicon  dioxide,  also  known  as  silica,  is  a  naturally  occurring  material  (PDF)  made  up  of  shells  of  tiny  single-celled  algae.  You  might  also  recognize  it  as  sand,  the  kind  that  gets  stuck  in  your  suit  at  the  beach.Silicon  dioxide  is  used  in  dry  coffee  creamer,  dried  soups  and  other  powdery  foods.  It  is  also  used  as  an  insect  repellent,  removing  the  oily  film  that  covers  an  insect's  body,  causing  them  to  dry  out  and  die.The  EPA  concluded  that  the  human  health  risk  is  low  and  "not  unreasonable."  In  rat  studies,  high-dose  exposure  has  caused  some  lung  problems.  Another  study  of  Chinese  workers  who  were  heavily  exposed  to  the  chemical  showed  a  disproportionate  number  of  deaths  related  to  respiratory  diseases,  lung  cancer  and  cardiovascular  diseases.  Silicon  dioxide  has  also  been  associated  with  the  risk  of  developing  autoimmune  diseases  --  again  only  after  heavy  exposure.7.  Triacetin  (glycerol  triacetate)Triacetin,  also  known  as  glyceryl  triacetate,  has  been  approved  and  generally  recognized  as  safe  by  the  FDA  as  a  food  additive.In  food,  it  is  used  as  a  plasticizer  for  chewing  gum  and  gummy  candy.  It  can  be  used  to  keep  food  from  drying  out  and  in  some  cookies,  muffins  and  cakes.  It  is  also  used  in  perfume,  cosmetics  and  cigarette  filters  and  in  drugs  like  Viagra.</TEXT></DOC>

It  was  all  about  stealth.  Pentagon  Cold  War  strategists  desperately  wanted  to  build  planes  that  could  evade  Soviet  radar.And  so  the  Air  Force  launched  a  "black  program"  to  develop  Tacit  Blue  and  tested  it  at  a  secret  government  airbase  in  Nevada  called  "Area  51,"  according  to  CIA  documents  released  in  2013.The  program,  which  lasted  from  1978  to  1985,  aimed  to  develop  a  single-seater  jet  for  battlefield  surveillance.Before  last  year's  document  release,  the  government  never  acknowledged  the  existence  of  Area  51.  For  decades,  a  fenced-off  area  surrounding  Nevada's  Groom  Lake  was  rumored  to  be  a  testing  ground  for  some  of  the  nation's  most  secret  technology.Two  retired  Air  Force  test  pilots  who  flew  Tacit  Blue  in  the  early  1980s,  Ken  Dyson  and  Russ  Easter,  spoke  about  why  this  plane  was  important  and  what  set  it  apart.Although  the  plane  flew  135  times  and  was  never  put  into  production,  without  Tacit  Blue,  there  would  have  been  no  B-2  Spirit  bomber.  The  plane  proved  that  aircraft  with  curved  surfaces  could  evade  radar."The  airplane  flew  pretty  solid,  I'd  say,"  Dyson  remembered.Could  sightings  of  Tacit  Blue  have  contributed  to  UFO  reports?"I'm  not  aware  of  any  circumstance  like  that,"  Easter  said.  Dyson  also  says  no.But  Cynda  Thomas,  widow  of  the  first  Tacit  Blue  test  pilot  Richard  G.  "Dick"  Thomas,  said  she  was  with  her  husband  in  Los  Angeles  when  an  airline  pilot  accosted  her  husband  during  a  test  pilots'  banquet  at  the  Beverly  Hilton.As  she  remembers  it,  "The  pilot  came  over,  and  he  said,  'Mr.  Thomas,  I'm  so-and-so,  and  I  fly  for  Continental,  and  I'm  sure  I  saw  you  flying  the  Tacit  Blue  --  and  you  know,  I  reported  you  as  a  UFO.'  ""Airline  pilots  have,  over  the  past,  reported  some  stuff  that  could  have  been  black  aircraft  in  flight  tests,"  Dyson  said."One  and  a  half"  Tacit  Blue  planes  were  built,  Dyson  said,  so  that  "if  we  lost  one,  we  could  have  a  second  one  up  and  flying  in  short  order."  What  happened  to  the  other  half  of  Tacit  Blue?  "I  think  it  was  done  away  with  --  with  total  respect  to  secrecy."Mechanical  remnants  from  a  related  black  program  called  Have  Blue  "are  buried  at  Groom  Lake,"  according  to  a  2011  Air  Force  report.  Groom  Lake  is  inside  Area  51,  according  to  those  released  CIA  documents."I  don't  know  anything  at  all  about  that  Have  Blue  stuff  and  wouldn't  answer  it  if  I  did,"  said  Dyson,  who  also  tested  Have  Blue  airplanes.Dyson  is  aware  of  the  CIA  documents  but  said  he  didn't  want  to  talk  about  Groom  Lake  or  Area  51  or  to  even  mention  those  places  by  name.  "That's  just  because  of  the  secrecy  that  was  drilled  into  me,"  he  said.Maintaining  Tacit  Blue's  secrets  and  preventing  leaks,  Dyson  said,  was  proof  of  the  success  of  a  tightly  knit  and  dedicated  team.  Pursuing  a  career  centered  around  a  secret  job  takes  discipline."My  wife  had  no  clue  what  I  was  doing  for  a  long  time,"  Dyson  said.  "I  just  didn't  talk  about  it  to  her  or  to  anyone  else  who  wasn't  cleared  on  the  program.  It  just  wasn't  done."Richard  Thomas  also  kept  details  about  his  work  from  his  family,  Cynda  Thomas  said,  although  in  1972  he  did  reveal  to  her  that  he  was  "going  into  the  black  world."Secrecy  made  professional  relationships  complicated  at  times.  Associates  outside  Dyson's  and  Easter's  secret  circle  wanted  to  hear  "war  stories"  about  what  it  was  like  to  work  in  the  world  of  black  programs,  Easter  said.  "Sometimes  I  wish  we  could  tell  more  stories  more  freely  so  that  some  of  the  lessons  learned  could  be  passed  on  freer."50  states,  50  spots  to  visit  in  2014Three  unique  things  about  Tacit  Blue•  Pantyhose  made  it  safer:  According  to  Cynda  Thomas'  book  "Hell  of  a  Ride,"  an  air  compressor  was  blowing  tiny  flammable  aluminum  shavings  through  inlet  pipes  and  into  the  cockpit,  creating  a  fire  hazard.  The  engineers'  unorthodox  solution:  cover  the  inlet  pipes  with  filters  made  of  pantyhose,  Thomas  wrote.  "That  could  be  true,"  Easter  acknowledges.•  They  created  an  artificial  wind  tunnel  with  a  huge  transport  aircraft.  Developers  used  a  huge  C-130  Hercules  plane  to  create  artificial  winds  that  hit  the  side  of  the  plane  so  they  could  test  Tacit  Blue's  performance.  Dyson  described  it  as  a  sort  of  "wind  tunnel"  that  was  set  up  "in  the  black  of  the  night  so  no  one  could  see  us  flying  overhead  with  a  satellite."•  It  was  very  hard  to  pilot:  Tacit  Blue  at  the  time  was  "arguably  the  most  unstable  aircraft  man  had  ever  flown,"  ex-Northrop  engineer  John  Cashen  told  Air  Force  Magazine.Richard  Thomas  died  in  2006,  at  age  76.  Cynda  Thomas  said  her  husband  had  been  battling  Parkinson's  disease.At  Tacit  Blue's  1996  unveiling  ceremony  at  the  museum,  Thomas  was  able  to  sit  inside  the  airplane's  cockpit  one  more  time."That's  when  they  let  me  point  my  camera  up  the  steps  of  the  airplane  to  take  his  picture,"  recalls  Cynda  Thomas.  "I'm  so  thankful  he  got  to  do  that  before  he  passed.  That  plane  was  my  husband's  legacy."8  very  old  sites  in  the  New  WorldThe  plane  that  wouldn't  quit:  'Spare  617'Outside  the  museum's  doors,  at  the  Air  Park,  sit  several  giant  planes  --  each  with  their  own  stories.  One  of  them,  the  Air  Force  Museum  says,  saw  "one  of  the  greatest  feats  of  airmanship  of  the  Southeast  Asia  War."In  April  1972,  a  huge  C130-E  Hercules  transport  plane  code-named  Spare  617  was  ordered  to  fly  over  a  raging  battle  in  South  Vietnam  and  parachute-drop  giant  pallets  of  ammunition.  If  all  went  well,  the  ammo  would  resupply  South  Vietnamese  soldiers  fighting  on  the  ground.  But  all  did  not  go  well.Preparing  to  make  his  drop,  pilot  William  Caldwell  flew  the  plane  low  over  the  town  of  An  Loc.But  the  enemy  had  put  a  machine  gun  nest  high  above  the  town  in  a  church  steeple,  Caldwell  recalled.  "So,  we  were  just  a  sitting  duck  for  him."Caldwell  remembers  machine  gun  fire  ripping  through  the  cockpit,  smashing  a  circuit  breaker  panel  and  the  plane's  windows.  Flight  engineer  Jon  Sanders  died  instantly.  The  attack  wounded  copilot  John  Hering  and  navigator  Richard  Lenz  and  damaged  two  of  the  plane's  four  turboprop  engines.Gunfire  ruptured  a  duct  designed  to  bleed  hot  air  from  the  plane's  powerful  engines.  The  scalding  air  severely  burned  cargo  loadmaster  Charlie  Shaub,  as  Caldwell  put  it,  like  a  "600-degree  hurricane."Then  it  got  worse.  The  attack  set  fire  to  some  of  the  plane's  explosive  cargo.But  despite  his  burns,  Shaub  was  somehow  able  to  eject  the  burning  pallets  of  ammunition.  It  was  just  in  time.  Seconds  later,  the  ammo  exploded  as  it  fell  to  the  ground.  Then,  Shaub  astonishingly  snuffed  out  the  fire  in  the  cargo  hold.  Caldwell  closed  the  bleed  air  duct  and  shut  down  the  damaged  engines.Next  problem:  how  to  save  the  wounded  crew.  Caldwell  pointed  the  plane  toward  an  air  base  with  the  best  medical  facilities.  He  would  have  to  land  a  giant  C-130E  with  only  two  working  engines  --  both  on  the  same  side  of  the  aircraft.Things  looked  grim,  he  said,  but  "I  got  more  confident  with  every  mile  we  got  closer  to  the  air  base,"  said  Caldwell.Again,  things  went  further  south.A  hydraulics  system  that  was  needed  to  lower  the  landing  gear  became  useless.  Using  nothing  but  sheer  muscle,  Lenz  and  cargo  loadmaster  Dave  McAleece  lowered  the  wheels  by  hand  using  crank  handles,  Caldwell  said.Caldwell  landed  the  plane  fast:  pushing  about  170  mph.  With  hydraulics  busted,  he  had  trouble  steering  the  plane."I  used  the  inboard  right  side  engine  to  guide  the  plane  down  a  high-speed  runway  turnoff,"  he  said.After  rolling  to  a  stop,  "I  got  out  of  the  airplane,"  Caldwell  recalled.  An  airman  on  the  ground  asked,  "Are  you  OK?"  Caldwell  replied,  "You  bastards  didn't  prepare  us  for  THIS."Blood  Falls  and  other  natural  odditiesThree  notable  details  about  the  mission•  What  recognition  did  the  crew  receive?  Caldwell  and  Shaub  received  the  Air  Force  Cross,  the  Air  Force's  second-highest  award  for  valor.•  Did  the  plane  have  any  weapons?  Spare  617  flew  with  virtually  no  defensive  weaponry.  "We  only  had  38  revolvers,"  said  Caldwell,  70,  now  a  retired  colonel  who  teaches  aviation  at  the  University  of  Southern  Illinois.  It  was  the  airplane  itself,  he  said,  that  helped  save  them.  "That  airplane  was  just  as  responsible  for  getting  us  home  as  any  of  the  crew."•  How  hard  was  it  to  lower  the  landing  gear?  The  attack  knocked  out  the  plane's  hydraulic  system,  forcing  the  crew  to  lower  the  plane's  gigantic  landing  gear  manually.  "I  think  it  takes  roughly  650  turns  of  that  crank  to  get  a  landing  gear  down  on  both  sides  of  the  airplane.  It's  an  endurance  thing  more  than  strength  thing."'Angel'  of  freedom:  The  Hanoi  TaxiA  third  piece  of  flying  history  at  the  museum  has  come  to  symbolize  freedom  for  former  U.S.  POWs  captured  during  the  Vietnam  War.They  call  it  the  Hanoi  Taxi,  the  first  U.S.  plane  to  ferry  newly  freed  troops  out  of  North  Vietnam.  Photos  of  the  ex-captives  taken  aboard  the  C-141  Starlifter  clearly  illustrate  the  joy  and  relief  the  men  felt  that  day  in  February  1973.Until  the  POWs  left  enemy  airspace,  they  had  refused  to  give  their  captors  the  satisfaction  of  showing  happiness  for  being  released.  When  they  crossed  over  international  waters,  stoic  silence  immediately  turned  to  joyful  pandemonium.A  few  hours  later,  with  the  Starlifter  in  the  background,  TV  viewers  watched  stunning,  emotional  reunions  in  the  Philippines  between  the  ex-POWs  and  their  loved  ones.Maj.  Gen.  Edward  Mechenbier,  a  retired  Air  Force  fighter  pilot  who  spent  nearly  six  years  as  a  North  Vietnamese  prisoner,  rode  aboard  the  plane  as  it  carried  him  back  to  the  United  States  from  the  Philippines."This  plane  looked  like  an  absolute  angel  coming  to  get  us,"  he  remembered.Now,  the  plane  sits  at  the  museum's  Air  Park,  at  the  mercy  of  the  wind  and  cold.  Walking  around  the  aircraft  and  running  your  hand  across  its  metal  exterior,  you  get  a  sense  that  you're  touching  a  piece  of  history."It's  a  hallowed  place,"  said  museum  curator  Jeff  Duford.  "And  you  can  definitely  get  a  sense  of  that  when  you  step  aboard  it."  But  right  now,  that's  not  possible  for  visitors.  The  Taxi's  interior  is  off-limits,  and  its  flight  deck  windows  are  covered.The  plane  --  along  with  Spare  617  --  is  slated  to  be  housed  in  a  new  $35.4  million  building  in  2016.  Duford  says  the  museum  hasn't  decided  whether  visitors  will  be  able  to  board  either  aircraft  when  they  move  inside.The  Hanoi  Taxi  flew  two  freedom  missions  carrying  ex-POWs  out  of  Hanoi's  Gia  Lam  Airport.  Overall,  the  aircraft's  total  passengers  to  freedom  numbered  78  POWs  and  two  civilian  returnees.  The  plane  also  flew  four  freedom  missions  from  the  Philippines  to  the  United  States,  carrying  a  total  of  76  ex-POWs.For  four  decades,  the  airplane  served  around  the  world,  until  it  retired  in  2006  to  the  Air  Force  museum.Three  unique  things  about  the  Hanoi  Taxi•  The  plane  returned  to  Vietnam  in  2004:  Mechenbier,  by  then  a  major  general,  flew  the  Hanoi  Taxi  back  to  Vietnam  on  a  mission  to  repatriate  the  newly  recovered  remains  of  two  U.S.  service  members  who  were  killed  in  action  during  the  war.•  It  served  in  the  Iraq  War:  The  plane  helped  transfer  wounded  troops  from  Baghdad  to  Ramstein  Air  Base  in  Germany  and  to  Washington  for  treatment  at  Walter  Reed  Army  Medical  Center.•  It  served  as  a  disaster  evacuation  plane:  The  Hanoi  Taxi  airlifted  survivors  to  safety  after  2005's  Hurricane  Katrina.Like  many  of  the  museum's  other  hundreds  of  aircraft,  these  three  planes  --  Tacit  Blue,  Spare  617  and  the  Hanoi  Taxi  --  contributed  to  history."These  really  aren't  airplanes  anymore,"  Duford  said.  "They're  artifacts.  And  so  we  want  to  make  sure,  as  a  responsible  institution,  that  we  protect  those  artifacts.  That's  more  important  than  anything  else."</TEXT></DOC>

Johnson's  parents  have  said  the  original  probe  was  mishandled  by  local  authorities.  The  FBI  has  interviewed  several  of  Johnson's  former  schoolmates,  according  to  a  source  with  knowledge  of  the  investigation.Outside  the  federal  courthouse  Thursday,  U.S.  Attorney  Michael  Moore  said,  "We're  working  methodically,  and  sometimes  we  remember  we're  running  a  marathon  instead  of  a  sprint.  So,  we're  working  on  it.  It's  better  to  get  it  right  than  to  get  it  fast.  I'm  satisfied  that  the  FBI  is  moving  forward  at  the  appropriate  speed,  and  they're  doing  a  fine  job."Johnson's  body  was  found  in  a  rolled-up  mat  in  the  Lowndes  High  School  gymnasium  on  January  11,  2013.  Investigators  with  the  Lowndes  County  Sheriff's  Office  ruled  his  death  accidental,  concluding  that  Johnson  climbed  into  the  center  of  the  gym  mat  to  reach  for  a  shoe  and  got  stuck.State  officials  later  concurred  that  Johnson's  death  was  accidental  and  listed  his  cause  of  death  as  "positional  asphyxia,"  or  suffocation  by  his  own  body  weight.Johnson's  parents  have  called  the  official  story  a  "coverup"  and  said  they  believe  their  son's  death  was  a  homicide.  A  separate  autopsy  commissioned  by  the  family  attributed  the  17-year-old's  death  to  "apparent  non-accidental,  blunt  force  trauma."The  complete  list  of  those  subpoenaed  for  Thursday's  grand  jury  proceeding  was  not  clear,  but  Lowndes  County  Sheriff  Chris  Prine  said  he  had  not  received  a  federal  subpoena,  and  Lowndes  County  Schools  said  it  was  subpoenaed  only  to  provide  hard  drives  containing  surveillance  video  from  the  school.County  Coroner  Bill  Watson  said  he  hasn't  received  a  subpoena,  either,  though  the  FBI  has  interviewed  him  twice  and  he  has  spoken  to  the  U.S.  attorney.  Johnson's  parents  say  they,  too,  spoke  with  the  FBI  during  a  three-hour  interview  in  Thomasville,  40  miles  west  of  Valdosta,  in  December.Asked  during  a  January  interview  if  he  found  the  feds'  involvement  encouraging,  Johnson's  father,  Kenneth  Johnson,  said,  "We  really  won't  feel  anything  until  justice  comes  for  Kendrick.  We're  glad  they're  here,  but  my  feelings  won't  be  there  until  we  get  justice  for  our  son."His  wife,  Jacquelyn  Johnson,  said  the  FBI  interview  left  her  hopeful."They  answered  a  lot  of  questions  about  a  lot  of  what  we  had  heard,"  she  said.  "I  felt  better  because  it's  another  set  of  eyes  looking  into  the  case."</TEXT></DOC>

For  the  first  time  in  45  years,  Goodyear  is  flying  a  new  model  of  its  famous  blimp.  And,  it's  a  Zeppelin.  Cue  the  guitars!</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  It's  a  new  era  for  Goodyear's  iconic  blimp.  You  could  call  it  the  Age  of  the  Zeppelin.  Cue  the  guitars!The  Ohio-based  tire  and  rubber  company  started  testing  its  next-generation  airship  last  month  at  Goodyear's  airfield  near  Akron.  Yes,  this  is  an  actual  Zeppelin  airship,  made  in  partnership  with  the  German  company  that  dates  to  before  the  infamous  Hindenburg  disaster.But  don't  panic,  this  new  lighter-than-air  vehicle  is  just  as  safe  as  its  blimp  predecessor.  It's  filled  with  helium,  not  hydrogen  like  the  humongous  airship  that  burned  in  New  Jersey  in  1937.Goodyear  is  finally  closing  the  door  on  the  GZ-20  models,  which  came  off  the  drawing  board  45  years  ago.In  the  coming  months,  Goodyear  plans  to  train  more  than  10  pilots  to  fly  the  Zeppelin  NT.  (NT  stands  for  new  technology.)If  all  goes  as  planned,  we'll  be  watching  this  sleek  new  silver,  yellow  and  blue  airship  hovering  high  above  sporting  events  east  of  the  Rockies  this  fall.More  amenities  on  the  new  ZeppelinSo  what's  different  about  this  one?  It's  faster,  because  it  has  three  engines  instead  of  two.  It's  bigger.  It's  more  maneuverable.  It  can  carry  more  passengers.  Oh,  yeah,  and  unlike  the  old  model,  this  one's  got  an  onboard  restroom.  Believe  me,  I  can  tell  you  from  experience  that  will  be  a  relief  (literally).Oh,  good.  Seat  belts.  The  new  blimp's  going  to  have  seat  belts.  The  older  model  didn't,  which  shook  me  up  a  little  when  we  lifted  off  at  a  25-degree  angle  with  the  engines  screaming.Behind  the  scenes  as  Goodyear  preps  the  new  blimpWhen  Goodyear  Capt.  Matt  Lussier  let  me  briefly  fly  one  of  the  older  blimps  over  Atlanta  on  New  Year's  Eve,  its  engines  maxed  out  about  50  mph.  Top  speed  of  these  Zeppelins:  73  mph,  increasing  their  range  and  allowing  them  to  take  part  in  more  events.Lussier  instructed  me  on  how  to  turn  the  blimp  left  and  right  with  pedals  on  the  floor.  The  cockpit  aboard  the  Zeppelin  includes  a  joystick  that  will  more  easily  allow  the  pilot  to  turn  and  to  point  up  or  down.Read  more  about  how  I  ended  up  piloting  the  blimpOne  thing  that  surprised  me  about  the  older  blimp  was  its  tiny  gondola,  which  seats  from  three  to  seven  people,  including  the  pilot  --  depending  on  whether  it's  covering  a  sporting  event.  The  new  Goodyear  Zeppelin  accommodates  12.  It's  got  bigger  "wrap-around  windows"  that  Goodyear  says  offer  improved  "sweeping  panoramic  views."I  have  to  tell  you,  the  views  on  the  older  blimp  were  still  pretty  damn  awesome.  It  felt  like  we  were  standing  atop  the  world's  tallest  treehouse,  looking  out  for  a  hundred  miles  in  every  direction.Massive  enough  to  blot  out  the  skyWhen  you  stand  underneath  a  blimp  on  a  landing  field,  the  thing  is  so  massive  that  it  blots  out  the  sky.  It's  nearly  the  length  of  an  American  football  field.  But  this  new  airship  is  even  longer,  measuring  246  feet  from  tip  to  tail  --  54  feet  more  than  the  current  blimp.In  the  older  blimps,  the  two  engines  are  bolted  to  the  gondola.  But  in  the  new  ones,  engines  are  attached  to  the  "envelope,"  the  blimp's  helium-filled  "bag,"  as  the  pilots  sometimes  call  it.  The  bag  on  the  new  blimp  is  constructed  with  a  semirigid  skeleton  to  make  it  faster  and  more  nimble.Compare  the  old  and  new  blimpsIt's  all  part  of  a  phase-out  plan  of  all  three  Goodyear  blimps;  the  Spirit  of  Goodyear  retired  this  year  in  Florida  after  a  record  14-year  career.  Eventually,  it's  expected  to  go  on  display  at  an  undisclosed  aviation  museum.The  Carson,  California-based  Spirit  of  America  will  be  decommissioned  in  2015  or  2016,  and  finally,  the  Pompano  Beach,  Florida-based  Spirit  of  Innovation  is  scheduled  to  retire  in  2018.A  Goodyear  pilot  shows  how  he  flies  the  older  blimpGoodyear  has  launched  an  online  contest  to  allow  the  public  to  name  the  new  blimp.Tour  offers  Zeppelin-view  of  ParisFYI,  airship  enthusiasts,  Goodyear  will  continue  to  call  these  things  "blimps,"  even  though  technically,  they're  not.  As  any  "helium  head"  will  tell  you,  a  blimp  is  an  airship  without  an  internal  skeleton.  These  new  airships  have  internal  skeletons.But  Goodyear  loves  the  "B"  word,  so  the  company  plans  to  keep  calling  them  "blimps."</TEXT></DOC>

DHS  often  issues  these  alerts  out  of  an  abundance  of  caution,  but  this  does  not  necessarily  rise  to  the  level  of  facilitating  a  response,"  the  intelligence  official  said.A  fourth  official  similarly  stressed  there  is  no  specific  threat  and  said  there  is  already  some  puzzlement  about  why  DHS  issued  the  warning.Yet  another  intelligence  source  said  the  warning  went  beyond  a  concern  about  explosives  in  shoes  to  include  cosmetics  and  liquids.The  official  added  that  the  threat  is  unrelated  to  recent  warnings  about  toothpaste  and  cosmetic  tubes  potentially  being  used  to  hide  explosives  on  flights  to  Russia.Terrorism  experts  say  airlines  continue  to  be  a  target  of  terrorists  wishing  to  make  a  spectacular  impact  with  an  attack.  The  focus  on  security  since  2001  has  shifted  from  hijackings  to  bombs,  especially  those  that  might  be  hidden  in  luggage.In  December  2001,  just  weeks  after  the  9/11  attacks,  passengers  aboard  an  American  Airlines  flight  from  Paris  to  Miami  thwarted  another  passenger's  attempt  to  detonate  explosives  hidden  in  his  sneakers.  Richard  Reid,  a  British  citizen,  pleaded  guilty  and  is  serving  a  life  sentence.A  failed  attempt  to  blow  up  an  overseas  flight  heading  to  Detroit  on  Christmas  Day  in  2009  involved  a  bomb  concealed  in  a  passenger's  underwear.Current  Transportation  Security  Administration  policy  requires  passengers  going  through  security  checkpoints  to  take  off  their  shoes  to  be  X-rayed.DHS  is  not  making  any  changes  to  passenger  requirements,  though  travelers  may  notice  additional  searches,  including  swabs  to  detect  explosives,  according  to  a  law  enforcement  official.The  official  added  that  there  are  "seen  and  unseen"  measures  TSA  can  take  for  security  and  additional  scrutiny.The  warning  outlined  25  to  30  cities  overseas,  all  of  which  have  nonstop  flights  to  the  United  States,  an  airline  industry  source  said.  Johannesburg,  Paris,  London  and  Cairo,  as  well  as  some  cities  in  the  Middle  East,  were  on  the  list.For  carriers  flying  on  those  routes,  the  alert  warned  there  would  be  increased  scrutiny  of  people  who  appear  on  the  TSA's  "selectee  list,"  which  includes  people  deemed  suspicious  who  could  warrant  additional  screening,  as  well  as  randomly  picked  people.The  warning  was  meant  to  give  a  heads  up  to  airlines  about  delays,  not  asking  airlines  to  do  anything  specific,  the  industry  source  said.CNN's  Rene  Marsh  and  Mike  Ahlers  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

It  crashed  into  the  Indian  Ocean,  they'll  say,  citing  complicated  math  as  proof.They  can  tell  you  when  it  probably  happened  --  on  March  8,  sometime  between  8:11  and  9:15  a.m.  (7:11  to  8:15  p.m.  ET  March  7),  handing  you  a  sheet  with  extraordinarily  technical  details  about  satellite  communications  technology.What  they  still  can't  tell  you  is  why,  or  precisely  where,  or  show  you  a  piece  of  the  wreckage.All  those  uncertainties  are  too  much  for  relatives  of  the  239  people  aboard  the  plane,  some  of  whom  marched  to  the  Malaysian  Embassy  in  Beijing  to  denounce  the  airline,  the  country  and  just  about  everything  involved  with  an  investigation  that  has  transfixed  the  world  and  vexed  experts."I'm  so  mad,"  one  upset  family  member  told  reporters.  He  said  he  felt  there  was  "no  evidence"  that  the  passenger  jet  crashed  in  the  Indian  Ocean."If  you  find  something:  OK,  we  accept,"  he  said.  "But  nothing  --  just  from  the  data,  just  from  analysis."Where's  the  proof?Malaysian  authorities  say  they  know  the  news  is  hard  to  take.  But  Tuesday,  acting  Malaysian  Transportation  Minister  Hishammuddin  Hussein  defended  the  decision  to  release  the  analysis  and  the  heartbreaking  conclusions  that  flowed  from  it."It  was  released  out  of  a  commitment  to  openness  and  respect  for  the  relatives,  two  principles  which  have  guided  the  investigation,"  he  said.That  investigation  now  focuses  on  an  area  of  the  southern  Indian  Ocean  off  Australia's  west  coast,  where  authorities  believe  the  plane  went  down  after  a  long,  odd,  unexplained  flight  that  should  have  ended  hours  before  in  Beijing.Searching  there  resumed  Wednesday  after  bad  weather  grounded  planes  for  a  day.Hishammuddin  said  authorities  have  stopped  searching  for  the  plane  altogether  along  a  northern  arc  that  stretched  from  Vietnam  to  Kazakhstan.  Analysis  of  data  by  British  satellite  company  Inmarsat  and  British  accident  investigators  show  the  Boeing  777-200ER  was  heading  south  at  last  contact,  he  said.How  'groundbreaking'  number  crunching  found  path  of  Flight  370Commercial  satellite  data  from  a  U.S.  company,  first  analyzed  by  Australian  officials,  as  well  as  satellite  data  from  China  and  France,  have  turned  up  evidence  of  debris  bobbing  in  the  general  area  where  authorities  believe  the  plane  went  down.Australian  and  Chinese  surveillance  planes  have  both  reported  seeing  debris  on  the  water,  but  so  far  nothing  has  been  recovered  or  definitively  linked  to  the  missing  flight.Authorities  cautioned  that  despite  the  narrowing  the  search  area,  it  could  still  be  some  time  before  crews  find  any  sign  of  the  airplane."We're  not  searching  for  a  needle  in  a  haystack,"  Mark  Binskin,  vice  chief  of  the  Australian  Defence  Force,  told  reporters.  "We're  still  trying  to  define  where  the  haystack  is."Search  resumes  after  weather  delayAfter  bad  weather  halted  the  hunt  for  a  day,  searching  resumed  Wednesday  for  Malaysia  Airlines  Flight  370,  the  Australian  Maritime  Safety  Authority  said.A  Chinese  plane  took  off  for  the  search  area  in  the  Indian  Ocean  at  5  a.m.  Wednesday  (5  p.m.  ET  Tuesday),  several  hours  ahead  of  schedule,  the  authority  told  CNN's  Kyung  Lah.Gale-force  winds,  large  waves,  heavy  rain  and  low  clouds  lashed  the  search  area  Tuesday,  making  it  impossible  to  dispatch  surveillance  planes  to  the  scene  and  making  it  all  but  impossible  to  spot  anything  from  ships.Wednesday's  search  is  set  to  include  ships  and  aircraft  from  six  countries:  Australia,  New  Zealand,  the  United  States,  Japan,  China  and  South  Korea.Twelve  aircraft  will  be  part  of  the  search,  Australian  officials  said.And  equipment  to  help  find  the  plane's  locator  beacon  is  expected  to  arrive  Wednesday  from  the  United  States.But  even  with  more  searchers  and  equipment  and  calmer  weather,  the  effort  will  still  face  severe  challenges.The  area  is  extraordinarily  remote  --  some  1,500  miles  from  Perth,  Australia,  where  military  surveillance  planes  capable  of  searching  the  site  are  based.  It  is  also  astoundingly  large  ---  some  400,000  to  500,000  square  miles  of  ocean."With  eight  hours  of  flying  to  and  from  the  search  region,  the  fleet  of  P-3  Orion  aircraft  and  other  military  aircraft  have  only  a  precious  few  hours  to  scour  the  search  tracks  they  have  been  given,"  Australian  Defence  Minister  David  Johnston  said.To  complicate  matters,  debris  that  may  have  been  floating  days  ago,  when  some  of  the  satellite  images  were  taken,  could  have  sunk  by  now.  Other  debris  may  have  drifted  hundreds  of  miles.And  time  is  running  out  to  find  the  flight  data  recorder,  whose  locator  beacon  is  expected  to  stop  working  sometime  around  April  7.More  than  half  a  million  square  kilometers  (193,000  square  miles)  have  been  searched  to  date,  Australian  authorities  said.How  they're  searching  for  debrisCrash  conclusion  explainedHishammuddin  spent  part  of  Tuesday's  briefing  explaining  how  investigators  came  to  the  conclusion  that  the  plane  must  have  gone  into  the  southern  Indian  Ocean.He  said  the  analysis  was  based  on  sophisticated  mathematics  calculating  how  long  it  took  signals  from  a  transmitter  on  the  plane  to  reach  an  orbiting  Inmarsat  communications  satellite.Much  like  the  horn  from  a  passing  car  whose  pitch  rises  as  it  approaches  and  then  falls  as  it  races  away,  engineers  were  able  examine  the  satellite's  signal  and  determine  it  had  to  be  moving  south,  he  said.Engineers  checked  their  calculations  against  data  from  other  Boeing  777  flights  that  day  and  found  their  technique  was  sound,  he  said.One  mystery  remains  in  the  data:  The  plane's  transmitter  and  satellite  tried  to  make  one  final  connection  at  8:19  a.m."At  this  time  this  transmission  is  not  understood  and  is  subject  to  further  ongoing  work,"  he  said.The  analysis  shows  that  the  plane  didn't  answer  a  ping  from  the  satellite  ground  station  at  9:15  a.m.  (8:15  p.m.  ET),  leading  investigators  to  conclude  the  plane's  satellite  transmitter  stopped  working  sometime  between  8:11  and  9:15  a.m."This,"  Hishammuddin  said,  "is  consistent  with  the  maximum  endurance  of  the  aircraft."Malaysia  has  convened  an  international  working  group  to  help  further  narrow  the  search  area.  It  involves  agencies  with  "expertise  in  satellite  communications  and  aircraft  performance,"  he  said.It  will  build  on  the  existing  analysis  of  satellite  data  in  hopes  of  pinpointing  a  more  exact  location  for  the  plane's  location.What  happened  to  cause  the  plane  to  veer  off  course  and  presumably  crash  into  the  Indian  Ocean  hours  after  it  was  supposed  to  arrive  in  Beijing  remains  unknown.  Authorities  and  analysts  have  speculated  anything  from  mechanical  failure  to  terrorism  to  pilot  suicide  could  have  played  a  role.Police  have  interviewed  scores  of  people,  and  the  Royal  Malaysian  Air  Force  is  conducting  its  own  inquiry  into  the  disappearance,  authorities  say.Anguished  families  reactThe  Malaysian  government's  announcement  was  met  with  anger  by  relatives,  many  of  whom  said  it  was  premature  to  declare  their  loved  ones  dead  before  locating  any  wreckage  or  bodies.  Others  accused  Malaysian  officials  of  lying  or  concealing  facts.Relatives  first  learned  of  the  conclusion  that  the  plane  had  crashed  via  a  text  message  sent  to  their  cell  phones.  Malaysian  authorities  followed  up  with  briefings  for  families  in  Beijing  and  Kuala  Lumpur,  Malaysia."They  have  told  us  all  lives  are  lost,"  a  missing  passenger's  relative  briefed  by  the  airline  in  Beijing  said  Monday.In  Beijing,  hundreds  of  friends  and  family  members  of  missing  passengers  marched  to  the  Malaysian  Embassy  to  express  their  anger  and  frustration.Uniformed  police  blocked  journalists  from  joining  the  protesters  as  they  approached  the  gates  of  the  embassy.  One  woman  in  the  crowd,  overcome  by  stress  and  emotion,  was  carried  to  a  nearby  ambulance  on  a  stretcher.James  Wood,  whose  brother  Philip  was  one  of  three  American  passengers  on  the  plane,  said  the  announcement,  followed  by  the  temporary  suspension  of  the  search  because  of  weather,  "almost  felt  like  a  miniature  roller  coaster  within  the  day."Families  are  stuck  in  a  "holding  pattern,"  he  told  CNN's  "AC360°.""We're  just  waiting  and  waiting,"  he  said,  "and  not  getting  any  answers  one  way  or  another."Malaysian  officials  said  they  are  doing  all  they  can.Prime  Minister  Najib  Razak  explained  Tuesday  that  he  decided  to  make  his  official  announcement  Monday  because  he  did  not  want  the  government  to  be  seen  as  hiding  information  on  purpose  from  the  families  of  the  missing  passengers.In  an  address  to  Parliament  in  Kuala  Lumpur,  he  said  his  statement  was  based  on  "the  most  conclusive  information  we  have."Malaysia  Airlines  said  Tuesday  it  has  offered  family  members  financial  support  of  $5,000  for  each  passenger  aboard  the  ill-fated  flight  and  was  preparing  to  make  additional  payments  as  the  prolonged  search  continues.CEO  Ahmad  Jauhari  Yahya  told  reporters  the  airline  shares  in  the  families'  grief."We  all  feel  enormous  sorrow  and  pain,"  he  said  Tuesday.  "Sorrow  that  all  those  who  boarded  Flight  MH370  on  Saturday  8th  March,  will  not  see  their  families  again.  And  that  those  families  will  now  have  to  live  on  without  those  they  love."Ocean  search  has  many  challengesClues  lead  to  new  theoriesCNN's  Jethro  Mullen  reported  and  wrote  from  Hong  Kong;  CNN's  Mitra  Mobasherat  reported  from  Kuala  Lumpur,  Malaysia;  Catherine  E.

Hunley  --  the  first  submarine  to  sink  an  enemy  ship  --  has  held  tight  to  its  murky  mysteries.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Born  and  built  amid  gray-cloaked  secrecy  during  the  American  Civil  War,  the  H.L.  Hunley  --  the  first  submarine  to  sink  an  enemy  ship  --  has  held  tight  to  its  murky  mysteries.The  150th  anniversary  of  the  Hunley's  daring  and  dangerous  raid  will  be  marked  this  weekend  and  Monday,  but  the  overarching  question  remains:  What  caused  the  submarine  and  its  eight-member  crew  to  slip  to  the  bottom  of  the  sea  on  the  moonlit  evening  of  February  17,  1864,  after  it  signaled  to  shore  a  success  that  changed  naval  warfare.The  Hunley,  housed  at  a  laboratory  in  North  Charleston,  South  Carolina,  has  yielded  its  secrets  slowly  and  sparingly,  even  to  researchers  armed  with  the  latest  in  technology.Was  the  loss  of  the  Hunley  the  result  of  the  torpedo's  detonation?  An  unsecured  hatch?  Or  perhaps  a  lucky  enemy  shot  that  blasted  a  hole  in  the  Confederate  vessel's  viewing  port?And  why  were  the  crew's  remarkably  preserved  remains  found  at  their  stations,  rather  than  jammed  together  near  an  escape  hatch?These  and  other  questions  continue  to  enthrall  scientists  and  historians  as  the  sesquicentennial  is  observed  with  tours  and  events  in  the  Charleston  area.Unmasking  the  Hunley's  secretsThere  is  hope  that  some  additional  clues  may  emerge  soon.The  Hunley  Project,  a  consortium  of  researchers,  scientists  and  state  and  federal  agencies,  this  year  begins  a  conservation  phase  that  might  add  an  important  piece  to  the  puzzle  of  what  happened  to  the  submarine.  A  chemical  bath  will  peel  away  the  final  layer  of  sediment  that  covers  the  exterior  of  the  well-constructed  hull  and  the  Hunley's  interior.What  we  know  about  the  doomed  crew"You  are  going  to  be  blown  away.  You  are  going  to  look  at  the  face  of  the  submarine  for  the  first  time,"  says  Paul  Mardikian,  the  project's  senior  conservator.Already,  the  Hunley  impresses  visitors  who  gaze  down  to  a  90,000-gallon  freshwater  conservation  tank.  Dive  planes  and  remnants  of  other  submarine  components,  including  ballast  tanks,  are  evidence  of  the  innovation  and  care  of  the  sub's  designers  and  builders.Patrons  at  the  Warren  Lasch  Conservation  Center  also  see  the  encrusted  sediment,  known  as  concretion  --  a  mix  of  sand  and  remains  of  sea  life  --  that  Mardikian  likens  to  a  "black  box."By  removing  the  material,  he  says,  researchers  will  be  able  to  do  more  precise  analysis  of  holes  in  the  hull  and  its  condition,  the  Hunley's  speed  and  performance  in  the  Atlantic  Ocean  and  whether  gunfire  from  the  USS  Housatonic,  its  target,  contributed  to  the  submarine's  demise."If  the  submarine  was  hit  by  a  bullet,  you  should  be  able  to  see  that  in  the  metal,"  says  the  conservator.By  combining  new  findings  with  previous  study,  including  that  of  the  remains  of  the  crew,  experts  believe  they  will  be  able  to  tell  the  complete  story  of  what  happened  to  the  Hunley,  which  was  brought  to  the  surface  amid  much  fanfare  in  August  2000."I  am  confident  this  is  all  going  to  fall  into  place,"  says  Mardikian.But  don't  be  surprised  if  everything  falling  into  place  won't  result  in  a  "smoking  gun"  that  points  to  a  single  cause."There  may  be  several  things  (factors)  happening  at  the  same  time,"  according  to  Mardikian.Archaeologist  Michael  Scafuri  says  the  team  is  trying  to  ascertain  the  truth  of  what  happened  that  chilly  night  a  few  miles  offshore  from  Charleston.  But  there  are  no  guarantees."It  is  like  detective  work  --  with  a  really  cold  case."'Curious'  submarine  a  danger  to  its  crews,  tooThe  cold  case  begins  in  Mobile,  Alabama,  where  the  Hunley  was  built  for  the  Confederate  government.The  40-foot  vessel,  described  as  "curious"  looking  and  resembling  a  whale,  had  watertight  hatches,  two  short  conning  towers,  sea  cocks,  pumps  and  ballast  tanks.But  there  were  shortcomings.  There  was  constant  concern  about  a  sufficient  oxygen  supply  for  the  crew,  which  limited  its  dive  time.  The  captain  had  a  difficult  time  monitoring  certain  movements.The  Hunley  was  dependent  on  the  crew  hand-turning  a  crank  to  power  the  single  propeller.  Batteries  and  a  steam-powered  engine  proved  impractical  for  the  submersible."We  don't  know  how  real  well  the  submarine  functioned,"  says  Scafuri.  "This  is  a  case  where  they  settled  on  what  would  work.  That  was  hand  power."Confederate  officials  ordered  the  Hunley  to  Charleston,  where  it  and  other  ships  prepared  to  challenge  a  blockade  of  the  harbor.  The  Federal  Navy  had  deprived  the  Southern  city  of  vital  military  supplies.The  Union  fleet  was  well  aware  of  the  Hunley's  danger  --  to  its  own  occupants.Five  members  of  the  first  crew  died  in  August  1863  when  it  accidentally  dived  while  its  hatches  apparently  were  open.  The  second  crew's  eight  members  succumbed  in  October  when  the  Hunley  failed  to  return  to  the  surface.The  Confederate  commander  of  Charleston,  concerned  about  the  loss  of  life  and  the  expense  of  recovering  the  Hunley,  ordered  that  any  attack  be  made  on  the  surface.  Still,  the  vessel  would  be  mostly  under  the  water  line  during  an  attack.Still,  those  who  volunteered  for  the  mission  against  the  205-foot  USS  Housatonic  must  have  been  well  aware  of  the  perils  when  approached  by  Hunley  skipper  Lt.  George  Dixon."This  took  some  serious  bravery  here.  I  wouldn't  want  to  go  in  there,"  says  forensic  genealogist  Linda  Abrams,  who  has  conducted  extensive  research  on  the  Hunley  crew.  "They  know  some  other  people  had  drowned  in  it.  They  had  to  have  some  faith  in  Dixon."Dixon  and  his  courageous  crew,  which  included  four  European-born  men,  would  target  the  Housatonic,  the  closest  blockade  ship.Dixon  routinely  kept  a  worn  good-luck  charm  in  his  pocket:  A  gold  coin  that  was  bent  when  he  was  wounded  nearly  two  years  before  at  the  Battle  of  Shiloh  in  Tennessee.In  2001,  the  shiny  talisman  was  found  in  the  laboratory,  along  with  Dixon's  presumed  remains.  Only  one  crew  member  has  been  positively  identified  through  DNA  tests.Menacing  object  approaches  wary  shipOn  a  chilly  February  evening  150  years  ago,  the  Hunley  set  out  from  Breach  Inlet,  which  separates  Sullivan's  Island  and  what  is  now  called  the  Isle  of  Palms.  The  vessel  churned  toward  the  Housatonic,  about  4  miles  away,  at  an  estimated  speed  of  2  to  4  knots.One  of  the  crew  members  would  have  been  in  charge  of  bellows,  providing  sufficient  air  to  breathe  when  the  hatches  were  closed.Friends  of  the  Hunley,  a  nonprofit  group  established  by  South  Carolina's  Hunley  Commission,  provides  a  history  of  the  mission  on  its  website."While  the  cold  bit  through  the  lookout's  coat  ...  men  poured  sweat  over  hand  cranks  that  powered  a  spinning  propeller  while  their  captain  manned  the  dive  planes  --  steering  man,  iron,  anxiety  and  raw  courage  towards  its  final  destination.""A  lookout  aboard  the  Union  Navy's  largest  ship  was  tired,  cold  --  but  restless.  Talk  of  a  Confederate  secret  weapon  was  in  and  out  of  his  thoughts.  Suddenly  he  spotted  something  move  in  the  chilly  waters.  A  porpoise?  There  were  certainly  a  lot  of  them  around.  But  something  about  this  one  didn't  seem  right."Alarms  went  out  on  the  Housatonic,  which  carried  12  guns.The  Hunley  was  too  close  and  low  to  be  hit  by  artillery  fire,  so  crew  and  officers  of  the  Union  ship  fired  small  arms,  rifles  and  even  a  shotgun  at  the  approaching  menace.Once  in  place,  a  submarine  crew  member  managed  to  pull  the  lanyard  for  the  135-pound  torpedo,  attached  to  a  16-foot  spar  that  was  still  connected  to  the  Hunley's  bow.The  Housatonic  sank  within  minutes.Five  members  of  the  Union  vessel  died;  150  others  were  rescued.All  kinds  of  scenarios  for  loss  of  HunleyA  Union  sailor  who  climbed  to  the  Housatonic's  rigging  and  a  Confederate  observer  on  the  shore  reported  seeing  a  blue  light  emanating  from  the  Hunley,  signaling  mission  accomplished."That  indicates  someone  was  conscious  after  the  sinking  of  the  Housatonic,"  says  Robert  Neyland,  head  of  underwater  archaeology  for  the  Naval  History  and  Heritage  Command  and  former  director  of  the  Hunley  Project.But  researchers  have  been  unable  to  precisely  pinpoint  the  source  of  the  light  --  whether  it  came  from  a  lantern  or  pyrotechnic  device  that  sent  out  various  signal  colors.  And  it's  possible  the  light  came  from  Union  rescuers.Experts  looked  at  the  Hunley's  lantern,  but  found  no  evidence  of  blue  glass."I  think  it  was  just  Dixon's  flashlight,  to  be  honest,"  says  Mardikian,  the  conservator.One  scenario  holds  that  the  Hunley  was  swamped  by  or  struck  by  a  Union  vessel.  Or  that  it  plunged  to  the  sea  floor  to  avoid  detection,  and  never  made  it  back  up.  A  latch  on  the  forward  conning  tower  was  found  to  be  not  properly  locked.In  January  2013,  Hunley  scientists,  who  work  for  the  Clemson  University  Restoration  Institute,  reported  a  significant  discovery."Until  now,  the  conventional  wisdom  has  been  the  Hunley  would  ram  the  spar  torpedo  into  her  target  and  then  back  away,  causing  the  torpedo  to  slip  off  the  spar,"  they  said  in  a  statement.Instead,  research  showed  the  submarine  was  less  than  20  feet  from  her  torpedo  when  it  exploded."There  is  overwhelming  evidence  to  indicate  this  was  not  a  suicide  mission.  The  crew  no  doubt  knew  the  dangers  facing  them,  but  still,  they  hoped  to  make  it  back  home.  They  must  have  believed  this  was  a  safe  enough  distance  to  escape  any  harm,"  says  South  Carolina  Lt.  Gov.  Glenn  McConnell,  head  of  the  Hunley  Commission.It's  possible  that  the  force  of  the  explosion  incapacitated  the  crew,  eventually  causing  the  sub  to  slide  down  into  the  chilly  depths.  Even  a  small  hole  or  holes  could  have  allowed  water  to  seep  or  pour  in."Everything  we  have  tried  to  explain  (as  to)  how  the  submarine  worked,  we  were  naïve  in  our  approach,"  says  Mardikian.Researchers  at  the  lab,  while  excavating  the  sub's  interior  silt  that  held  the  the  human  remains,  found  the  eight  Hunley  crew  members  were  still  at  or  near  their  stations,  despite  an  unsealed  forward  hatch."We  don't  see  evidence  of  anyone  trying  to  get  out  of  the  submarine.  It  could  have  been  something  catastrophic  or  they  died  with  a  certain  amount  of  resignation,"  Neyland  says.Detailed  examinations  of  the  well-preserved  remains  of  the  crew  looked  for  the  tiniest  of  fractures  or  evidence  of  concussion.  "We  did  not  find  any  unhealed  injuries  to  their  skeletons,"  says  Scafuri,  the  Hunley  Project  archeologist.The  team  is  still  gathering  and  analyzing  data  on  the  physics  and  effects  of  the  detonation  on  the  Hunley  and  its  doomed  crew,  he  says.  It  also  continues  to  analyze  the  source  of  holes  in  the  hull,  possibly  from  battle  damage  or  exposure  to  currents  and  underwater  conditions.Ongoing  efforts  to  learn  more  about  sub,  crewIn  1995,  the  Hunley  was  finally  located  by  a  group  led  by  author  Clive  Cussler.  It  rested  in  several  feet  of  silt,  largely  protected  from  strong  currents  and  the  most  corrosive  effects  of  saltwater.  The  environment,  mostly  free  of  oxygen,  left  the  skeletal  remains  and  artifacts  in  amazing  condition.The  submarine  was  brought  to  the  surface  five  years  later  and  was  quickly  placed  back  in  protective  water  at  the  Lasch  laboratory.The  federal  and  South  Carolina  governments  have  contributed  an  estimated  $9  million  or  so  between  them  on  the  recovery,  lab  and  research.  The  Hunley,  considered  a  spoil  of  war,  is  the  property  of  the  U.S.  Navy.About  40,000  visitors  a  year  marvel  at  the  Hunley,  see  exhibits  and  peer  at  facial  reconstructions  of  the  crew  members.Researchers  found  personal  artifacts,  including  a  wallet,  watch,  bandana,  matchsticks  and  remains  of  tobacco  pipes.One  mystery  was  answered  relatively  early  in  the  excavation  and  conservation  process."They  didn't  know  whether  these  guys  had  escaped  and  tried  to  swim  to  shore,"  genealogist  Abrams  says  of  the  Hunley  crew.  "Or  whether  they  had  been  taken  captive.  There  was  no  concrete  knowledge  that  they  were  still  inside."Inside  the  sub,  scientists  found  human  hair,  complete  skeletons  and  skulls  of  eight  people  --  debunking  one  part  of  the  legend  that  held  that  nine  men  were  on  board.Abrams  has  spent  years  trying  to  learn  more  about  the  crew.  She  has  learned  a  great  deal,  but  is  hampered  by  the  fact  that  only  one  is  known  to  have  married  and  have  children.  And  there  are  no  known  photographs  of  any.Kellen  Correia,  executive  director  of  Friends  of  the  Hunley,  says  she  expects  a  permanent  museum  to  be  built  around  the  end  of  the  decade,  with  expanded  days  of  operation,  instead  of  the  current  weekends.For  the  anniversary  of  the  attack,  the  first  150  visitors  on  Saturday  and  Sunday  receive  free  replicas  of  Lt.  Dixon's  gold  coin,  which  is  on  permanent  display.  Admission  on  Monday,  the  actual  anniversary,  is  $1.50,  compared  to  the  normal  $12  ticket.Abrams,  the  genealogist,  was  to  share  her  latest  research  on  the  crew  at  a  $50  Saturday  evening  reception.At  7  p.m.  Monday  --  timed  to  the  hour  the  Hunley  was  making  its  way  toward  the  Housatonic  --  a  memorial  service  will  be  held  at  Sunrise  Presbyterian  Church  near  Breach  Inlet  for  those  killed  on  both  warships.  Participants  will  then  drop  flowers  into  the  water  in  remembrance.Correia  is  accustomed  to  debates  over  the  Hunley's  demise."I  love  that  it  engages  people,"  she  says.  "You  know  why  the  Titanic  went  down.  With  this,  you  don't  have  that  known  factor."Piece  of  Civil  War  ironclad  brought  to  surfaceWhat  caused  the  HMS  Bounty  to  go  down?Booty  from  Blackbeard's  sunken  ship:  Five  huge  cannonsGhostly  underwater  art  gallery  breathes  new  life  to  sunken  ship</TEXT></DOC>

Authorities  don't  know  where  the  plane  is  or  what  happened  to  it.  Here  are  answers  to  22  of  the  most  frequently  asked  questions  about  this  baffling  disappearance:Where  the  devil  is  this  plane?At  this  point,  it's  anyone's  guess.  The  official  search  area  covers  35,000  square  miles  now,  including  parts  of  the  Gulf  of  Thailand,  South  China  Sea,  Strait  of  Malacca  and  the  Andaman  Sea.  If  there's  anything  to  a  Wall  Street  Journal  report  that  the  plane  flew  on  another  four  hours  after  losing  contact,  it  could  be  hundreds  or  even  thousands  of  miles  beyond  that  --  an  area  stretching  from  India  all  the  way  to  Australia.  If  that's  the  case,  only  the  luckiest  of  breaks  would  turn  up  the  missing  plane.  "This  is  simply  too  big  an  area  to  even  contemplate  searching,"  CNN's  Tom  Foreman  said  Thursday.Did  it  go  off  course?Possibly,  but  not  certainly.  Some  accounts  have  placed  the  aircraft  hundreds  of  miles  from  its  expected  flight  path  to  Beijing,  and  authorities  have  expanded  the  search  area  to  include  that  possibility.  But  they're  also  still  searching  areas  along  the  flight  path.  A  big  problem  is  that  the  plane's  identifying  transponder  wasn't  working,  making  radar  determinations  more  difficult.  International  experts  are  reviewing  Malaysian  radar  data  in  hopes  of  helping  pin  down  where  the  plane  may  have  gone.What  is  a  transponder?It's  a  radio  transmitter  in  the  cockpit  that  works  with  ground  radar.  When  it  receives  a  radar  signal,  it  returns  a  code  with  the  aircraft's  position,  altitude  and  call  sign.  Air  traffic  controllers  use  the  signals  to  determine  a  plane's  speed  and  direction.Why  did  it  stop  working?That's  one  of  many  million-dollar  questions.  The  transponder  is  situated  between  the  pilots  and  can  be  disabled  with  a  twist  of  the  wrist,  but  former  airline  captain  Mark  Weiss  said  that  because  of  the  vital  information  --  and  thus,  protection  --  the  transponder  provides,  it's  highly  unlikely  a  pilot  would  turn  it  off.  Without  the  cockpit  voice  recorder  and  flight  data  recorder,  it's  difficult  to  say  who  was  in  the  cockpit  and  exactly  what  happened,  Weiss  said.  Experts  also  give  conflicting  opinions:  While  one  expert  says  the  circumstances  point  to  someone  --  perhaps  a  hijacker  --  deliberately  turning  the  plane  around,  another  says  a  catastrophic  power  failure  could  explain  the  anomalies.What  about  the  plane's  "black  box?"Searchers  would  desperately  love  to  get  their  hands  on  it.  The  device,  known  as  a  flight  data  recorder,  would  have  details  on  what  was  going  on  in  the  cockpit  before  the  plane  disappeared  and  all  sorts  of  technical  data  about  what  the  plane  was  doing  and  how  it  was  performing.  The  problem  is  that  the  devices  don't  broadcast  their  position  over  a  large  area,  said  science  educator  Bill  Nye.  So  until  searchers  can  narrow  down  their  search  for  the  plane,  the  data  recorders  won't  help  resolve  the  mystery.Was  anything  else  sending  data  on  the  plane?According  to  aviation  experts,  Boeing  777-200  models  like  the  missing  aircraft  can  automatically  send  data  in  two  ways.  A  system  call  ACARS,  or  Aircraft  Communications  Addressing  and  Reporting  System,  can  send  bursts  of  information  from  text  messages  to  engine  data.  And  a  newer  positioning  system  called  AVS-B  can  send  automated  positioning  information,  as  well.  Flight  370  was  equipped  with  such  a  system,  according  to  science  writer  Jeff  Wise,  who  writes  on  aviation  issues.  According  to  Malaysian  authorities,  nothing  on  the  plane  was  transmitting  after  1:07  a.m.  Saturday.But  didn't  the  Wall  Street  Journal  say  the  plane  had  sent  out  engine  data  for  hours?Yes.  Malaysian  officials  say  there's  nothing  to  that  report,  and  a  senior  aviation  source  with  extensive  knowledge  of  the  matter  told  CNN's  Richard  Quest  that  the  newspaper's  account  was  wrong.  The  source  told  Quest  the  plane  was  not  sending  engine  data  as  the  newspaper  had  reported.Could  the  plane  have  landed  someplace?One  theory  U.S.  officials  are  considering,  according  to  that  Wall  Street  Journal  report,  is  that  someone  might  have  taken  the  plane  to  be  used  for  some  other  purpose  later.  So  it's  theoretically  possible  that  the  plane  could  have  landed  at  some  remote  air  strip  where  it's  being  hidden.  But  there  are  some  big  holes  in  that  theory.  The  777  is  a  big  plane.  It  requires,  at  minimum,  nearly  a  mile  to  land.  And,  says  Quest,  there's  the  matter  of  getting  it  someplace  without  setting  off  alarm  bells.  "You  can't  just  fly  a  Triple  7  and  not  have  a  radar  trace,"  he  said.Couldn't  a  pilot  just  "fly  under  the  radar"?Again,  theoretically.  Being  a  tool  to  watch  the  sky,  radar  doesn't  reach  all  the  way  to  the  ground.  Military  pilots  are  trained  to  take  advantage  of  this  when  they  need  to  sneak  into  a  country  undetected.  But  those  aircraft  also  have  terrain-evading  radar  and  other  features  meant  to  help  fighter  and  helicopter  pilots  hug  the  ground,  noted  aviation  consultant  Keith  Wolzinger  of  the  Spectrum  Group.  Understandably,  Boeing  doesn't  offer  that  feature  on  its  commercial  airliners.  "Airline  pilots  are  not  trained  for  radar  avoidance,"  said  Wolzinger,  himself  a  former  777  pilot.  "We  like  to  be  on  radar."  Also,  unlike  military  craft,  civilian  airliners  don't  have  gear  to  detect  when  they've  been  spotted  on  radar.  So  any  effort  to  go  undetected  would  be  difficult  and  undoubtedly  harrowing.How  does  the  search  work?Authorities  break  huge  swaths  of  Earth  into  much  smaller  grids.  Then,  planes  or  ships  scour  the  grids  to  eliminate  them  as  candidates  for  the  crash  site.  As  of  Thursday,  43  ships  and  40  planes  from  a  dozen  countries  were  involved.  The  grids  are  massive  and  make  up  35,000  square  miles  of  land  and  sea,  including  the  southern  tip  of  Vietnam,  South  Thailand,  about  half  of  Malaysia  and  parts  of  the  South  China  Sea,  Gulf  of  Thailand  and  Strait  of  Malacca.What  about  those  Chinese  satellite  photos?On  Wednesday,  China  released  satellite  images  from  a  spot  in  the  South  China  Sea  that  appeared  to  show  large  objects  floating  in  the  water  Sunday,  a  day  after  the  disappearance.  Search  crews  checked  the  location  and  found  no  trace  of  wreckage.  China  later  said  releasing  the  photos  was  a  mistake  and  the  images  weren't  related  to  the  plane.Could  'crowdsourcing'  help  find  the  plane?Ostensibly,  sure.  Colorado  firm  DigitalGlobe  has  one  of  the  most  advanced  commercial  satellite  networks,  and  its  images  of  the  Strait  of  Malacca  and  Gulf  of  Thailand  can  capture  details  as  small  as  a  baseball  field's  home  plate,  the  longest  side  of  which  is  17  inches.  Volunteers  can  flag  anything  they  find  interesting,  but  so  many  answered  the  call  this  week  that  the  firm's  website  crashed.  (The  website  appeared  to  be  up  Wednesday.)  Also,  there's  the  troubling  size  of  the  search  area.Is  this  the  first  time  a  plane  has  vanished?No,  it's  happened  occasionally,  and  some  have  disappeared  under  mysterious  circumstances.  Perhaps  none  was  as  a  tricky  as  Air  France  447,  which  went  down  after  departing  Rio  de  Janeiro  on  June  1,  2009.  It  took  four  searches  and  almost  two  years  before  the  bulk  of  the  wreckage  and  majority  of  bodies  were  recovered.  The  voice  and  data  recorders  weren't  found  on  the  ocean  floor  until  May  2011.How  does  a  plane  disappear?There's  no  simple  answer  here,  especially  when  you  consider  the  bevy  of  technology  on  a  state-of-the-art  jetliner,  which  includes  UHF  and  VHF  radios,  automatic  beacons,  GPS  and  computer  communications  systems.  It  doesn't  help  that  Flight  370's  flight  path  is  unclear  and  that  the  search  areas  include  vast  waters  and  sparsely  populated  jungles  and  mountains.Were  the  pilots  experienced?The  short  answer  is  yes.  Fariq  Ab  Hamid,  27,  joined  Malaysia  Airlines  in  2007  and  was  first  officer  on  the  flight.  He  has  2,763  flying  hours  and  was  transitioning  to  the  Boeing  777-200  after  finishing  training  in  a  flight  simulator.  The  pilot,  Capt.  Zaharie  Ahmad  Shah,  53,  has  18,365  flying  hours.  He  joined  the  airline  in  1981.There  are  reports  that  Hamid  let  passengers  in  the  cockpit  on  another  flight?  Is  that  legal?Jonti  Roos  has  told  several  media  outlets  that  Hamid  invited  her  and  a  friend  into  the  cockpit  for  most  of  a  2011  flight  from  Thailand  to  Malaysia.  While  this  would  be  a  strict  violation  of  U.S.  regulations  put  in  place  after  the  9/11  attacks,  the  legality  would  vary  from  country  to  country.  Upon  learning  of  Roos'  claim,  Malaysia  Airlines  said  it  was  "shocked,"  while  former  U.S.  Federal  Aviation  Administration  chief  of  staff  Michael  Goldfarb  said  such  behavior  by  a  pilot  "just  violates  every  code  of  conduct."Is  foul  play  possible?  Hijackers?  Terrorism?The  CIA  and  FBI  aren't  ruling  it  out,  but  to  be  fair,  authorities  aren't  ruling  out  much  at  this  point.  It's  highly  suspicious  that  the  plane  may  have  turned  around.  Those  suspicions  are  further  fueled  by  the  loss  of  communication  with  the  plane,  considering  the  aircraft  had  "redundant  electrical  systems"  that  would  have  to  be  disabled.  Robert  Francis,  former  vice  chairman  of  the  U.S.  National  Transportation  Safety  Board,  said  his  first  thought  upon  hearing  the  circumstances  of  the  flight's  mysterious  disappearance  was  that  it  blew  up,  but  even  then,  an  explosion  would  not  be  hard-and-fast  evidence  of  terrorism.What  about  those  passengers  with  stolen  passports?Interpol  says  it  has  identified  the  men  as  Iranians  Pouri  Nourmohammadi,  18,  and  Delavar  Seyed  Mohammad  Reza,  29,  and  Malaysian  investigators  say  neither  of  them  has  any  apparent  connection  to  terrorist  organizations.  Stolen  passports  certainly  aren't  indicative  of  terrorism.  In  fact,  Interpol  says  passengers  flew  without  having  their  travel  documents  checked  against  its  lost-and-stolen  passport  database  more  than  a  billion  times  in  2013.  Among  the  reasons  someone  might  use  a  stolen  passport:  to  immigrate  illegally  to  another  country,  to  import  goods  without  being  taxed  or  to  smuggle  stolen  goods,  people,  drugs  or  weapons.What  about  pilot  error?Certainly  possible.  That's  what  the  investigation  showed  happened  with  the  2009  Air  France  flight,  though  there  was  an  element  of  mechanical  failure  as  well.  In  that  case,  though,  there  was  also  inclement  weather  --  not  the  case  with  Flight  370.  As  of  Wednesday,  nothing  suggests  that  pilot  error  played  a  role  in  the  flight's  disappearance.So,  could  mechanical  failure  explain  it?It's  one  of  the  stronger  possibilities.  The  absence  so  far  of  any  debris  field  could  suggest  the  pilot  had  to  make  an  emergency  landing  on  water  and  the  plane  later  sank  into  the  sea,  but  there  is  still  the  mystery  of  the  distress  signal.  There's  wasn't  one.  However,  aviation  consultant  Kit  Darby  has  said  that  it's  possible  there  was  a  power  problem,  and  the  backup  power  lasted  only  an  hour  and  the  pilot  attempted  to  turn  back  to  "the  airports  and  a  region  he  knows."  There's  also  the  possibility  of  a  tail  or  wing  ripping  off.  This  particular  Boeing  suffered  a  clipped  wingtip  in  the  past,  but  Boeing  repaired  it.  Another  frightening  possibility  is  that  a  window  or  door  failed,  which  would  allow  ambient  temperatures  of  60  degrees  below  zero  into  the  cabin,  creating  a  freezing  fog  and  giving  crew  members  only  seconds  to  don  oxygen  masks  before  they  were  disoriented  and  then  incapacitated.Could  it  have  been  hit  by  a  meteor?There  was  a  known  meteor  in  the  area  at  takeoff,  but  this  seems  to  be  atop  a  list  of  strange  conspiracy  theories  popping  up  in  the  absence  of  empirical  data  explaining  the  plane's  disappearance.  Given  what  little  is  known  about  the  flight  path,  it  seems  like  a  long,  long  shot  that  a  meteor  is  to  blame.What  about  reports  that  passengers'  cell  phones  continued  operating  after  the  flight's  disappearance?Please  see  the  earlier  question  about  meteors  and  conspiracy  theories.  When  phones  are  disabled  or  turned  off  --  which  would  presumably  happen  after  a  plane  crash  --  calls  to  those  cell  phones  don't  ring,  but  go  directly  to  voice  mail.  Friends  and  loved  ones  of  the  missing  passengers,  however,  reported  ringing  when  they  called.  Technology  industry  analyst  Jeff  Kagan  says  a  call  would  first  connect  to  a  network  before  trying  to  find  the  end  user,  and  the  ringing  sound  callers  hear  masks  the  silence  they  would  otherwise  hear  while  waiting  for  the  connection  to  be  made.  "If  it  doesn't  find  the  phone  after  a  few  minutes,  after  a  few  rings,  then  typically,  it  disconnects,  and  that's  what's  happening,"  he  said.READ:  Officials  dispute  report  that  Malaysia  Airlines  Flight  370  kept  flying  for  hoursINTERACTIVE:  What  happened  to  Malaysia  Airlines  Flight  370?READ:  Transponder's  fate  may  prove  key  to  solving  Malaysia  Airlines  puzzleREAD:  Malaysia  Airlines  Flight  370:  Days  pass,  no  word  of  loved  ones</TEXT></DOC>

Ivan  Lopez,  who  ended  his  life  after  killing  three  people  at  the  Fort  Hood,  Texas,  military  base  Wednesday,  was  undergoing  diagnostic  procedures  for  post-traumatic  stress  disorder,  according  to  Lt.  Gen  Mark  Milley,  Fort  Hood's  commanding  general.He  was  also  receiving  a  variety  of  treatments  for  conditions  including  depression,  anxiety  and  sleep  disturbances,  Army  Secretary  John  McHugh  told  the  Senate  Armed  Services  Committee  Thursday.Lopez  did  not  receive  a  diagnosis  of  PTSD,  but  the  incident  puts  the  condition  in  the  spotlight.A  big  challenge  in  helping  veterans  with  PTSD  is  the  amount  of  time  that  passes  before  a  diagnosis,  which  can  be  three  to  four  months,  said  Terry  Lyles,  a  stress  coach  in  Miami  who  has  worked  with  PTSD  patients  and  is  a  civilian  contractor  with  the  Department  of  Defense.In  the  general  population,  PTSD  is  diagnosed  right  away,  but  in  the  military  there  are  bureaucratic  holdups  before  a  diagnosis  is  officially  given,  he  said.  "The  system  itself  gets  bogged  down."White  House  press  secretary  Jay  Carney  said  Thursday  that  more  needs  to  be  done  to  support  military  veterans  and  their  families.  "We  need  to  be  very  mindful  in  this  country  that  even  as  those  wars  end,  what  we  owe  our  veterans  does  not  end,"  he  said.Here  are  facts  you  should  know  about  PTSD:Fort  Hood  shooter  was  Iraq  vet  being  treated  for  mental  health  issues1.  What  is  PSTD?It's  natural  to  experience  fear  in  dangerous  situations.  But  people  with  PTSD  may  behave  as  though  they  are  under  attack  when  there  is  no  real  imminent  threat.A  person  who  suffers  PTSD  typically  re-experiences  the  trauma  through  flashbacks  and  nightmares,  experiences  that  can  seem  as  real  as  the  actual  trauma.  The  person  often  feels  intensely  that  the  trauma  could  happen  again  at  any  time.Thoughts  and  feelings  can  trigger  symptoms,  but  so  can  words,  situations  or  objects  that  remind  the  person  of  a  traumatic  situation.National  Institutes  of  Health:  PTSD2.  How  common  is  it?Anyone  who  has  experienced  a  life-threatening  situation  can  develop  PTSD,  according  to  Dr.  Stephen  J.  Cozza,  a  professor  of  psychiatry  at  the  Uniformed  Services  University  of  the  Health  Sciences.Although  over  the  course  of  a  lifetime,  many  people  have  extremely  distressing  or  threatening  experiences,  only  a  small  percentage  will  experience  PTSD,  experts  say.  The  range  of  responses  is  largely  based  on  the  amount  of  exposure  to  the  stressor,  said  Cozza.  Most  studies  examining  the  rate  of  PTSD  in  service  members  put  the  rates  at  about  15%  to  20%.Thirty  percent  of  service  members  who  have  fought  in  Iraq  or  Afghanistan  have  been  diagnosed  with  PTSD,  according  to  a  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  study.The  nonprofit  think-tank  RAND  Corporation  estimates  a  third  of  veterans  likely  have  some  type  of  traumatic  brain  injury,  PTSD  or  depression,  which  puts  the  overall  number  affected  at  around  600,000."We  need  to  remember  that  while  substantial  numbers  of  vets  have  mental  health  conditions,"  the  majority  do  not,  Cozza  said."We  don't  want  to  stigmatize  our  vets,  because  many  of  them  are  not  ill,"  he  said.  "As  an  organization  and  as  a  community,  the  military  has  varying  levels  of  health  and  risk.  There  are  more  services  for  mental  health  care  in  the  military  than  there  has  ever  been  before."What  is  war's  true  toll?  The  Uncounted3.  What  causes  PTSD?Experiencing  any  kind  of  trauma  or  dangerous  event  --  including  seeing  people  harmed  or  killed  or  personally  getting  injured  --  raises  the  risk  for  PTSD.  A  history  of  mental  illness  also  makes  PTSD  more  likely,  as  does  a  lack  of  social  support  after  a  traumatic  event  and  enduring  additional  stress  in  its  aftermath.Scientists  are  looking  at  the  role  of  genes  that  are  involved  in  the  creation  of  fear  memories.  There  are  also  neuroscientists  investigating  brain  differences  in  people  who  have  PTSD.Genes  and  brain  structural  differences  may  raise  a  person's  risk  for  the  condition  without  causing  symptoms,  according  to  the  National  Institutes  of  Health.  The  early  growth  of  the  brain  may  be  affected  by  environmental  factors  or  a  history  of  mental  illness.3.  Do  other  mental  illnesses  make  it  worse?Other  problems  such  as  depression  and  insomnia  that  a  veteran  may  have  had  before  deployment  are  magnified  with  PTSD,  Lyles  said."It  does  not  help  itself,"  he  said.  "It's  kind  of  like  a  pinball  that  gets  trapped  inside  a  machine  that  can't  get  out  and  just  continues  to  ping  around.  You  try  to  live  your  life  as  normal  as  possible  but  it's  always  present."4.  How  is  it  diagnosed  in  the  military?A  typical  PTSD  screening  would  be  a  well-structured  diagnostic  interview,  and  a  few  other  tests,  lasting  about  two  hours,  said  Michael  Telch,  psychology  professor  at  the  University  of  Texas  at  Austin.During  the  debriefing  process  from  the  U.S.  military,  returning  soldiers  go  through  an  interview  and  other  evaluations  that  may  indicate  PTSD,  Lyles  said.  If  there  is  reason  to  suspect  PTSD,  the  veteran  then  goes  for  a  full  medical  evaluation  that  involves  PTSD  testing.There  is  generally  not  a  big  lag  time  to  make  a  medical  diagnosis  after  the  two-hour  interview,  Telch  said.However,  it  can  take  months  before  the  diagnosis  is  officially  recognized  by  the  military,  Lyles  said.Many  cases  of  PTSD  go  undetected  because  some  view  the  condition  as  a  sign  of  weakness.  Some  also  don't  want  to  go  through  the  extra  battery  of  tests  when  they  return  home,  he  said."Many  of  these  individuals  fall  through  the  cracks,"  Lyles  said.5.  Do  people  with  PTSD  pose  an  increased  risk  of  violence  to  themselves  or  others?Having  PTSD  does  not  mean  that  a  person  will  be  violent.  But  certain  sounds,  images  and  smells  can  trigger  alarming  memories  to  a  person  with  the  condition,  and  they  react  as  if  they  were  in  the  midst  of  war."Reality  becomes  skewed  because  you've  been  trained  to  be  violent,"  Lyles  said.  "So  it's  really  hard  to  shut  that  out."PTSD  is  not  only  about  fear  and  anxiety.  Patients  may  experience  other  kinds  of  emotional  disturbances,  and  violence  may  be  a  way  that  they  respond."Coping  with  strong  feelings  of  anger,  shame  or  guilt  can  be  played  out  in  terms  of  violent  behavior,"  Telch  said.Iraq  and  Afghanistan  veterans  who  struggle  with  anger  are  twice  as  likely  as  other  vets  to  be  arrested  for  crimes,  according  to  the  Journal  of  Consulting  and  Clinical  Psychology,  which  published  a  study  last  year.The  study,  conducted  by  the  University  of  North  Carolina-Chapel  Hill  School  of  Medicine,  examined  1,388  combat  veterans.  Researchers  found  that  about  23%  of  those  with  PTSD  and  high  irritability  had  been  arrested  for  criminal  offenses.But  researchers  also  found  that  other  factors  unrelated  to  military  service  --  including  growing  up  around  violence  or  drug  abuse  --  were  factors  behind  why  some  vets  committed  crimes.6.  Does  this  impact  veterans'  performance  in  the  workplace,  after  they  leave  the  service?Employers  sometimes  cite  PTSD  as  a  reason  for  not  hiring  veterans,  because  of  public  misunderstanding,  former  President  George  W.  Bush  said  in  February  at  the  George  W.  Bush  Library  Military  Service  Initiative.  The  condition,  he  said,  is  mislabeled  as  a  "disorder.""Employers  would  not  hesitate  to  hire  an  employee  getting  treated  for  a  medical  condition  like  diabetes  or  high  blood  pressure,  and  they  should  not  hesitate  to  hire  veterans  getting  treated  for  post-traumatic  stress,"  Bush  said.A  person  who  has  been  successful  in  treatment  should  be  able  to  function  in  the  workplace,  Telch  said.  But  without  treatment,  symptoms  can  be  severe,  and  impair  functioning  at  work,  in  social  situations  and  in  the  family.8.  How  do  people  with  PTSD  come  back  to  normal?Exposure  therapy  often  helps  the  person  with  PTSD  revisit  or  re-experience  their  trauma  as  a  means  of  lessening  the  effect  the  memory  has  on  them,  said  Dr.  Albert  "Skip"  Rizzo,  a  psychiatrist  who  works  with  the  military  and  has  pioneered  use  of  virtual  reality  for  treating  PTSD.This  kind  of  therapy  has  been  around  for  years.  Typically  a  therapist  would  ask  someone  to  imagine  they  are  experiencing  their  trauma  again.  This  would  happen  repeatedly,  and  ideally,  with  each  retelling  of  what  happened,  the  event  would  seem  gradually  less  threatening.Rizzo,  who  is  with  the  Institute  for  Creative  Technologies  at  the  University  of  Southern  California,  and  other  experts  have  employed  virtual  reality  for  this  purpose.  Patients  wear  goggles  and  describe  their  experiences  while  a  technician  stands  by  with  a  console  changing  the  scene  to  fit  the  patient's  description.If  the  patient  recalls  hearing  a  young  boy's  voice,  for  instance,  the  technician  makes  that  happen.  If  the  patient  experienced  the  trauma  at  night  or  in  the  daytime,  or  perhaps  was  involved  in  an  IED  explosion,  those  circumstances  will  be  created  in  the  virtual  world."We  can  begin  to  pace  the  exposure  in  a  very  evocative  fashion,"  Rizzo  said."This  works  because  some  people  don't  engage  in  the  trauma  memory  at  a  sufficient  level.  They  don't  engage  fully  with  their  imagination  to  confront  difficult  memories."A  therapy  that  uses  similar  principles  is  called  cognitive  processing  therapy.  It  helps  patients  become  aware  of  their  thoughts  and  feelings  and  learn  how  to  deal  with  changes  in  beliefs  from  before  and  after  trauma.Some  patients  also  benefit  from  medication.9.

His  goal:  eliminating  the  use  of  cigarettes  and  tobacco.In  1964,  when  Dr.  Luther  Terry  released  the  first  surgeon  general's  report,  the  public  learned  smoking  causes  lung  cancer.  At  the  time,  42%  of  American  adults  smoked,  Lushniak  says.Since  then,  "Tobacco  has  killed  more  than  20  million  people  prematurely,"  says  Dr.  Thomas  Frieden,  director  of  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention,  in  the  forward  to  the  new  report.The  number  of  smokers  has  dropped  to  18%  in  2012,  according  to  the  latest  estimates  published  Thursday  by  the  CDC.But  "that  still  translates  into  45  million  people,  including  3  million  kids,"  Lushniak  says.  "One  out  of  three  cancers  is  caused  by  tobacco  (and  other  smoking  products)."Even  though  the  number  of  smokers  has  gone  down,  the  figures  of  those  dying  from  disease  linked  to  tobacco  products  are  up.While  440,000  people  died  from  smoking-related  causes  in  2008,  that  number  has  risen  to  480,000  people  dying  each  year,  according  to  the  report.And  even  though  the  latest  data  suggests  87%  of  lung  cancer  deaths  are  caused  by  smoking  and  secondhand  smoke,  more  smokers  age  35  and  older  die  from  heart  disease  than  lung  cancer.Another  alarming  milestone,  according  to  the  report,  is  that  women  have  caught  up  to  men  and  for  the  first  time  are  just  as  likely  as  men  to  die  from  smoking-related  diseases.What's  newThirteen  cancers  are  now  linked  to  smoking  and  secondhand  smoke.  Liver  and  colorectal  cancer  are  added  in  this  report.  So  far,  there's  not  enough  evidence  to  say  smoking  causes  breast  cancer.  Smoking  does  not  cause  prostate  cancer,  according  to  existing  evidence,  according  to  the  report.Another  finding:  "Exposure  to  secondhand  smoke  is  a  cause  of  stroke,"  according  to  the  report.  People  who  don't  smoke  themselves  but  are  exposed  to  secondhand  smoke  have  a  20%  to  30%  increased  risk  for  a  stroke.We  know  it  can  kill  us:  Why  people  still  smokeFor  the  first  time,  the  report  found  that  smoking  can  cause  diabetes,  erectile  dysfunction,  rheumatoid  arthritis,  macular  degeneration,  ectopic  pregnancies  and  impaired  immune  function.  Smokers  have  a  30%  to  40%  increased  risk  of  developing  Type  2  diabetes  compared  with  nonsmokers.And  women  who  smoke  early  in  their  pregnancies  put  their  unborn  at  risk  of  having  cleft  palates  or  cleft  lips,  according  to  the  report.Some  5.6  million  children  living  today  will  die  early  because  of  smoking  if  things  don't  change,  the  report  warns.  That's  one  in  13  children,  Lushniak  says.Lushniak  appears  passionate  about  wanting  to  make  smoking  a  thing  of  the  past.The  tools  to  do  so  already  exist,  he  says,  including  making  tobacco  products  more  expensive.  High-impact  anti-smoking  media  campaigns,  such  as  one  the  CDC  conducted  last  year,  as  well  as  full  access  to  smoking  cessation  programs  may  help.Smoke-free  laws  are  needed  across  the  United  States,  Lushniak  says.  "It's  embarrassing  in  this  country  only  half  our  population  is  covered  by  those  laws."He  says  he  believes  using  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration's  authority  to  regulate  tobacco  products  effectively  and  funding  comprehensive  statewide  tobacco  control  programs  at  CDC-recommended  levels  will  also  help  reduce  smoking."But  the  current  rate  of  progress  in  tobacco  control  is  not  fast  enough.  More  needs  to  be  done,"  according  to  the  report.The  CDC  recommends  spending  $12  per  person  from  taxes  and  tobacco  settlement  money  to  reduce  smoking  rates,  Lushniak  says.  "Right  now,  only  just  over  a  buck-fifty  is  spent  per  person."His  message  to  current  smokers:  "Tell  them  it's  never  too  late  to  stop.  It's  best  to  quit  smoking  completely.  Talk  to  your  doctor,  call  1-800-QUIT-NOW."He  also  recommends  supporting  those  who  want  to  quit.  "It's  good  for  their  health,  your  family's  health  and  the  nation's  health."Goal  of  a  tobacco-free  generationLushniak  says  he  has  a  new  formula  to  create  a  smoke-free  generation.  It  can't  just  be  a  federal  government  attack  on  tobacco,  he  says;  the  battle  needs  to  be  fought  on  the  local  level,  too,  with  nongovernmental  agencies,  academia,  faith-based  organizations,  health  care  professionals  and  businesses.Lushniak  has  his  work  cut  out  for  him.  He  has  to  devise  a  plan  to  prevent  teens  from  wanting  to  smoke  --  most  adult  smokers  begin  smoking  as  teenagers,  according  to  the  Mayo  Clinic.  The  new  report  backs  that  up,  stating  that  87%  of  smokers  had  their  first  puff  on  a  cigarette  under  the  age  of  18.And  now  kids  have  a  new  enticement:  e-cigarettes.  Last  year,  a  CDC  report  found  the  percentage  of  middle  and  high  school  students  trying  electronic  cigarettes  doubled  from  3.3%  to  6.8%.While  the  safety  of  e-cigarettes  is  still  being  hashed  out,  some  health  officials  fear  these  electronic  devices  may  be  a  gateway  to  tobacco  cigarettes  and  other  tobacco  products.Young  people  today  don't  write  letters  anymore  because  they  prefer  to  text,  Lushniak  says.  He  wants  the  younger  generation  to  think  of  smoking  like  writing  a  letter  --  that  it's  no  longer  in  vogue.As  surgeon  general,  Lushniak  oversees  more  than  6,500  public  health  professionals  making  up  the  U.S.  Public  Health  Service  Commissioned  Corps.  It's  the  first  uniformed  service  to  go  entirely  smoke  free,  he  says;  the  others  include  the  Navy,  Marines,  Air  Force,  Coast  Guard  and  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration."It  is  my  sincere  hope  that  50  years  from  now  we  won't  need  another  (surgeon  general's)  report  on  smoking  and  health,  because  tobacco-related  disease  and  death  will  be  a  thing  of  the  past,"  Lushniak  writes  in  the  report.</TEXT></DOC>

The  publication  has  ranked  the  controversial  diet  last  on  their  "Best  Diets  Overall"  list  for  2014.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Followers  of  the  Paleo  Diet  may  go  prehistoric  on  U.S.  News  &  World  Report  this  week.  The  publication  has  ranked  the  controversial  diet  last  on  its  "Best  Diets  Overall"  list  for  2014.Each  year,  U.S.  News  &  World  Report  asks  experts  to  rank  various  nutrition  plans  to  help  consumers  make  informed  decisions.  This  year  the  panel  evaluated  32  of  the  most  popular  diets.To  be  top-rated,  a  diet  has  to  be  relatively  easy  to  follow,  nutritious,  safe,  effective  for  weight  loss  and  protective  against  diabetes  and  heart  disease.First  popularized  in  the  1970s,  the  Paleo  Diet  asks  people  to  follow  a  diet  similar  to  those  who  lived  during  the  Paleolithic  era,  between  2.6  million  and  10,000  years  ago.  This  means  eating  like  hunters  and  gathers  --  consuming  lots  of  produce  and  animal  protein,  while  avoiding  sugar,  grains,  legumes  and  dairy  altogether."If  the  cavemen  didn't  eat  it,  you  shouldn't  either,"  U.S.  News  &  World  Report  summarized.The  diet  has  gained  a  significant  following  in  recent  years,  especially  among  the  CrossFit  crowd.  "Paleo  Diet"  was  the  most  searched  diet  term  on  Google  in  2013.Being  last  on  the  Best  Diets  list  doesn't  mean  Paleo  is  the  worst  diet  ever  (the  "Cookie  Diet"  didn't  even  make  the  list).  But  U.S.  News  &  World  Report's  experts  said  the  Paleo  Diet  was  too  restrictive  for  most  people  to  follow  long  term,  and  that  it  limited  some  essential  nutrients.  They  also  cited  a  lack  of  research  proving  the  Paleo  Diet's  cardiovascular  health  and  weight  loss  benefits  in  their  ranking.The  Paleo  Diet  tied  for  last  place  on  the  list  alongside  the  Dukan  diet,  which  is  also  a  high-protein,  low-carbohydrate  approach.For  the  fourth  year  in  a  row,  the  DASH  Diet  Eating  Plan  was  named  the  best  overall  diet.  DASH,  or  Dietary  Approaches  to  Stop  Hypertension,  was  developed  by  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  for  people  with  high  blood  pressure.  But  it  is  also  effective  in  lowering  cholesterol  and  reducing  a  person's  risk  for  heart  disease,  stroke,  kidney  stones  and  diabetes,  its  website  states.Unlike  many  diet  plans,  DASH  doesn't  cut  out  or  extremely  restrict  certain  foods.  Its  focus  is  on  limiting  daily  sodium  intake.  The  meal  plan  includes  three  whole-grain  products  each  day,  four  to  six  servings  of  vegetables,  four  to  six  servings  of  fruit,  two  to  four  servings  of  dairy  products  and  several  servings  each  of  lean  meats  and  nuts/seeds/legumes.The  diet's  only  downfalls,  the  expert  panel  said,  are  that  it  takes  some  "grunt  work"  to  adhere  to,  and  that  it  may  cost  more  than  a  diet  based  on  "processed,  fatty,  sugary  foods."Following  DASH  on  the  best  overall  list  was  the  Therapeutic  Lifestyle  Changes  Diet,  which  also  was  created  by  the  National  Institutes  of  Health.  Next  in  line  were  the  Mayo  Clinic  Diet,  the  Mediterranean  Diet  and  Weight  Watchers  --  all  tied  for  third  place.  This  is  the  same  as  last  year's  ranking.U.S.  News  &  World  Report  also  published  several  other  lists,  including  best  weight-loss  diets,  best  diabetes  diets,  best  commercial  diet  plans  and  easiest  diets  to  follow.Weight  Watchers  topped  the  best  weight-loss,  best  commercial  diet  plan  and  easiest  to  follow  lists.  Also  high  on  several  lists  were  the  Jenny  Craig  plan  and  "The  Biggest  Loser"  plan.For  more,  visit  U.S.  News  &  World  Report's  Best  Diets  Rankings.</TEXT></DOC>

The  sender  of  the  e-mail  does  not  suggest  he  or  she  witnessed  a  confession;  instead,  the  sender  claims  to  have  been  told  information  by  somebody  who  purportedly  was  aware  of  a  confession  in  the  2013  death  by  one  of  the  people  implicated  in  the  e-mail.Johnson's  body  was  found  in  a  rolled-up  mat  in  the  Lowndes  High  School  gymnasium  on  January  11,  2013.  Investigators  with  the  Sheriff's  Office  ruled  his  death  accidental,  concluding  that  he  climbed  into  the  center  of  the  gym  mat  to  reach  for  a  shoe  and  got  stuck.According  to  an  incident  report  provided  to  CNN  by  the  Sheriff's  Office,  investigators  interviewed  two  of  four  students  identified  by  name  in  the  anonymous  e-mail  on  January  28.Both  students  acknowledged  they  knew  Johnson  but  denied  any  involvement  in  his  death.The  incident  report  does  not  indicate  whether  the  investigators  attempted  to  speak  with  the  two  other  students  identified  in  the  e-mail.CNN  is  not  naming  the  students  mentioned  in  the  e-mail  because  none  of  them  has  been  named  a  suspect  in  the  death  of  Johnson.Lowndes  County  sheriff's  investigators  concluded  that  Johnson,  17,  got  stuck  while  reaching  for  a  shoe  at  the  center  of  the  mat  and  that  his  death  was  accidental.  The  state's  medical  examiner  agreed,  citing  "positional  asphyxia"  as  the  cause  of  death.Kenneth  and  Jacquelyn  Johnson  believe  their  son  was  beaten  to  death  and  officials  are  "covering  up  a  murder."  An  independent  pathologist,  hired  by  the  parents,  concluded  that  the  death  was  the  result  of  a  homicide  after  finding  evidence  of  "unexplained  apparent  non-accidental  blunt  force  trauma"  to  Johnson's  neck."If  anybody  has  any  information  of  a  different  opinion  that  they  can  provide  to  us,  we're  certainly  open  to  looking  at  that.  We're  not  closed-minded  on  this,"  Lt.  Stryde  Jones,  supervisor  of  the  Lowndes  County  Sheriff's  Office's  Investigative  Division,  told  CNN  in  May.The  Sheriff's  Office  has  received  many  public  comments  regarding  Johnson's  death  since  it  closed  its  case  on  May  2.  The  grand  jury  subpoena  is  the  first  document  provided  to  CNN  that  suggests  the  department  has  acted  on  any  of  those  public  comments."Although  our  case  has  been  closed,  if  evidence  comes  forward,  specifically  testimony,  then  we're  open  to  hearing  that  and  certainly  we'll  act  accordingly,"  Jones  said.Chief  Assistant  District  Attorney  Bradfield  Shealy  issued  the  subpoena  to  Mediacom  Communications  Corp.  on  January  28.  The  New  York-based  cable,  phone  and  Internet  provider  was  ordered  to  provide  the  Lowndes  County  grand  jury  with  subscriber  information  associated  with  the  e-mail  sent  through  the  Lowndes  County  Sheriff's  Office's  website,  or  submit  the  documents  to  the  district  attorney's  office  or  Jones  before  February  26.According  to  a  Lowndes  County  Sheriff's  Office  incident  report,  the  subpoena  was  faxed  to  Mediacom  on  February  7.Mediacom  received  the  subpoena  via  fax  Wednesday  afternoon  and  immediately  complied  with  Georgia  officials'  request,  spokesman  Tom  Larson  told  CNN  on  Thursday.Last  week,  students  from  Lowndes  High  School  and  nearby  Valdosta  High  School  were  among  those  who  appeared  before  a  federal  grand  jury  in  Macon,  as  part  of  the  Department  of  Justice's  investigation  into  Johnson's  death.  The  U.S.  attorney  for  the  Middle  District  of  Georgia,  Michael  Moore,  launched  the  federal  investigation  on  October  31.</TEXT></DOC>

Another  hearing  will  be  held  in  April  to  deal  with  the  other  issues  in  the  suit,  including  college  costs.WATCH:  Judge's  harsh  words  for  suing  teenIt's  a  case  of  she  said  versus  they  said.Rachel  Canning  says  she  is  an  honors  student  and  cheerleader,  who  was  cut  off  from  her  family  and  could  lose  the  opportunity  to  attend  college,  where  she  hopes  to  major  in  biomedical  engineering.Canning's  parents,  Sean  and  Elizabeth,  argue  that  she  was  not  kicked  out  of  the  house.  Instead,  they  say  she  left  on  her  own  back  in  October  because  she  didn't  want  to  abide  by  their  rules.Mixed  into  this  seemingly  dysfunctional  family  brew  are  a  number  of  other  allegations  against  each  side:  that  the  Cannings  didn't  like  Rachel's  boyfriend  and  that  they  were  abusive  to  her,  and  that  Rachel  missed  curfews  and  was  suspended  from  school.READ:  Brace  yourself,  Mom!  Millennials  move  back  home!No  surprise  that  reaction  in  social  media  was  swift  and  significantly  tilted  in  one  direction."She  is  an  entitled  spoiled  brat  and  will  regret  this  later  in  life,"  wrote  G.G.  Benitez,  CEO  and  founder  of  a  public  relations  firm,  on  my  Facebook  page.Tish  Howard,  a  former  elementary  school  principal  and  CEO  of  an  educational  consulting  firm,  agreed.  "Here  is  another  example  of  what  happens  when  children  are  over  entitled.  Let's  hand  out  more  trophies  for  just  showing  up,"  Howard,  a  mother  and  grandmother,  wrote  on  Facebook.Kim  Kennedy,  a  New  York-based  television  producer,  said,"Bratty  kids  have  always  been  there.  Some  have  better  publicists."But  there  was  a  little  bit  of  blame  for  the  parents  too.READ:  OMG!  Your  teen  actually  talks  to  you?"Her  parents  have  clearly  contributed  to  the  development  of  her  character  and  work  ethic  (or  lack  thereof),"  wrote  Pamela  Sellers,  a  freelance  producer  and  writer  and  mom  of  two  girls  in  Atlanta."They  should  settle  this  by  ensuring  that  she  complete  her  high  school  degree.  As  for  college:  until  she  learns  to  appreciate  what  she's  had,  she  will  never  be  respectful.  They  should  cut  her  off  completely.  Her  learning  to  make  it  on  her  own  will  be  the  best  thing  in  the  end."Howard,  the  former  school  principal,  said  she  feels  "deep  compassion"  for  the  parents."I  am  saddened  that  someone  in  their  life  was  not  brave  enough  to  have  a  critical  conversation  with  them  years  ago  about  disabling  children  with  an  easy  easy  path,"  she  said.  "Self  esteem  and  accountability  are  by  products  of  overcoming  disequilibrium  and  succeeding  not  by  having  adults  eliminate  the  hurdles  and  failures  for  you."Dorothy  Liu,  an  entrepreneur  and  mom  in  Bellevue,  Washington,  said  if  the  parents'  side  of  the  story  is  true,  it  sounds  as  though  they  were  "at  the  end  of  their  rope."READ:  SOS  for  stressed  out  teens"As  parents,  most  of  us  try  to  do  the  best  we  can  and  hope  we  can  instill  enough  good  common  sense  and  humility  in  our  kids  so  they  may  make  good  decisions,"  said  Liu,  who  has  a  10-year-old  daughter.  "It  saddens  me  to  see  the  level  of  entitlement  in  this  generation,  but  it's  more  evidence  that  by  giving  our  kids  every  opportunity  to  realize  their  potential,  we're  also  giving  them  the  power  to  see  it  as  their  due  rather  than  the  gift  and  privilege  it  is."On  the  other  side  are  people  like  Sheryl  Resnick  of  Tucson,  Arizona,  who  believes  the  appropriateness  of  suing  parents  really  depends  on  the  individual  child's  circumstances"I  know  of  a  situation  where  a  12-year-old  was  taken  out  of  private  school  and  had  to  go  to  public  school  in  a  different  city,"  said  Resnick,  also  on  Facebook.  "His  parents  drank  up  his  school  money.  But  in  those  days  a  kid  didn't  sue  his  parents.  He  pitied  them.  But  it  did  irrevocably  change  his  life."READ:  Nonversations:  When  talking  to  your  teen  is  one-sidedPerhaps  the  view  that  sums  up  this  entire  case  was  a  tweet  with  the  hashtag  #Nowinners  by  a  father  of  two  boys.  He  called  it  a  "terrible  situation."Indeed  it  is,  because  whatever  happens,  you  have  a  relationship  between  a  child  and  her  parents  that  is  anything  but  healthy  at  the  moment.Raising  a  teenager  isn't  easy.  At  the  same  time,  being  a  teenager  is  no  walk  in  the  park  either.  If  only  both  sides  could  find  a  way  to  meet  in  the  therapist's  office  --  together  --  that  would  be  a  step  in  the  right  direction,  said  Jennifer  Hartstein,  a  New  York  City-based  child,  adolescent  and  family  psychologist."Clearly,  there  is  a  breakdown  in  communication  in  this  family,  bordering  on  limited  communication,"  said  Hartstein.  "The  real  question  I  have  is  how  did  it  get  so  bad  and  go  this  far?  What  kind  of  steps  could  have  been  taken  prior  to  this  happening?"Do  you  think  a  child  should  be  able  to  sue  his  or  her  parents  to  pay  for  college?

Toledo,  Naples,  ItalyOpened  in  2012,  Toledo  station  defies  its  depth  --  at  50  meters,  one  of  the  deepest  in  Naples  --  with  a  design  based  around  themes  of  light  and  water.A  work  called  "Light  Panels"  by  Robert  Wilson  illuminates  the  station  corridor  furthest  underground.This  stunning  station  has  competition:  it's  part  of  the  city's  network  of  so-called  Metro  Art  Stations.2.  Westfriedhof,  Munich,  GermanyInaugurated  in  1998  to  little  fanfare,  this  otherwise  ordinary  looking  station  took  on  new  life  just  three  years  later.In  2001,  Westfriedhof's  platform  was  aesthetically  enhanced  by  11  enormous,  domed  lighting  fixtures  that  continuously  bathe  the  surroundings  in  haunting  shades  of  blue,  yellow  and  red.MORE:  What's  the  new  London,  Paris  or  Rome?3.  Komsomolskaya  (Koltsevaya  Line),  MoscowKomsomolskaya  station's  baroque-style  decor,  historical  mosaics  and  chandeliered  ceilings  resemble  a  grand  ballroom.Opened  in  1952  to  alleviate  the  congestion  of  one  of  Moscow's  busiest  transport  hubs,  it  was  Stalin's  infamous  1941  wartime  speech  that  inspired  the  opulence  of  the  mosaics.4.  Olaias,  Lisbon,  PortugalIn  1998,  Lisbon  hosted  a  world  expo,  in  part  to  celebrate  500  years  of  Portuguese  inventions.Built  to  help  transport  the  expo's  11  million  visitors,  the  station  is  a  whimsically  colorful  space  that  to  this  day  holds  its  own  as  a  modern  work  of  art.5.  Westminster,  LondonLondon  Underground  might  be  the  great-great-grandparent  of  all  the  world's  metro  stations  but  Westminster,  opened  just  days  before  the  new  millennium,  has  to  be  one  of  the  most  futuristic-looking.The  austere  concrete  and  stainless  steel  design  somehow  achieves  a  functional  beauty  rather  than  oppressing  all  those  commuters  scurrying  to  and  from  their  offices.MORE:  5  great  city  markets  in  Europe6.  T-Centralen,  Stockholm,  SwedenAbove  ground,  Stockholm's  central  station  looks  like  a  pretty  average  part  of  a  rapid  transit  system.Start  boring  down,  though,  and  unexpected  changes  in  color  and  shape  reveal  a  very  different  animal.When  commuters  reach  the  bold  blue  and  white,  cave-like  platform  at  T-Centralen,  they're  reminded  that  they've  indeed  ventured  underground.7.  Bockenheimer  Warte,  Frankfurt,  GermanySeeking  to  distinguish  his  design  from  the  unobtrusive  minimalism  of  other  Frankfurt  stations,  architect  Zbigniew  Peter  Pininski  outdid  himself  with  the  fantastical  entrance  to  Bockenheimer  Warte.Depicting  a  train  car  crashing  through  the  sidewalk,  it  leaves  commuters  either  shocked  or  bemused,  but  rarely  indifferent.8.  "Fosteritos,"  Bilbao,  SpainLess  than  20  years  old,  Bilbao's  metro  is  the  third-largest  in  Spain.The  curved-glass  entrances  of  many  of  the  stations  --  affectionately  nicknamed  "Fosteritos"  ("Little  Fosters")  after  their  creator,  Lord  Foster  --  are  considered  prime  examples  of  the  city's  modern,  up-to-the-minute  style.The  transparent  structures  admit  plenty  of  daytime  light  and  at  night  are  lit  up.MORE:  7  of  Europe's  most  beautiful  villages9.  Palais  Royal  --  Musée  du  Louvre,  ParisIn  a  city  as  beautiful  as  Paris,  this  unconventional  station  entrance  at  Place  Colette  still  stands  out.Completed  in  2000  (the  centennial  year  of  the  Paris  metro),  Jean-Michel  Othoniel's  "Kiosque  des  noctambules"  ("Kiosk  of  the  night  owls")  intertwines  dazzling  colored  beads  to  form  two  protective  cupolas.A  meeker  design  would  be  overshadowed  by  the  close  proximity  of  the  Louvre  Museum  and  surrounding  classic  architecture.In  this  case,  however,  it  adds  a  touch  of  cheeky  hipness.10.  Admiralteyskaya,  St.  Petersburg,  RussiaSt.  Petersburg's  newest  metro  stop  proves  that  classic  and  modern  design  can  coexist  harmoniously.After  many  setbacks,  the  station  finally  opened  for  business  in  December  2011.Stark  curved  ceilings  and  low  lighting  complement  traditional  marble  and  arched  platforms  in  what's  the  deepest  station  in  the  network.11.  Plac  Wilsona,  Warsaw,  PolandThe  Soviets  built  some  extraordinary  metro  stations  but  this  2005  effort,  named  after  U.S.  president  Woodrow  Wilson,  showed  that  a  capitalist  Poland  could  come  up  with  some  beauties,  too.Unless,  as  might  appear,  it  was  actually  built  by  UFOs.MORE:  9  quirky  and  brilliant  Paris  boutiques12.  Staromestska,  PragueAll  the  stations  on  Prague's  A  Line  deserve  a  place  in  the  European  metro  hall  of  fame  for  their  distinctive  dimpled  metal  tunnel  walls,  but  Staromestska  is  the  most  visited  and  photographed.A  different  color  for  each  station,  they  look  like  something  from  the  dystopian  film  "A  Clockwork  Orange,"  but  the  bubble-wrap  design  actually  strengthens  the  metal.What's  the  best  metro  stop  --  in  Europe  or  worldwide  --  you've  ever  traveled  through?

Mostly  because,  generally  speaking,  it  also  requires  fine  currency.  And  pants.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Each  week  in  "Apparently  This  Matters,"  CNN's  Jarrett  Bellini  applies  his  warped  sensibilities  to  trending  topics  in  social  media  and  random  items  of  interest  on  the  Web.(CNN)  --  I  rarely  get  to  experience  fine  dining.  Mostly  because,  generally  speaking,  it  also  requires  fine  currency.  And  pants.Fortunately,  I'm  perfectly  happy  with  Lean  Pockets,  and  enjoying  one  of  those  rarely  requires  dignity.But  don't  judge.  Even  Napoleon  shared  my  low-brow  culinary  interests.  The  dude  loved  Lean  Pockets.  Most  people  don't  know  that.  And  you  won't  find  it  in  any  history  books.Seriously,  I  wouldn't  look  that  up.All  things  considered,  though,  when  I  do  get  a  chance  to  partake  in  a  true  quality  meal  at  an  upscale  restaurant  (read:  when  someone  else  is  buying)  I  genuinely  enjoy  the  odd  experience  of  being  served  really  small  portions  of  elaborate  food  on  really  large  elaborate  plates,  where  75  percent  of  the  actual  surface  area  is  covered  by  tiny,  elaborate  flakes  of  garnish  that,  combined  with  the  elaborate  entrée,  ultimately  won't  prevent  me  from  just  ordering  pizza  a  few  hours  later  when  I  get  home  so  I  can  finally  get  to  sleep  all  fat  and  bloated  like  I'm  accustomed  to.America.Still,  while  I'm  hardly  deserving  of  such  things,  I  really  do  enjoy  the  fine  dining  experience.  And  it's  partly  because  people  leave  their  kids  at  home.Usually.Recently,  however,  a  couple  didn't  leave  their  kid  at  home,  and  that's  exactly  what  caused  a  heated  online  debate  about  the  social  acceptability  of  bringing  your  children  to  restaurants  that  don't  have  crayons  or  dancing,  human-sized  mice  that  may  or  may  not  have  done  time  in  Leavenworth."Hey  kids!  Who  wants  to  hear  about  the  time  I  shanked  a  guy!"This  particular  fine  dining  incident  all  started  when  the  couple  brought  their  8-month-old  baby  into  one  of  Chicago's  swankiest  restaurants,  Alinea,  which  has  the  incredibly  rare  distinction  of  being  awarded  three  stars  by  a  renowned  tire  company.Meals  at  Alinea  start  at  $210,  so  I'm  guessing  they  don't  serve  fajitas.The  head  chef  of  Alinea,  Grant  Achatz,  later  took  to  Twitter  after  diners  began  complaining  when  the  aforementioned  8-month-old  baby  starting  crying.  As  babies  and  columnists  with  crippling  self-doubt  sometimes  do.Achatz  tweeted:  Tbl  brings  8mo.Old.  It  cries.  Diners  mad.  Tll  ppl  no  kids?  Subject  diners  2crying?  Ppl  take  infants  2  plays?  Concerts?  Hate  saying  no,but..It  seems  that  the  couple's  baby-sitter  had  canceled  at  the  last  moment,  but  they  decided  to  go  out  for  dinner  anyway  because,  apparently,  the  family  dog  isn't  a  suitable  or  legal  fill-in."OK,  Snickers.  You're  in  charge."Not  surprisingly,  Achatz's  tweet  started  a  much  larger  conversation  online  where  the  general  consensus  was:  Screw  your  kids.Now,  before  we  go  any  deeper  into  this  debate,  let  me  first  disclose  that  I  don't  have  any  children  of  my  own  ...  at  least  outside  of  those  who  may  or  may  not  be  living  in  Thailand.And  it's  not  that  I  don't  like  kids.  I  do.  They  say  the  darndest  things.It's  just  that  ...  they're  also  kind  of  sticky.And  they  require  maintenance.Quite  frankly,  I  prefer  the  company  of  dogs.  Because,  while  I'm  quite  grossed  out  by  the  idea  of  changing  a  diaper,  I'm  somehow  perfectly  OK  with  wrapping  my  hand  in  a  Kroger  bag  and  scooping  up  a  giant,  six-pound  pile  of  partially  digested  IAMS  from  my  lawn.So,  yes,  I  understand  that  I  don't  understand  what  it's  like  to  have  children.  But  I  also  understand  what  it's  like  NOT  to  have  children.And  it's  amazing.  I  nap  a  lot.Whether  this  disqualifies  me  to  comment  on  this  subject  is  up  for  you  to  decide.Regardless,  we  have  to  ask:  Should  adults  bring  their  small  children  to  fine  dining  restaurants?Almost  everyone  I  spoke  to  about  this  agrees  with  me  that  there's  a  certain  level  of  swank  where  you  sort  of  have  to  draw  the  line.  It's  a  gray  line.  But  it's  a  line.  And  it  runs  nowhere  near  Red  Lobster.The  kids  and  restaurant  debate  later  took  a  bizarre  and  wonderful  twist  when  somebody  created  a  fake  Twitter  handle  for  the  8-month-old  child.@AlineaBaby  describes  itself  as  ...  a  baby  who  likes  fine  food,  fine  drinks,  and  crying.So,  you  know.  Now  there's  that.But  what  should  the  no-kids  criteria  be?  Is  it  a  price  range?  Is  it  a  particular  style  of  cuisine?  Or  is  it  something  undefined  that  you  just  sort  of  feel?Chef  Achatz  eventually  spoke  about  the  incident  on  ABC's  Good  Morning  America  where  he  simply  said,  "I  could  hear  it  crying  in  the  kitchen."And  in  response  to  the  pop-up  Twitter  account  for  @AlineaBaby,  he  tweeted  a  photo  of  two  giant  fish  heads  and  wrote:  Definitely  not  baby  food...And  definitely  not  fajitas.I  think  we  found  our  line.Follow  @JarrettBellini  on  Twitter.</TEXT></DOC>

He  also  tweeted  "i  love  GA."In  contrast,  Bieber's  January  was  a  whirlwind  of  controversy  that  included  a  DUI  arrest  in  Miami,  an  assault  charge  in  Toronto  and  a  felony  vandalism  probe  in  Los  Angeles.The  People  v.  Justin  Bieber:  The  singer's  court  casesJail  video:  Bieber  off  balance?Video  of  Bieber  undergoing  a  sobriety  test  inside  a  Miami  Beach  police  station  on  January  23  was  released  to  the  media  Wednesday.  He  appeared  unsteady  at  times  as  he  walked  along  a  white  stripe  on  the  floor.Bieber  failed  a  series  of  sobriety  tests,  including  "horizontal  gaze,"  "Romberg  balance,"  "walk  and  turn,"  "finger  to  nose"  and  "one-leg  stand"  tests,  the  Miami  Beach  police  report  said.The  preliminary  toxicology  report  on  Bieber's  urine  sample  said  it  tested  positive  for  "metabolite  of  THC,"  which  indicates  marijuana  use,  and  alprazolam,  the  generic  name  for  the  prescription  sedative  Xanax.Bieber's  Southern  hideout?The  aggressive  paparazzi  who  routinely  tail  celebrities  in  Los  Angeles  have  sometimes  clashed  with  Bieber.The  singer  has  been  ticketed  for  speeding,  which  he  blamed  on  his  being  chased  by  photographers.  He  was  investigated  but  not  charged  two  years  ago  after  a  photographer  accused  him  of  assault  after  a  confrontation  in  Calabasas,  California,  where  Bieber  owns  a  mansion.Although  a  hip-hop  recording  center,  Atlanta  lacks  the  robust  hoard  of  photographers  that  stakes  out  all  corners  of  Hollywood.  But  Jason  Winslow,  a  Miami-based  photographer  who  sells  his  images  through  the  Splash  photo  agency,  traveled  to  Atlanta  to  cover  Bieber.Winslow  told  police  he  was  parked  outside  the  Sandy  Springs  Funhouse,  a  north  Atlanta  "family  fun  center,"  waiting  for  Bieber  to  emerge  Tuesday  afternoon  when  Hesny  told  him  to  leave."He  continued  to  take  pictures  from  further  away,"  Officer  K.D.  Sawtell  wrote.  "Eventually,  that  same  person  chased  him  down  in  a  Cadillac  Escalade  as  Winslow  fled  in  his  Chevy  SUV."Hesny,  32,  admitted  to  police  that  he  opened  Winslow's  car  door  and  took  the  camera,  but  he  said  had  no  intentions  of  keeping  it,  the  arresting  officer  said.  He  told  police  "he  just  wanted  to  delete  the  pictures  from  the  camera."He  tossed  the  camera  in  the  back  of  another  Bieber  SUV  and  then  drove  away,  he  told  police.  Winslow's  Nikon  camera,  which  he  valued  at  $10,000,  was  found  when  police  stopped  the  other  Escalade.  It  was  in  that  vehicle  where  the  drugs  were  found,  the  police  report  said.The  driver,  who  was  arrested  but  later  released  without  charges,  told  police  that  he  was  just  a  driver  and  knew  not  to  ask  his  client  questions,  the  arrest  report  said.Winslow  did  not  respond  to  CNN  calls  for  comment  on  the  case.The  arrest  of  his  bodyguard  doesn't  seem  to  have  dampened  Bieber's  spirits.  He  posted  on  his  Instagram  account  a  photo  of  a  panda  at  Zoo  Atlanta  with  the  caption  "My  bro"  early  Wednesday.  Bieber  also  noted  via  Twitter  that  his  20th  birthday  is  just  days  away  --  Saturday."I  love  sleep,"  the  singer  tweeted  Wednesday  afternoon.CNN's  Matthew  Stucker  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

But  they  also  reveal  new  details  about  legacy  moments  in  her  husband's  presidency  that  were  frustrating  and  distracting  to  the  White  House.It  seemed  as  if  Bill  Clinton  had  too  many  choices  in  his  first  chance  to  name  a  Supreme  Court  justice  and  not  enough  for  his  second.The  deliberations  went  down  to  the  wire,  and  when  Stephen  Breyer's  name  came  up  each  time,  he  was  not  the  person  the  President,  in  his  heart,  preferred."At  this  point  BC  [Clinton]  also  said  he  did  not  want  to  name  Breyer,"  wrote  Diane  Blair  in  May  1994  just  two  days  before  he  was  ultimately  selected.  "Didn't  want  to  give  a  big  deal  to  Massachusetts."That's  where  Breyer,  then  55,  was  serving.  Apparently  naming  someone  from  that  reliably  liberal  state  would  not  pay  political  dividends.Blair  was  a  close  family  friend  who  took  copious  notes  of  conversations  she  had  with  both  Clintons  throughout  most  of  their  White  House  years  that  ended  in  2001.Notes  from  that  conversation  with  Clinton  are  part  of  papers  Blair,  then  a  University  of  Arkansas  professor,  left  the  school  after  her  death  in  2000.CNN  has  uncovered  one  inside  look  at  how  Breyer  was  ultimately  chosen,  and  it  mirrors  the  tricky,  often  delicate  game  of  politics  nearly  every  White  House  must  navigate.Blair's  three-page  memo  affirms  much  of  what  a  variety  of  sources  have  told  CNN  about  the  Breyer  selection  process.  But  she  adds  a  fresh  layer  of  detail  on  the  last-minute  maneuvering  to  get  Clinton  to  decide.Back  to  '93It  all  began  a  year  earlier  soon  after  Clinton  took  office  in  1993.  Justice  Byron  White  was  retiring  and  the  President  had  his  first  chance  to  create  a  legacy  with  a  high-profile  pick.Sources  said  Clinton  had  lots  of  ideas  of  who  should  sit  on  the  high  court--  too  many,  in  the  eyes  of  many  White  House  staffers.  Names  included  New  York  Gov.  Mario  Cuomo,  Senate  Majority  Leader  George  Mitchell,  and  Education  Secretary  Richard  Riley.All  turned  him  down.Interior  Secretary  Bruce  Babbitt's  name  was  quietly  leaked,  but  Senate  Republicans  made  clear  he  would  face  a  rocky  confirmation.In  her  words:  Hillary  Clinton  then  and  nowClinton  even  briefly  considered  naming  his  wife  to  the  court--  which  he  labeled  an  intriguing,  "sexy"  idea--  but  was  quickly  talked  out  of  it,  according  to  former  top  White  House  aide  George  Stephanopoulos,  in  his  memoir."We  don't  need  another  gang-that-couldn't-shoot-straight  story,"  reluctantly  concluded  the  president,  according  to  Stephanopoulos.More  traditional  choices  were  then  considered--  federal  appeals  court  judges.  Among  them  was  Breyer,  then  chief  judge  on  the  Boston-based  First  Circuit.He  was  asked  to  come  to  the  White  House  and  interview  personally  with  Clinton.  But  there  was  one  problem.  He  had  days  earlier  suffered  a  serious  accident  on  his  bicycle,  and  sources  said  he  left  his  hospital  bed  to  come  to  Washington.The  interview  "went  badly,"  Jeffrey  Toobin,  CNN's  Senior  Legal  Analyst,  wrote  in  "The  Nine,"  his  book  on  the  Court."Normally  a  friendly,  almost  garrulous  man,  Breyer  was  short  of  breath  and  still  in  pain,"  wrote  Toobin."Afterwards,  Clinton  told  his  staff  Breyer  seemed  'heartless'.  ...  I  don't  see  enough  humanity.  I  want  a  judge  with  soul."Still,  government  sources  say  Breyer  was  on  the  verge  of  being  selected  until  he  tapped  Ruth  Bader  Ginsburg.  She  served  on  the  D.C.  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals,  where  her  colleagues  at  one  time  included  Antonin  Scalia  and  Clarence  Thomas.  Both  would  precede  her  on  the  high  court.Despite  her  clear  liberal  record  on  the  bench,  the  nominee  was  well  received  and  received  near  unanimous  Senate  approval.It  also  helped  boost  the  morale  of  a  White  House  struggling  in  its  first  year  from  a  series  of  political  setbacks.  Clinton  knew  he  had  a  winner  in  the  second  woman  to  sit  on  the  high  court,  introducing  her  by  saying  she  had  a  "big  heart."Friend's  papers  giver  insight  into  rise  of  the  ClintonsThe  1994  pickFast  forward  one  year.  Justice  Harry  Blackmun  announced  his  retirement  April  6,  presenting  another  chance  for  Clinton  to  burnish  his  legacy.  The  five-week  selection  process  was  again  unwieldy,  as  the  Blair  memo  shows.Her  notes  from  that  May  11  conversation  with  Clinton  show  it  was  ostensibly  about  the  "Supreme  Court  appointment,"  but  other  topics  kept  cropping  up.Clinton  was  worried  about  the  midterm  congressional  elections,  even  his  own  political  future  ("BC  not  sure  he  can  get  reelected").Yet,  it  was  clear  Clinton  was  torn  between  his  personal  and  political  sides  --  focusing  on  one  man  --  Judge  Richard  Arnold,  a  fellow  Arkansan  on  the  8th  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals.The  two  were  not  close  but  Arnold  had  a  national  reputation,  with  some  later  calling  him  one  the  greatest  judges  never  to  have  sat  on  the  Supreme  Court.But  there  were  three  problems,  among  them  his  divorce  years  earlier.  Blair's  memo  notes  county  divorce  records  point  to  some  "messy  allegations"  that  might  complicate  Arnold's  chances.  "This  thing  is  so  sick,  according  the  BC  [Clinton],  in  a  way  he  wants  to  stand  up  to  it,  but  [the  issue]  will  come  out  and  will  be  part  of  the  pattern  of  sleaze,"  she  writes.There  were  also  concerns  of  perceived  nepotism,  which  fellow  Arkansan  Blair  tried  to  downplay  to  the  president."BC  is  furious  about  what  has  been  done  to  Ark.,  how  they've  taken  all  the  joy  and  happiness  out  of  BC's  victory,  turned  the  state  into  the  killing  field--  this  would  restore  their  pride  and  happiness,"  she  paraphrases  him  saying.But  the  biggest  lingering  concern  was  Arnold's  health.  He  had  been  diagnosed  years  previously  with  low-grade  Hodgkin's  lymphoma,  and  the  cancer  had  produced  tumors,  spreading  through  his  body.Although  Arnold  was  able  to  function  "more  or  less  normally,"  wrote  Toobin,  a  doctor  told  Clinton  on  May  13  that  there  was  no  way  he  could  say  "that  Arnold's  disease  'would  not  interfere'  with  his  duties  as  a  Supreme  Court  justice."Hillary's  big  concernBlair's  memo  says  this  was  "HRC  [Hillary  Clinton's]  greatest  concern,  makes  it  seem  he's  [Clinton]  is  not  taking  this,  his  greatest  legacy,  seriously,  if  [he  puts  in]  someone  who  may  die  in  5  years  of  less  time."Arnold  stayed  active  on  the  bench  until  his  2004  death.But  Arnold,  in  Blair's  mind,  was  clearly  the  best  choice  and  she  strongly  urged  Clinton  to  "go  ahead  and  appoint  RA,  because  that's  what  he  really  wanted  to  do."The  President  was  not  even  remotely  close  to  a  decision,  and  he  urged  Blair  to  speak  with  his  wife  after  their  conversation.The  first  lady  was  "wild"  about  the  issue  of  Arnold's  health.  Blair  paraphrases  her  close  friend  saying,  "BC  wouldn't  even  think  about  naming  someone  from  Neb.  or  Iowa  if  they  had  possible  cancer  threat--  so  why  do  it  just  because  he  knows  the  guy,"  writes  Blair."If  HRC  carried  the  day,  and  sounds  as  if  she  is,  it  will  be  Babbitt.  She's  not  wild  about  him.  Wishes  there  were  a  3rd  choice.  But  there  isn't.  Which  in  itself  is  very,  very  sad  and  strange,"  according  to  Blair's  notes.After  hearing  Arnold's  medical  prognosis  from  the  doctor,  Clinton  later  that  day  made  up  his  mind.  It  was  Breyer.The  final  decision  was  sudden,  and  Clinton  wanted  it  public  immediately,  before  his  pick  could  get  down  to  Washington.  So  Breyer  wasn't  even  present  when  the  announcement  was  made.He  was  easily  confirmed.The  whole  selection  process  lacked  the  excitement  and  momentum  of  the  one  a  year  earlier  but  both  of  Clinton's  high  court  choices  have  turned  out  to  be  great  successes.  Ginsburg  and  Breyer  have  carved  a  consistent  left-leaning  record,  and  are  well-liked  and  respected  by  their  colleagues.</TEXT></DOC>

His  name,  uttered  here  and  there  in  a  few  hushed  hallway  conversations,  usually  surfaced  only  when  reporters  brought  it  up.  And  when  asked  about  the  still-unfolding  political  and  legal  drama  in  the  New  Jersey  capital  of  Trenton,  some  Republicans  here  declined  to  talk  about  Christie  at  all.Still,  the  RNC  gathering  was  as  good  a  place  as  any  to  take  the  Republican  Party's  temperature  on  Christie.  After  all,  the  assembled  group  of  state  party  chairs,  conservative  activists  and  professional  operatives  from  around  the  country  represent  the  very  people  Christie  must  court  to  win  the  GOP  nomination.The  controversies  swirling  around  ChristieThe  collective  takeaway?  A  wide-ranging  sense  of  support  and  sympathy  for  the  governor,  laced  with  a  heavy  dose  of  wait-and-see  caution.Here's  what  10  Republicans  said  about  the  Christie  flap:Saul  Anuzis,  Republican  consultant:  "If  he  is  really  involved,  when  all  the  facts  come  out,  it  will  be  the  nail  in  his  coffin.  If  he  wasn't,  it  could  be  a  rallying  cry,  because  people  thought  he  was  being  unfairly  treated  by  the  media.  That's  the  gut  reaction  right  now  by  many  activists.  But  if  he's  lying,  he's  dead."Ron  Kaufman,  Massachusetts  national  committeeman:  "It's  New  Jersey.  It's  not  Connecticut,  it's  not  Wyoming,  it's  not  Colorado.  Politics  in  New  Jersey  is  tougher  than  most  places.  But  on  the  other  hand,  he  did  exactly  what  he  should  have  done.  He  took  responsibility  for  it,  apologized  for  it,  and  fired  the  guys."In  this  day  of  overanalyzing  and  24-hour  news  cycles,  it's  being  blown  out  of  proportion.  The  media  needs  to  fill  time,  especially  on  stations  like  MSNBC.  It's  overdone.  But  this  too  shall  pass.  There  is  nobody  I  know  --  nobody  --  that  wouldn't  take  Christie  tomorrow  for  a  fundraiser  in  their  state."To  call  this  the  same  kind  of  crisis  as  Benghazi  where  people  were  killed.  ...  It's  just  so  interesting  that  so  many  networks  spent  so  much  more  time  on  this,  at  the  same  time  a  bipartisan  report  form  the  Senate  comes  out  saying  they  should  have  stopped  Benghazi.  It  takes  your  breath  away  a  little  bit.  It's  bad  for  the  process."Cuccinelli  calls  on  Christie  to  'step  aside'  from  RGA  postMatt  Moore,  South  Carolina  Republican  Party  chairman:  "Unique  politicians  have  an  extraordinary  ability  to  recover.  Gov.  Christie  fits  that  bill.  Right  now  he  is  the  prizefighter  in  the  middle  rounds.  He  has  got  to  get  back  up.  These  next  few  months  will  tell  the  tale.  Its  possible  he  comes  out  stronger  on  the  other  side."People  from  South  Carolina  like  people  who  are  tough-talking  with  a  big  personality.  Always  have,  always  will.  We  disagree  on  certain  policy  positions,  but  once  they  meet  the  Chris  Christie  that  I've  met,  I  think  a  lot  of  people  will  like  him.  He  is  a  real  person  who  makes  tough  decisions  and  sticks  with  them."Fredi  Simpson,  Washington  national  committeewoman:  "There  are  a  lot  of  people  who  like  that  he  is  strong  and  against  the  unions.  He  puts  people  in  their  place.  You  have  to  perform,  you  have  to  work  hard,  etc."Then  there  are  people  who  say  there  is  just  no  way  that  they'll  support  him.  They  don't  think  he  is  conservative  enough.  People  are  all  over  the  place.  But  the  bridge  scandal  is  not  going  to  be  a  factor.  The  bigger  question  for  Republicans  is  whether  he  is  conservative  enough."Decoding  Christie's  speech:  Different  strokes  for  different  folksLenny  Curry,  Florida  Republican  Party  chairman:  "Chris  Christie  did  what  few  folks  do  it  seems  in  politics,  and  he  took  responsibility  for  the  situation.  He  addressed  the  public.  He  addressed  the  press.  People  got  fired.  It's  a  New  Jersey  problem.  It's  not  a  national  problem.  And  he  is  the  head  of  the  RGA.  His  job  is  to  raise  money  to  get  Republican  governors  elected.  So  he  is  doing  his  job."Dennis  Lennox,  Republican  activist:  "I  think  Chris  Christie  is  still  the  odds-on  favorite  for  the  Republican  Party  in  2016.  The  reality  is  Democrats  failed  to  find  a  credible  candidate  to  run  against  him  for  re-election  last  year,  and  as  a  result  they  are  throwing  everything  against  the  wall  and  hoping  it  sticks."Shawn  Steel,  California  national  committeeman:  "Gov.  Christie  is  going  through  a  major  political  experience  that  will  either  make  him  or  break  him.  And  at  this  point,  he  is  showing  genuine  mea  culpa,  taking  complete  responsibility.  He  is  not  evading.  He's  a  different  kind  of  politician.  He  is  not  afraid  to  call  it  like  he  sees  it.  But  he's  getting  hammered  by  the  most  liberal  part  of  the  country."If  he  survives,  he  will  come  out  a  stronger  person.  Most  voters  understand  that  politicians  make  mistakes.  The  question  is  how  they  deal  with  it.  He  is  making  lemonade  out  of  lemons.  He's  had  a  whole  bunch  of  lemons  thrown  at  him,  and  he's  putting  up  a  lemonade  stand,  and  I  think  it  sells."Veteran  RNC  member  who  declined  to  be  identified:  "The  truth  is,  his  personality  is  such  that  you  are  bound  to  have  a  time  when  people  are  going  to  take  a  swipe  back  at  you,  because  that's  the  way  you  are.  That's  the  nature  of  the  beast.  He  has  a  persnickety  personality,  which  he  kind  of  cultivated."Stormy  days  ahead  as  Christie  takes  oathChad  Connelly,  RNC  director  of  faith  outreach:  "They  think  he  really  handled  that  whole  bridge  thing  pretty  well.  What  I  am  hearing  is  that  he  is  taking  it  head-on,  as  opposed  to  what  Obama  has  done  with  all  these  issues  like  Benghazi.  I  get  a  lot  of  pastors  e-mailing  me  about  that.  I  don't  hear  a  lot  of  haters  out  there."I  think  people  are  going  to  wait  and  see  how  he  handles  it  all  as  it  plays  out.  But  the  biggest  thing  I  have  heard  from  pastors,  in  e-mails  and  phone  calls,  is  'I  wish  Obama  would  take  stuff  head-on.'  Benghazi,  IRS,  Obamacare.  He  won't  event  talk  about  it.  And  here  you  got  a  guy  on  our  side  who  actually  answers  hard  questions."Susan  Hutchison,  Washington  Republican  Party  chair:  "Bridgegate  is  interesting.  I  have  to  look  at  it  from  a  big-picture  point  of  view  to  see  whether  it's  going  to  stick  in  a  few  months.  We'll  have  to  wait  and  see.  Are  there  more  shoes  to  drop?  If  there  are,  then  they  will  have  to  contend  with  it."But  I  think  people  find  him  refreshing  just  in  general,  because  the  President  is  so  untrustworthy  when  it  comes  to  giving  his  word.  Countless  times,  whatever  he  says  is  exactly  the  opposite  of  what  he  does.  With  Christie,  what  he  says  is  what  he  does.  I  think  people  really  like  that.  It's  a  sign  of  leadership,  and  I  think  we  would  all  agree  that  the  leadership  qualities  in  the  president  have  been  sorely  lacking."</TEXT></DOC>

Billions  flew  on  them.  But  the  plane  that  helped  spur  U.S.  jet  travel  is  done.  Get  ready  to  fly  newer  jets  as  airlines  get  rid  of  their  oldies.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Hef  owned  one.Miss  Universe  had  one  named  after  her.And  a  recent  vice  presidential  nominee  campaigned  on  one.Now,  after  nearly  50  years,  the  iconic  McDonnell  Douglas  DC-9  airliner  is  pretty  much  done.  Overall,  say  aviation  enthusiasts,  it's  been  a  great  ride.The  twin-engine,  single-aisle  jet's  biggest  and  first  operator,  Delta  Air  Lines,  officially  retired  its  remaining  fleet  of  six  DC-9s  on  Monday,  leaving  only  a  handful  of  passenger  models  operating  among  foreign  airlines  and  government  and  military  outfits.It's  high  time  to  give  this  plane  its  due.  Experts  credit  the  DC-9  with  helping  to  open  markets  and  spark  air  travel  trends  that  continue  today.And  what  about  pop  culture?  During  its  peak  in  the  1970s,  the  DC-9  became  an  ultimate  status  symbol  among  the  world's  emerging  Jet  Set.For  some,  the  plane  was  truly  shagadelic.Playboy  magazine  owner  Hugh  Hefner  bought  a  custom  DC-9  and  turned  it  into  a  personal  fur-lined  flying  boudoir.But  while  Hef  was  making  mile-high-club  history,  the  DC-9  was  making  travel  history.Airlines  embraced  this  T-Tailed  plane  with  engines  mounted  on  the  rear,  instead  of  the  wings.  They  liked  its  ability  to  land  easily  at  airports  with  shorter  runways.Here's  how  the  DC-9's  geeky  aviation  technology  helped  change  America's  travel  culture:—Longer  wing  flaps  and  dynamic  engines  helped  DC-9s  land  and  takeoff  on  shorter  runways  that  often  served  smaller  towns.—In  turn,  airlines  used  the  DC-9  to  open  new  shorter  routes  which  connected  big  cities  to  smaller  ones.—And  that  led  to  making  jetliner  travel  more  accessible  to  more  Americans.Bottom  line:  The  DC-9  helped  Americans  who  live  in  smaller  towns  embrace  air  travel.  It's  hard  to  know  for  sure,  but  experts  estimate  the  DC-9  series  has  flown  perhaps  2  or  3  billion  passengers  between  its  first  commercial  flight  on  December  8,  1965,  and  its  last  flight  on  January  6."I  think  its  age  alone  puts  it  in  the  hall  of  fame,  just  on  longevity,"  said  William  Swelbar,  an  aviation  industry  blogger,  consultant  and  research  engineer  at  the  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology.  "Post-deregulation,  the  DC-9  was  incredibly  important  in  building  hubs  in  lots  and  lots  of  smallish  markets."  Swelbar  said  it  had  a  direct  impact  on  the  growth  of  air  travel  to  smaller  cities  like  Green  Bay,  Wisconsin."Today  that  airplane  would  arguably  be  too  big  to  serve  Green  Bay  --  because  now  Green  Bay  is  served  by  a  number  of  smaller  regional  jets,"  he  said.  "But  the  fact  of  the  matter  is,  the  DC-9  really  helped  make  Green  Bay  an  important  point  on  a  number  of  airline  maps."Affectionate  nicknames  for  the  plane  stuck.  Some  called  it  the  Chuck  Niner.  More  powerful  versions  were  called  "Sport  Nines."  Labels  like  "Dirty  Niner"  and  "Diesel  9"  were  veiled  references  to  its  smoky,  loud  engines  during  the  early  days."As  an  ex-Northwest  employee  I  can't  say  enough  great  things  about  the  Diesel  9,"  wrote  CNN  commenter  Keith  Montgomery.  The  plane's  rear-mounted  engines  made  loading  and  unloading  luggage  faster,  he  wrote,  because  baggage  handlers  didn't  have  to  wait  for  the  engines  to  "spool  down"  before  they  could  access  the  bags.By  the  late  '60s,  the  buzz  was  growing  and  Hefner  wanted  one.  In  1969  he  took  delivery  of  a  DC-9-32  --  a  longer  version  than  the  original  --  painted  black  and  stenciled  with  the  iconic  bunny  logo  on  the  tail.  The  aircraft  was  dubbed  "The  Big  Bunny."  Riding  this  sleek  chariot,  the  Playboy  prince  whisked  his  bright-eyed  girlfriend  Barbi  Benton  on  a  whirlwind  trip  to  Europe  and  Africa  in  1970.  Video  posted  on  YouTube  shows  the  plane  as  a  high-altitude  party  palace,  complete  with  a  reel-to-reel  videotape  player,  a  shower,  and  a  disco.In  1977,  BWIA  West  Indies  Airways  celebrated  the  crowning  of  Trinidad  and  Tobago's  first  Miss  Universe,  Janelle  Penny  Commissiong,  by  naming  a  DC-9  in  her  honor.More  recently,  the  plane  played  a  role  in  the  2012  election.  GOP  presidential  nominee  Mitt  Romney  trusted  a  DC-9  to  ferry  his  running  mate,  Paul  Ryan,  from  stump  speech  to  stump  speech.  By  the  way,  that  plane  --  built  in  1970  --  was  the  same  age  as  the  vice  presidential  candidate.Since  1965,  Delta  --  the  first  carrier  to  fly  DC-9s  --  has  flown  a  total  of  305  of  them  --  nearly  a  third  of  the  over  970  that  McDonnell  Douglas  manufactured  until  production  ended  in  1982.This  isn't  the  first  time  Delta  has  retired  the  DC-9.  The  Atlanta-based  airline  got  rid  of  their  first  fleet  of  DC-9s  in  1993.  But  15  years  later,  it  acquired  72  DC-9s  as  part  of  a  merger  with  Northwest.  It's  been  taking  those  planes  out  of  service  little  by  little  until  last  week,  when  Delta  retired  its  final  six.  (Delta  said  two  of  those  DC-9s  will  remain  on  standby  for  a  few  weeks  as  backup  planes.)Not  wanting  to  ignore  a  key  moment  in  the  history  of  an  aviation  icon,  Delta  hosted  a  small  ceremony  with  cake  and  balloons  on  Monday  at  Minneapolis-St.  Paul  International  Airport.  The  DC-9  chosen  for  the  final  passenger  flight  was  a  120-seat  Series  50  model  built  in  1978.  Its  FAA  registry  number:  N773NC.Aboard  the  plane  was  aviation  correspondent  Jack  Harty  of  Airchive.com.  "It  was  bittersweet,"  he  said,  reflecting  on  the  passing  of  a  relic  from  a  different  time  when  on-board  WiFi  sounded  like  science  fiction  and  lighting  up  a  Marlboro  was  commonplace.While  still  on  the  ground,  Harty  got  a  peak  inside  the  flight  deck.  He  found  no  advanced  flight  management  computer  and  none  of  the  modern,  so-called  "glass  cockpit"  digital  displays  you  might  find  on  newer  airliners.  The  plane's  instruments  were  a  throwback  to  1970s  technology  --  lots  of  old-fashioned  round,  analog  dials.N773NC's  first  airline  was  North  Central  in  '78.  A  year  later,  it  was  obtained  by  Republic.  It  changed  airlines  again  in  1986  when  Northwest  swallowed  Republic.  In  2009,  it  got  a  Delta  paint  job,  after  Delta's  mashup  with  Northwest.Eventually  it  was  time  for  Harty  to  board  N773NC  for  Delta's  final  scheduled  DC-9  passenger  flight  --  appropriately  named  Flight  2014  --  from  Minneapolis  to  Atlanta.  Once  in  the  air,  the  crew  led  passengers  in  a  quick  champagne  toast  to  honor  the  aircraft.By  the  way,  another  storied  airliner  from  the  same  era,  the  DC-10,  will  reportedly  make  its  final  passenger  flight  in  February  from  Dhaka,  Bangladesh,  to  Birmingham,  England.The  DC-9  leaves  behind  a  powerful  design  legacy  that  will  fly  for  years.  Aviation  geeks  point  to  what  they  call  "variants"  of  the  plane  which  are  still  going  strong,  including  the  MD  series  --  the  MD-88  and  the  MD-90.  Another  plane  with  design  roots  reaching  back  to  the  DC-9  is  the  Boeing  717.  These  planes  all  look  a  lot  like  the  DC-9,  with  their  rear-mounted  engines  --  and  of  course  that  cool-looking  T-Tail.To  replace  the  DC-9s  and  other  retiring  planes,  Delta  is  acquiring  36  717s  this  year  from  AirTran  and  another  36  in  2015.  The  110-seat  717s  have  a  range  that  will  allow  them  to  fly  all  of  the  airline's  domestic  routes.By  2017,  Delta  also  plans  to  add  40  Airbus  planes  to  its  fleet,  including  the  international  widebody  A330-300  and  --  for  domestic  routes  --  the  single-aisle  A321.Delta  also  is  the  process  of  buying  100  new  Boeing  737-900ERs  to  replace  older  757s  and  767s.Get  ready  for  a  lot  more  airliners  to  retire  between  now  and  2019.  The  aviation  consulting  firm  ICF  SH&E  predicts  more  commercial  jets  will  be  retired  worldwide  this  decade  than  ever  before  --  somewhere  between  6,000-8,000.  Compare  that  to  about  1,700  commercial  jets  that  were  retired  in  the  entire  1990s.The  time  is  right  for  airlines  to  buy  newer  planes,  experts  say,  because  interest  rates  are  relatively  low,  and  higher  fuel  prices  require  newer,  efficient  engines.As  for  the  exiting  DC-9s,  one  will  be  handpicked  for  permanent  display  at  the  Delta  Flight  Museum  in  Atlanta."It  was  a  robust  workhorse  of  an  airplane,"  said  Delta  spokesman  Michael  Thomas.

The  result  is  a  lively  community  of  startups,  hobbyists  and  photographers  who  have  embraced  the  still-young  technology.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>American  Canyon,  California  (CNN)  --  Marque  Cornblatt's  interest  in  drones  began  with  a  bit  of  playful  drone-on-drone  violence.He  began  attending  "Fight  Club"-like  meetups  in  the  Bay  Area  where  enthusiasts  pit  the  amateur  flying  machines  against  each  other  in  bloodless  battles  of  strength  and  flying  technique."We  were  beginners,  so  just  getting  off  the  ground  caused  damage,"  Cornblatt  said  of  the  dogfights,  which  were  won  by  whichever  drone  lasted  the  longest  and  got  back  up  in  the  air  fastest.And  so  the  idea  for  an  "indestructible"  drone  design  was  born.  Cornblatt,  along  with  Eli  D'Elia,  started  Game  of  Drones.  Using  an  extremely  durable  plastic  called  Kydex,  the  company  creates  inexpensive  but  rugged  drones  capable  of  surviving  everything  from  high-impact  crashes  to  shotgun  blasts.For  many,  the  word  "drone"  still  conjures  images  of  military  strikes  or  a  near-future  retail  fleet  delivering  packages  or  pizzas.  But  while  commercial  uses  of  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  are  banned  while  tangled  up  in  federal  regulations,  a  growing  number  of  drone  enthusiasts  are  embracing  the  still-young  technology  as  a  creative  new  pursuit.The  result  is  a  lively  community  of  hobbyists,  entrepreneurs  and  aerial  photographers,  some  of  whom  gathered  this  week  for  a  picnic  and  flying  demonstration  in  a  suburban  field  south  of  Napa.  The  "drone  fly-in"  event  was  the  brainchild  of  Make  magazine,  which  is  celebrating  a  new  all-drone  issue."The  technology  is  still  very  much  in  the  hands  of  the  do-it-yourselfers  and  the  enthusiasts,"  said  Mike  Senese,  Make's  executive  editor.Rise  of  the  DIY  dronesThe  Maker  movement,  with  its  legions  of  tinkerers,  is  an  ideal  community  to  embrace  drones.  The  DIY  drone  technology  has  grown  organically  from  existing  popular  maker  interests,  including  micro-controllers,  robotics  and  radio-controlled  vehicles.  Drones  combine  all  those  disciplines  to  create  advanced  and  programmable  versions  of  what  look  like  toy  helicopters.The  most  practical  and  popular  use  for  the  devices  is  aerial  photography.  Lightweight  cameras  like  GoPros  can  be  affixed  to  drones  such  as  the  DJI  Phantom  quadcopter  or  the  forthcoming  $750  Iris  from  3D  Robotics.  Specialized  drone  rigs  can  even  hold  larger  professional  cameras.Soaring  up  to  several  hundred  feet  above  the  ground  produces  some  unbeatable  angles.  But  to  get  a  perfect  shot,  hobbyists  program  their  drones  with  precise  routes  and  mount  the  cameras  on  gimbals,  which  keep  the  camera  steady  and  pointed  in  one  direction  even  as  the  drone  moves  about."For  us,  drones  means  'capable  of  autonomy,'"  said  Chris  Anderson,  founder  of  3D  Robotics  and  the  former  editor  of  Wired  magazine.  Being  able  to  program  an  exact  path  for  a  drone  instead  of  manually  steering  it  is  what  makes  the  technology  so  promising  for  commercial  and  photography  use,  enthusiasts  say.Experimenting  and  makingPlaying  pilot  is  part  of  the  fun  for  hobbyists.  Just  as  there  are  a  variety  of  uses  for  drones,  there's  a  number  of  ways  to  steer  them.  The  more  traditional  controls  are  hand-held  joysticks  and  knobs.  More  advanced  controlling  can  be  done  through  computers  and  increasingly,  tablets  and  smartphones,  although  some  purists  claim  the  touchscreens  lack  the  tactile  satisfaction  of  physical  controls.A  startup  called  Fighting  Walrus  is  working  on  a  $129  accessory  (it  bears  a  slight  resemblance  to  walrus  tusks)  that  clips  onto  the  end  of  an  iPad  and  can  be  used  to  control  standard,  mid-range  drones  over  a  radio  connection.  With  the  app,  you  can  program  a  route  and  monitor  the  device's  flight  progress,  though  full  manual  controls  are  coming  in  a  future  update.The  most  immersive,  and  arguably  most  fun,  way  to  pilot  a  drone  is  through  first-person  view  (FPV).  A  small  camera  is  affixed  to  the  front  of  the  drone,  and  a  person  on  the  ground  views  a  live  stream  from  the  drone's  point  of  view  though  a  pair  of  goggles.  Users  can  control  the  drone's  direction  in  real  time,  which  feels  similar  to  piloting  an  aircraft  from  inside  a  cockpit.  Some  enthusiasts  even  use  FPV  setups  for  drone  races.Many  drones  are  square  quadcopters  and  it  can  be  difficult  to  tell  which  way  they're  facing  at  any  given  time.  The  FPV  live  stream  clears  up  any  confusion,  though  sometimes  it's  tricky  to  find  a  downed  drone  when  you  didn't  see  where  it  landed.Flying  under  the  radarThe  Federal  Aviation  Administration  is  expected  to  complete  standards  and  rules  for  commercial  drones  by  late  2015,  though  senators  and  lobbyists  are  pushing  for  an  earlier  deadline.  Until  the  FAA  clears  drones  for  flight  in  general  airspace,  the  devices  are  only  allowed  to  be  flown  for  recreation  and  below  400  feet.Manufacturers  of  professional  drones  are  stuck  on  the  sidelines  for  the  time  being,  but  this  has  left  the  door  open  for  hobbyists  to  experiment  and  invent.  The  consumer-first  approach  might  help  pave  the  way  for  more  widespread  acceptance  of  commercial  drones  whenever  they  take  to  the  air.Some  enterprising  drone  companies  are  already  doing  business  while  avoiding  the  glare  of  the  FAA.  Aerial  drone  photographers  are  selling  their  services  to  real  estate  companies  and  the  movie  and  TV  industry.  Journalists  have  used  the  devices  to  capture  footage  of  news  events.  A  handful  of  people  have  been  sent  cease  and  desist  letters  from  the  FAA.Because  they  can  be  outfitted  with  cameras,  microphones  and  other  surveillance  equipment,  drones  will  no  doubt  be  used  by  law  enforcement.  But  such  drones  will  have  to  battle  public  privacy  concerns  in  the  U.S."People  decide  what  they're  comfortable  with,"  said  Anderson,  who  pointed  out  that  it  will  continue  to  be  illegal  to  fly  drones  over  built-up  areas  like  housing  or  cities.Play  onDrones,  called  UAVs  by  large  companies  and  industry  groups,  are  expected  to  be  a  $89  billion  business  worldwide  in  the  next  decade,according  to  the  Teal  Group.  For  example,  agriculture  will  be  a  huge  market  for  the  devices,  which  could  allow  famers  to  monitor  crops  autonomously.For  now,  inventors  and  hobbyists  are  enjoying  improving  the  technology  while  waiting  for  the  commercial  industry  to  catch  up.  Photographers  are  skirting  around  regulations,  companies  are  selling  new  commercial  models  in  the  U.S.  and  in  countries  with  more  relaxed  regulations,  and  the  Game  of  Drones  guys  are  busy  with  their  high-tech  endurance  tests."I  took  [the  drone]  out  into  the  wasteland  with  a  baseball  bat  and  my  anger,"  said  Cornblatt.  "I've  wanted  to  destroy  them  but  I've  been  unable  to  do  so,  so  I  decided  to  sell  them."</TEXT></DOC>

The  prosecutor  will  ask  the  judge  to  set  a  $25,000  bond,  the  release  said.The  charges  of  one  count  of  aid  by  misrepresentation  and  two  counts  of  perjury  by  false  application  for  aid  accuse  Suleman  of  not  reporting  nearly  $30,000  in  earnings.From  June:  Suleman  books  stripper  gigs  to  save  homeHer  work  was  no  secret,  though.  Suleman,  38,  performed  in  adult  videos  and  danced  topless  at  a  Florida  strip  club  last  year."This  is  not  a  new  career  for  her,"  her  rep,  Gina  Rodriguez,  told  CNN  in  June  when  asked  about  her  stripping  gig.  "She  is  just  promoting  her  new  video."  An  adult  video  featuring  Suleman  was  released  in  June.Suleman  revealed  in  April  that  she  was  so  determined  to  build  a  future  for  her  14  young  children  that  she  would  accept  adult  entertainment  offers,  although  she  would  not  touch  another  "human's  flesh.""I  wouldn't  even  kiss  somebody  for  money,"  Suleman  told  CNN's  Nischelle  Turner.  "I  would  not  kiss  somebody.  I  wouldn't  touch  somebody."Suleman,  who  collected  food  stamps  to  feed  her  14  young  children,  filed  for  bankruptcy  in  May,  but  the  case  was  tossed  out  of  court  because  of  paperwork  issues.Suleman  dreams  of  building  a  business  "empire"  that  will  pay  for  food,  shelter  and  college  educations  for  her  14  children,  she  told  Turner.She  ultimately  hopes  to  become  a  role  model  for  other  women  facing  major  struggles,  she  said."I've  got  to  win  the  battle,"  she  said.  "But  right  now,  people  don't  understand  that."The  criminal  complaint,  filed  by  Deputy  District  Attorney  William  Clark  with  the  public  assistance  fraud  division,  said  Suleman  applied  for  public  assistance  in  Lancaster,  California,  in  January  2013.  It  alleges  that  she  failed  to  report  the  extra  income  earned  between  in  the  first  six  months  of  last  year.Suleman  faces  up  to  five  years,  eight  months  in  prison  if  convicted,  the  prosecutor  said.CNN's  Rosalina  Nieves  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

But  authorities  found  no  guns  in  the  car  the  teen  was  riding  in.The  case  is  garnering  international  attention  not  just  because  of  the  similarities  to  the  case  of  Trayvon  Martin  and  George  Zimmerman,  but  also  because  the  prosecutor  in  the  case  is  the  same:  State  Attorney  Angela  Corey.Michael  Dunn  shot  and  killed  Jordan  Davis,  17,  in  November  2012.Dunn  told  police  that  he  asked  Davis  and  three  other  teens,  who  were  parked  next  to  him  at  a  Jacksonville  gas  station,  to  turn  down  their  music.

It  was  a  sad  day  in  Portland  when  its  longtime  24-Hour  Church  of  Elvis,  a  roving  storefront  art  installation  dispensing  marriage  licenses  and  25-cent  pop  culture  trinkets,  closed  this  summer.  Luckily,  Voodoo  Doughnut  was  there  to  fill  in  the  gap.  This  cash-only,  24/7  doughnut  shop  performs  about  400  legal  weddings  a  year.  It  was  started  in  2003  by  Tres  Shannon,  a  flamboyant  one-time  mayoral  candidate,  and  Kenneth  "Cat  Daddy"  Pogson  to  feed  the  hangover  crowd.  The  FDA  eventually  put  the  kibosh  on  the  Nyquil,  Robitussin  and  Pepto-Bismo  doughnuts,  but  their  signature  voodoo  doughnut  lives  on.  It's  shaped  like  a  gingerbread  man  and  comes  with  a  pretzel  stick  in  the  belly  for  stabbing  and  drawing  blood,  er,  raspberry  jelly.  As  for  weddings,  which  come  with  coffee  and  doughnuts  for  up  to  60  guests,  Pogson  says  his  favorite  involved  a  groom  in  a  psychedelic  suit  who  brought  his  mother  in  an  urn.An  ice  cream  counter  that  tops  sundaes  with  worms.  At  the  Freakybuttrue  Peculiarium,  an  art  gallery,  novelty  shop  and  café  in  Portland's  Alphabet  District,  you  can  pick  up  everything  from  zombie  slippers  and  fake  dog  poop  to  plastic  eyeballs  to  float  in  your  gin  and  tonics.  Lots  of  people  show  up  just  to  pet  Bigfoot  (he's  10  feet  tall,  so  you  need  a  ladder),  leave  a  message  in  the  neon  graffiti  room  or  perform  an  autopsy  on  a  life-size  space  alien.  Daring  sorts  belly  up  to  the  ice  cream  counter  for  sundaes,  hot  dogs  and  other  treats  sprinkled  with  real  bug  larvae.  Tempting  as  it  is  to  think  "Sparky,"  the  on-display  ventriloquist-murdering  dummy,  is  the  mastermind  behind  this  house  of  terror,  it  was  actually  started  by  filmmaker  Mike  Wellins  and  two  friends.A  museum  where  vacuum  cleaners  are  out  of  the  closet.  Stark's  Vacuum  Cleaner  Museum  --  where  you  won't  find  crumbs,  cobwebs  or  a  single  dust  bunny  --  will  sweep  you  off  your  feet.  More  than  100  vintage  vacuums  from  the  late  1800s  up  to  the  1960s  are  on  display  in  a  10-foot-by-40-foot  wing  of  Stark's  Vacuums  in  downtown  Portland.  Other  than  during  the  summer  of  2012,  when  the  Vacuum  Cleaner  Collectors  Club  convened  at  this  Smithsonian  of  Sucking  Machines,  the  little  museum  averages  about  a  dozen  visitors  a  month  who  come  to  ogle  rare  pre-electricity  hand-pumped  vacs,  a  cardboard  model  from  the  penny-pinching  1930s,  an  Electrolux  on  runners  and  a  Duntley  Pneumatic  that  attaches  to  the  ceiling.  Needless  to  say,  the  museum's  carpet  is  spotless.A  city  park  that  can  fit  only  one  person  at  a  time.  Mill  Ends  Park,  the  world's  smallest,  is  a  2-foot  circle  and,  according  to  legend,  houses  the  only  leprechaun  colony  west  of  Ireland.  It  was  dedicated  on  St.  Patrick's  Day  1948  after  the  light  pole  for  which  it  was  intended  never  appeared.  Instead,  newspaper  columnist  Dick  Fagan  planted  flowers,  and  Patrick  O'Toole,  the  colony's  so-called  head  leprechaun,  approved,  at  various  times,  such  park  installations  as  a  swimming  pool  for  butterflies.  It  even  had  a  diving  board  and  a  miniature  Ferris  wheel.Costumed  adults  who  ride  bikes  with  banana  seats  down  a  710-foot  hill.  Not  only  does  Portland  have  the  highest  number  of  bike  commuters  it  the  U.S.,  it  has  a  club  of  self-described  anarchist  Zoobombers.  Every  Sunday  night  for  10  years,  they've  picked  out  a  bike  from  a  jumbled  pile  of  customized  kiddie  bikes  near  Powell's  Books,  loaded  it  onto  Portland's  light  rail  system  and  rode  up  to  the  Portland  Zoo,  where  they  unloaded,  walked  up  another  hill  and  then  zoomed  along  a  designated  route  through  Washington  Park.  The  weirder  the  costume,  the  funkier  the  bike,  the  better.</TEXT></DOC>

She  said  that  the  armed  men  had  replaced  Ukrainian  flags  with  Russian  standards  but  that  no  shots  had  been  fired.Ukrainian  navy  chief  Sergey  Gaiduk  was  taken  away.  Russia's  official  ITAR-Tass  news  agency,  citing  the  local  Kryminform  news  agency,  reported  Gaiduk  had  been  passed  to  the  Sevastopol  prosecutor's  office  to  be  questioned  about  whether  he'd  passed  on  orders  from  Kiev  for  Ukrainian  soldiers  to  use  their  weapons.Acting  President  Oleksandr  Turchynov  issued  a  9  p.m.  (3  p.m.  ET)  deadline  for  Crimea  to  release  all  hostages  and  stop  all  provocations,  a  statement  on  the  presidential  website  said.  That  deadline  passed  with  no  apparent  consequences.It  had  warned  that  if  all  hostages,  including  Gaiduk,  were  not  released  by  then,  authorities  would  take  action  of  "technical  and  technological  character,"  likely  meaning  turning  off  utilities.Meanwhile  in  Kiev,  officials  unveiled  a  series  of  new  measures  against  Russia  and  the  "self-proclaimed"  authorities  in  Crimea.In  a  televised  briefing,  Andriy  Porubiy,  secretary  of  the  national  defense  and  security  council,  said  the  measures  included  a  full-scale  visa  system  for  Russians  and  that  if  the  United  Nations  designates  Crimea  a  "demilitarized  zone,"  Ukraine  was  prepared  to  evacuate  its  military  personnel  and  family  members.  Ukraine  has  facilities  ready  to  accommodate  25,000  evacuees.The  country  has  decided  to  leave  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States,  an  organization  made  up  of  republics  of  the  former  Soviet  Union,  Porubiy  said.  Kiev  also  will  estimate  the  damages  caused  by  the  annexation.NATO:  'Business  as  usual  is  not  an  option'The  incident  at  the  navy  headquarters  comes  a  day  after  one  member  of  the  Ukrainian  military  was  killed,  another  wounded  and  more  captured  when  masked  gunmen  seized  their  base  near  the  Crimean  regional  capital,  Simferopol.After  that  fatality  --  the  first  Ukrainian  military  death  since  the  Crimean  crisis  erupted  about  two  weeks  ago  --  Ukraine's  Defense  Ministry  authorized  its  forces  to  open  fire  in  self-defense.  On  the  same  day,  Russian  President  Vladimir  Putin  announced  the  annexation  of  Crimea,  after  voters  in  the  semi-autonomous  territory  approved  a  hastily  called  weekend  referendum  on  separating  from  Ukraine.Speaking  in  Washington,  NATO  Secretary  General  Anders  Fogh  Rasmussen  warned  of  the  organization's  fear  that  Russia  may  move  into  eastern  Ukraine."I  see  Crimea  as  an  element  in,  in  a  greater  pattern,  in  a  more  long-term  Russian,  or  at  least  Putin,  strategy.  So,  of  course,  our  major  concern  now  is  whether  he  will  go  beyond  Crimea,  whether  Russia  will  intervene  in  the  eastern  parts  (of  Ukraine),"  he  said."No  one  wants  to  turn  away  from  our  cooperation  with  Russia,  but  no  one  can  ignore  that  Russia  has  violated  the  very  principles  upon  which  that  cooperation  is  built.  So  business  as  usual  is  not  an  option,"  Rasmussen  said.Elsewhere,  the  head  of  Ukraine's  state  TV  reportedly  was  assaulted  by  at  least  three  lawmakers  from  Ukraine's  far-right  Svoboda  party  and  forced  to  resign.  In  a  video  posted  online,  the  MPs  could  be  seen  arguing  with  to  Oleksandr  Panteleymonov,  asking  him  why  the  station  aired  a  concert  from  Moscow  live.  He  was  then  roughed  up.Speaking  to  CNN  by  phone  from  hospital  where  he  said  he  was  being  checked  for  injuries,  Panteleymonov  called  the  incident  a  "quarrel"  and  confirmed  he  had  to  sign  a  paper.The  U.S.  embassy  in  Kiev  condemned  the  incident.U.N.  chief  to  visit  Russia,  UkraineAs  diplomatic  efforts  to  resolve  the  crisis  continue,  the  United  Nations  said  Secretary-General  Ban  Ki-moon  would  visit  Russia  and  Ukraine  this  week  "as  part  of  his  diplomatic  efforts  to  encourage  all  parties  to  resolve  the  current  crisis  peacefully."He  will  meet  Putin  and  Russian  Foreign  Minister  Sergey  Lavrov  in  Moscow  on  Thursday  and  Turchynov  and  Prime  Minister  Arseniy  Yatsenyuk  on  Friday  in  Kiev.Speaking  at  the  United  Nations  on  Wednesday,  Ukraine's  U.N.  Ambassador  Yuriy  Sergeyev  called  upon  "the  entire  civilized  world  not  to  recognize  the  illegitimately  declared  independence  of  Crimea  and  its  violent  dismembering  from  the  territory  of  our  country."He  expressed  reservations  about  the  referendum,  saying  that  Russian  citizens  were  able  to  vote  and  journalists  were  banned."The  declaration  of  independence  by  the  Crimean  Republic  is  a  direct  consequence  of  the  application  of  the  use  of  force  and  threats  against  Ukraine  by  the  Russian  Federation,"  Sergeyev  said.U.S.  Ambassador  Samantha  Power  echoed  his  comments,  stressing  that  what  happened  in  Crimea  cannot  be  recognized  as  valid,  nor  can  it  be  repeated  in  other  parts  of  Ukraine."A  thief  can  steal  property,  but  that  does  not  confer  the  right  of  ownership  on  the  thief,"  she  said.U.S.  Vice  President  Joe  Biden,  dispatched  to  reassure  NATO  allies  in  Eastern  Europe  and  the  Baltics,  met  Wednesday  with  the  presidents  of  Lithuania  and  Latvia  in  Lithuania's  capital,  Vilnius.He  stressed  the  United  States  was  committed  to  the  defense  of  its  NATO  allies  and  had  stern  words  for  Moscow's  response  to  the  political  upheaval  in  Ukraine."Russia  has  chosen  to  respond  with  military  aggression,  a  referendum  rejected  by  virtually  the  entire  world,  illegal  efforts  to  annex  Crimea  and  now  reports  of  armed  attacks  against  Ukrainian  military  personnel  and  installations  in  Crimea,"  he  said."I  want  to  make  it  clear:  We  stand  resolutely  with  our  Baltic  allies  in  support  of  the  Ukrainian  people  and  against  Russian  aggression."U.S.  officials  are  keeping  a  close  eye  on  the  growing  number  of  heavily  equipped  Russian  forces  near  the  Ukraine  border  because  of  concern  the  troops  could  move  into  Ukraine  with  little  or  no  warning.One  U.S.  official  with  access  to  the  latest  intelligence  said  the  estimate  is  that  in  recent  days,  Russia  has  assembled  up  to  20,000  forces  in  "motorized"  units.  They  are  so  close  to  the  border  that  the  United  States  would  not  have  enough  time  to  predict  what  they  might  do,  but  would  only  see  it  as  it  was  happening,  the  official  said.  One  theory  the  U.S.  is  considering  is  that  the  Russians  may  plan  to  establish  a  "land  bridge"  into  Crimea,  the  official  said.  He  described  it  as  moving  forces  to  an  area  they  can  control,  so  they  have  assured  access  in  the  future.Also  Wednesday,  Ukraine's  deputy  premier,  Vitaly  Yarema,  and  acting  Defense  Minister  Ihor  Tenuyh  took  off  from  Kiev,  planning  to  fly  to  Crimea  to  "resolve  all  problematic  issues,"  but  Crimean  authorities  would  not  allow  them  to  land,  the  statement  on  the  Ukrainian  presidential  website  said.Escalation  fearYatsenyuk  warned  Tuesday  the  crisis  was  shifting  "from  political  to  the  military  form,  and  the  blame  is  on  the  Russian  military."The  weekend's  contested  referendum  has  been  condemned  by  the  interim  Kiev  government,  the  United  States  and  the  European  Union.  But  Russia  remains  steadfastly  defiant.For  Ukrainians,  'it's  hard  to  not  be  concerned'Russia's  Constitutional  Court  unanimously  ruled  Wednesday  that  the  agreement  between  the  Russian  Federation  and  Crimea  on  its  accession  to  Russia  was  lawful,  state  news  agency  RIA  Novosti  reported.The  step  clears  the  way  for  the  country's  lawmakers  to  vote  on  ratifying  the  accession  agreement,  as  well  as  draft  amendments  to  the  Russian  Constitution,  it  said.The  State  Duma,  or  lower  house,  will  hold  a  special  session  Thursday  to  ratify  the  treaty,  ITAR-Tass  reported.Putin  made  it  clear  Tuesday,  in  a  speech  greeted  by  enthusiastic  applause  by  Russian  lawmakers,  that  Moscow  has  no  intention  of  relinquishing  its  grip  on  Crimea,  a  Black  Sea  peninsula  with  historical  ties  to  Russia."In  our  hearts,  we  know  Crimea  has  always  been  an  inalienable  part  of  Russia,"  he  said.Of  those  who  cast  a  ballot,  96.7%  voted  in  favor  of  Crimea  leaving  Ukraine  and  joining  Russia,  according  to  the  Crimean  Electoral  Commission.  But  the  ballot  questions  offered  no  real  option  for  any  residents  who  wanted  to  remain  part  of  Ukraine.Putin  said  Russia  had  to  act  because  Ukraine's  new  government,  backed  by  Washington  and  European  powers,  was  prepared  "to  seize  the  state  through  terror  and  murders."But  Yatsenyuk  called  it  "a  robbery  on  an  international  scale,"  one  that  Kiev  will  never  accept.Members  of  the  Russian  parliament  and  the  new  Crimean  legislature  met  Wednesday  morning  in  Moscow  to  discuss  the  details  of  how  the  region  will  join  Russia.Russia's  annexation  of  Crimea  opportune  or  opportunistic?Rising  tensionsCrimean  lawmakers  have  said  they  now  see  Ukrainian  soldiers  as  an  occupying  force  and  have  given  them  a  certain  amount  of  time  to  leave  the  peninsula.The  Ukrainian  troops  have  been  encircled  by  pro-Russian  forces  in  their  bases  for  days.They  have  also  come  under  pressure  from  pro-Russian  crowds  who  gather  outside  and  call  on  those  still  loyal  to  Kiev  to  surrender  or  defect  to  Russia's  military.  CNN  teams  on  the  ground  have  seen  Russian  forces  also  show  up  to  reinforce  that  message.Putin  has  denied  Russia's  military  has  been  used  in  Crimea,  despite  what  has  been  stated  by  international  observers  and  the  government  of  Kiev.  The  pro-Russian  forces  seen  in  Crimea  are  Crimean  "self-defense"  forces,  he  said.Putin  said  the  22,000  Russian  troops  in  Crimea  did  not  enter  during  the  current  crisis,  but  "were  already  there,"  in  accordance  with  previous  international  negotiations.Russian  forces  were  allowed  in  Crimea  under  a  treaty  that  allowed  the  Black  Sea  fleet  to  be  based  in  the  port  of  Sevastopol,  but  their  movements  within  Crimea  are  supposed  to  be  agreed  upon  with  Kiev.U.S.  and  EU  officials  have  imposed  sanctions  on  more  than  two  dozen  Russian  and  Crimean  officials  and  urged  Russia  to  avoid  escalating  the  crisis,  but  Moscow  has  ignored  those  calls.Putin  may  be  under  international  pressure  over  Russia's  actions  in  Crimea,  but  public  opinion  is  firmly  behind  him  at  home.Cheering  crowds  celebrated  the  announcement  that  Crimea  was  now  part  of  Russia  at  some  80  rallies  across  the  country,  from  Vladivostok  to  Moscow's  Red  Square.READ:  U.S.  warns  Russia:  More  sanctions  coming  due  to  Ukraine  crisisREAD:  Crimea  remarries  --  but  that  divorce  will  be  messyREAD:  Crimea's  vote:  Was  it  legal?READ:  Amanpour  blog:  Ukraine  on  brink  of  'very  dangerous  conflict'CNN's  Nick  Paton  Walsh  reported  from  Simferopol  and  Ivan  Watson  from  Kiev,  while  Laura  Smith-Spark  wrote  and  reported  from  London.

The  investigators  will  "conduct  an  environmental  health  assessment  and  evaluate  the  outbreak  and  response  activities."The  CDC  is  also  testing  stool  samples  from  the  sickened  passengers  and  crew,  the  agency  said.Holland  America  officials  did  not  immediately  respond  to  requests  for  comment.The  Veendam  carried  1,273  passengers  and  a  crew  of  575,  the  CDC  said.Hundreds  of  people  aboard  two  cruise  ships  in  the  Caribbean  fell  ill  with  norovirus  last  month.  The  CDC  reported  that  norovirus  hit  more  than  600  passengers  and  crew  on  Royal  Caribbean's  Explorer  of  the  Seas  in  January,  making  it  one  of  the  biggest  such  outbreaks  on  any  cruise  ship  in  the  past  two  decades.The  Caribbean  Princess,  operated  by  Princess  Cruises,  cut  short  its  seven-day  Caribbean  itinerary  last  month  after  178  passengers  and  11  crew  members  were  stricken  with  norovirus.  CDC  staffers  helped  sanitize  that  ship.The  Veendam  got  a  failing  grade  from  CDC  inspectors  who  found  multiple  sanitation  violations,  including  brown  liquid  dripping  on  clean  dishes  and  a  fly  on  the  buffet,  in  September,  the  CDC  said."While  unacceptable  for  Holland  America  Line,  the  unsatisfactory  score  is  highly  unusual  and  an  aberration,"  Holland  America's  Sally  Andrews  said  last  year.Inspectors  don't  tell  cruise  lines  when  they're  going  to  show  up,  but  they  visit  twice  a  year  as  part  of  the  CDC's  vessel  sanitation  inspection  program.  The  CDC  grades  ships  on  a  100-point  scale.  An  85  or  lower  is  considered  a  failing  grade.  The  Veendam  received  a  grade  of  77."Since  1996,  Veendam  has  received  passing  scores  on  32  inspections,"  Andrews  said.The  Veendam  is  a  16-year-old  ship,  christened  by  actress  Debbie  Reynolds,  that  can  carry  1,930  passengers  and  crew,  according  to  Holland  America.CNN's  AnneClaire  Stapleton  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

I  really  expected  so  much  better  from  the  Italian  justice  system,"  she  said.  "They  found  me  innocent  before.  How  can  they  say  that  it's  guilt  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt?"An  appeals  court  found  Knox  and  her  former  boyfriend,  Raffaele  Sollecito,  guilty  of  murder  in  the  Italian  city  of  Florence  after  a  retrial.Her  attorney,  Ted  Simon,  told  CNN's  "New  Day"  that  he  had  been  in  touch  with  Knox  and  her  family  all  day  as  they  awaited  the  court's  decision."It  was  terrible  news,"  he  said.  "She  understands  more  than  anyone  that  a  wrongful  conviction  is  unjust,  not  just  for  the  accused  but  for  the  victim,  their  family,  as  well  as  society,  and  she  feels  this  very  personally."Knox's  conviction  has  raised  questions  about  her  possible  extradition  to  Italy  to  serve  her  28½-year  sentence,  handed  down  in  absentia,  since  she  has  been  in  the  United  States  throughout  the  retrial.But  Simon  said  it  was  too  early  to  talk  about  extradition  since  there  is  still  an  appeals  process  to  go  through,  which  will  probably  last  another  year.Citing  privacy  and  confidentiality  issues,  State  Department  spokeswoman  Marie  Harf  declined  to  say  whether  Italy  has  requested  Knox  be  extradited.Knox,  26,  told  ABC  she  would  fight  every  step  of  the  way."I  will  never  go  willingly  back  to  the  place  where  I  --  I'm  gonna  fight  this  until  the  very  end,"  she  said.Asked  how  she  was  coping  with  the  situation,  her  attorney  highlighted  her  strength  of  character."While  she  accepted  that  very  difficult  news,  she  has  rebounded.  She  has  shown  great  resilience  and  fortitude.  And  with  a  great  deal  of  family  support,  they're  going  to  go  forward  and  appeal  what  we  would  characterize  as  a  completely  unjust  conviction,"  Simon  said.The  attorney  argued  there  was  "no  evidence"  implicating  his  client  in  the  murder  and  never  had  been,  adding  that  it  was  "incomprehensible"  that  the  court  had  found  her  guilty.Sollecito  stopped  near  borderEarlier  Friday,  Italian  authorities  stopped  Sollecito  near  the  border  with  Austria  and  Slovenia,  Italian  police  told  CNN.Sollecito,  who  is  not  allowed  to  leave  Italy  while  the  legal  process  continues,  was  halted  in  the  northern  Italian  town  of  Udine,  police  said.The  Slovenian  border  is  less  than  20  miles  east  of  Udine,  and  the  border  with  Austria  lies  about  55  miles  to  the  north.Sollecito's  lawyer,  Luca  Maori,  said  his  client  was  indeed  in  Udine  with  his  girlfriend.  They  were  driving  to  the  town  of  Treviso,  where  his  girlfriend  lives,  and  because  of  the  snow  had  to  stop,  the  lawyer  said.Maori  told  CNN  it  was  not  Sollecito's  intent  to  flee  the  country.Prosecutors  said  the  couple  killed  Kercher,  a  British  student,  in  November  2007.  Sollecito  was  sentenced  to  25  years  in  prison.  Both  denied  murder.Kercher,  21,  was  found  partially  nude  in  a  pool  of  blood  in  the  house  she  shared  with  Knox  in  the  picturesque  town  of  Perugia,  where  both  women  were  exchange  students.But  despite  years  of  courtroom  battles  over  her  death,  many  aspects  of  the  crime  still  remain  unexplained.'Journey  to  the  truth'On  Friday  morning,  Kercher's  siblings  spoke  in  Florence  about  their  family's  long  ordeal.Her  sister,  Stephanie  Kercher,  said  the  family  might  never  know  exactly  what  happened  on  the  night  of  her  death."I  think  we  are  still  on  the  journey  to  the  truth,"  she  said.  "I  think  it  may  be  the  fact  that  we  don't  ever  really  know  what  happened  that  night,  which  is  obviously  something  we  will  have  to  come  to  terms  with."Lyle  Kercher,  Meredith's  brother,  said  the  family  may  have  to  wait  until  spring  2015  for  a  final  resolution,  since  the  verdicts  reached  Thursday  can  still  be  appealed  at  Italy's  Supreme  Court."Nothing  is  going  to  bring  Meredith  back,  nothing  will  take  away  the  horror  of  what  happened  to  her,"  he  said."The  best  we  can  hope  for  is  finally  bringing  this  whole  case  to  a  conclusion,  having  a  conviction,  and  everyone  can  move  on  with  their  lives."If  the  Supreme  Court  upholds  the  murder  conviction,  he  expects  to  see  Italian  authorities  make  an  extradition  request  to  the  United  States  so  that  Knox  serves  her  sentence  in  Italy,  he  said.Stephanie  Kercher  said  that  she  had  been  told  of  a  letter  written  by  Knox  to  the  Kercher  family  but  that  she  had  not  seen  it.She  also  appeared  to  rule  out  meeting  with  Knox  in  the  future,  despite  the  American's  overtures  to  the  family  and  whatever  the  final  outcome  of  the  case."We've  asked  to  have  our  wishes  respected  in  that  we  would  like  to  be  together  as  a  family  to  remember  Meredith,"  she  said.  "A  lot  has  happened  over  this  length  of  time.  It  would  be  very  difficult  to  meet  someone  having  had  all  that  happen."Read  more:  Six  things  to  know  about  Amanda  Knox  retrial  verdictPair  first  convicted  in  2009Knox  and  Sollecito  were  first  convicted  in  2009,  but  those  charges  were  overturned  on  appeal  in  2011  and  the  pair  were  freed,  having  spent  four  years  in  prison.In  March  of  last  year,  Italy's  Supreme  Court  overturned  the  pair's  acquittals,  leading  to  the  retrial  that  resulted  Thursday  night  in  their  convictions  for  murder  being  reinstated  by  a  Florence  appeals  court.Knox,  who  remained  at  home  in  Seattle,  Washington,  while  the  retrial  was  held,  said  in  a  written  statement  Thursday  that  her  conviction  would  bring  no  consolation  to  the  Kercher  family.Presiding  Judge  Alessandro  Nencini  has  90  days  to  write  his  arguments  behind  the  jury's  ruling.

Terrified  passengers  huddled  on  decks  worried  about  their  safety,  she  said,  with  foul  toilets  overflowing  into  hallways,  no  power,  near-total  darkness,  long  lines  for  rationed  water  and  almost  no  food.Townsend  described  how  she  finally  reached  her  mother  on  the  phone  when  the  broken  ship  got  towed  into  Mobile,  Alabama,  days  late  from  what  was  supposed  to  have  been  the  vacation  of  a  lifetime.  She  told  the  court  she  begged  her  mother  to  come  get  her  immediately.  And  as  she  spoke,  her  voice  trailed  away,  she  looked  down,  and  began  sobbing  in  the  witness  chair.Townsend  was  one  of  numerous  Carnival  Triumph  passengers  who  testified,  sometimes  crying,  about  the  conditions  on  the  boat  and  how  they  still  suffer  one  year  later.Who  got  injured  and  how  much  is  it  worth?The  trial  is  expected  to  continue  for  several  weeks,  with  lawyers  for  passengers  suing  Carnival  Corp.  and  lawyers  for  the  cruise  line  arguing  over  whether,  and  to  what  degree,  passengers  got  injured,  if  they  remain  hurt  and  how  much  Carnival  should  pay  for  those  damages.But  while  testimony  has  finished  only  its  first  week,  the  legal  case  has  already  brought  some  unusual  and  significant  rulings  from  the  judge,  U.S.  District  Judge  Donald  Graham.Before  testimony  began,  Graham  ruled  Carnival  is  liable  and  responsible  for  the  fire  on  board  the  Triumph  because  of  negligence  on  the  part  of  the  company.  The  judge  agreed  with  the  plaintiffs,  who  argued  a  presumption  of  liability  based  upon  an  older  common  law  idea  of  negligence.  Going  back  to  the  Romans,  the  Latin  doctrine  of  "res  ipsa  loquitur"  means  roughly  "the  thing  speaks  for  itself."The  judge's  ruling  is  sweeping  and  unusual  in  a  major  cruise  ship  disaster,  with  larger  possible  implications  for  future  cruises  and  passengers."The  Court  finds  that  the  record  evidence  demonstrates  that  the  fire  and  resulting  conditions  experienced  by  Plaintiffs  aboard  the  Triumph  is  a  mishap  that  ordinarily  does  not  occur  in  the  absence  of  negligence,"  wrote  Graham.  "It  is  highly  likely  that  Carnival  was  responsible  for  a  reasonably  probable  causes  to  which  the  accident  could  have  be  (sic)  attributed.  Here,  the  facts  of  the  occurrence  warrant  the  inference  of  negligence."Passengers  not  promised  a  safe  voyageBut  Graham  also  ruled  that  the  company  did  not  breach  its  contract  with  passengers,  agreeing  with  Carnival's  argument  that  when  passengers  bought  a  ticket,  they  were  never  promised  a  safe  voyage  at  all,  which  may  come  as  a  big  surprise  to  future  cruise  passengers."The  contract  ticket  makes  no  express  guarantee  for  safe  passage,  a  seaworthy  vessel,  adequate  and  wholesome  food,  and  sanitary  and  safe  living  conditions,"  wrote  Graham.  The  ruling  reflects  the  little  protections  afforded  to  passengers  as  currently  written  by  many  cruise  ship  companies.Graham  also  ruled  that  Carnival  does  not  have  to  pay  punitive  damages  to  plaintiffs  who  say  they  were  hurt  and  are  seeking  financial  compensation.Your  rights  on  a  cruise  ship"Carnival  contends  that  there  is  no  evidence  of  intentional  wrongdoing,"  Graham  wrote.  "Plaintiffs  have  failed  to  demonstrate  and  the  record  evidence  does  not  support  a  finding  of  intentional  misconduct."Next  on  the  agenda:  Graham  must  determine  which  passengers  were  injured,  how  much  Carnival  must  pay  for  those  injuries  and  how  long  the  company  must  pay.  Testimony  from  passengers  is  expected  to  continue  for  at  least  another  week.Many  passengers  have  already  testified  to  injuries  they  sustained  during  the  cruise,  though  few  are  physical  in  nature.'I  got  mentally  injured'"I  did  not  get  physically  injured.  I  got  mentally  injured,"  testified  Jean  Cripps,  a  74-year-old  grandmother  who  suffers  from  Parkinson's  disease.  She  went  on  the  cruise  with  her  husband,  Alton,  who  has  diabetes  and  a  hurt  leg  that  forced  him  to  retire  disabled.  The  elderly  couple  was  on  the  cruise  as  a  present  from  their  son,  David,  and  grandson,  Easton,  who  went  with  them."It  never  ends,  the  whole  experience  never  ends,"  testified  Cripps.  "It's  over  and  over  again.  We  had  two  good  days,"  she  said,  referring  to  the  first  days  of  the  cruise."But  that's  not  what  I  think  about.  I  think  about  the  smell,  the  stench  and  the  bad  things.  All  the  memories  come  flooding  back,  and  I  can't  stop  them."Are  cruise  ships  floating  petri  dishes?Among  the  worst  memories,  Cripps  testified,  was  the  fear  that  the  ship,  which  listed  severely  after  the  fire,  would  actually  turn  over  and  sink.Alton  had  to  go  several  days  without  his  diabetes  medicine  and  was  forced  to  climb  numerous  flights  of  often  slippery  stairs  with  his  bad  leg,  causing  him  to  fall  once."It  was  a  horrible  experience,"  testified  Michelle  Key,  48,  who  went  on  the  cruise  with  her  mother,  Fleda  Key,  68.  "I  walked  through  water  and  feces  and  urine,  no  telling  what  else,"  she  testified.  "We  would  slip  and  slide  through  greasy,  gross,  slippery  muck,"  she  said,  adding  "it  was  very  difficult"  for  her  mother.Fleda  Key  described  having  terrible  diarrhea  on  numerous  occasions  and  having  difficulty  finding  any  toilets  that  were  not  overflowing.Fear  of  dying  before  reaching  shore"There  was  lots  of  urine  and  feces  all  the  way  up  to  the  rim  of  every  one,"  she  said,  explaining  she  "choked  away  the  smell."  Like  many  of  the  witnesses,  she  testified  that  she  lived  for  days  in  total  fear  that  they  might  not  finish  the  voyage  alive.  "I  was  fearful,  downright  afraid  and  scared,"  said  Fleda  Key.Her  daughter,  like  many  of  those  testifying,  said  the  cruise  ship  company  kept  them  in  the  dark,  with  no  information  about  what  was  truly  happening,  and  did  not  care  for  them  properly."Carnival  Cruise  did  not  give  one  flip  about  the  ...  passengers  on  that  ship,"  Michelle  Key  testified.  "They  did  not  do  their  best."When  asked  by  Graham  what  Carnival  should  have  done,  she  responded,  "If  they  knew  something  was  wrong,  they  should  never  have  left  the  dock."Michelle  Key  may  have  been  referring  to  the  company's  internal  documents  that  became  public  through  this  lawsuit  in  December  and  obtained  exclusively  by  CNN.CNN  Exclusive:  Documents  show  Carnival  knew  of  fire  danger  before  ill-fated  cruiseThe  documents  revealed  the  fiasco  on  board  the  Carnival  Triumph  was  a  problem  waiting  to  happen.  Internal  company  documents  show  that  the  crew  of  the  Triumph  set  sail  in  February  with  only  four  of  six  generators  fully  operational,  knowing  that  the  company  had  an  ongoing  generator  fire  hazard  in  ships  across  its  fleet,  including  the  Triumph.A  Triumph  generator  was  overdue  for  maintenanceThe  first  trouble  with  Triumph  was  in  diesel  generator  No.  6  --  the  one  that  wound  up  catching  fire.  Starting  more  than  a  year  before  the  cruise,  that  generator  was  overdue  for  maintenance  and  often  not  in  compliance  with  the  safety  laws  of  the  sea,  known  as  SOLAS,  according  to  the  ship's  engineer.Read  the  document  about  the  generator  (PDF)Over  and  over  again,  Carnival's  own  maintenance  reports  stated  the  same  thing:  Diesel  generator  No.  6  was  overdue  for  maintenance.  The  company  says  the  fire  that  originated  with  the  generator  was  not  connected  to  the  lack  of  maintenance.  But,  during  that  same  period,  Carnival  learned  about  another,  even  more  alarming  safety  problem  in  the  engine  room:  fuel  lines.A  dangerous  pattern  of  leaks  had  emerged  on  other  Carnival  cruise  ships,  according  to  the  company's  documents.  In  fact,  Carnival's  Costa  Allegra  caught  fire  in  the  Indian  Ocean  in  February  2012  because  fuel  leaked  onto  a  hot  spot  and  ignited.  That  fire  left  the  ship  without  power  for  three  days  in  tropical  heat  of  nearly  100  degrees  Fahrenheit.Read  Carnival's  advisory  notice  (PDF)That  would  be  eerily  similar  to  what  started  the  fire  on  board  the  Triumph  one  year  later.Carnival  says  it  proactively  began  investigating  after  the  Costa  Allegra  fire  and  found  a  big  problem  in  a  different  type  of  fuel  line.  There  had  been  nine  incidents  resulting  in  fuel  leaks  associated  with  flexible  fuel  lines  in  just  two  years.Spate  of  fires  pose  problem  for  cruise  industryOn  January  2,  Carnival  issued  a  compliance  order,  giving  ships  two  months  to  address  the  problem  to  "ensure  a  suitable  spray  shield  ...  is  installed"  for  all  diesel  engines  using  the  flexible  fuel  lines.  "After  that  internal  study,  the  company  came  out  with  a  new  policy  to,  again,  shield  all  the  flanges  and  the  hoses,"  said  Mark  Jackson,  Carnival  Cruise  Lines  vice  president  of  technical  operations.What  went  wrong  on  the  'poop'  cruise?But  Carnival  did  not  in  fact  shield  the  part  of  the  one  hose  that  wound  up  causing  the  fire  on  board  the  Triumph  in  February."That  hose  was  beneath  the  deck  plates,  and  it  was  believed  the  deck  plates  would  provide  that  shield,"  Jackson  said.  "In  this  case,  it  (the  fuel  leak)  found  that  gap  in  the  hose  ...  in  the  bilge  plates  and  caused  the  fire."On  February  7  --  with  a  diesel  generator  still  in  need  of  overhaul  and  fuel  line  shields  on  some,  but  not  all,  of  its  flexible  hoses  --  Triumph  set  sail  from  Galveston,  Texas.  Three  days  later,  off  the  coast  of  Mexico,  a  fire  broke  out  in  diesel  generator  No.  6  when  fuel  sprayed  from  a  flexible  fuel  line,  even  though  that  fuel  line  was  only  6  months  old.Speaking  about  the  ship,  Jackson  said:  "We  were  totally  in  compliance  ...  with  all  the  rules  and  regulations.  ...  We  had  ...  our  regulating  bodies  on  board  the  ship  less  than  two  weeks  prior  that  had  certified  the  ship  to  sail.  Obviously,  you  learn  things  in  a  situation,  in  an  incident  such  as  the  Triumph."While  Carnival  Cruise  Lines  insists  that  what  happened  on  the  Triumph  was  just  an  accident,  the  company  has  dedicated  $300  million  in  a  fleetwide  safety  upgrade,  focusing  on  detecting  and  preventing  any  potential  fire  hazards  in  its  engine  rooms.Attorneys  for  both  sides  declined  to  speak  about  the  case  during  the  trial  but  their  opening  statements  provide  some  clues  about  their  respective  strategies.Asking  for  compensation  of  $1  millionIn  his  opening  statement,  plaintiffs'  attorney  Frank  Spagnoletti  of  Houston  told  the  court,  "There's  documented  evidence  with  regard  to  any  number  of  plaintiffs  that  show  that  they  were  physically  injured,  and  there  is  ample  documented  evidence  that  shows  that  all  of  the  plaintiffs  were  injured  mentally  because  of  the  way  they  were  exposed  to  this."When  pressed  for  details  on  compensation,  Spagnoletti  told  the  court  that  passengers  should  receive  anywhere  from  $30,000  to  $1  million,  depending  on  the  severity  of  their  injuries."What  happened  on  the  Triumph  "is  certainly  not  something  that  Carnival  would  ever  want  to  have  happen  and  would  ever  want  its  guests  to  experience,"  said  Miami  attorney  Curtis  Mase,  representing  Carnival.  But  he  also  told  Judge  Graham  that  many  of  the  plaintiffs  alleging  various  injuries  have  never  sought  medical  treatment  for  their  injuries  and  do  not  deserve  compensation."I  think  that  there's  no  one  who  I  would  suggest  to  you  is  entitled  to  receive  more  than  $50,000,  and  I'm  going  to  suggest  probably  lower  numbers  after  we've  heard  all  the  evidence,"  Mase  told  the  court."There  are  a  number  who  I  believe  deserve  nothing.  And  I  will  tell  you  this,  the  one  or  two  that  I  can  think  of  who  have  significant  injuries,  they're  very  much  in  the  minority  and  there  are  only  one  or  two."</TEXT></DOC>

Reeves'  lawyers  said  their  client  felt  threatened  by  a  much  larger,  younger  man.The  next  court  hearing  in  the  case  is  scheduled  for  March  12.Hours  earlier,  those  inside  the  same  courtroom  got  a  chance  to  see  surveillance  video  captured  on  January  13  from  inside  the  Grove  16  theater  in  the  Tampa  suburb  of  Wesley  Chapel.The  jumpy,  grainy  video  shows  Reeves  return  to  his  seat  at  1:26:19  p.m.,  according  to  the  video's  time  stamp.  Six  seconds  later,  Reeves  appears  to  lean  forward  but  only  for  a  second.At  1:26:30  p.m.,  the  video  stops  --  likely  because  the  motion  sensors  weren't  activated,  according  to  previous  testimony  in  Reeves'  bail  hearing  this  week  --  but  it  starts  recording  again  five  seconds  later.That's  when  a  hand  extends  in  front  of  Reeves,  from  the  seat  where  victim  Chad  Oulson  was  reportedly  sitting,  and  appears  to  snatch  something  from  Reeves  --  the  defense  has  repeatedly  said  Oulson  threw  popcorn  --  and  throws  it  into  Reeves'  face.Reeves'  right  hand,  the  one  Reeves  told  police  he  used  to  shoot  Oulson,  thrusts  forward  at  1:26:37  p.m.  A  strange  dust  falls  in  front  of  the  surveillance  video  lens  as  theater  patrons  begin  walking  over  to  the  area  where  Reeves  remains  seated.  It's  the  row  behind  where  a  mortally  wounded  Oulson  is  taking  his  last  breaths.No  threats  before  shooting,  widow  saysFriday's  hearing  began  with  police  testimony  and  video  of  police  interviews  with  Reeves  and  his  wife  immediately  after  the  shooting.During  that  interview,  Reeves  told  police  he  had  "reason  to  believe  (Oulson)  was  going  to  kick  my  ass"  after  Reeves  confronted  the  43-year-old  Navy  veteran  over  his  texting  during  the  previews  to  "Lone  Survivor."Reeves  and  his  wife  both  told  police  that  Oulson  began  using  foul  language,  and  Reeves  left  to  talk  to  a  theater  manager.  When  he  returned,  Oulson  stood  up  and  turned  around  to  confront  Reeves,  he  said."I  see  that  he's  very  explosive,  unnecessarily,"  Reeves  told  police.  "It  scared  the  crap  out  of  me."Oulson  edged  toward  Reeves  --  and  "he's  virtually  on  top  of  me"  --  and  Reeves  told  him  either  "no,  no,  no"  or  "whoa,  whoa,  whoa,"  he  couldn't  remember  which,  he  told  the  police  interrogator."He  hit  me  with  something.  I  assume  it  was  his  fist,"  Reeves  told  police.  "I  think  he  had  a  cell  phone  in  his  hand  because  I  saw  the  blur  of  the  screen.  ...  My  face  went  sideways.  My  glasses  came  partially  off."Widow  Nicole  Oulson  smirked  and  shook  her  head  as  Reeves  described  the  situation  in  court.Vivian  Reeves  backed  much  of  her  husband's  story  during  her  police  interview,  spelling  out  the  f-word  for  police  as  she  described  Chad  Oulson's  language  during  the  altercation.  Asked,  though,  if  she  saw  Chad  Oulson  strike  Curtis  Reeves,  she  replied  no.  Her  husband  told  her  he  had  been  struck  after  shooting  Chad  Oulson,  she  said.Widow:  'My  whole  world  just  got  shattered'Reeves  seemed  to  express  regret  in  the  police  interviews  immediately  after  the  shooting.  The  retired  Tampa  police  captain  said  if  he  had  been  20  years  younger,  he  and  Oulson  would  have  "wrestled  it  out,"  but  at  71,  "I  couldn't  take  anybody,  not  anymore."He  also  told  police  that  he  longed  for  a  second  chance  to  deal  with  the  situation,  in  which  case  he  and  his  wife  would  have  changed  seats  and  he  never  would  have  drawn  his  gun."If  I  had  to  do  it  over  again,  it  never  would've  happened.  We  would've  moved,  but  you  don't  get  do-overs,"  he  told  police.  "I  was  defending  myself.  It  doesn't  make  it  any  easier  for  me  to  accept  it,  but  that's  what  I  was  doing."Couple  describes  encounter  with  ReevesCNN's  Faith  Karimi  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

"So  that  is  the  wake-up  call."Russia's  aggression  "is  the  gravest  threat  to  European  security  in  a  generation  and  it  challenges  our  vision  of  a  Europe  whole,  free  and  at  peace,"  NATO  Secretary  General  Anders  Fogh  Rasmussen  told  reporters.In  a  joint  statement  announcing  the  suspension  of  cooperation,  the  ministers  said  political  dialogue  in  the  NATO-Russia  Council  could  continue,  "as  necessary,  at  the  ambassadorial  level  and  above,  to  allow  us  to  exchange  views,  first  and  foremost  on  this  crisis."They  said  they  would  review  NATO's  relations  with  Russia  at  their  next  meeting  in  June.  NATO  and  Russia  have  cooperated  on  an  anti-narcotics  operation  in  Afghanistan,  counterpiracy  and  various  counterterrorism  measures.  Rasmussen  said  cooperation  on  the  anti-narcotics  operations  would  continue.A  NATO  official  told  CNN  the  ministers  had  decided  the  alliance  would  develop,  as  a  matter  of  urgency,  "a  series  of  additional  measures  to  reinforce  NATO's  collective  defenses."These  would  include  possible  deployments  and  reinforcements  of  alliance  military  assets  in  Eastern  European  member  states,  a  possible  review  of  training  and  exercise  plans  in  the  near  term,  a  possible  increase  of  the  readiness  level  of  the  NATO  Response  Force,  and  a  possible  review  and  update  of  NATO  defense  and  military  plans,  the  official  said.Russian  troops  on  borderEarlier,  Rasmussen  said  he  saw  no  sign  that  Russia  is  pulling  its  forces  back  from  the  border  with  Ukraine."Unfortunately  I  cannot  confirm  that  Russia  is  withdrawing  its  troops,"  Rasmussen  said  at  the  opening  of  the  two-day  meeting.  "This  is  not  what  we're  seeing.  And  this  massive  military  buildup  can  in  no  way  contribute  to  a  de-escalation  of  the  situation."Concerns  are  high  that  Russia,  which  U.S.  officials  last  week  said  had  about  40,000  troops  near  the  frontier,  might  seek  to  enter  eastern  Ukraine,  after  it  annexed  Ukraine's  Crimea  region  last  month.Russian  President  Vladimir  Putin  told  German  Chancellor  Angela  Merkel  on  Monday  that  he'd  ordered  a  withdrawal  of  some  Russian  troops  from  his  country's  border  area  with  Ukraine,  Merkel's  office  said.  The  news  prompted  U.S.  State  Department  spokeswoman  Jen  Psaki  to  say  Monday  that  if  the  reports  were  accurate,  "it  would  be  a  welcome  preliminary  step."On  Tuesday,  Merkel  told  reporters:  "I  can  only  take  what  the  Russian  President  has  told  me.  I  will  of  course  try  to  find  out  whether  this  is  perceptible  or  not  perceptible."According  to  Russian  state  media  Monday,  one  Russian  infantry  battalion  was  being  moved  from  the  border  area  to  its  base  deeper  in  Russia.  A  battalion  would  typically  number  several  hundred  troops.But  Rasmussen  appeared  to  quash  hopes  that  the  situation  might  be  easing  with  his  remarks  Tuesday.  His  assessment  was  echoed  in  Brussels  by  UK  Foreign  Secretary  William  Hague,  who  said:  "We  have  had  some  statements  or  rumors  from  Russia  about  pulling  back  forces  from  the  eastern  border  of  Ukraine."But  we  haven't  seen  the  evidence  of  that  yet.  Of  course,  we  continue  to  call  for  that  and  continue  to  use  every  possible  diplomatic  lead  to  seek  a  de-escalation  of  this  crisis."Kerry,  among  those  in  Brussels  for  the  NATO  meeting,  also  called  for  a  Russian  withdrawal  in  lengthy  weekend  talks  in  Paris  with  his  Russian  counterpart,  Sergey  Lavrov.What  do  we  know  about  Russia's  troop  buildup  on  Ukraine's  border?NATO  and  Ukraine  cooperationThe  foreign  ministers  also  met  with  Ukraine's  acting  Foreign  Minister  Andriy  Deshchytsia  in  the  latest  demonstration  of  Western  support.  Moscow  does  not  recognize  Ukraine's  new  government,  saying  ousted  President  Viktor  Yanukovych  was  removed  in  an  unconstitutional  coup.In  a  joint  statement,  they  called  on  Moscow  "to  reverse  the  illegal  and  illegitimate  'annexation'  of  Crimea;  to  refrain  from  any  further  interference  and  aggressive  actions  in  Ukraine  ...  and  to  abide  by  international  law."At  the  same  time,  NATO  and  Ukraine  announced  they  would  intensify  cooperation  and  promote  defense  reforms  in  Ukraine  through  training  and  other  programs.Rasmussen  told  reporters  the  ministers  agreed  to  help  Ukraine  make  its  military  "more  professional  and  more  effective"  and  provide  advice  on  how  it  can  defend  its  infrastructure.  "A  possibility  is  also  deployment  of  mobile  training  teams  as  and  when  appropriate,"  he  said.Pressed  on  how  NATO  was  prepared  to  help  Ukraine  improve  its  military,  Rasmussen  cited  enhanced  military  exercises  as  an  example.As  the  talks  got  under  way,  Russia's  Foreign  Ministry  had  warned  Ukraine  against  seeking  integration  into  the  defense  alliance.Discussion  of  the  issue  while  Yanukovych  was  in  power  "led  to  freezing  of  Russian-Ukrainian  political  communications,  to  headaches  in  the  relationship  between  NATO  and  Russia  and,  what  is  the  most  dangerous,  to  the  deepening  of  the  split  of  Ukrainian  society,  the  majority  of  which  doesn't  support  the  idea  of  Ukraine  entering  NATO,"  a  Foreign  Ministry  statement  said.It  added  that  Kiev  must  understand  that  the  prospects  for  future  cooperation  between  Ukraine  and  Russia,  including  on  economic  matters,  "will  largely  depend  on  the  actions  Ukraine  takes  in  its  foreign  policy."Russia  annexed  Ukraine's  Crimean  Peninsula  last  month  amid  the  political  upheaval  that  followed  the  ouster  of  the  pro-Moscow  Yanukovych.Ukraine's  parliament  on  Tuesday  granted  permission  for  foreign  military  units,  including  some  from  NATO  countries,  to  conduct  military  exercises  in  Ukraine  in  2014.Such  military  exercises  by  foreign  troops,  including  naval  drills  in  the  Black  Sea,  are  an  annual  event  but  take  on  additional  significance  this  year  in  light  of  Russia's  military  takeover  of  Crimea.Gazprom  hikes  natural  gas  priceIn  a  move  that  will  heighten  pressure  on  the  interim  government  in  Kiev,  Russian  energy  giant  Gazprom  announced  a  sharp  increase  in  the  price  it  charges  Ukraine  for  natural  gas.Starting  Tuesday,  Ukraine  will  be  charged  $385.50  per  1,000  cubic  meters  of  gas,  up  from  the  previous  rate  of  $268.50,  Russian  state  news  agency  RIA  Novosti  quoted  Gazprom  Chief  Executive  Alexei  Miller  as  saying.The  move  ends  a  discount  that  was  agreed  to  before  Yanukovych  was  ousted  in  February  after  months  of  street  protests.The  gas  price  hike  will  only  increase  the  pressure  on  Ukraine's  interim  government  as  it  seeks  to  stave  off  economic  collapse.Ukraine,  which  is  heavily  reliant  on  Russia  for  energy,  is  also  $1.7  billion  in  arrears  in  its  payments  for  gas  already  supplied,  Miller  said,  according  to  RIA  Novosti.The  International  Monetary  Fund  last  week  agreed  to  lend  Ukraine  up  to  $18  billion  over  the  next  two  years  in  return  for  a  package  of  reforms,  including  to  its  energy  market.Kiev  has  been  running  dangerously  low  on  cash  to  pay  for  imports  and  service  its  debts  since  the  ouster  of  Yanukovych,  which  killed  off  a  $15  billion  financial  lifeline  from  Russia.READ:  Is  Crimea  gone?

Susan  Collins  of  Maine  is  launching  what  may  be  a  long-shot  effort  to  forge  bipartisan  compromise  over  a  minimum  wage  increase."I'm  reaching  out  to  members  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle  about  whether  or  not  it's  possible,"  the  Republican  told  a  handful  of  reporters  Tuesday.  "I  don't  know  whether  it  is."Collins  laid  out  a  possible  framework  she  is  floating  in  initial  conversations:•  Wages:  Increase  the  minimum  wage  to  something  higher  than  the  current  $7.25  an  hour,  but  lower  than  the  $10.10  that  Democrats  want.•  Hours:  To  bring  in  more  Republicans,  raise  the  number  of  hours  that  define  "full-time"  employees  under  Obamacare.  Currently  individuals  working  30  hours  or  more  are  "full-time"  under  the  law.•  Small  business:  Add  an  extension  of  small  business  tax  credits.Ryan  budget  aims  to  cut  $5.1  trillion,  balance  in  10  yearsThis  is  the  latest  example  of  Collins'  work  toward  finding  space  for  a  deal  on  large,  divisive  issues.  She  made  one  of  the  earliest  proposals  to  avoid  the  government  shutdown,  spent  weeks  trying  to  find  agreement  on  an  unemployment  benefits  extension,  and  has  regularly  been  a  key  vote  allowing  issues  to  come  to  the  Senate  floor.For  Collins,  $7.25  is  too  low.  But,  $10.10  an  hour  is  just  too  high."I've  talked  to  employers  in  Maine  who  have  said  they  would  have  to  curb  hiring  and  actually  have  to  lay  people  off  with  that  kind  of  increase,"  she  said,  "but  they  are  open  to  a  more  modest  increase,  they  could  accommodate  that."But  as  Collins  tries  to  find  a  middle  ground,  both  sides  of  the  debate  continue  digging  in  around  polar  positions.Obamacare  takes  minimum  wage  pitch  to  Michigan"If  (a  bill)  includes  raising  the  minimum  wage,  then  it's  a  bad  idea  to  put  people  out  of  work,"  said  Sen.  Pat  Toomey  of  Pennsylvania.  He  and  many  other  Republicans  cite  a  Congressional  Budget  Office  report  which  concluded  that  a  minimum  wage  increase  would  cost  the  country  hundreds  of  thousands  of  jobs.Toomey  was  well  known  for  his  attempt  at  compromise  over  background  checks  on  guns  last  year,  but  he  insists  he  is  not  budging  on  the  minimum  wage."If  you  (increase  it)  on  a  smaller  scale,  that  I  suppose  makes  it  less  bad,  but  it's  still  bad,"  he  said.As  Republicans  exclaim  "jobs,"  those  on  the  left  shout  "poverty.""That  minimum  wage  pay  of  $7.25  an  hour  is  really  a  starvation  wage,"  said  Sen.  Bernie  Sanders,  the  Vermont  independent.  He  and  many  Democrats  point  out  that  the  same  CBO  report  concluded  that  raising  the  minimum  wage  to  $10.10  would  lift  900,000  Americans  out  of  poverty,  but  a  lower  increase  would  have  just  one-third  the  effect.He  insists  he  won't  settle  for  a  penny  less  than  $10.10."No,  I  strongly  believe  we  need  to  have  a  $10.10  minimum  wage."Senate  Majority  Leader  Harry  Reid  of  Nevada  took  a  similar  stance  in  February.  And  what's  more,  Democrats  have  been  unyielding  toward  many  potential  changes  to  Obamacare,  including  proposals  to  redefine  "full-time"  employees.That  leaves  Collins  in  the  middle.Standing  by  herself  outside  the  Senate  doors,  she  smiled  and  stuck  to  her  goal  statement."I'm  trying  to  see  if  (a  potential  compromise)  could  garner  sufficient  support,"  she  told  reporters.Reid  has  said  a  minimum  wage  vote  could  come  up  in  the  Senate  as  soon  as  next  week.Asked  for  her  timeline,  Collins  shrugged,  "Well,  it's  coming  up  pretty  fast."Republicans  hit  a  nerve  when  it  comes  to  Obamacare</TEXT></DOC>

The  deal  called  for  Iran  to  roll  back  parts  of  its  nuclear  program  in  return  for  relief  from  some  sanctions.  That  agreement  went  into  effect  in  January.The  challenge  now  is  to  reach  a  permanent  deal  acceptable  to  all  sides.Obama  said  Thursday  that  "a  comprehensive  agreement  ...  this  year  can  help  open  up  new  possibilities  and  prosperity  for  the  Iranian  people  for  years  to  come."  That  includes  more  open  trade,  more  jobs  and  "more  opportunities  for  Iranian  students,"  according  to  the  President.Noting  the  progress  that  has  been  made,  Obama  stressed  that  "this  will  be  difficult."  At  the  same  time,  he  insisted  the  United  States  is  ready  to  talk."I'm  committed  to  diplomacy,"  the  President  said,  "because  I  believe  there  is  the  basis  for  a  practical  solution."READ:  P5+1  and  Iran  agree  on  nuclear  negotiation  framework  in  ViennaREAD:  Iran  nuclear  deal  commitments  kept  so  far,  U.S.  official  says</TEXT></DOC>

The  Kremlin  made  no  mention  of  a  withdrawal  in  its  description  of  the  call  but  said  the  two  leaders  discussed  Ukraine,  including  "possibilities  for  international  assistance  to  restore  stability."Further  details  about  Putin's  reported  order  weren't  immediately  available.  But  a  withdrawal  may  ease  tensions  simmering  since  Russia  annexed  Ukraine's  Black  Sea  peninsula  of  Crimea  this  month  --  a  move  that  has  led  to  the  worst  East-West  relations  since  the  Cold  War.Earlier  Monday,  Russian  media  reported  that  one  Russian  infantry  battalion  was  being  moved  from  the  border  area  to  its  base  deeper  into  Russia.U.S.  State  Department  spokeswoman  Jen  Psaki  said  that  if  reports  about  Russia  removing  troops  from  the  border  were  accurate,  "it  would  be  a  welcome  preliminary  step.""We  would  urge  Russia  to  accelerate  this  process,"  Psaki  said.  "We  also  continue  to  urge  Russia  to  engage  in  a  dialogue  with  the  government  in  Kiev  to  de-escalate  the  situation,  while  respecting  the  sovereignty  and  territorial  integrity  of  Ukraine."The  news  about  Russian  troops  came  on  the  day  that  Russian  Prime  Minister  Dmitry  Medvedev  traveled  to  Crimea  --  the  highest-level  visit  from  Moscow  since  Russia  annexed  the  region  --  in  part  to  unveil  measures  aimed  at  integrating  the  peninsula  into  the  Russian  economy.Ukrainian  and  Western  officials  for  weeks  have  voiced  alarm  about  Russia's  reported  military  buildup  on  Ukraine's  eastern  border,  which  has  raised  fears  that  Russian  troops  would  enter  the  Ukrainian  mainland.  Russia  may  have  40,000  troops  near  its  border  with  eastern  Ukraine  and  another  25,000  inland  on  alert  and  prepared  to  go  in,  two  U.S.  officials  have  told  CNN.Moscow  has  said  it  had  no  intention  of  ordering  armed  forces  to  cross  over  into  its  neighbor,  insisting  its  troops  have  been  conducting  exercises.  But  Putin  has  said  Russia  reserves  the  right  to  protect  ethnic  Russians  in  Ukraine  from  what  he  calls  threats  from  Ukrainian  nationals  --  a  reasoning  he  also  used  in  this  month's  annexation  of  CrimeaPutin's  conversation  with  Merkel  came  a  day  after  U.S.  Secretary  of  State  John  Kerry  and  Russian  Foreign  Minister  Sergey  Lavrov  held  talks  in  Paris  about  ways  to  defuse  the  crisis  over  Ukraine.Kerry  told  Lavrov  that  progress  depended  on  a  Russian  troop  pullback  from  Ukraine's  borders  but  no  breakthrough  was  announced.The  West  imposed  sanctions  against  some  Russian  officials  because  of  the  Crimea  crisis  and  threatened  more  if  tensions  weren't  eased.Is  Crimea  gone?Ukraine:  Russian  troops  'conducting  unclear  maneuvers'Amid  reports  that  Russia  may  have  started  withdrawing  from  the  border,  but  before  the  Merkel  announcement,  government  sources  in  Kiev  told  CNN  that  Russian  troops  were  not  backing  away  but  were  repositioning  their  forces  farther  north.One  Ukrainian  official  said  intelligence  indicated  that  Russian  troops  are  "conducting  unclear  maneuvers  at  the  Ukrainian  border."Meanwhile,  Russian  state  news  agency  ITAR-Tass  reported  Monday  that  one  Russian  infantry  battalion  was  being  withdrawn  from  a  region  bordering  Ukraine.  That  battalion,  having  finished  military  exercises,  is  returning  to  its  base  in  Russia's  Samara  region,  hundreds  of  miles  away  from  the  border,  the  outlet  reported,  citing  Russia's  Defense  Ministry.Details  about  how  many  troops  are  in  that  battalion  weren't  immediately  available.During  a  daily  briefing  Monday,  Ukrainian  Foreign  Ministry  spokesman  Evhen  Perebyinis  said  Russia  had  not  told  Kiev  about  the  intentions  of  any  military  forces  in  the  area."At  some  border  districts  the  troops  are  withdrawn,  in  others  they  approach  the  border,"  he  said.  "We  are  concerned  about  this  movement  of  the  army."U.S.  official:  'Too  soon'  to  discern  Russian  intentionsBefore  Merkel's  announcement,  a  U.S.  official  said  Monday  it  was  too  soon  to  conclude  whether  Russia  was  moving  its  troops  away  from  the  Ukraine  border.  The  official  was  reacting  to  statements  from  Ukraine  about  Russian  troop  maneuvers."We  have  nothing  to  back  that  up  one  way  or  the  other  so  far,"  the  official  said,  speaking  on  condition  of  anonymity.Barring  any  significant  withdrawal  from  the  border,  the  Russians  are  positioned  "in  a  way  (that)  they  could  conduct  a  swift  movement  into  Ukraine,"  the  official  said.Russian  Prime  Minister  in  CrimeaMedvedev  arrived  in  Crimea's  capital,  Simferopol,  for  talks  Monday  on  social  and  economic  development."As  a  result  of  entering  Russia,  not  a  single  citizen  of  Crimea  should  lose  anything  --  they  need  only  to  benefit  from  it,"  Medvedev  said  in  a  news  conference  carried  by  Russian  state  television.  "Citizens  need  to  understand  that  they're  citizens  of  a  powerful  country."The  Premier  met  with  Crimean  officials,  including  its  Prime  Minister,  the  speaker  of  the  regional  parliament  and  mayor  of  Sevastopol,  among  others.He  said  Crimean  state  salaries  and  pensions  should  be  raised  to  Russian  levels,  as  should  the  pay  for  military  personnel,  while  compulsory  social  insurance  would  be  introduced  to  the  region  next  year.Crimeans  voted  to  secede  from  Ukraine  and  join  Russia  in  a  March  16  referendum  dismissed  as  a  sham  by  Western  governments,  which  say  it  violated  Ukraine's  Constitution  and  was  held  only  after  pro-Russian  forces  had  seized  control.In  tense,  defiant  Ukraine  border  region,  prayers  for  peaceEconomic  measuresUnveiling  a  list  of  measures  for  the  region,  Medvedev  also  said  Moscow  would  make  Crimea  a  special  economic  zone.Tax  breaks  may  also  be  offered  to  companies,  he  added,  calling  for  mortgage  programs  to  be  introduced  to  the  region  and  for  a  review  of  water  supply  projects.Crimea  was  integrated  into  Ukraine's  mainland  economy  and  infrastructure  --  90%  of  its  water,  80%  of  its  electricity  and  roughly  65%  of  its  gas  have  come  from  the  rest  of  the  country.The  absorption  of  Crimea  and  its  2  million  residents  creates  an  added  financial  burden  on  Russia,  which  is  struggling  with  slow  growth  and  facing  Western  sanctions  over  its  move."The  water  system  is  old.  ...  We'll  need  to  make  sure  that  citizens  of  Crimea  are  provided  with  the  fresh  water,"  Medvedev  said.  "There  are  a  few  projects.  We'll  need  to  consider  them  and  choose  the  most  suitable."With  agriculture  one  of  the  region's  main  economic  gainers,  Medvedev  said  Crimea  would  be  included  in  a  Russian  support  program  for  the  sector  and  would  soon  receive  around  80  harvesters.  Local  wines,  which  he  said  were  popular  across  Russia,  would  also  receive  special  attention.After  visiting  a  school  and  children's  hospital,  Medvedev  added  that  Crimea  needed  modern  medical  equipment  and  reforms  in  education.  He  offered  to  establish  a  new  federal  university.Read:  Opinion:  Ukraine  'prepares  for  war'Read:  'The  hordes  are  coming':  Ukrainians  fear  Russian  invasion  in  northeastRead:  Report:  Ukraine  military  dolphins  to  switch  nationalities,  join  Russian  navyCNN's  Gena  Somra,  Barbara  Starr,  Nick  Paton  Walsh,  Alexander  Felton,  Stefan  Simons  and  Victoria  Butenko  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

International  monitors.  Increased  jet  fighters  in  the  region.Trying  to  figure  out  how  the  United  States  and  its  European  allies  will  respond  to  Russia's  Crimea  incursion  gets  confusing.The  tense  showdown  over  Ukrainian  sovereignty  offers  few  easy  answers,  with  differing  priorities  between  Washington  and  the  European  Union  adding  to  the  confusion.Here  is  a  look  at  where  Western  allies  stand:MilitaryUnited  States  --  It  is  hard  to  imagine  a  scenario  that  would  cause  U.S.  troops  to  get  involved  in  Ukraine.At  the  same  time,  the  Obama  administration  can't  rule  out  any  option  as  it  pushes  for  direct  negotiations  between  Russia  and  Ukraine  aimed  at  de-escalating  the  current  crisis  and  laying  the  groundwork  for  peaceful  coexistence  going  forward.The  Pentagon  has  announced  the  addition  of  six  F-15  fighter  planes  to  the  four  currently  on  a  NATO  mission  in  the  Baltics.  Previously,  Washington  halted  ongoing  military  cooperation  with  Russia.After  a  series  meetings  Wednesday  with  European,  Ukrainian  and  Russian  counterparts  in  Paris,  Secretary  of  State  John  Kerry  told  reporters  that  "all  parties  agreed  today  that  it  is  important  to  try  to  resolve  the  issues  through  dialogue."  He  added:  "They  don't  believe  that  any  of  us  are  served  by  greater  or  further  confrontation."Europe  --  The  last  thing  the  European  Union  wants  is  an  armed  conflict  in  its  backyard.  Only  if  Russian  forces  moved  into  eastern  Ukraine  would  consideration  be  given  to  bolstering  NATO  forces  in  neighboring  countries.While  no  obligation  exists  for  NATO  to  militarily  defend  Ukraine  against  Russian  aggression,  the  United  States  and  Britain  --  along  with  Russia  --  committed  to  protecting  Ukrainian  independence  and  territorial  integrity  in  1994  when  Kiev  gave  up  its  nuclear  arsenal  that  dated  back  to  the  Soviet  era.What  happens  now  to  Ukraine  will  have  an  impact  on  nuclear  nonproliferation  programs  elsewhere,  Ukrainian  interim  Prime  Minister  Arseniy  Yatsenyuk  warned  Thursday.His  implication  was  clear:  failure  to  effectively  respond  to  Russia's  aggression  in  Crimea  would  embolden  North  Korea  and  Iran  to  further  resist  Western  efforts  to  prevent  them  from  developing  nuclear  weapons.Europe  has  power  over  RussiaSanctionsThe  United  States  --  President  Barack  Obama  said  Thursday  that  he  signed  an  executive  order  that  laid  the  groundwork  for  sanctions  against  people  and  entities  deemed  responsible  for  the  crisis.The  executive  order  provides  the  legal  basis  for  sanctions  against  specific  people  and  entities,  but  White  House  spokesman  Jay  Carney  later  told  reporters  no  individuals  were  specifically  targeted.Visa  bans  are  already  in  effect  for  some  Russian  and  Ukrainian  officials,  and  the  freezing  of  assets  and  property  could  be  forthcoming.The  moves  fall  short  of  broader  economic  sanctions  aimed  at  Russia's  state-owned  banks  and  energy  industry  sought  by  some  in  Congress."This  action  by  Russia  cannot  go  unchallenged,"  Republican  Rep.  Ed  Royce  of  California,  the  chairman  of  the  House  Foreign  Affairs  Committee,  said  Thursday  at  a  hearing  where  the  panel  approved  a  non-binding  resolution  backing  sanctions.Europe  --  Closer  proximity  to  Russia  and  crucial  economic  ties  make  the  issue  of  sanctions  more  difficult  for  European  countries.  Already,  Russia  threatens  to  retaliate  with  its  own  sanctions  if  the  United  States  and  Europe  take  such  a  step.Russia  is  the  European  Union's  third-biggest  trading  partner  after  the  United  States  and  China,  with  goods  and  services  worth  more  than  $500  billion  exchanged  in  2012.  About  75%  of  all  foreign  direct  investment  in  Russia  originates  in  EU  member  states,  according  to  the  European  Commission.In  addition,  Russia  is  the  single  biggest  supplier  of  energy  to  the  European  Union.  British  energy  firm  BP  is  the  second-largest  shareholder  in  Russia's  leading  oil  producer  Rosneft,  and  some  of  the  biggest  energy  companies  in  Germany,  the  Netherlands  and  France  are  invested  in  a  joint  venture  with  Russian  gas  giant  Gazprom."If  and  when  any  sanctions  are  placed  on  Russia,  they  are  likely  to  be  targeted  on  key  officials  rather  than  on  the  wider  economy,"  said  Neil  Shearing,  chief  emerging  markets  economist  at  Capital  Economics.  "Europe  is  too  dependent  on  Russian  energy  to  countenance  full-blown  trade  restrictions."On  Thursday,  the  European  Union  threatened  limited  steps  if  no  substantive  negotiations  between  Russia  and  Ukraine  start  in  coming  days.European  Council  President  Herman  Van  Rompuy  told  reporters  in  Brussels  that  "in  any  absence  of  results,  the  EU  will  decide  on  additional  measures  such  as  travel  bans,  asset  freezes,  and  cancellation  of  the  EU-Russia  summit."Later,  Kerry  told  reporters  that  no  serious  gap  existed  between  the  U.S.  and  EU  approaches,  adding  that  "  there  may  be  some  differences  of  opinion  about  timing  or  about  one  choice  over  another."U.S.  paves  way  for  sanctions  over  Ukraine,  Europe  threatens  to  do  sameAidUnited  States  --  Kerry  announced  $1  billion  in  loan  guarantees  for  Ukraine  this  week  as  part  of  the  Obama  administration's  effort  to  publicly  support  the  interim  government  and  provide  incentive  for  Ukraine  to  continue  to  align  itself  with  the  West  through  the  European  Union  instead  of  Russia.Obama  called  Thursday  for  Congress  to  support  assistance  for  the  Ukrainian  government  from  both  the  United  States  and  the  International  Monetary  Fund.  A  few  hours  later,  the  Republican-led  House  overwhelmingly  approved  an  aid  package  to  authorize  the  previously  announced  loan  guarantees.Such  support  offers  a  trifecta  of  being  unilateral,  enjoying  political  support  at  home  and  backing  the  goal  of  bolstering  Ukraine.Europe  --  The  European  Union  announced  Wednesday  it  will  offer  Ukraine  at  least  $15  billion  in  aid  as  the  country  struggles  with  dwindling  cash  and  the  military  standoff  with  Russia.The  package  would  provide  Ukraine  with  assistance  over  the  next  few  years,  said  Jose  Manuel  Barroso,  the  head  of  the  EU's  executive  body,  the  European  Commission.  On  Wednesday,  Ukraine  said  it  would  be  unable  to  pay  its  February  natural  gas  bill  to  Gazprom.European  aid  is  the  easiest  way  to  show  immediate  support  for  Ukraine  while  avoiding  risks  of  counter-sanctions  and  other  retaliation.Four  things  about  Crimea's  referendumDiplomacyUnited  States  --  The  United  States  is  working  with  European  allies  to  create  an  "exit  ramp"  for  Putin  to  be  able  to  de-escalate  the  Ukraine  crisis.Their  plan  would  call  for  Russian  troops  in  Crimea  to  return  to  their  barracks,  and  international  observers  to  come  to  Ukraine  to  monitor  the  situation  on  the  ground,  where  Russia  complains  of  persecution  against  ethnic  Russians.In  addition,  the  United  States  seeks  to  isolate  Russia  diplomatically,  joining  other  members  of  the  G8  group  of  industrial  powers  in  pulling  out  of  preparatory  meetings  for  the  scheduled  June  summit  in  Sochi,  Russia.The  foundation  of  the  U.S.  stance  is  for  Ukraine  to  maintain  its  independence  and  territorial  integrity,  while  also  recognizing  Russia's  historical  and  economic  ties  to  Ukraine.Obama  said  Thursday  he  was  "confident"  that  the  international  community  was  "moving  forward  together"  in  responding  to  what  he  called  the  Russian  intervention.Europe  --  German  Chancellor  Angela  Merkel  spoke  with  Obama  on  Tuesday  about  the  diplomatic  exit  ramp,  but  initial  indications  Thursday  showed  little  progress  with  Russia  on  agreement.Reflecting  the  standoff,  Merkel  said  Thursday  that  the  European  Union  wants  to  do  everything  it  can  to  settle  the  Ukraine  crisis  diplomatically,  but  she  warned  that  without  any  "diplomatic  possibility,"  steps  such  as  asset  freezing  and  visa  limitations  would  be  options.5  possible  directions  in  UkraineCNNMoney's  Mark  Thompson,  Alanna  Petroff  and  Charles  Riley  and  CNN's  Deirdre  Walsh  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

It's  an  admonishment  often  heard  from  wildlife  officials.  Mary  Musselman  of  Sebring,  Florida,  didn't  listen,  and  it  got  her  arrested  at  age  81.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Don't  feed  the  bears!It's  an  admonishment  heard  over  and  over  again  from  wildlife  officials.  But  Florida  resident  Mary  Musselman  didn't  listen,  officials  said.And  it  got  her  arrested  at  age  81.She  is  being  held  without  bond,  CNN  affiliate  WFTS  reported."I  think  it  is  outrageous,"  said  Karen  Tedder.  She  and  other  former  students  of  the  retired  gym  teacher  held  a  gathering  Thursday  outside  Musselman's  house  in  Sebring  to  pray  for  her.She  must  be  released,  they  say,  because  her  husband  is  dying  of  cancer  and  she's  his  only  caregiver.But  authorities  had  warned  her  multiple  times  not  to  feed  the  black  bears  coming  onto  her  property.She  did  anyway.  And  she  fed  them  a  lot  --  up  to  17  to  18  bowls  of  dog  food  at  a  time,  wildlife  officials  told  the  affiliate.The  bears  loved  it  and  kept  coming  back.  The  Florida  Fish  and  Wildlife  Commission  hated  it  and  kept  coming  back,  too.Killing  a  bearMusselman's  trouble  with  the  law  began  last  year,  when  wildlife  officials  had  to  put  down  a  bear  she  was  feeding,  they  said.They  went  to  great  lengths  to  explain  to  her  why  she  shouldn't  give  the  wild  animals  food,  said  FWC  spokesman  Gary  Morse.  They  brought  her  informational  videos  and  pamphlets,  had  conversations  with  her."Feeding  bears  results  in  bears  losing  their  fear  of  people,"  Morse  said.  After  they  get  used  to  living  around  humans  and  getting  food  from  them,  relocating  them  does  not  solve  the  problem.And  when  bears  come  too  close  to  people,  they  do  damage  --  to  property  and  to  people,  Morse  said.The  education  they  gave  Musselman  was  all  for  naught."She  told  us  she  wasn't  going  to  stop,"  Morse  told  the  affiliate.Then,  in  November,  they  issued  her  an  official  warning.  Weeks  later,  officers  caught  her  feeding  bears  again.  Out  came  the  instructional  videos  once  more.Still  no  change.The  law  steps  inIn  December,  Musselman  was  ordered  to  appear  in  court,  where  --  this  time  --  a  judge  told  her  to  stop  feeding  the  bears.  That  didn't  work  either.  On  Christmas  Eve,  she  was  back  in  court;  she  left  there  on  probation.Again,  the  problem  persisted:  More  food;  more  bears.A  judge  sent  wildlife  commission  officers  to  arrest  Musselman.  They  said  she  fought  them  and  told  them  she'd  kill  them.Now  she  is  charged  not  only  with  feeding  wildlife  but  also  with  battery  against  a  law  officer  and  violating  her  probation.Why  wouldn't  she  stop?She  thought  the  bears  would  starve  without  her,  according  to  the  affiliate."She  didn't  want  to  accept  that  fact  that  they'd  be  fine  without  her,"  Morse  said.  "They  hibernate  when  there  is  no  food."Her  former  students  are  trying  to  find  a  mental  health  professional  to  appear  with  her  in  court.CNN's  Darrell  Calhoun  contributed  to  this  report</TEXT></DOC>

"But  then  again,  that's  how  my  life  is."The  memories  of  his  stellar  career  --  the  Springbok  jerseys  and  silverware  --  line  the  walls  of  Van  der  Westhuizen's  home  in  South  Africa.When  he  retired  in  2003,  he  was  the  country's  most  capped  player  with  a  reputation  as  one  of  the  most  brilliant,  and  toughest,  scrum  halves  in  the  history  of  the  game.Francois  Pienaar,  who  captained  South  Africa  to  success  in  1995,  described  Van  der  Westhuizen  as  "a  phenomenal  athlete.""What  Joost  did  on  the  rugby  field  was  incredible,"  Pienaar  told  CNN.  "He  was  probably  the  best  number  nine  to  play  the  game,  and  that's  saying  something."Tough  and  tenacious  on  the  rugby  field,  Van  der  Westhuizen  is  having  to  apply  those  skills  in  his  fight  to  stay  alive  and  help  find  a  cure  for  motor  neurone  disease."I  am,"  he  assured  CNN.  "Without  a  doubt.  I  am  a  self-confessed  bad  loser  and  I  want  to  beat  this  not  just  for  myself  but  for  everyone  with  ALS  around  the  world."Van  der  Westhuizen  has  started  a  foundation  called  J9  to  raise  money  and  awareness  of  motor  neurone  disease.The  foundation  offers  support  and  advice  to  patients  and  their  families  as  they  come  to  terms  with  a  disease  which  has  no  clear  cause.A  J9  legends  team  --  boasting  over  500  international  caps  between  them  --  was  cheered  on  by  Van  der  Westhuizen  in  the  veterans'  tournament  at  November's  Dubai  round  of  the  HSBC  Sevens  World  Series.He  still  travels  around  the  world,  often  connecting  with  his  old  rugby  rivals  for  fundraising  events  as  well  as  making  regular  medical  research  trips  to  the  United  States.It  isn't  just  Van  der  Westhuizen's  global  mission  which  keeps  him  pressing  on  with  his  crusade."I  am  doing  this  to  give  my  children  a  dad  for  longer,"  he  says.  "My  daughter  is  eight,  my  son  10.  They  need  a  dad."It  is  for  this  reason  that  Van  der  Westhuizen  has  revealed  that  he  has  decided  to  be  artificially  ventilated  when  his  lungs  are  no  longer  able  to  function  on  their  own.It  is  a  huge  step  for  Van  der  Westhuizen  given  it's  not  common  practice  in  his  native  South  Africa."I  am  going  to  live  as  long  as  possible  --  to  help  find  a  cure,  to  give  my  kids  a  dad,"  he  said,  confirming  that  he  has  made  a  decision  about  using  an  artificial  ventilation  machine,  which  will  aid  his  breathing  and  help  him  stay  alive"There  is  nothing  wrong  with  my  brain  or  my  heart.  I  am  still  alive."Already  a  figure  in  one  of  South  Africa's  most  historic  sporting  events,  Van  der  Westhuizen  is  determined  to  defy  the  odds  and  help  make  history  a  second  time.Read:  "NFL  or  rugby?

"Isaac  was  drumming  in  a  band  with  him,  and  I  had  taken  a  ballet  class  at  college  with  him."Size  of  the  wedding:  About  75  guestsWhat  they  wore:  They  both  wore  J.Crew.Wedding  music:  "Ben  (the  friend  who  introduced  us)  played  old  Simon  and  Garfunkel  songs  on  his  guitar,"  Kelsey  says.  "As  I  walked  down  the  aisle,  he  played  'The  Three  of  Us'  by  Ben  Harper.  He  continued  to  play  an  original  melody  he  wrote  for  the  occasion  in  the  background  throughout  the  ceremony.  At  our  luncheon,  Isaac  played  the  guitar  and  sang  'I  Have  and  I  Always  Will'  by  David  Barnes  for  me."What  did  they  love  most  about  the  wedding?  "It  was  outside  and  we  were  able  to  go  barefoot  in  the  grass,"  Kelsey  says.  "Isaac  and  his  brother  built  the  arch  we  got  married  under  with  wood  they  found  in  the  mountains.

"I  tried  on  a  few  lacy  boho  cream  dresses  that  were  beautiful  and  elegant  and  they  were  certainly  fit  for  a  bride,  just  not  me  as  a  bride,"  Shenae  says.  "When  I  saw  my  dress  online,  I  got  this  butterfly  feeling  in  my  stomach.  When  I  went  in  to  try  it  on,  I  knew  it  was  the  one.

"So  we  rushed  the  wedding  for  her.  We  were  trying  to  figure  out  what  to  do  on  the  fly,  and  Chi  had  the  idea  of  our  getting  married  in  Battery  Park,  because  we'd  ridden  bikes  there  and  sat  in  the  sun  together  all  day  the  first  day  we  spent  together  (after  the  first  night  we  spent  together),  which  was  Labor  Day  in  2005."How  they  met:  "We  met  through  a  group  of  mutual  friends  on  a  series  of  rooftops  in  the  summer  of  2005,"  Jesse  says.  "Chi  had  to  figure  out  that  the  chef  she  had  been  pursuing  all  summer  wasn't  going  to  pan  out.  By  Labor  Day,  all  was  resolved  and  we  were  together."Size  of  the  wedding:  "The  day  was  like  a  snowball  rolling  downhill,"  Jesse  says.  "We  had  just  under  50  people  at  our  ceremony,  counting  us  and  our  priest,  and  then  around  75  for  dinner  and  maybe  200  for  our  late-night  party."What  they  wore:  "Chi  wore  a  beautiful  cream  gown  she  designed  with  a  dressmaker  she  met  while  working  as  a  fit  model  for  our  friend's  line  Apiece  Apart,"  Jesse  says.

"The  ceremony  itself  took  place  on  a  schooner  from  1929  in  the  Hudson,"  Jesse  says.  "We  said  our  vows  in  front  of  the  Statue  of  Liberty.  I  read  Chi  a  poem  by  Rilke,  and  Chi  read  me  a  poem  by  Neruda.  At  one  point,  there  was  the  sound  of  buoy  bells  on  the  river,  and  our  priest  exclaimed,  'Church  bells!'  A  helicopter  flew  over  and  he  went,  'Page  Six!'  He  was  a  good  improviser.  A  dinner  followed  in  the  South  Street  Seaport  in  the  back  of  a  pop-up  chocolate  shop  that  had  been  opened  just  a  few  days  earlier  by  the  Mast  Brothers.

The  Catholic  ceremony  was  at  Dahlgren  Chapel  on  Georgetown  University's  campus.  And,  our  interfaith  ceremony  was  at  the  Hotel  Monaco."How  they  met:  "Two  of  my  childhood  friends  ended  up  marrying  two  of  Vincent's  college  classmates,"  Zahra  says.  "We  met  at  their  two  sets  of  weddings  over  the  years  and  became  friends."Size  of  the  wedding:  Muslim  and  Catholic  ceremonies:  Only  family  and  close  friends;  interfaith  ceremony:  130  guestsWhat  they  wore:  "At  the  interfaith  ceremony  and  reception,  Vincent  wore  a  black  custom-tailored  Burberry  evening  suit  that  he  paired  with  a  T.M.  Lewin  white  shirt,"  Zahra  says.  "He  accessorized  with  a  deep  purple  Versace  tie  and  a  paisley  black-and-purple  pocket  square.  I  wore  a  custom-made  traditional  lengha  designed  by  my  cousin,  and  a  pair  of  Sigerson  Morrison  shimmery  bronze-and-gold  heels.  My  jewelry  was  a  custom  set  my  parents  picked  out  on  a  trip  to  India.  My  clutch  was  by  Judith  Leiber.  I  also  carried  my  paternal  grandmother's  handkerchief,  which  had  her  initials  on  it.  My  mother  surprised  me  before  the  ceremony  by  embroidering  my  initials  on  it,  too."Wedding  music:  "We  had  an  impromptu  dance  party  with  a  street  band  in  front  of  the  Verizon  Center,  while  taking  pictures  before  our  reception,"  Zahra  says.  "And  there  was  a  surprise  flash  Bollywood  dance  mob  performed  by  my  family  and  friends  at  the  start  of  the  reception  to  Akon's  'Chammak  Challo.'  It  set  off  a  firestorm  of  feverish  dance-offs!  As  guests  were  taking  their  seats,  we  played  music  from  the  Sachal  Orchestra  (from  Lahore,  Pakistan)  playing  over  the  loudspeaker.  It's  one  of  my  favorite  orchestras  because  they  play  jazz  on  classical  Pakistani  instruments."What  did  they  love  about  the  wedding?  "Our  interfaith  ceremony  was  a  wonderful  amalgamation  of  the  Muslim  and  Catholic  ceremonies  and  our  respective  cultural  traditions,"  Zahra  says.

"Beauchamp  Point  in  Rockport  is  a  very  special  place  to  me,  my  family,  and  now  Thomas  and  his  family,"  Kara  says.  "We  have  spent  many  vacations,  holidays,  and  family  events  there  so  it  seemed  like  an  obvious  choice.  We  wanted  to  harness  that  feeling  of  staying  up  late  catching  fireflies  and  making  s'mores  on  the  beach."How  they  met:  "We  met  very  serendipitously  through  a  mutual  friend,"  Kara  says.  "Oddly  enough,  we  had  gone  to  college  together  but  never  met.  One  summer  our  mutual  friend  invited  me  and  some  friends  on  his  annual  trip  to  visit  Thomas  in  Seattle.  Thomas  and  I  fell  in  love  instantly.  We  dated  bi-coastally  for  a  year  and  a  half  until  he  moved  to  New  York  City."Size  of  the  wedding:  Around  175  guestsWhat  they  wore:  "I  wore  a  vintage  evening  gown  that  I  found  at  Bergdorfs,"  Kara  says.  "Thomas  wore  a  light  gray  J.Crew  Ludlow  suit  and  tie."Wedding  music:  "Our  first  dance  was  something  that  I  will  never  forget,"  Kara  says.  "Thomas'  sister  and  brother-in-law  sang  'Home'  by  Edward  Sharpe,  and  our  friends  and  family  filled  in  the  chorus,  singing  and  whistling.  It  is  something  that  I  think  back  on  all  the  time."What  did  they  love  most  about  the  wedding?  "We  really  just  wanted  to  create  our  ultimate  night  together,"  Kara  says.  "We  never  picked  colors  or  themes,  but  instead  both  made  a  list  of  things  we  wanted  to  do  or  include.  Thomas  and  I  wrote  our  own  vows,  and  were  barely  able  to  choke  them  out  through  the  smiles  and  tears.  Both  my  mother  and  father  walked  me  down  the  aisle,  a  cousin  did  the  ceremony,  our  siblings  read  poems  and  passages,  my  mother  made  my  bouquet,  and  the  ceremony  took  place  under  a  tree  my  grandmother  had  planted  when  she  was  four-years-old."Any  words  of  wedding  wisdom?

"We  had  the  ceremony  next  to  the  pond,  dinner  on  the  patio,  and  danced  inside  the  barn  afterward,"  Maggi  says.  "It  has  a  modern  summer-camp  feel,  but  with  fun  luxury  touches."How  they  met:  "We  met  in  July  2009  at  a  Williamsburg  rooftop  going-away  party  for  a  mutual  friend.  We  actually  had  many  mutual  friends  but  had  never  met  before,"  Maggi  says.  "[A  group  of  us  ended  up]  roaming  around  Brooklyn  looking  for  tacos  and  beer  until  the  wee  hours.  We  had  both  just  gotten  out  of  relationships  and  weren't  necessarily  looking  to  start  dating  anyone  so  soon,  but  it  really  was  an  immediate  connection."Size  of  the  wedding:  68  guests.  "Alex  and  I  designed  the  invitations  ourselves,"  Maggi  says.  "It  was  pretty  simple  calligraphy  of  our  names  (by  myself)  with  small  botanical  drawings  by  Alex.  Our  friend  Jared  Friedman  (Econo  Graphics)  screenprinted  them  with  us  (along  with  lots  of  Greenpoint  Polish  food  and  beer)  in  his  studio."Wedding  music:  The  music  for  the  ceremony  was  "My  Baby  Just  Cares  for  Me"  by  Nina  Simone.What  did  they  love  most  about  the  wedding?  "We  didn't  really  want  it  to  be  too  traditional,"  Maggi  says.  "I  am  strongly  against  anyone  giving  away  the  bride,  so  I  walked  about  halfway  down  the  'aisle,'  which  was  actually  a  grassy  hill.  Alex  met  me  and  we  walked  to  the  chuppah  together.  We  ended  up  writing  the  entire  ceremony—it  was  about  how  marriages  unite  and  create  communities.  For  the  dinner,  my  mother-in-law  made  all  the  table  arrangements  in  funny  little  glasses  and  jars  that  we'd  thrifted  and  scrounged."Any  words  of  wedding  wisdom?  "Make  many,  many  lists  in  the  days  before  the  wedding  (like  one  per  every  aspect  of  the  wedding)  and  then  delegate  them  out,"  Maggi  says.  "Getting  all  your  ducks  in  a  row  on  paper  beforehand  will  make  everything  run  much  more  smoothly."Amy  and  CarterWhen  they  were  married:  On  September  10,  2011,  at  their  Traverse  City,  Michigan,  home,  which  is  a  100-year-old  farmhouse.  "We  both  have  a  true  love  for  the  Midwest  and  both  our  families  are  back  there.  The  setting  was  unbelievable,"  Amy  says.How  they  met:  "We  are  both  on  the  board  for  the  Environmental  Media  Association  (EMA),"  Amy  says.  "We  were  assigned  to  adopt  a  school  garden  at  North  Hollywood  High."Size  of  the  wedding:  About  220  guestsWhat  they  wore:  Amy  wore  Carolina  Herrera  and  Carter  wore  Tom  Ford.What  did  they  love  about  the  wedding?  "I'm  Roman  Catholic  and  Amy  is  very  spiritual,"  Carter  says.  "So,  of  course,  she  had  Guru  Singh,  her  spiritual  adviser,  and  I  had  the  priest  who  baptized  me,  Father  Thome.  And  later  in  the  night,  people  literally  never  got  off  the  dance  floor  and  that  was  exactly  what  we  were  hoping  for."McKenzie  and  JamieWhen  they  were  married:  June  2012.  "We  said  our  vows  in  the  pine  grove  on  a  farm  we  rented,"  McKenzie  says.  "The  reception  was  held  in  the  pasture  next  to  the  orchard  and  barnyard."How  they  met:  "Jamie  and  I  started  'dating'  after  we  started  living  together,"  McKenzie  says.  "A  little  unconventional,  yes,  but  we  wouldn't  have  it  any  other  way.  Within  a  year,  we  were  mama  and  papa  to  two  alpacas  that  we  named  Oliver  and  Abraham,  a  Babydoll  sheep  we  called  Bill  Murray,  and  a  starter  flock  of  chickens."Size  of  the  wedding:  "At  first,  we  wanted  something  very  small,"  McKenzie  says.  "But  when  we  realized  how  large  our  extended  families  were,  we  decided  to  go  all  out.  We  invited  about  250  people.  Since  I'm  an  illustrator,  I  drew  our  own  wedding  invitations  based  on  Jamie's  love  of  sacred  geometry.  Little  did  I  know  that  those  invitations  would  open  the  door  to  working  with  other  brides  through  my  Etsy  shop  and  becoming  self-employed."What  did  they  love  about  the  wedding?  "When  it  came  down  to  it,  the  ceremony  was  the  most  powerful  and  significant  memory  of  our  wedding  day,"  McKenzie  says.  "My  best  friend  played  the  guitar  leading  us  down  the  aisle,  and  our  neighbor  living  across  the  pasture  married  us."Any  words  of  wedding  wisdom?  "We  greeted  our  guests  down  a  winding  path  through  the  grass,"  McKenzie  says.  "I'd  recommend  to  any  bride  that  she  greet  her  guests  this  way—it  took  the  pressure  off  of  us  to  mingle  during  the  reception."How  did  you  put  your  own  stamp  on  your  special  day?

"After  attending  his  and  his  manager's  depositions,  it  appears  as  if  the  pressure  led  to  a  brief  relapse."Cassidy,  63,  was  on  his  way  to  the  Los  Angeles  airport   "to  return  to  his  home  in  Florida  and  to  transitional  rehabilitation"  when  he  was  stopped  by  a  California  Highway  Patrol  officer,  she  said.The  singer-actor  blew  .19  --  twice  the  legal  level  --  on  an  alcohol  test  administered  by  the  officer  who  stopped  his  rented  Chevrolet  Impala,  according  to  a  California  Highway  Patrol  statement  on  Saturday.The  former  star  of  the  TV  series  "The  Partridge  Family"  was  booked  in  a  Los  Angeles  jail  on  a  driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  charge  early  Saturday,  the  statement  said.  Jail  records  show  he  was  freed  on  $15,000  bond  several  hours  later."Cassidy  was  observed  making  a  right  turn  on  a  red  light,  in  violation  of  a  black  and  white  regulatory  sign  indicating  'No  Right  Turn  On  Red,'"  the  California  Highway  Patrol  said.  The  traffic  stop  happened  off  the  405  Freeway,  near  the  Los  Angeles  International  Airport.The  officer  noticed  "the  odor  of  an  alcoholic  beverage  was  emitting  from  the  vehicle"  when  he  approached  Cassidy,  who  was  alone  in  the  car,  the  release  said.Cassidy  was  arrested  on  a  drunken  driving  charge  in  Schodack,  New  York,  in  August  after  he  failed  to  dim  his  car's  headlights  at  a  police  checkpoint,  according  to  the  police  report.  He  blew  a  .10  in  the  Breathalyzer  device,  the  report  said.  The  legal  blood  alcohol  limit  is  .08  in  New  York.  That  case  is  still  pending.Cassidy,  who  lives  in  Fort  Lauderdale,  Florida,  entered  a  no  contest  plea  as  a  first-time  offender  in  February  2011  to  a  drunken  driving  charge  that  followed  a  November  2010  arrest  in  Florida.  He  was  sentenced  to  a  year's  probation  and  his  driver's  license  was  suspended  for  six  months  for  that  conviction.  He  also  attended  a  DUI  school,  paid  a  $500  fine  and  served  50  hours  of  community  service.On  the  TV  series,  Cassidy  played  the  eldest  of  five  children  of  a  widowed  mother  (Shirley  Jones,  who  was  then  Cassidy's  real-life  stepmother).The  family,  all  musicians,  traveled  to  gigs  in  a  repainted  school  bus.

The  result  would  look  great  even  if  it  was  a  cloudy  night  --  I  set  up  in  the  right  place  at  the  right  time.MORE:  Best  places  to  see  the  Northern  LightsCNN:  In  some  of  the  shots,  the  moon  looks  enormous  --  how  did  you  do  that?Metallinos:  You  set  up  up  the  telephoto  lens  or  a  telescope  at  least  a  few  kilometers  away  from  the  landscape  you  want  to  include  in  the  shot.Use  a  lens  with  a  long  focal  length  to  magnify  the  moon  from  afar.For  example,  the  shot  with  the  moon  rising  behind  the  Old  Fortress  was  shot  eight  kilometers  away  using  a  1,000-millimeter  lens.Theoretically,  you  can  capture  a  full  moon  every  29  days  from  a  different  azimuth  76°  -  116°  but  it's  actually  challenging  to  shoot  the  moon  due  to  the  unpredictable  weather  and  difficulty  in  getting  the  exact  shooting  angle  correct.After  calculating  the  exact  point  of  the  azimuth  and  setting  up  where  you  can  put  the  landscape  in  the  same  shot,  you'll  then  need  a  clear  horizon.I  manage  to  capture  the  moon  only  a  few  times  every  year.  So  the  shots  in  the  video  are  from  2010  till  February  2014.CNN:  The  most  time-consuming  process  is  ...Metallinos:  Some  shots  took  more  than  eight  to  nine  hours  of  continuous  capturing.I  climbed  up  the  cliff  with  my  camera  and  telescope  for  almost  eight  hours  continuously  to  capture  the  shot  with  the  trees.The  shots  with  the  moon  took  an  hour  or  two,  but  it  required  an  hour  or  two  of  pre-calculation  for  where  to  set  up,  and  then  we  had  to  be  there  an  hour  earlier  with  the  heavy  equipment.But  that  is  not  the  end  --  we  had  to  process  thousands  of  raw  pictures.It  took  me  more  than  a  month  to  archive  my  200,000  pictures  of  time-lapse  to  a  library  of  more  than  1.5  million  pictures  I  have.Then,  it  took  us  another  month  to  create  the  video  with  the  right  shots  and  the  right  sound.MORE:  10  of  the  world's  coolest  underground  wondersCNN:  The  best  places  to  photograph  Corfu  are  ...Metallinos:  To  capture  the  old  town  of  Corfu  in  the  photograph,  the  best  angle  is  from  Kontokali  Bay,  about  seven  kilometers  northwest  of  Corfu  town.Other  beautiful  places  with  a  nice  dark  sky  include  Chalikounas  Beach  (Lake  Korission)  in  southwest  Corfu  and  near  Aggelokastro  Castle  just  above  Palaiokastritsa  Bay.CNN:  What  are  your  favorite  places  to  photograph  Greece?Metallinos:  I  once  captured  nice  star  photographs  from  the  Parnon  mountains  at  Peloponnisos  in  southern  Greece,  with  a  perfect  dark  sky.Pelion  at  the  city  of  Volos  and  the  Gramos  mountain  range  both  yield  beautiful  photos.More  of  Metallinos'  videos  can  be  found  on  his  Youtube  page.</TEXT></DOC>

"It  has  been  on  a  slow  but  steady  march  towards  deregulation,  towards  saying  that  restrictions  on  your  spending  money  --  say,  in  expenditures  or  in  contributions  to  candidates  --  that  is  a  free  speech  right."Breyer's  lamentJustice  Stephen  Breyer  sounded  forlorn  Wednesday,  lamenting  in  sad  tones  the  effect  of  the  Supreme  Court  ruling.Speaking  from  the  bench,  Breyer  --  supported  by  his  three  more  liberal  colleagues  --  criticized  the  conservative  majority  for  ignoring  a  century  of  efforts  to  blunt  political  corruption  --  or  its  appearance."The  threat  to  that  integrity  posed  by  the  risk  of  special  access  and  influence  remains  real,"  he  said.The  ruling  "eviscerates  our  nation's  campaign  finance  laws,  leaving  a  remnant  incapable  of  dealing  with  the  grave  problems  of  democratic  legitimacy  that  those  laws  were  intend  to  resolve,"  he  added.But  Chief  Justice  John  Roberts,  in  his  majority  opinion,  acknowledged  what  many  a  smart  election  lawyer  knows:"Because  individuals'  direct  contributions  are  limited,  would-be  donors  may  turn  to  other  avenues  for  political  speech"  than  direct  contributions  to  office-seekers,  said  Roberts.  "Individuals  can,  for  example,  contribute  unlimited  amounts  to  501(c)  organizations,  which  are  not  required  to  publicly  disclose  their  donors.  Such  organizations  spent  some  $300  million  on  independent  expenditures  in  the  2012  election  cycle."Roberts  emphasized  the  free-speech  rights  of  donors  and  downplayed  the  concerns  the  ruling  would  further  erode  public  confidence  in  the  political  system."The  government  may  no  more  restrict  how  many  candidates  or  causes  a  donor  may  support  than  it  may  tell  a  newspaper  how  many  candidates  it  may  endorse,"  he  said.The  man  behind  the  rulingShaun  McCutcheon  is  an  electrical  engineer  by  trade,  but  grassroots  politics  may  be  his  true  passion.The  Alabama  native  has  worked  for  years  with  his  local  Republican  Party  in  Birmingham,  and  is  chairman  of  Conservative  Action  Fund,  a  so-called  "super  PAC"  that  "promotes  conservative  Republicans'  time-proven  messages  and  effective  solutions."His  success  in  business  and  a  willingness  to  put  his  money  into  GOP  coffers  set  him  at  the  center  of  the  politically  tricky  Supreme  Court  fight.  He  equates  his  donations  to  "core  political  speech."McCutcheon  says  he  has  a  constitutional  right  to  donate  more  than  that  amount  to  as  many  office  seekers  as  he  wants,  so  long  as  no  one  candidate  gets  more  than  the  $2,600  per  election  limit.He  supports  those  individual  controls,  but  "what  doesn't  make  any  sense  is  that  you  can  only  give  that  amount  of  money  to  a  few  candidates,  because  somehow  my  giving  money  to  (U.S.  Rep.)  Martha  Roby  of  Alabama  could  corrupt  (former  Rep.)  Allen  West  of  Florida,"  he  told  CNN."That's  just  nutty,  but  that's  what  the  powers-that-be  want:  to  prevent  folks  who  want  to  get  involved  from  having  the  same  ability  to  get  involved  and  support  candidates  that  big  union  PACs  have,"  he  said.But  backers  of  continued  congressional  regulation  do  not  see  it  that  way."The  reason  we  have  limitations  on  the  dollars  an  individual  can  give  is  to  create  some  sense  of  fairness,  so  that  if  we  do  have  a  campaign  finance  system  driven  by  donations,  we  have  as  many  opportunities  for  as  many  people  as  possible  to  participate,"  said  Robert  Zimmerman,  a  prominent  Democratic  fundraiser."That's  why  there  are  limitations,  so  that  everyone  has  an  equal  or  fair  voice  in  the  process.  Not  only  are  our  elections  being  put  up  for  auction,  these  donors  are  making  an  investment  in  the  democratic  system  for  their  own  agenda  and  we  taxpayers  have  to  foot  the  bill,"  he  said.Fundamental  debateThe  competing  arguments  are  stark:  supporters  of  campaign  finance  reform  say  current  federal  regulations  are  designed  to  prevent  corruption  in  politics.  Opponents  said  it  would  criminalize  free  speech  and  association.The  current  case  deals  with  direct  political  contributions.  But  it  continues  a  trend  that  culminated  in  the  separate  "Citizens  United"  high  court  ruling  from  2010,  easing  long-standing  restrictions  on  "independent  spending"  by  corporations,  labor  unions,  and  certain  non-profit  advocacy  groups  in  political  campaigns.Its  impact  put  corporations  on  the  same  free-speech  footing  as  wealthy  individuals,  who  have  long  enjoyed  the  ability  to  spend  freely  and  independently  on  behalf  of  federal  candidates.That  and  a  subsequent  decision  from  a  federal  appeals  court  in  Washington  have  led  to  a  proliferation  of  so-called  "super  PACs"--  separate  political  action  committees  that  can  raise  and  spend  unlimited  amounts  of  cash  from  businesses,  unions,  and  advocacy  groups.These  super  PACs  are  independent  political  organizations  operating  as  "527s,"  named  after  the  tax  code  governing  their  operation.  They  cannot  contribute  directly  to  a  federal  candidate  or  political  party.Limits  on  direct  contributions  to  candidates  by  corporations  and  individuals  remain  in  place,  the  focus  in  part  of  the  current  McCutcheon  appeal.Some  political  experts  say  a  ruling  in  favor  of  increased,  or  even  unlimited,  aggregate  individual  donor  contributions  could  put  party  committees  and  political  action  committees  on  a  greater  competitive  track  with  the  "super  PACs."All  PACs  are  organizations  that  campaign  either  for  or  against  candidates,  legislation,  or  ballot  measures.  The  difference  is  in  how  they  are  organized  for  regulatory  and  tax  purposes,  and  by  the  amounts  of  money  they  are  allowed  to  spend.Regular  PACs  may  also  give  limited  donations  to  federal  candidates  and  political  parties,  while  super  PACs  cannot.With  a  resounding  win  at  the  high  court,  wealthy  donors  like  McCutcheon  --  whether  Democrat,  Republican,  or  Independent  --  could  in  theory  contribute  a  maximum  $3.6  million  to  the  national  and  state  parties,  and  the  450  or  so  Senate  and  House  candidates  expected  to  run  in  2014.Key  for  the  conservative  majority  court  was  rejecting  claims  by  the  law's  supporters  that  it  had  a  permissible  goal  of  preventing  political  corruption  or  the  appearance  of  it.Another  point  of  contention  is  whether  the  aggregate  spending  limits  are  really  having  a  pervasive  effect,  or  only  involve  a  relative  few  well-heeled  givers.Figures  from  the  Center  for  Responsive  Politics  for  the  2012  race  showed  about  600  donors  leveraged  their  money  to  each  give  the  maximum  of  about  $48,000  total  --  benefitting  no  more  than  17  presidential  or  congressional  candidates.Almost  1,700  contributors  forked  over  the  maximum  limit  to  party  committees,  which  added  up  to  more  than  $100  million.  Loosening  those  limits,  say  opponents  of  the  law,  would  benefit  wealthy  liberals  and  conservatives  equally.Lax  enforcementBut  the  Supreme  Court  has  never  in  its  history  overturned  a  federal  contribution  limit.And  critics  accuse  regulators  of  having  a  generally  lax  enforcement  stance,  particularly  for  independent  advocacy  groups.The  FEC  will  now  be  tasked  with  taking  this  high  court  opinion  and  crafting  new  rules  to  ease  limits  on  aggregate  spending.Unlike  in  "Citizens  United,"  the  big  winners  may  be  harder  to  discern.  Certainly  individual  donors  seeking  to  expand  their  election  portfolio  have  more  choices.  But  as  Roberts  noted,  other  big-move  avenues  exist  to  funnel  money  to  outside  groups  willing  to  spend  freely.And  political  parties  certainly  will  have  more  money  to  spend.  That  worries  many  supporters  of  more  regulation."The  court  opens  another  loophole  by  allowing  our  political  parties  to  be  further  corrupted  by  big-money  contributions  from  special  interests,"  said  Elisabeth  MacNamara,  president  of  the  League  of  Women  Voters  of  the  U.S.  "The  party  and  PAC  systems  now  become  a  huge  funnel  for  corrupting  elected  officials  across  the  country."But  McCutcheon  argues  that  characterizing  the  legal  fight  as  between  "good"  and  "bad"  simply  blurs  the  truth."Getting  rid  of  the  aggregate  limits  is  not  about  corrupting  democracy  --  it  is  about  practicing  democracy,"  he  said.  "This  case  is  about  freedom--  your  freedom  and  my  freedom--  to  express  ourselves  openly  and  fully  within  our  political  system.  And  if  there  is  one  thing  that  we  Americans  believe  with  all  our  hearts,  it  is  that  freedom  never  corrupts."The  case  is  McCutcheon  v.  Federal  Election  Commission  (12-536).</TEXT></DOC>

We've  known  that  for  at  least  50  years  --  and  yet  millions  smoke,  and  thousands  more  start  every  year.  Why?</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Smoking  can  kill  you.  We've  known  that  for  at  least  50  years  --  and  yet  millions  still  smoke,  and  thousands  more  pick  up  the  habit  every  year.Why?  Their  stories  involve  strong  addictions,  passionate  defiance  --  and  billions  spent  to  make  people  act  against  their  own  best  interest.How  bad  is  it?In  1965,  42%  of  the  population  smoked.  Today,  19%  of  Americans  do,  according  to  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention.  That  number  sounds  comparatively  small,  but  that's  an  estimated  43.8  million  Americans  --  and  the  decline  in  smoking  has  plateaued,  experts  say.Saturday  is  the  50th  anniversary  of  the  landmark  U.S.  Surgeon  General's  report  that  linked  smoking  with  bad  health.  The  government  has  issued  yet  another  edition  of  the  report,  its  32nd.  Barring  a  drastic  change,  experts  say  the  government  will  be  issuing  these  same  reports,  warning  of  the  dangers  of  smoking,  for  many  more  years.Government  anti-smoking  efforts  have  saved  8  million  livesSmoking  is  still  the  No.  1  cause  of  preventable  death  in  the  United  States,  and  has  been  for  decades.  It  kills  more  people  than  obesity,  substance  abuse,  infectious  disease,  firearms,  and  traffic  accidents,  according  to  the  CDC.  Some  443,000  Americans  die  from  smoking-related  illnesses  every  year,  according  to  the  U.S.  Department  of  Health.Even  President  Barack  Obama,  who  has  pushed  some  of  the  toughest  anti-tobacco  laws  in  history,  admitted  in  2009  that  he  stopped  smoking  but  still  "falls  off  the  wagon"  sometimes.  The  urge  to  smoke  is  that  strong.A  portrait  of  defiance"Smoking  is  my  best  friend,"  Barry  Blackwell  said.  Blackwell  perfectly  embodies  the  predicament  of  how  the  smoking  culture  has  changed,  but  his  smoking  hasn't.  He  is  so  closely  associated  with  the  habit  he  is  featured  in  an  elegant  portrait  series  documenting  smokers'  lives."I  thought  it  was  interesting  to  explore  why  people  continue  to  smoke  in  the  face  of  public  repulsion,"  said  Laura  Noel,  a  professional  photographer  and  Emory  University  instructor  who  hopes  to  turn  the  series  into  a  book.While  shooting  these  portraits,  she  noticed  the  age  difference  among  smokers.  Young  smokers,  she  said,  enjoy  it  with  a  kind  of  practiced  defiance.  "You  see  a  little  more  of  the  addiction  when  people  get  older."Blackwell  is  nearly  60  and  runs  the  last  black-and-white  photo  development  studio  in  Atlanta.He  says  he  has  held  onto  this  other  old-fashioned  activity  --  smoking  --  for  about  as  long  as  there  have  been  Surgeon  General  warnings.  When  he  started  at  age  8,  however,  he  knew  nothing  about  the  health  risks.9  tips  to  stop  smokingBlackwell  is  a  child  of  tobacco  country.  He  grew  up  in  North  Carolina.  Like  several  generations  before  him,  he  spent  summers  working  the  family  tobacco  farm."Everyone  around  me  smoked,  everyone,"  Blackwell  said.  "Every  room  in  the  house  had  an  ashtray.  I  don't  remember  anyone  at  school  telling  me  it  was  bad.  I  even  remember  going  to  the  doctor  for  a  regular  checkup  and  he'd  examine  me  with  a  cigarette  hanging  out  of  his  mouth.  It  was  a  way  of  life."When  he  joined  the  Marines,  the  government  daily  gave  Blackwell  cigarettes  with  his  C-rations.  Over  the  years,  though,  his  smoking-supportive  environment  changed.Smoking  despite  the  restrictionsHis  own  mother  quit  a  couple  of  decades  ago  after  experiencing  chest  pains.  "She's  been  after  me  ever  since,"  Blackwell  says.  Fewer  public  places  let  him  smoke.  Even  the  park  Blackwell  used  to  exercise  in  went  smoke-free  last  year.And  while  he  jokes  he  was  a  "pretty  young  thing  back  in  the  day"  and  "had  (his)  fun  when  it  was  more  socially  acceptable  to  smoke"  it's  harder  now  for  him  to  date.  "Women  don't  like  guys  who  smoke,"  he  said.He's  put  restrictions  on  himself,  keeping  his  smoking  to  one  room  in  his  "mancave."  But  he's  not  ashamed  of  smoking,  and  refuses  to  lie  about  it  like  the  estimated  40%  of  traditional  cigarette  smokers  who  say  they  do,  according  to  an  independent  research  firm  that  conducted  a  recent  survey  on  behalf  of  an  e-cigarette  company.Still,  Blackwell  said  he  understands  the  reasons  behind  deception.Doctors  support  raising  the  smoking  age"People  look  at  you  with  less  regard  when  you  smoke,"  Blackwell  said.  Strangers  who  see  him  smoke  tell  him  it  will  kill  him,  he  said.  "It's  one  of  the  few  socially  acceptable  prejudices  left."He's  tried  to  quit,  but  nothing  worked.  In  fact,  in  the  '80s  he  had  more  success  quitting  a  drug  that  is  supposed  to  be  more  addictive.  "Cocaine  was  a  lot  easier  to  kick  than  cigarettes,"  he  said.There's  a  very  good  reason  for  that.'They  will  lose  their  capacity  to  make  a  free  choice'While  smoking  harms  your  health,  you  don't  notice  it  at  first.  That's  why  the  World  Health  Organization  calls  tobacco  a  "gradual  killer."  By  the  time  smokers  may  feel  the  effects,  they're  addicted."Smokers  typically  start  smoking  as  adolescents  or  young  adults,  with  initial  smoking  occurring  in  social  situations,"  said  Sherry  McKee,  the  director  of  the  Yale  Behavioral  Pharmacology  Lab.  "Most  young  smokers  believe  that  they  can  easily  quit  at  any  time  and  nearly  all  believe  that  they  won't  be  long-term  smokers.""Ultimately,  they  will  lose  their  capacity  to  make  a  free  choice  to  smoke,"  said  Jed  Rose,  the  director  of  the  Duke  Center  for  Smoking  Cessation  in  North  Carolina.  "Then  30  years  later,  that's  when  we  typically  see  them  in  our  program  desperately  trying  to  quit,  because  now  they  can't  go  a  single  day  without  (a  cigarette)."Nine  ex-smokers  who  quit  the  habit  for  goodIn  addition,  tobacco  marketing  strategies  can  be  persuasive.  Several  studies  show  the  marketing  and  advertising  works,  and  increases  the  likelihood  that  youth  will  start  smoking.In  2011,  cigarette  companies  spent  $8.37  billion  on  ads  and  promotional  expenses  in  the  United  States  alone  --  even  with  tight  federal  regulations  on  advertising,  according  to  the  CDC.  That  breaks  down  to  about  $23  million  a  day  or  $27  for  every  American  per  year.Warnings  on  cigarette  packs  themselves  have  used  increasingly  stronger  language  over  the  years.  In  1965,  federal  law  required  the  warning  "Caution:  Cigarette  smoking  may  be  hazardous  to  your  health"  be  placed  on  a  side  panel  of  the  pack,  according  to  the  CDC.  That  changed  to  "Warning:  Cigarette  smoking  is  dangerous  to  health  and  may  cause  death  from  cancer  and  other  diseases"  in  1967,  then  "Warning:  The  Surgeon  General  has  determined  that  cigarette  smoking  is  dangerous  to  your  health"  in  1969.Today's  packs  use  one  of  four  warnings,  including  "Surgeon  General's  warning:  Smoking  causes  lung  cancer,  heart  disease,  emphysema  and  may  complicate  pregnancy"  and  "Surgeon  General's  warning:  Quitting  smoking  now  greatly  reduces  serious  risks  to  your  health."However,  warning  labels  in  the  United  States  are  considered  "weaker  and  less  prominent"  than  those  in  other  countries,  according  to  the  CDC.  Some  other  nations  use  graphic  images.A  U.S.  move  toward  use  of  similar  tactics  on  cigarette  packs  was  blocked  by  a  federal  judge  in  2011.  U.S.  District  Judge  Richard  J.  Leon  cited  First  Amendment  rights  against  unconstitutionally  compelled  speech  as  a  factor  in  his  decision.Meanwhile,  a  strong  combination  of  psychological  and  biological  factors  keep  people  smoking."The  chemicals  in  cigarettes  work  on  the  structures  deep  within  a  smoker's  brain,  literally  rewiring  it  so  the  habit  becomes  deeply  ingrained,"  said  Rose.With  drugs  like  cocaine,  there  can  be  extreme  discomfort  from  withdrawal  in  those  first  few  days,  but  it  goes  away.  "The  behavior  addiction  of  smoking  may  be  far  more  compelling  than  just  the  short-term  withdrawal  symptoms  of  a  hard  drug,"  he  said.That  means  smokers  may  be  more  addicted  to  the  smoking  behaviors  than  the  nicotine."Every  move  a  smoker  makes:  the  lighting  of  the  cigarette,  the  inhaling,  all  the  feelings  and  sensations  of  it,  the  whole  package  becomes  highly  addictive,"  Rose  said.That's  why,  when  helping  people  quit,  Rose  said  his  organization  has  found  a  patch  or  lozenge  or  drug  in  combination  with  behavioral  change  techniques  is  more  successful.  They're  also  exploring  e-cigarettes  as  an  alternative.E-cigarettes:  Healthy  tool  or  gateway  drug?Quitters  resolveBehavioral  modification  and  the  patch:  that's  the  approach  smoker  Derrick  Jones  is  taking  with  his  New  Year's  resolution  to  quit.Jones  doesn't  remember  why  he  started  smoking.  In  fact,  the  36-year-old  communications  consultant  said  he  forbade  his  mom  and  grandma  from  smoking  when  they  rode  in  the  car  with  him.He  thinks  he  started  to  relieve  stress  when  he  moved  to  Washington  in  the  mid-'90s.  He  tried  quitting  last  spring,  but  "booze"  was  a  trigger,  he  said.  He  can't  avoid  being  around  alcohol;  on  Sundays  he  hosts  karaoke  at  a  local  bar,  and  says  it  always  leaves  him  with  an  urge  to  smoke.This  time  the  patch  seems  to  help,  but  it  interrupts  his  sleep.  "The  patch  gives  me  nightmares  and  wakes  me  up  at  5  a.m.,"  Jones  said.He  heads  to  the  gym  on  those  mornings.  The  exercise  seems  to  be  an  adequate  distraction,  he  said."I  figured  I'd  change  everything  at  once,  my  eating  habits  and  exercise  habits  and  smoking  habits  so  I'll  be  better  ready  for  a  total  change."Blackwell,  meanwhile,  said  he  thinks  he's  quit  trying  to  quit.Twin  study  shows  smoking  ages  your  face  faster"I  still  run  and  am  still  healthy  and  I've  got  lots  of  smokers  in  my  family  who  lived  long  into  their  late  80s,"  Blackwell  said.  "Smoking  is  always  with  me  long  after  friends  have  left  and  people  have  gone.  Cigarettes  are  always  here."</TEXT></DOC>

"In  that  sense,  it's  amazing."Watson  --  who  works  for  Turner  Broadcasting  System,  an  entity  that  includes  CNN  --  and  her  partner  were  one  of  57  couples  to  get  same-sex  marriage  licenses  in  Ingham  County,  according  to  county  clerk  Barb  Byrum.Byrum,  a  Democrat  elected  to  the  county  clerk  post,  said  that  she  personally  performed  30  ceremonies  in  Mason."Today  was  an  awesome  day,"  Byrum  tweeted.Not  all  county  clerks  followed  suit  by  taking  the  abnormal  step  of  opening  up  their  offices  on  a  weekend.  But  there  were  a  few  others,  such  as  in  Oakland  County,  according  to  CNN  affiliate  WDIV.There,  in  Pontiac,  Frank  Colasonti  and  James  Ryder  arrived  early  for  the  chance  to  marry  after  26  years  together.Colasonti  told  WDIV  that  "we  wanted  to  get  married  as  soon  as  possible"  in  the  wake  of  the  court  ruling  issued  late  Friday  afternoon.  Their  motivation  was  simple:  "We  love  each  other,  and  we  want  to  make  sure  that  we  protect  each  other."As  to  being  among  the  first  gay  couples  married  in  Michigan,  Colasonti  said,  "It's  historic,  and  we're  glad  we're  a  part  of  it.  And  we  are  just  happy."There's  a  chance  that  their  marriage  could  be  among  the  last,  too.Michigan  Attorney  General  Bill  Schuette,  a  Republican  whose  term  expires  later  this  year,  announced  on  Friday  evening  he'd  filed  an  emergency  request  for  U.S.  District  Judge  Bernard  Friedman's  order  to  be  stayed  and  appealed."In  2004,  the  citizens  of  Michigan  recognized  that  diversity  in  parenting  is  best  for  kids  and  families  because  moms  and  dads  are  not  interchangeable,"  Schuette  said.  "Michigan  voters  enshrined  that  decision  in  our  state  constitution,  and  their  will  should  stand  and  be  respected."The  U.S.  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Sixth  Circuit  issued  an  order  Saturday  to  temporarily  stay  through  at  least  Wednesday  the  decision  by  Friedman.  In  its  brief  order,  the  court  explained  that  it  did  so  "to  allow  a  more  reasoned  consideration  of  the  motion  to  stay."Earlier,  the  same  court  had  said  that  those  opposed  to  Schuette's  request  have  until  noon  Tuesday  to  respond.It's  not  immediately  clear  what  will  happen,  then,  with  the  same-sex  marriages  that  took  place  earlier  Saturday.Watson  said  she  isn't  surprised  by  the  stay  and  is  bracing  for  the  idea  she  and  Sherman  won't  immediately  have  full  benefits  available  to  them  in  Michigan  --  though  she  expects  that,  at  least,  they'll  now  have  federal  benefits  available  to  marriage  same-sex  couples."It  is  what  we  expected,"  Watson  said.  "We  know  that  we  are  on  the  right  side  of  history."In  fact,  Friedman's  ruling  was  the  latest  in  a  series  of  recent  district  judge  decisions  --  which  have  also  affected  Texas,  Virginia,  Kentucky,  Oklahoma  and  Utah  --  striking  down  state  laws  restricting  marriage  to  one  man  and  one  woman.  Judges  later  issued  stays  of  those  decisions  until  higher  courts  weigh  in.Carl  Tobias,  a  professor  at  the  University  of  Richmond's  law  school,  explained  that  appellate  judges  must  weigh  in  on  all  these  cases.  The  Supreme  Court  likely  won't  add  its  input  until  its  next  term,  which  starts  in  October.  Still,  the  trend  in  the  courts  --  which  also  happens  to  mirror  that  in  public  opinion  polls  --  so  far  is  clear."It's  all  in  one  direction  right  now,"  Tobias  said.Regardless  of  the  fact  her  situation  is  in  limbo,  Watson  and  her  partner  are  celebrating,  nonetheless.  They  have  family  members  expressing  joy  and  solidarity  along  with  them,  such  as  a  brother-in-law  who  noted  the  two  are  finally  "acting  out  what's  been  in  place  for  years."But  most  importantly,  they  have  their  16-year-old  daughter  to  savor  the  moment  with  --  who  they  were  able  to  jointly  adopt  years  ago  in  Georgia  and  who  was  at  her  parents'  wedding  ceremony  in  Mason."She's  excited  about  it,"  Watson  said.CNN's  Bill  Mears  contributed  to  this  report</TEXT></DOC>

He  was  69.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Harold  Ramis,  the  actor,  writer  and  director  whose  films  include  "Stripes,"  "Ghostbusters,"  "Groundhog  Day"  and  "Analyze  This,"  has  died.  He  was  69.His  death  was  caused  by  complications  related  to  autoimmune  inflammatory  vasculitis,  a  condition  Ramis  battled  for  four  years,  according  to  United  Talent  Agency,  which  represented  Ramis  for  many  years.His  disease  is  called  'painful'  and  'debilitating'Ramis  died  Monday  morning  in  his  Chicago-area  home,  the  agency  said.For  more  than  40  years,  Ramis  was  a  leading  figure  in  comedy.  A  veteran  of  the  Second  City  troupe  in  his  hometown  of  Chicago,  he  was  a  writer  for  "SCTV"  and  wrote  or  co-wrote  the  scripts  for  "National  Lampoon's  Animal  House"  (1978),  "Caddyshack"  (1980),  "Stripes"  (1981),  "Ghostbusters"  (1984),  "Groundhog  Day"  (1993)  and  "Analyze  This"  (1999).The  films  often  featured  members  of  his  generation  of  comedy  talents  --  veterans  of  the  National  Lampoon's  recordings,  "Saturday  Night  Live"  and  "Second  City  TV"  --  most  notably  Ramis'  old  comedy  colleague  and  fellow  Chicagoan  Bill  Murray."Harold  Ramis  and  I  together  did  'The  National  Lampoon  Show'  off-Broadway,  'Meatballs,'  'Stripes,'  'Caddyshack,'  'Ghostbusters'  and  'Groundhog  Day.'  He  earned  his  keep  on  this  planet,"  said  Murray  in  a  statement.  "God  bless  him."Ramis'  directing  credits  include  "Caddyshack,"  "National  Lampoon's  Vacation"  (1983),  "Groundhog  Day,"  "Analyze  This"  and  --  in  a  change  from  his  usual  comedies  --  the  dark  2005  film  "The  Ice  Harvest."  He  occasionally  acted  as  well,  most  notably  playing  Murray's  friend  in  "Stripes,"  Dr.  Egon  Spengler  in  "Ghostbusters"  and  a  doctor  in  "As  Good  as  It  Gets"  (1997)."Ghostbusters"  star  Dan  Aykroyd  wrote  on  Facebook,  "Deeply  saddened  to  hear  of  the  passing  of  my  brilliant,  gifted,  funny  friend,  co-writer/performer  and  teacher  Harold  Ramis.  May  he  now  get  the  answers  he  was  always  seeking."Steve  Carell,  who  worked  with  Ramis  on  "The  Office,"  tweeted,  "Harold  Ramis.  Funny,  gracious,  kind  hearted.  A  joy  to  have  known  you."Ramis  directed  several  episodes  of  that  TV  series.Ramis'  films  were  some  of  the  most  influential  --  and  highest-grossing  --  comedies  of  recent  decades.  "Animal  House"  remains  a  model  for  knockabout  laughs  and  gross-out  moments.  "Caddyshack"  is  eminently  quotable.  "Ghostbusters"  was  the  second-biggest  box  office  hit  of  1984,  just  behind  "Beverly  Hills  Cop."But  though  the  movies  were  full  of  silly  moments,  Ramis  often  tried  to  tap  into  larger  themes.  Perhaps  most  successful  was  "Groundhog  Day"  in  which  Bill  Murray's  cynical  weatherman  is  forced  to  relive  the  same  day  over  and  over  again  until  he  finally  comes  to  terms  with  his  life.  The  film  has  been  used  as  the  subject  of  philosophical  and  religious  discussions.That  intellectual  bent  didn't  always  go  over  well  with  studio  bosses,  Ramis  observed.In  an  interview  with  the  Onion  A.V.  Club,  he  mentioned  the  studio  for  his  2009  film  "Year  One"  was  uncertain  how  to  pitch  it."When  the  studio  said,  'Well,  what  is  the  movie  about?'  I  said,  'The  movie  tracks  the  psycho-social  development  of  civilization.'  And  they  said,  'Uh,  that's  not  going  to  be  too  good  on  a  poster.'  "Ramis  was  also  a  mentor  to  several  current  comedy  writers  and  directors,  the  Chicago  Tribune  noted  in  its  obituary.  Judd  Apatow,  a  fan,  cast  him  as  Seth  Rogen's  father  in  "Knocked  Up."  Jake  Kasdan  put  him  in  "Walk  Hard:  The  Dewey  Cox  Story"  (which  was  co-produced  and  co-written  by  Apatow).Did  you  ever  meet  Ramis?  Share  your  memoriesRamis  was  usually  a  good-natured  presence,  playing  understanding  characters  --  often  doctors,  of  one  sort  or  another.  It  was  true  to  his  personality,  the  late  Second  City  founder  Bernie  Sahlins  told  the  Chicago  Tribune  in  1999."He's  the  least  changed  by  success  of  anyone  I  know  in  terms  of  sense  of  humor,  of  humility,  sense  of  self,"  Sahlins  told  the  paper.  "He's  the  same  Harold  he  was  30  years  ago.  He's  had  enormous  success  relatively,  but  none  of  it  has  gone  to  his  head  in  any  way."Indeed,  Ramis  always  seemed  to  find  a  way  to  laugh.Asked  by  The  New  York  Times  about  the  existential  questions  raised  by  "Groundhog  Day"  --  and  competing  interpretations  of  the  film's  meaning  --  he  mentioned  that  he  didn't  practice  any  religion  himself.''Although  I  am  wearing  meditation  beads  on  my  wrist,''  he  noted.  ''But  that's  because  I'm  on  a  Buddhist  diet.  They're  supposed  to  remind  me  not  to  eat,  but  actually  just  get  in  the  way  when  I'm  cutting  my  steak.''Ramis  is  survived  by  his  wife,  Erica  Mann  Ramis,  three  children  and  two  grandchildren.People  we've  lost  in  2014</TEXT></DOC>

Now  the  network  is  bringing  back  the  show  for  a  13-episode  event  series  to  air  in  2015.  Original  series  creator  Tim  Kring  is  on  board  to  run  the  show.  Titled  "Heroes  Reborn,"  the  project  is  billed  as  a  stand-alone  story;  the  characters  have  not  yet  been  announced."The  enormous  impact  'Heroes'  had  on  the  television  landscape  when  it  first  launched  in  2006  was  eye-opening,"  said  NBC  Entertainment  President  Jennifer  Salke.  "Shows  with  that  kind  of  resonance  don't  come  around  often  and  we  thought  it  was  time  for  another  installment.  We're  thrilled  that  visionary  creator  Tim  Kring  was  as  excited  about  jumping  back  into  this  show  as  we  were  and  we  look  forward  to  all  the  new  textures  and  layers  Tim  plans  to  add  to  his  original  concept.  Until  we  get  closer  to  air  in  2015,  the  show  will  be  appropriately  shrouded  in  secrecy,  but  we  won't  rule  out  the  possibility  of  some  of  the  show's  original  cast  members  popping  back  in."The  news  seems  to  echo  Fox  rebooting  its  action  franchise  "24"  for  a  limited  series  to  launch  this  May,  though  NBC  has  long  been  fond  of  recycling  prior  TV  hits  —  there  have  been  short-lived  new  version  of  "Bionic  Woman,"  "American  Gladiators,"  "Knight  Rider,"  and  the  network  had  also  developed  (but  not  aired)  new  editions  of  "Wonder  Woman"  and  "Murder  She  Wrote."Reviving  "Heroes,"  which  was  canceled  four  years  ago,  might  be  met  with  some  mixed  feelings  by  the  show's  fans,  however.  The  show  got  off  to  a  strong  start  in  both  ratings  and  acclaim  (averaging  14.5  million  viewers  its  first  season),  then  was  widely  considered  to  have  creatively  collapsed  into  a  confused  muddle  and  became  a  serialized  TV  cautionary  tale.  But  with  broadcast  drama  TV  ratings  on  the  decline,  networks  are  increasingly  turning  to  event  series  to  grab  attention,  and  brands  that  were  cancelled  years  ago  now  seem  like  potential  hits  even  if  they  only  deliver  a  large  percentage  of  their  previous  audience.  Plus,  "Heroes"  performed  well  on  DVD,  having  sold  more  than  10  million  units."Heroes"  might  be  coming  back  onto  a  field  with  plenty  of  competition,  depending  on  how  many  current  superhero  projects  get  renewed  or  greenlit.  There's  The  CW's  Arrow,  its  spinoff  The  Flash,  Fox's  Batman  prequel  in  the  pipeline  Gotham  and  ABC's  Marvel's  Agents  of  SHIELD.What  do  you  think  of  Heroes  coming  back?See  the  original  story  at  EW.com.CLICK  HERE  to  Try  2  RISK  FREE  issues  of  Entertainment  Weekly©  2011  Entertainment  Weekly  and  Time  Inc.

While  we  could  write  an  encyclopedia  on  the  city's  food  and  music  options  alone,  these  15  suggestions  will  help  you  start  to  experience  the  heart  of  this  low,  lovely,  lyrical  place.World's  most  colorful  carnivalsEat  with  your  handsAmong  the  benefits  of  dining  in  a  shellfish  culture  is  that  silverware  is  frequently  optional.  Eating  with  your  hands  is  the  only  way  to  get  through  a  bowl  of  buttery,  pepper-spiked  BBQ  shrimp  at  Pascal's  Manale  Restaurant,  where  the  iconic  dish  was  first  conceived.  Boiled  crawfish  is  the  seasonal  delicacy  from  roughly  January  through  May,  and  it's  arguably  best  eaten  on  a  park  bench  with  a  cold  one.  Big  Fisherman  in  Uptown  and  KJean  in  Mid-City  are  reliable  crawfish  takeout  spots.And  locals  tend  to  tip  oysters  on  the  half-shell  up  to  their  lips  rather  than  mess  with  those  awkward,  tiny  forks.  At  Bourbon  House  Restaurant  in  the  French  Quarter  and  Casamento's  Restaurant  in  Uptown,  no  one  expects  you  to  use  those  forks  for  anything  besides  squeezing  the  juice  from  lemon  wedges  over  your  catch.Browse  a  supermarketEspecially  at  locally  owned  grocery  stores  like  Rouses  Supermarkets  and  Langenstein's,  you  can  stock  your  suitcase  --  and,  later,  your  pantry  --  with  Louisiana  dry  goods  staples  like  Camilla  red  beans,  Cajun  Country  rice,  Zapp's  Potato  Chips  (try  the  Cajun  Crawtator),  Creole-style  coffee,  crab  boil  and  boxed  jambalaya  mix.Even  if  you  can't  find  room  among  your  boas  and  beads  for  smuggling  food  products  home,  it's  worth  a  wander  down  the  spice  aisle  to  observe  in  what  amazing  quantities  New  Orleanians  stock  up  on  bay  leaves  and  cayenne  pepper.Cool  off  with  a  sno-ballNew  Orleans'  best  ammunition  against  the  subtropical  heat  of  its  eight-or-so  summer  months  is,  perhaps  counter-intuitively,  not  alcoholic.  Sno-balls  (not  snow  cones)  are  simple  but  culturally  important  treats  of  finely  shaved  ice  drenched  in  sugary  syrups.  They  come  served  in  cups  or  Chinese  take-out  containers  and  are  generally  sold  from  trucks,  takeaway  windows  and  small  sweet  shops.  Your  favorite  sno-ball  vendor  is  generally  the  closest  sno-ball  vendor,  though  our  pick  is  Uptown's  Hansen's  Sno-Bliz,  where  the  syrup  flavors  range  from  the  traditional  (nectar,  chocolate,  cream  of  strawberry)  to  the  uber-contemporary  (satsuma,  cardamom,  ginger).Get  your  bounce  onMiley  Cyrus  might  have  brought  twerking  --  a  dance  move  that  involves  shaking  one's  rump  at  the  speed  of  a  hummingbird's  wings  --  to  a  popular  audience  at  MTV's  Video  Music  Awards  last  year,  but  New  Orleans  dancers  have  been  "popping"  since  the  late  1980s.  In  a  NOLA.com/Times-Picayune  article  last  summer,  local  music  writer  Allison  Fensterstock  even  presented  evidence  that  Miley  learned  to  twerk  to  New  Orleans  bounce  music  while  filming  a  movie  here  in  2010  and  2011.  Check  in  at  http://nolabounce.com  for  bounce  news  and  up-to-date  club  listings.Take  a  literary  tourNew  Orleans  collects  literary  ghosts,  Tennessee  Williams,  Truman  Capote  and  Eudora  Welty  among  them.  Besides  reading  works  penned  while  writers  were  encamped  in  the  city,  the  best  way  to  channel  the  city's  literary  life  is  by  touring  the  French  Quarter's  numerous  and  wonderfully  atmospheric  used  and  new  book  stores.  Call  it  antiquing  for  the  mind.  Our  favorites  include  Crescent  City  Books,  Librairie  Book  Shop  and  Kitchen  Witch,  a  store  specializing  in  used  cookbooks.  Local  author  Susan  Larsen's  book,  "The  Booklover's  Guide  to  New  Orleans,"  is  a  great  resource  for  unpacking  the  city's  literary  dimension.Eat  beignetsThe  centenarian,  open-air  coffee  and  beignet  spot  Café  du  Monde  might  be  the  most  obvious  tourist  attraction  in  the  French  Quarter,  if  not  the  entire  city.  As  we're  in  the  business  of  steering  visitors  to  New  Orleans'  more  genuine  experiences,  you  might  expect  us  to  avoid  such  clichés.  On  the  contrary.  A  beignet-free  trip  to  New  Orleans  would  be  a  travesty  of  the  first  order,  and  Café  du  Monde  has  a  high  batting  average  for  serving  a  consistently  hot  and  well-sugared  product.  The  queue  can  be  excruciating,  though,  so  keep  the  nearby  Café  Beignet,  as  well  as  the  City  Park  location  of  Morning  Call  Coffee  Stand,  in  your  back  pocket.Marvel  at  the  MississippiIn  a  city  surrounded  by  water  --  the  Great  River,  Lake  Pontchartrain,  the  ever-encroaching  Gulf  of  Mexico  --  it's  sometimes  surprising  how  infrequently  you  encounter  water  views.  Woldenberg  Park,  adjacent  to  the  French  Quarter,  is  an  exception;  it's  also  a  wonderful  place  to  pass  a  breezy  hour  or  two.  But  for  a  birds-eye  view  of  the  winding  Mississippi  and  its  workings,  take  the  elevator  at  Canal  Place  (located  at  the  foot  of  Canal  Street)  skyward.  Alternately,  "The  Fly"  at  Audubon  Park,  just  behind  the  Audubon  Zoo  in  Uptown,  is  an  expanse  of  ball  fields  and  green  space  from  which  you  can  watch  magnificent  barges  push  down  the  river  at  eye  level  --  and  practically  at  arm's  length.See  Treme  off-screenExperience  the  real-life  companion  to  David  Simon's  HBO  series  "Treme"  by  exploring  what  is  sometimes  referred  to  as  America's  oldest  African-American  neighborhood.  You  could  begin  just  across  Rampart  Street  from  the  French  Quarter  at  Armstrong  Park.  Then  make  your  way  to  Backstreet  Cultural  Museum  for  a  Mardi  Gras  Indian  history  lesson,  worship  at  a  jazz-filled  Mass  at  St.  Augustine  Catholic  Church  and  lunch  on  Creole  gumbo,  seafood  platters  and  po-boys  at  Li'l  Dizzy's  Café.Take  a  Katrina  tourKatrina  tours  are  touchy,  and  with  good  reason.  Cruising  in  air-conditioned  buses  or  vans  through  previously  flooded  neighborhoods  where  the  worst  possible  scenario  occurred  --  and  where,  nine  years  later,  life  is  hardly  back  to  normal  --  is  inherently  controversial.  But  seeing  the  altered  neighborhoods  with  a  knowledgeable  guide  is  also  the  best  way  to  unpack  the  natural  and  human-wrought  causes  behind  Hurricane  Katrina's  remarkable  losses  of  life,  land  and  property.Drink  a  SazeracNew  Orleans  had  a  cocktail  culture  long  before  "mixologist"  entered  the  popular  lexicon  and  specialty  cocktail  bars  augmented  the  nation's  bar  topography.  Though  it's  also  drunk  in  other  cities,  New  Orleans  has  laid  claim  to  the  Sazerac,  a  stiff  drink  of  rye  whiskey,  bitters,  sugar,  absinthe  or  pastis  and  a  twist  of  lemon.Mixologists  make  reputable  versions  in  their  cocktail  bars  even  here,  but  the  best  places  to  drink  Sazeracs  are  where  they've  always  done  well  --  in  historic  hotel  bars  like  the  Carousel  Bar  in  the  Hotel  Monteleone  or  the  Sazerac  Bar  in  The  Roosevelt  New  Orleans;  and  in  the  city's  oldest  restaurants,  like  Tujague's  and  Galatoire's.Go  to  Mardi  GrasIf  you  can't  make  it  down  for  the  actual  holiday,  you  can  still  peek  at  the  pageantry.  Tours  at  Mardi  Gras  World  offer  spectacular  behind-the-scenes  looks  at  float  production  and  costumes,  as  well  as  off-season  tastes  of  king  cake.Lunch  on  fried  chicken  in  the  Seventh  Ward,  twiceJust  two  blocks  apart,  the  kitchens  at  Willie  Mae's  Scotch  House  and  Dooky  Chase's  Restaurant  arguably  put  out  the  city's  most  consistently  fine  fried  chicken,  though  only  at  lunch.  The  restaurants  and  their  90-plus-year-old  matriarchs  are  not  at  war,  but  instead  coexist  peacefully,  with  differences  in  ambiance  and  chicken-frying  styles.  Willie  Mae's  is  a  more  casual  restaurant  with  chicken  cooked  to  order,  while  Dooky  Chase  is  a  white-tablecloth  establishment  with  a  lunch  buffet.Turn  on  the  radioWherever  you  listen  to  90.7  WWOZ  community-supported  radio  (you  can  stream  online  from  anyplace),  it  sounds  like  Louisiana.  Horns.  Accordions.  Carnival  tunes.  Listen  long  enough  and  you'll  find  your  favorite  DJs  and  shows  --  for  us,  it's  Bill  DeTurk's  New  Orleans  Music  Show  on  Fridays  and  the  back-to-back  Gospel  and  bluegrass  programs  on  Sunday  mornings.Local  food  media  personality  Tom  Fitzmorris  hosts  a  three-hour  radio  show  about  New  Orleans  food  every  weekday  around  lunchtime  on  1350  AM  and  105.3  FM.  And  the  local  NPR  station,  WWNO  89.9  FM,  is  rife  with  local  programming.Find  some  brassEspecially  in  the  spring,  around  Mardi  Gras  and  Jazz  Fest,  it's  nearly  impossible  to  walk  down  a  New  Orleans  sidewalk  without  eavesdropping  on  some  school  kid  practicing  his  trumpet  or  her  trombone.  Music  begins  in  the  schools  and  in  the  neighborhoods.  Second  line  parades,  which  include  brass  bands,  roll  every  Sunday  during  the  cooler  months.  And  in-between  the  beads  and  masks  in  Carnival  parades  are  junior  high  and  high  school  marching  bands  high-stepping  and  getting  the  crowds  moving.  For  nighttime  brass  sounds  year-round,  you  can  count  on  clubs  like  Blue  Nile,  Hi  Ho  Lounge  and  Maple  Leaf  Bar,  where  the  Rebirth  Brass  Band  raises  the  roof  every  Tuesday  night.See  some  art,  and  eat  some  tooNew  Orleans  has  a  centrally  located  arts  district,  commonly  called  the  Warehouse  District,  which  is  a  little-known  relative  to  the  city's  more  historic  and  heavily  toured  neighborhoods.  The  Contemporary  Arts  Center  (CAC)  is  the  district's  anchor,  though  it's  no  longer  the  only  attraction.  Additionally,  the  Ogden  Museum  of  Southern  Art,  the  National  World  War  II  Museum,  the  Louisiana  Children's  Museum  and  numerous  galleries  and  art  spaces  have  built  a  neighborhood  where  you  could  easily  spend  a  couple  of  days.To  sweeten  the  pot,  the  Warehouse  District  happens  to  be  a  culinary  hotbed,  with  top-tier  restaurants  like  the  Link  Restaurant  Group's  Cochon  and  Peche,  Emeril  Lagasse's  flagship  restaurant  Emeril's  New  Orleans,  Adolfo  Garcia's  steakhouse  La  Boca  and  John  Besh's  American  Sector  at  the  World  War  II  Museum.</TEXT></DOC>

A  major  U.S.  pharmacy  chain  is  breaking  that  habit.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Want  to  pick  up  a  pack  of  cigarettes  with  your  prescription  refill?  A  major  U.S.  pharmacy  chain  is  breaking  that  habit.CVS  Caremark  announced  Wednesday  it  will  stop  selling  cigarettes  and  other  tobacco  products  at  its  CVS/pharmacy  stores  by  October  1.The  retailer  said  the  move  makes  CVS/pharmacy  the  first  chain  of  national  pharmacies  to  take  tobacco  products  off  the  shelves."Ending  the  sale  of  cigarettes  and  tobacco  products  at  CVS/pharmacy  is  the  right  thing  for  us  to  do  for  our  customers  and  our  company  to  help  people  on  their  path  to  better  health,"  Larry  J.  Merlo,  president  and  CEO  of  CVS  Caremark,  said  in  a  statement.  "Put  simply,  the  sale  of  tobacco  products  is  inconsistent  with  our  purpose."CVS  Caremark  is  the  largest  pharmacy  in  the  United  States  based  on  total  prescription  revenue,  according  to  the  company.  It  operates  more  than  7,600  CVS/pharmacy  stores  nationwide  in  addition  to  more  than  800  MinuteClinics,  which  are  medical  clinics  within  the  pharmacy  locations.Health-oriented  organizations  and  President  Barack  Obama  praised  the  move."As  one  of  the  largest  retailers  and  pharmacies  in  America,  CVS  Caremark  sets  a  powerful  example,  and  today's  decision  will  help  advance  my  administration's  efforts  to  reduce  tobacco-related  deaths,  cancer,  and  heart  disease,  as  well  as  bring  down  health  care  costs  --  ultimately  saving  lives  and  protecting  untold  numbers  of  families  from  pain  and  heartbreak  for  years  to  come,"  Obama  said  in  a  statement  Wednesday."This  is  an  important,  bold  public  health  decision  by  a  major  retail  pharmacy  to  act  on  the  long  understood  reality  that  blending  providing  health  care  and  providing  cigarettes  just  doesn't  match,"  said  Dr.  Richard  Wender,  chief  cancer  control  officer  at  the  American  Cancer  Society."We  need  an  all-hands-on-deck  effort  to  take  tobacco  products  out  of  the  hands  of  America's  young  generation,  and  to  help  those  who  are  addicted  to  quit,"  Health  and  Human  Services  Secretary  Kathleen  Sebelius  said  in  a  statement.  "Today's  CVS  Caremark  announcement  helps  bring  our  country  closer  to  achieving  a  tobacco-free  generation.  I  hope  others  will  follow  their  lead."It  remained  unclear  whether  other  pharmacies  will  follow  CVS'  lead."We  have  been  evaluating  this  product  category  for  some  time  to  balance  the  choices  our  customers  expect  from  us  with  their  ongoing  health  needs,"  Walgreens  spokesman  Jim  Graham  said  in  a  statement."We  will  continue  to  evaluate  the  choice  of  products  our  customers  want,  while  also  helping  to  educate  them  and  providing  smoking-cessation  products  and  alternatives  that  help  to  reduce  the  demand  for  tobacco  products."Meanwhile,  David  Howard,  spokesman  for  R.J.  Reynolds  Tobacco  Co.,  said,  "We  value  the  long-term  relationship  with  CVS  and  respect  their  commercial  decision.  We  will  work  with  them  as  they  transition  out  of  the  tobacco  category  in  the  coming  months."Stopping  cigarette  sales  comes  at  a  price.  CVS  Caremark  estimates  it  will  take  an  annual  loss  of  $2  billion  from  tobacco  shoppers  --  $1.5  billion  in  tobacco  sales  and  the  rest  from  other  products  tobacco  shoppers  purchase  while  in  the  store.The  company  has  enjoyed  growing  revenues  in  recent  years,  boosted  by  its  pharmacy  services  business  and  prescription  drug  sales.CVS  Caremark  hasn't  reported  its  year-end  results  yet,  but  it  took  in  nearly  $94  billion  in  revenues  in  the  first  nine  months  of  2013,  up  slightly  from  the  same  period  in  2012,  according  to  its  most  recent  earnings  report.In  2012,  CVS  Caremark  reported  $123.1  billion  in  revenues,  a  15%  jump  from  $107.1  billion  the  previous  year."We  commend  CVS  for  putting  public  health  ahead  of  their  bottom  line  and  recognizing  the  need  for  pharmacies  to  focus  on  supporting  health  and  wellness  instead  of  contributing  to  disease  and  death  caused  by  tobacco  use,"  the  American  Medical  Association  said.Asked  Wednesday  about  the  reaction  of  tobacco  executives  to  the  decision,  CVS  Caremark's  Merlo  said  they  were  "disappointed.  At  the  same  time,  I  think  they  understand  the  paradox  that  we  face  as  an  organization,  and  they  understand  the  rationale  for  the  decision."On  whether  CVS  would  extend  its  ban  to  other  products  known  to  be  unhealthy  --  candy,  potato  chips  or  alcohol,  for  instance  --  Merlo  told  reporters  those  items,  in  moderation,  do  not  have  the  same  adverse  effects  as  the  use  of  tobacco.We  know  it  can  kill  us:  Why  people  still  smokeHelping  people  quitThe  company  also  announced  Wednesday  it  plans  to  launch  a  national  smoking-cessation  program  in  the  spring.  The  program  will  include  information  and  treatment  on  smoking  cessation  at  CVS/pharmacy  and  Minute  Clinic  locations  in  addition  to  online  resources.Members  of  the  pharmacy  benefit  management  plan  will  be  able  to  access  comprehensive  programs  to  help  themselves  stop  smoking.Smoking-cessation  products  such  as  nicotine  patches  or  gum  will  continue  to  be  available  at  CVS/pharmacy  locations,  Dr.  Troyen  Brennan,  chief  medical  officer  for  CVS  Caremark,  said  Wednesday.The  last  cigarette:  Nine  ex-smokers  who  quit  the  habit  for  goodFewer  people  smoke  today  than  in  the  mid-20th  century,  but  there  are  still  a  lot  of  Americans  lighting  up.  In  1965,  42%  of  the  population  smoked,  compared  with  19%  today,  according  to  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention.  Experts  said  the  decline  in  smoking  has  plateaued.It's  no  secret  that  tobacco  causes  health  problems.  Cancer,  stroke,  heart  disease  and  lung  diseases  are  among  the  results  of  smoking,  according  to  the  CDC.  More  than  5  million  deaths  per  year  are  caused  by  tobacco  use.  Smokers  also  tend  to  die  10  years  before  nonsmokers,  according  to  the  CDC.Support  from  public  health  advocatesThe  company's  announcement  is  "a  huge  step  toward  our  country  being  able  to  have  a  really  long-lasting  culture  of  health,"  said  Dr.  Risa  Lavizzo-Mourey,  president  and  CEO  of  the  Robert  Wood  Johnson  Foundation,  the  largest  U.S.  philanthropy  devoted  to  public  health.In  addition  to  eliminating  a  point  of  sale  of  tobacco,  CVS  Caremark's  removal  of  tobacco  products  also  takes  away  an  advertising  opportunity,  said  Robin  Koval,  president  and  CEO  of  Legacy,  an  organization  that  conducts  research  on  tobacco  use.  Young  people  who  shop  at  CVS/pharmacy  for  other  reasons  will  no  longer  see  the  array  of  tobacco  products  available."It's  obviously  a  landmark  decision  and  one  that  I  hope  wakes  up  the  entire  retail  industry  that  it's  the  right  thing  to  do,"  Koval  said.FDA  launches  teen  anti-smoking  campaignA  report  from  the  California  Department  of  Public  Health  found  that  while  total  cigarette  sales  decreased  between  2005  and  2009  in  the  United  States,  sales  in  pharmacies  increased.  If  sales  of  cigarettes  at  pharmacies  continue  rising  at  the  current  rate,  by  2020  almost  15%  of  all  U.S.  cigarette  sales  will  occur  at  pharmacies,  the  report  said.According  to  a  2011  study  in  Los  Angeles,  cited  in  the  report,  more  than  32%  of  pharmacies  sold  cigarettes,  and  traditional  chain  pharmacies  were  far  more  likely  to  sell  cigarettes  than  independently  owned  pharmacies.Wender  noted  the  CVS  move  is  in  line  with  what  the  American  Cancer  Society,  American  Heart  Association,  American  Medical  Association,  American  Lung  Association  and  American  Pharmacists  Association  have  advocated:  to  stop  sales  of  tobacco  in  retail  outlets  with  pharmacies.On  the  other  side  of  the  issue,  there  is  a  lot  of  money  in  tobacco.  The  cigarette  industry  spent  $8.37  billion  in  2011  on  advertising  and  promotions,  according  to  the  CDC.Most  tobacco  is  sold  in  convenience  stores,  which  would  be  "a  tougher  nut  to  crack"  in  terms  of  stopping  tobacco  sales,  Wender  said.But  pharmacies  are  a  good  place  to  start,  Wender  said.  He  is  convinced  the  removal  of  tobacco  products  from  CVS/pharmacy  locations  will  result  in  some  smokers  quitting,  particularly  those  who  have  a  habit  of  buying  their  cigarettes  there."It's  going  to  force  every  one  of  them  to  pause  and  say,  'Why  isn't  my  CVS  selling  cigarettes  anymore?'  "  Wender  said.How  you  can  prevent  most  kinds  of  cancerCNNMoney's  Melanie  Hicken  and  Aaron  Smith  and  CNN's  Jen  Christensen  and  Miriam  Falco  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

An  Oscar-nominated  documentary  is  a  painful  reminder  of  what  has  been  lost.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Cynthia  Schneider  is  a  professor  in  the  practice  of  diplomacy  at  Georgetown  University,  dean  at  the  School  of  Diplomacy  at  Dubrovnik  International  University  and  a  senior  nonresident  fellow  at  the  Brookings  Institution.  She  is  also  a  former  U.S.  ambassador  to  the  Netherlands.(CNN)  --  Egyptian  voters  this  month  ratified  a  new  constitution  that  enshrines  the  military,  police  and  intelligence  in  positions  of  unprecedented  power.  Filmgoers  elsewhere  could  watch  "The  Square,"  Jehane  Noujaim's  documentary  about  resilient  revolutionaries  --  youth,  intellectuals  and  Muslim  Brotherhood  --  fighting  for  dignity,  social  justice,  economic  empowerment  and  freedom.Which  is  the  true  Egypt?  Both,  but  the  second  has  been  ignored  by  the  Obama  administration  and  much  of  the  media.In  Washington  as  in  Egypt,  there  are  two  narratives:  1)  The  army  has  brought  back  stability,  and  the  revolution  is  over;  2)  Egyptians  have  banished  fear,  if  not  the  regime,  and  many  who  led  and  joined  the  revolution  continue  to  fight  for  the  same  aspirations,  while  soberly  acknowledging  the  challenges  ahead.The  second  narrative  comes  to  life  in  "The  Square,"  the  Oscar-nominated  documentary  that  tracks  Egypt's  uprisings  from  the  inspiring  18  days  that  began  three  years  ago  on  January  25,  when  protesters  crossed  Tahrir  Square,  to  the  crackdown  on  the  Brotherhood  camps  last  August.  (Full  disclosure:  I  donated  $90  to  the  Kickstarter  campaign  that  supported  the  film,  and  I  know  director  Jehane  Noujaim  and  producer  Karim  Amer  personally.)Through  the  eyes  of  three  revolutionaries  who  meet  in  Tahrir  Square  during  the  first  protests  in  2011--  Ahmed  Hassan,  a  young  street  vendor  who  emerges  as  a  charismatic  leader  in  Tahrir;  Khalid  Abdalla,  a  third-generation  activist  and  actor  (star  of  "The  Kite  Runner,"  and  founder  of  the  post-revolution  media  collective  Mosireen);  and  Magdy  Ashour,  a  member  of  the  Muslim  Brotherhood  --  we  see  the  events  of  the  last  three  years  unfold  in  fits  and  starts  of  optimism,  betrayal,  and  disappointment.This  is  the  Egypt  that  the  Obama  administration  has  forgotten.  This  is  the  Egypt  that  took  Washington  by  surprise  three  years  ago.  True,  the  initial  promise  of  those  utopian  18  days  when  the  country  overcame  economic  and  ethnic  barriers  to  find  common  cause,  has  not  been  redeemed.  No  surprise.  After  decades  of  U.S.-  backed  authoritarian  rule,  Egyptians  have  no  reliable  independent  institutions,  only  the  ability  to  take  to  the  streets  in  protest.  And  now  the  new  military-backed  constitution  takes  that  away.Ahmed,  Khalid,  Magdy,  and  their  compatriots  in  "The  Square"  --  such  as  Ramy,  who  is  brutally  beaten  by  the  security  forces  for  the  crime  of  leading  Tahrir  in  song  --  demonstrate  that  this  Egypt  is  resilient.  They  may  not  have  learned  to  organize  political  parties  and  to  take  power  in  three  years,  a  failing  that  left  first  the  Brotherhood  and  then  the  military  to  fill  that  vacuum,  but  they  also  are  not  abandoning  the  struggle  for  their  rights.Egyptian  activists  behind  bars  on  uprising's  anniversaryGiven  the  film's  portrayal  of  the  military's  repeated  attacks  on  protesters,  beginning  in  March  2011,  it  is  difficult  to  understand  the  infatuation  with  Gen.  Abdel  Fattah  el-Sisi  and  the  army,  a  sentiment  that  extends  to  liberals  such  as  author  Alaa  al-Aswany.  Recently  returned  from  Cairo,  "The  Square"  producer  Karim  Amer  said  in  a  talkback  session,  "People  are  beginning  to  wake  up  and  recognize  what  the  regime  is  doing  to  divide  Egyptians."In  a  tragic  postscript  to  the  film,  Magdy  Ashour  currently  is  confined  to  his  home  --  a  common  fate  for  Brotherhood  members  --  unable  to  work  for  fear  of  arrest  under  the  military's  condemnation  of  the  Muslim  Brotherhood  as  a  terrorist  organization.  This  is  ironic,  since  Magdy  sided  with  the  revolutionaries  against  Egypt's  deposed  president,  Mohammed  Morsy.  The  current  Egyptian  regime's  policy  of  outlawing  a  movement  with  millions  of  Egyptian  supporters,  one  that  supplied  essential  social  services  to  the  poor,  cannot  end  well.And  where  is  the  United  States?  As  usual,  it  has  no  impact.  Having  consistently  abandoned  those  fighting  for  the  goals  of  the  revolution,  the  U.S.  has  steadily  weakened  its  position  of  influence.Now  the  U.S.  speaks  to  the  military  to  no  avail.  While  Defense  Secretary  Chuck  Hagel  dials  el-Sisi  to  discourage  growing  repression,  gaining  nothing  from  their  conversations,  the  U.S.  is  vilified  in  the  Egyptian  media."The  Square"  should  be  a  painful  reminder  for  the  White  House,  Congress,  and  State  Department  of  the  nature  of  the  military  regime  the  U.S.  continues  to  back,Egyptians,  who  already  know  this  well  enough,  do  not  have  the  opportunity  to  see  the  film:  It  languishes  in  the  state  censorship  authority.  And  no  wonder.  The  military-backed  regime  surely  does  not  want  Egyptians  to  see  the  juxtaposition  of  army  leaders  promising  "not  to  harm  a  single  Egyptian"  with  the  brutal  beatings  inflicted  on  protesters.The  Oscars  have  done  what  the  White  House  has  failed  to  do:  Recognize  the  ongoing  narrative  of  Egypt's  revolution.Now  the  Egyptian  authorities  must  allow  their  countrymen  to  see  their  own  history.  There  are  encouraging  signs  that  the  Oscar  nomination  has  prompted  them  to  review  the  film's  status.  The  Jumbotrons  screening  "The  Square"  in  the  Square  cannot  come  a  moment  too  soon.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Cynthia  Schneider.</TEXT></DOC>

For  her,  that  would  mean  bringing  out  the  vert  ramp  after  school  and  skateboarding  until  dark.These  days,  the  only  thing  she's  boarding  is  another  flight  to  Europe.This  Fashion  Week  season,  the  17-year-old  model  is  being  dogged  by  phrases  like  "it  girl"  and  "one  to  watch"  that  are  being  tossed  around  by  industry  insiders.This  week,  she's  across  the  pond  in  London  walking  for  Jonathan  Saunders  and  Giles  and  will  soon  be  off  to  Fashion  Week  events  in  Milan.  These  appearances  come  on  the  tail  of  spring  ad  campaigns  for  high  fashion  houses  Saint  Laurent  and  Red  Valentino."Every  job  that  I  get,  I  feel  so  honored,"  she  said.  "Because  yes,  there  are  so,  so  many  models  that  would  die  to  be  in  my  position  on  that  set,  doing  that  shoot."But  the  Arizona-born  teen  wasn't  always  so  keen  on  the  idea  of  modeling,  despite  her  mother's  urging  that  she  had  something  rare,  that  elusive  je  ne  sais  quoi."I  was  such  a  skater,  tomboy  girl  that  I  was  like,  'that  will  never  be  me,'  "  she  said.  "I  was  definitely  anti-girly  girl,  makeup,  fashion,  all  that."Less  than  two  years  ago,  fate  stepped  in  wearing  stilettos:  Westling  was  scouted  in  her  home  state  by  the  Agency  Arizona.  Shortly  after,  a  representative  from  the  Society,  now  her  agency  in  New  York,  came  out  to  scout  her  for  a  bigger  market.Last  summer,  Westling  was  flown  out  to  New  York  to  try  her  hand  at  Fashion  Week.  But,  as  the  end  of  the  week  approached,  she  hadn't  booked  a  single  job."It  was  like,  'OK,  I  don't  know  anymore,  nothing  is  really  working  out,'  "  she  said.Then,  she  got  the  call  for  the  Marc  Jacobs  "exclusive"  --  meaning  she  would  open  the  show.  It's  the  fashion  equivalent  of  a  high  school  baseball  player  getting  the  call  from  the  Yankees.Fast-forward  five  months,  and  the  laid-back  skater  girl  says  that  modeling,  however  unlikely,  is  her  focal  point.  (Though  she  does,  admittedly,  get  antsy  after  a  while  getting  her  hair,  makeup  and  nails  done  and  redone  for  each  show.)"People  think  we  stand  in  front  of  a  camera  for  30  seconds  and  that's  our  day,"  she  said.  "In  actuality,  we  work  really,  really  hard,  and  a  lot  of  the  money  we  earn,  we  earn  it."For  her,  that  means  shape-shifting  from  17-year-old  tomboy  to  high  fashion  archetype.Westling,  who  describes  her  natural  hair  color  as  a  "dirty  blonde,  auburn  mix,"  first  dyed  her  mane  a  shocking  "Little  Mermaid"  red  for  the  Marc  Jacobs  spring  2014  ad  campaign,  which  also  just  happens  to  feature  controversial  star  du  jour  Miley  Cyrus."I  think  it's  cool.  It's  perfect  to  be  able  to  stand  out,"  she  said.With  her  neon  tresses,  Westling  walked  in  shows  for  Prabal  Gurung,  Vera  Wang,  Anna  Sui  and  Marc  Jacobs  during  this  month's  New  York  Fashion  Week."A  lot  of  (designers)  were  surprised.  A  lot  of  them  didn't  like  it,  but  I  didn't  really  care,"  she  said.  "When  it  comes  to  certain  shows,  obviously,  this  color  wouldn't  match  the  clothing,  and  it  wouldn't  look  good,  so  I  understand  getting  canceled  for  shows  or  not  getting  picked  for  shows."That  tinge  of  teenage  rebellion  is  working  for  Westling,  who  is  in  high  demand.  Her  breakout  success  comes  at  a  pivotal  time,  as  New  York  legislature  passed  a  bill  in  November  that  deems  models  under  18,  like  Westling,  child  performers.  Among  the  stipulations:  Models  must  obtain  a  permit  to  work  in  the  state,  employers  must  also  be  certified  to  employ  the  young  models,  and  child  performers  must  get  12  hours  of  rest  between  jobs.Still,  Westling  is  growing  up  fast  in  the  high-stakes  fashion  world."You  drop  off  the  teenager  side  of  you  and  just  go  full-force  into  modeling  and  make  it  into  a  career  and  pursue  it  for  a  while,"  she  said.It's  a  work  ethos  she  credits  to  being  raised  by  older  parents,  who  still  live  in  Arizona:  Her  mother  had  her  when  she  was  43."My  teenage  years  were  like  when  I  was  10,"  she  joked."It  helps  me  in  this  industry,  because  you  have  to  act  mature,  take  responsibility  for  yourself,  because  no  one  else  will."See  all  of  CNN  Living's  New  York  Fashion  Week  coverage.</TEXT></DOC>

We  need  it  in  every  aspect  of  our  lives:  to  get  up  in  the  morning  and  go  to  work,  to  start  (and  finish)  that  10-page  paper,  to  do  laundry  after  a  long  day.Yet  the  motivation  to  get  healthy  often  eludes  us.  It  hides  in  the  form  of  excuses  --  excuses  for  why  we  can't  go  to  the  gym  or  cook  a  healthy  meal,  why  we  can't  get  enough  sleep  or  make  time  for  ourselves.Often  we  lack  motivation  because  we  lack  inspiration.Why  I  became  a  triathleteEvery  year  CNN  selects  iReporters  to  race  in  a  triathlon  with  Dr.  Sanjay  Gupta  and  the  Fit  Nation  team.  This  year  we're  giving  six  lucky  readers  a  road  bike  (with  all  the  necessary  accessories),  a  wet  suit  and  a  gym  membership  to  help  them  prepare  for  the  Nautica  Malibu  Triathlon  on  September  14.As  they  train  for  their  first  triathlon  with  support  from  our  fitness  and  nutrition  coaches,  they'll  blog,  tweet  and  share  their  workouts  online.  You'll  watch  as  they  get  ready  to  swim  a  half-mile  in  the  ocean,  bike  18  miles  and  run  4  miles  along  the  Pacific  coast.We  hope  this  year's  Fit  Nation  Triathlon  Challenge  team  will  inspire  you  to  make  your  own  health  a  priority.  Whether  it's  being  a  role  model  for  your  children,  accomplishing  a  personal  goal  or  simply  being  able  to  enjoy  life,  find  your  motivation  for  getting  fit  and  eating  better.

On  her  own,  she  lost  100  pounds,  and  now  she's  joining  us  to  lose  the  rest.She  hopes  to  show  the  Samoan  community  that  there's  nothing  positive  about  being  overweight.Learn  more  about  Sia's  story  on  iReportKaren  MannsKaren  is  a  detective  with  the  Baltimore  City  Police  Department.  Genetics  and  years  of  wear  and  tear  forced  Karen  to  undergo  two  hip  replacements  before  age  44.  Her  doctor  told  her  she'd  never  run  again.She  decided  she  was  too  young  to  be  sedentary,  so  she,  along  with  a  personal  trainer  and  her  police  partner  (an  accomplished  marathoner)  started  training.Today,  Karen  has  worked  her  way  up  to  a  10K!  Her  doctor  is  amazed,  and  now  Karen  is  ready  to  take  on  a  triathlon  --  showing  everyone  who  has  ever  had  joint  surgery  that  their  mobility  doesn't  have  to  be  limited.Learn  more  about  Karen's  story  on  iReportJamil  NathooIn  2013,  34-year-old  Jamil  was  training  for  the  South  Beach  Triathlon.

Chemo  and  surgery  took  a  major  toll  on  his  body,  drastically  reducing  his  fitness  level,  and  causing  him  to  lose  more  than  20  pounds.Now,  the  cancer  is  gone,  and  Jamil  is  ready  to  regain  his  fitness  level,  and  officially  kick  cancer's  butt.UPDATE:  Jamil  had  to  have  an  additional  surgery  two  weeks  ago,  but  his  doctors  say  as  soon  as  he  heals  from  the  operation,  he'll  be  on  his  way  to  becoming  a  triathlete.Learn  more  about  Jamil's  story  on  iReportConnie  SieversConnie  was  always  skinny,  even  through  her  three  pregnancies.

He  laughs  --  a  little  nervously:  "Yes,  you  do  get  a  sense  of  them."Looming  before  us  is  Roskilde  6,  the  largest  Viking  ship  ever  discovered,  carefully  reconstructed  after  1,000  years  languishing  beneath  the  waves.  At  37  meters  long  it's  double  the  size  of  the  boat  Christopher  Columbus  sailed  to  America.Ghost  armies  or  not,  it  is  a  sight  to  behold.  The  ship's  fearsome  metal  frame  seemingly  rises  from  a  watery  netherworld  on  a  mission  to  conquer  the  globe  --  once  and  for  all.Built  around  1025,  it  is  the  crown  jewel  in  the  museum's  major  new  exhibition  exploring  the  Viking  age,  and  it  sails  on  an  invisible  wave  past  glass  cases  of  ancient  jewels,  swords  and  skeletons."It's  huge.  And  you  can't  stress  that  enough.  Even  by  the  standards  of  written  descriptions  of  big  Viking  ships,  this  is  massive,"  says  curator  Thomas  Williams  --  who,  with  his  thick  beard  and  carefully  twirled  mustache,  resembles  something  of  the  modern-day  Norseman."We  read  about  ships  of  35  oarsmen  per  side  being  extremely  big,  shockingly  big.  And  this  probably  had  about  40  oarsmen  per  side."If  you  saw  this  vessel  on  the  horizon  --  with  its  elaborate  carvings,  animal  head  prow,  and  single  sail  billowing  in  the  wind  --  it  would  have  signaled  serious  trouble  was  on  the  way."To  see  this  coming  up  the  River  Thames  would  have  meant  domination  by  a  political  elite,"  says  Williams.  "It  would  have  struck  terror  into  people."I  suppose  in  many  ways  it's  psychological  warfare  as  much  as  anything  else.  You're  demonstrating  your  power  through  the  sheer  scale  and  awesomeness  of  this  ship.  And  of  course  we've  got  this  one,  but  we  don't  know  how  many  there  might  have  been.  Dozens,  hundreds  of  ships  ...  it's  frightening  stuff."Danish  discoveryIt's  perhaps  fitting  that  the  boat  was  discovered  in  Denmark's  Roskilde  Fjord  by  workers  renovating  the  city's  Viking  Museum  in  1997.Almost  a  quarter  of  the  original  timber  remained,  and  it  now  lines  the  heart  of  the  recreated  metal  structure  on  display  in  London.Only  a  person  of  enormous  wealth  and  power  could  have  built  a  boat  like  this,  with  historians  pointing  to  North  Sea  ruler  at  the  time,  Cnut  the  Great,  a  man  described  as:  "Exceptionally  tall  and  strong,  and  the  handsomest  of  men,  except  for  his  nose."Long  and  sleek  (the  boat,  not  Cnut's  nose),  it  was  designed  for  speed,  featuring  low  sides  so  men  could  leap  quickly  onto  land."This  is  really  a  troop  carrier,"  says  Williams.  "An  amphibious  landing  craft  to  get  lots  of  men  across  the  sea  as  fast  as  possible."Barbarians  vs.  BraveheartsBut  who  were  the  Vikings,  really?"The  way  the  Vikings  are  traditionally  presented,  in  Britain  at  least,  is  as  marauders,  as  these  terrible  people  who  come  from  overseas,  kill  all  the  monks,  steal  your  stuff,  steal  your  wife,  and  off  they  go  again,"  Williams  says."But  from  a  Scandinavian  perspective  it's  a  much  more  varied  picture.  Those  people  who  disappear  over  the  horizon  to  raid  a  monastery  don't  reflect  the  whole  of  Scandinavian  society  in  that  moment  --  that's  just  what  we  see  from  the  accounts  of  monks  writing  during  the  Viking  age."That  said,  being  seen  as  a  warrior  was  a  key  part  of  being  a  Viking  man.Much  like  a  Hell's  Angel  biker  might  adorn  himself  in  tattoos  to  intimidate  others,  a  Viking  might  file  down  his  teeth  into  a  horrific  snarl  --  as  one  skull  on  display  demonstrated."I  think  filing  down  your  teeth  like  that  is  a  way  of  saying,  'I'm  prepared  to  do  this  to  myself,  just  imagine  what  I'm  prepared  to  do  to  you,'  "  Williams  says."But  it's  also  saying,  'I  am  marking  myself  out  as  somebody  who  is  beyond  the  social  norm.'  And  people  who  identified  as  being  full-time  Vikings  were  not  the  norm."Maritime  mightBut  of  course  the  Vikings  were  not  simply  beefed-up  bruisers.  They  were  superior  seafarers;  the  first  people  to  reach  four  continents,  arriving  in  America  long  before  Christopher  Columbus.Their  naval  technology  opened  up  new  trade  routes  and  helped  establish  cities."You  can't  get  away  from  the  fact  that  there's  a  great  deal  of  violence  in  the  Viking  age,"  Williams  says.  "But  at  the  same  time  there's  a  great  deal  of  bravery  and  self-confidence  in  the  desire  to  explore,  to  open  up  new  horizons."All  of  these  things  are  quite  inspiring.  They  still  capture  our  imaginations  today."Read:  Henry  VIII's  Mary  Rose  warship  on  showSee:  Mississippi  River  Pirate  ship  sold  onlineInspire:  Sea  astronaut  light  years  ahead</TEXT></DOC>

Behind  the  scenes,  "SNL"  has  also  added  two  new  African-American  women  writers,  LaKendra  Tookes  and  Leslie  Jones.On  Saturday,  viewers  were  trying  to  figure  out  how  "SNL"  would  address  its  highly  publicized  hire  --  would  the  show  again  poke  fun  at  itself  by  making  her  take  on  everyone  from  the  first  lady  to  Beyoncé  to  Oprah  in  one  sketch,  as  Kerry  Washington  did  when  she  hosted  last  fall,  or  would  it  slowly  introduce  her  with  just  one  or  two  scenes?In  the  end,  "SNL"  went  with  a  third  option:  It  used  Zamata  liberally  throughout  the  show  as  a  supporting  player,  but  her  debut  was  virtually  overshadowed  by  the  night's  host,  Drake.In  addition  to  performing,  the  27-year-old  artist  participated  in  nearly  every  sketch  and  nailed  them,  from  his  opening  monologue  that  recalled  his  bar  mitzvah  ......  to  his  impersonation  of  comedian  Katt  Williams,  and  his  spoof  of  colleagues  Jay  Z  and  Lil  Wayne  in  "Before  They  Were  Stars."In  fact,  the  one  person  who  won  the  episode  more  than  Drake  was  Kate  McKinnon  and  her  impersonation  of  Justin  Bieber  in  the  cold  open:We  weren't  the  only  ones  who  thought  so."(G)ive  credit  to  host  and  musical  guest  Drake  for  shifting  through  characters  as  if  he'd  always  belonged  on  the  late-night  sketch  show,"  the  Los  Angeles  Times  said  in  a  review.  "Drake  showed  he  had  a  deft  comedic  hand  on  Saturday."The  Huffington  Post's  Mike  Ryan  was  also  pleasantly  surprised,  saying  in  a  review  that  Drake  reminded  him  of  Bruno  Mars  from  last  season:  "An  energetic  host  that's  been  given  so-so  material  that  he's  able  to  elevate  --  to  a  point."And  the  fact  that  "SNL"  fully  integrated  Zamata  into  the  episode  (versus  trying  to  break  her  out  as  a  more  prominent  star)  also  meant  there  was  more  time  for  Drake,  Entertainment  Weekly  noted,  "and  Drake  was  really,  really  great,"  particularly  in  the  "Before  They  Were  Stars"  sketch.</TEXT></DOC>

Citing  televised  comments  made  by  Defense  Minister  Ihor  Tenyukh  on  Sunday,  it  said  the  army  was  not  calling  for  full  mobilization,  as  diplomacy  was  still  the  preferred  method  to  resolve  the  crisis.The  Prime  Minister  of  the  autonomous  region,  Sergey  Aksenev,  was  recently  appointed  commander-in-chief  by  the  region's  parliament,  giving  him  the  power  to  form  an  army,  government  spokeswoman  Ekaterina  Polonchuk  told  CNN.Aksenev  told  the  Interfax  news  agency  that  the  decision  to  form  a  military  stems  from  "the  presence  of  illegal  armed  groups  in  the  territory  of  Crimea,"  comments  confirmed  to  CNN  by  Polonchuk.  So  far,  it  appears  a  small  number  of  men  have  joined  the  new  army.Opinion:  Five  myths  about  the  crisisMasked  troops  at  Ukrainian  baseMonday's  appearance  of  masked  troops  at  the  Bakhchisaray  base  came  a  day  after  a  pro-Russian  group  appeared  to  have  kidnapped  base  commander  Vladimir  Sadovnik  at  a  checkpoint,  according  to  the  Ukrainian  military.When  a  CNN  crew  visited  the  base  Monday  morning,  the  Ukrainian  military  was  in  charge,  but  Sadovnik  still  was  missing.  The  deputy  commander  said  that  if  "they  to  try  blackmail  us  into  giving  up  the  base,  it  won't  happen."Three  hours  later,  the  crew  returned  to  the  base,  and  the  Ukrainian  flag  was  no  longer  flying  there.  Masked  gunmen  were  on  the  property,  looking  at  the  crew  from  the  other  side  of  a  fence.The  deputy  commander  told  CNN  said  15  gunmen  came  to  the  base  with  Sadovnik,  and  that  the  gunmen  were  planning  to  take  vehicles  from  the  base.  CNN  was  not  allowed  inside.What  Sadovnik  did  upon  his  return  is  disputed.  Ukrainian  Defense  Ministry  spokesman  Vladislav  Seleznyov  said  Sadovnik  had  switched  allegiance  and  persuaded  some  of  the  Ukrainian  troops  there  to  join  him.Sadovnik  and  the  men  who  joined  him  loaded  trucks  with  fuel,  radios  and  other  goods  to  take  away  from  the  base,  according  to  Seleznyov.But  Sadovnik,  talking  later  to  CNN  by  phone,  denied  Seleznyov's  account.  He  said  his  kidnappers  allowed  him  to  return  to  the  base,  and  that  he  still  was  loyal  to  Ukraine.He  said  pro-Russian  forces  did  ask  Ukrainian  troops  at  the  base  to  change  sides  Monday,  but  that  he  did  no  such  thing.  He  said  he  still  was  at  the  base;  CNN  couldn't  immediately  verify  his  location.The  control  of  base  wasn't  immediately  clear  Monday.  Seleznyov  said  both  Ukrainian  and  Russian  flags  were  flying  at  the  base  late  Monday  afternoon.Putin  earlier  this  month  secured  permission  from  his  parliament  to  use  military  force  to  protect  Russian  citizens  in  Ukraine.  The  move  came  days  after  Yanukovych's  flight  from  the  country.  Yanukovych  was  ousted  after  three  months  of  protests  against  his  decision  to  spurn  a  free  trade  deal  with  the  European  Union  and  turn  toward  closer  ties  with  Moscow.Are  the  Russians  listening?At  the  United  Nations,  French  Ambassador  Gerard  Araud  told  reporters  the  situation  in  Crimea  "is  worsening  by  the  day."  Russian  troops  are  being  reinforced  and  Moscow  appears  ready  to  annex  the  region,  he  said  after  a  Security  Council  session  Monday  afternoon."(The  session)  was  a  call  to  the  Russians:  We  want  to  negotiate.  We  want  a  political  settlement.  Please  don't  worsen  this  crisis,"  Araud  said.  But  he  added,  "The  Russians  are  not  showing  any  signal  that  they  are  listening  to  us  --  not  only  to  the  Security  Council,  but  to  all  the  heads  of  state  and  government."And  British  Ambassador  Mark  Lyall  Grant  said  no  "free  and  fair"  vote  could  be  held  "while  Crimea  is  under  the  illegal  control  of  Russian  troops  and  armed  militias  who  are  denying  access  to  international  monitors.""In  the  light  of  these  concerns,  if  the  referendum  goes  ahead  on  the  16th  of  March,  its  results  must  be  considered  illegal  and  illegitimate  by  all  nations,"  Grant  said.Opinion:  Clock  is  ticking  on  Crimea  crisisPropaganda  warEarlier,  Ukraine's  Defense  Ministry  said  a  group  of  about  20  pro-Russian  activists  from  the  so-called  Crimea  self-defense  squads  had  broken  into  the  military  hospital  in  the  region's  main  administrative  city,  Simferopol,  and  thrown  out  its  chief.In  a  later  statement,  it  said  the  hospital  chief  was  back  at  work  after  negotiations  but  added  the  premises  were  being  blockaded  by  the  activists.However  a  CNN  team  that  traveled  to  the  hospital  found  it  very  quiet,  with  no  one  around.  A  guard  on  duty  said  he  had  not  heard  or  seen  anything  unusual  and  that  there  was  no  senior  official  to  speak  with  as  Monday  was  a  public  holiday.In  the  course  of  the  rapidly  changing  events  of  the  past  week,  a  propaganda  war  over  Ukraine  has  quickly  developed  as  each  side  seeks  to  strengthen  its  stance.Scenes  of  balaclava-wearing  men  without  insignia  patrolling  streets  or  other  premises  have  now  become  a  familiar  sight  in  the  region.Reports  of  confrontations  weren't  limited  to  Crimea.  In  the  eastern  mainland  Ukrainian  city  of  Lugansk,  just  a  few  kilometers  west  of  the  Russian  border,  50  to  60  pro-Russian  activists  burst  into  an  IRTA  TV  station  building  on  Monday,  editor-in-chief  Katerina  Rakova  said.The  intruders  initially  threatened  to  burn  the  building  if  they  weren't  allowed  to  broadcast.  But  they  eventually  left,  warning  that  they  would  return  if  they  are  dissatisfied  with  the  station's  news  broadcasts  about  pro-Russian  demonstrations  in  Lugansk,  Rakova  said.Russia,  meanwhile,  accused  far-right  groups  Monday  of  "conniving"  with  the  new  authorities  in  Ukraine.In  a  statement,  the  Russian  Foreign  Ministry  condemned  "lawlessness"  in  eastern  Ukraine  and  accused  the  West  of  being  silent  over  violence  and  detentions  taking  place  against  Russian  citizens,  such  as  one  incident  last  week  when  it  said  masked  gunmen  fired  on  and  injured  peaceful  protesters.On  Monday  afternoon,  U.N.  Secretary-General  Ban  Ki-moon  said  he  was  "increasingly  alarmed"  by  developments  in  Ukraine."Recent  events  in  Crimea  in  particular  have  only  served  to  deepen  the  crisis.  As  tensions  and  mistrust  are  growing,  I  urge  all  sides  to  refrain  from  hasty  actions  and  provocative  rhetoric,"  he  said.CNN's  Kellie  Morgan,  Stephanie  Halasz,  Clare  Sebastian,  Diana  Magnay,  Alla  Eshchenko,  Claudia  Rebaza,  Arkady  Irshenko,  Azadeh  Ansari,  Catherine  E.

Now  she's  a  size  2.  Learn  how  she  and  her  family  finally  got  fit.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Do  you  have  a  weight-loss  success  story  to  share?  Tell  us  how  you  did  it,  and  you  could  be  featured  in  our  weekly  weight-loss  story  on  CNN.com.(CNN)  --  Gabi  Rose  wore  maternity  clothes  for  more  than  12  years.Her  weight,  which  bounced  up  and  down  around  her  four  pregnancies,  wasn't  just  an  aesthetic  concern.  She  had  frequent  asthma  attacks,  broke  an  ankle  several  times,  developed  rosacea  and  noticed  that  her  hair  had  stopped  growing."I  didn't  realize  it  was  affecting  my  entire  family,"  Rose  said.Once  Rose  got  serious  about  losing  weight  for  good,  she,  her  husband,  David,  and  daughter  Rachel  lost  a  combined  300  pounds  together.  A  big  factor  in  the  trio's  transformation  was  changing  how  they  ate:  choosing  healthier  foods  and  cooking  at  home."The  weight  loss  in  my  opinion  is  the  easy  part,"  Rose  said.  "It's  the  maintenance  that's  hard,  and  that's  difficult  and  takes  time  and  education  and  understanding."A  family  health  crisisRose  had  many  complications  with  her  pregnancies.  She  was  hospitalized  for  four  weeks  because  of  preeclampsia  with  her  first  son,  Josh.  Her  third  child,  Noah,  almost  died  as  an  infant.  Rose  suffered  badly  with  asthma  and  weighed  close  to  300  pounds  when  she  was  pregnant  with  her  youngest  child,  Sarah.Her  older  daughter  Rachel,  now  14,  suffered  weight  problems,  too.  Rachel  remembers  going  to  Target  with  her  mother  and  wanting  to  try  on  clothes  in  the  kids'  section.  But  because  of  her  large  size  as  a  third-grader,  she  had  to  shop  in  the  adult  section.It  was  hard  for  Rachel,  knowing  children  were  in  the  other  part  of  the  store;  she  was  surrounded  by  "all  these  old  women.""Rachel  looks  at  old  pictures  of  herself  and  she  says,  'Why  did  you  let  me  get  so  big?'  "  Rose  said.  "It  probably  is  my  fault.  I  was  kind  of  lost  myself."Rose  tried  commercial  weight-loss  programs,  but  nothing  worked.She  became  serious  about  getting  healthy  after  an  asthma  attack  in  2005,  a  year  after  Sarah's  birth.  Rose  was  driving  her  children  home  from  a  friend's  house  when  she  felt  a  heaviness  in  her  chest.  She  reached  for  her  inhaler,  but  it  wasn't  in  her  purse.  She  panicked  and  pulled  over."The  only  thing  I  could  think  of  is:  'I'm  going  to  die  here  on  the  street,'  "  she  said.  "I  called  my  husband  and  I  told  him  where  I  was,  because  I  didn't  think  I'd  be  alive  when  he  got  there."Her  brush  with  death  made  her  decide  once  and  for  all:  The  weight  had  to  go.Changing  bad  habitsIn  those  days,  Rose  didn't  cook  much  at  all.  Frozen  pizza,  chicken  nuggets  in  a  bag,  mac  and  cheese  in  a  box,  a  pre-made  "family-size  portion"  of  chicken  lasagna  for  herself  and  her  husband  --  these  were  typical  meals.When  the  children  were  little,  Rose  kept  a  hefty  supply  of  bags  of  chips,  she  said."All  the  neighborhood  kids  used  to  come  over  all  the  time  because  I  had  so  much  junk  food,"  she  said.But  in  2006,  Rose  dedicated  herself  to  understanding  healthy  food  choices.  Now  Rose  avoids  anything  that  comes  in  a  bag  or  box.The  family  cooks  together,  making  main  courses  such  as  chicken  wings  from  scratch  and  sides  such  as  mashed  potatoes  mixed  with  cauliflower.  Every  meal  has  a  salad.Rose's  husband  has  become  "a  wizard  with  stir  fry,"  she  said.And  Rachel,  who  used  to  buy  two  ice  cream  snacks  at  school  at  lunch,  now  brings  her  lunch  from  home  and  makes  strawberry-banana  protein  smoothies.Getting  up  and  movingThe  family  has  also  been  spending  less  time  sitting  on  the  couch.Rachel  and  Noah  have  been  playing  tennis  for  years.  They've  motivated  the  rest  of  the  family  to  play  tennis,  too,  Rose  said.The  family  also  rides  bikes  around  the  neighborhood  and  has  gone  on  outdoor  adventures  such  as  white-water  rafting  and  an  obstacle  course.  They  have  joined  a  family  gym,  so  that  everyone  is  working  out  at  the  same  time,  and  have  run  5K  races  together  over  the  past  two  years.David  Rose  credits  his  wife  as  leading  by  example  in  the  diet  and  fitness  changes  that  have  transformed  the  household.  He  lost  80  pounds,  which  he  has  kept  off  for  four  years,  and  now  weighs  about  188  pounds."I  remember  the  first  day  that  she  took  me  over  to  the  gym  and  put  me  on  an  elliptical  machine,"  he  said.  "That  was  the  beginning  of  a  process."Ups  and  downsIt  hasn't  always  been  easy.On  Valentine's  Day  2008,  David  went  to  buy  his  wife  a  fondue  maker  and  gourmet  chocolate  from  a  local  chocolatier.  She  had  loved  the  Melting  Pot  fondue  restaurant;  he  thought  with  this  present,  "I  was  hitting  a  grand  slam  home  run."He  was  wrong."I  just  looked  at  him  and  said,  'You've  got  to  be  kidding  me,'  "  Gabi  Rose  said.  "I  was  just  beside  myself.  He's  just  not  understanding  the  efforts  that  I'm  putting  into  my  weight  loss."Her  fury  didn't  abate  when  her  husband  tossed  the  chocolate  in  the  garbage.  She  didn't  speak  to  him  for  a  month.  ("I  knew  she  was  going  to  bring  up  [the  fondue],"  he  said  later).In  retrospect,  Rose  sees  that  until  that  point  her  weight-loss  efforts  had  been  inconsistent.  But  her  husband  apologized,  telling  his  wife  that  he  hadn't  understood  where  she  was  coming  from  --  that  she  was  serious  about  getting  healthy,  long  term,  and  about  making  everyone  in  the  family  feel  better  about  themselves."He  was  afraid  that  I  was  going  to  become  a  different  person  I  guess,  or  not  as  fun  as  I  used  to  be,"  she  said.  "But  we  found  fun  in  other  ways,  without  eating."Inspiring  othersToday,  Rose  weighs  145  pounds,  and  has  become  an  expert  on  losing  weight.  She  has  traveled  extensively,  speaking  about  how  to  make  healthy  changes,  and  was  the  host  and  co-producer  of  a  reality  show  in  South  Florida  called  "The  Get  Fit  Club."In  2009,  she  teamed  up  with  Dr.  Elisabeth  Cohn-Gelwasser  --  whose  medical  practice  Rose  has  been  coordinating  since  1994  --  to  offer  a  medical  weight-loss  program  that  targets  nutrition  and  fitness  and  also  incorporates  counseling  in  behavior  modification,  and  medication  when  necessary.From  a  size  26,  Rose  has  slimmed  down  to  a  size  2.Rachel  has  also  made  significant  progress;  she  lost  50  pounds  between  2009  and  2011,  and  her  father  said  she  has  been  "an  inspiration  to  other  children."  Now  in  high  school,  Rachel  knows  a  lot  of  girls  who  complain  about  their  appearances."I  honestly  can't  relate  to  them,  because  I  love  the  way  that  I  am  right  now,"  she  said.As  for  the  embattled  fondue  maker,  it's  still  in  the  family's  kitchen,  David  said.  It's  a  reminder  of  an  era  of  overeating  that's  melted  away.Learn  more  about  Gabi  Rose  at  gabirose.com.</TEXT></DOC>

And  again,  a  female  police  officer  was  involved  in  bringing  the  violent  rampage  to  an  end.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  A  soldier  has  committed  a  deadly  mass  shooting  at  Texas'  Fort  Hood  again.  And  again,  a  female  police  officer  was  involved  in  bringing  the  violent  rampage  to  an  end.The  military  policewoman  has  not  been  identified,  but  by  all  accounts,  she  risked  her  life  to  ensure  the  bedlam  wrought  by  Spc.  Ivan  Lopez  came  to  a  close  in  the  second  building  he  entered.By  then,  Lopez,  whom  the  Army  chief  of  staff  has  described  as  a  "very  experienced  soldier,"  had  taken  three  lives  and  wounded  16  people  --  all  of  them  Army  personnel.  Without  the  officer's  courageous  actions,  Wednesday's  casualty  count  might  have  been  higher."It  was  clearly  heroic  what  she  did  in  that  moment  in  time,"  said  Lt.  Gen.  Mark  Milley,  the  post's  commander.  "She  did  her  job,  and  she  did  exactly  what  we'd  expect  of  a  United  States  Army  military  police."According  to  Milley,  the  melee  began  about  4  p.m.  Lopez  first  walked  into  a  unit  building  and  opened  fire.  The  34-year-old  Iraq  veteran  then  left,  got  into  a  vehicle  and  continued  firing  the  .45-caliber  Smith  &  Wesson  semiautomatic  that  he  had  purchased  off-base,  Milley  said.Lopez  exited  the  vehicle  and  walked  into  a  second  building,  opening  fire  again,  Milley  said.  It  was  there  he  "was  engaged  by  local  law  enforcement  here  at  Fort  Hood."The  MP  arrived  in  the  parking  lot  about  four  minutes  after  the  first  911  call."He  was  approaching  her  at  about  20  feet.  He  put  his  hands  up,  then  reached  under  his  jacket,  pulled  out  the  (semiautomatic)  and  she  pulled  out  her  weapon,"  the  lieutenant  general  said."She  engaged,  and  then  he  put  the  weapon  to  his  head  and  he  died  of  a  self-inflicted  gunshot  wound,"  Milley  said.The  shooting  spree  was  over  in  about  15  or  20  minutes.  The  investigation  into  what  spurred  Lopez's  violent  revolt  promises  to  take  much  longer.U.S.  Rep.  John  Carter  joined  Milley  in  praising  the  military  policewoman  in  a  CNN  interview  Thursday,  saying  she  "responded  exactly  as  the  military  would  expect."  He  further  said  that  her  quick  reaction  was  a  result  of  training  that  military  police  took  after  the  2009  Fort  Hood  shooting,  in  which  Maj.  Nidal  Hasan  killed  13  people  and  wounded  31  others  on  the  base."That's  the  active  shooter  program  they've  all  been  through,"  Carter  said.  "We  can  see  that  this  is  the  training  that  was  the  result  of  the  Hasan  shooting.  I  lived  through  the  Hasan  shooting,  and  it  was  kind  of  eerie  last  night."In  2009,  Sgt.  Kimberly  Munley,  a  civilian  police  officer,  was  washing  her  car  and  topping  off  the  gas  tank  when  she  got  the  report  that  shots  had  been  fired  at  Fort  Hood.  She  and  Senior  Sgt.  Mark  Todd  responded  to  the  scene  and  were  directed  to  the  Soldier  Readiness  Processing  Center.The  5-foot-2,  125-pound  mother  of  two  and  her  partner  exchanged  gunfire  with  Hasan,  who  shot  Munley  three  times,  sending  a  bullet  into  each  of  her  thighs  and  another  into  her  knuckles.Munley  and  Todd  were  credited  with  ending  Hasan's  rampage  and  hailed  as  heroes.  Munley  can  no  longer  work  in  law  enforcement  because  of  her  injuries  and  has  spoken  out  on  behalf  of  the  victims,  whom  she  claims  the  government  has  "betrayed"  by  denying  them  certain  treatment  and  benefits  in  the  aftermath  of  the  shooting.Though  not  much  is  yet  known  about  the  policewoman  involved  in  ending  Wednesday's  shooting  spree,  Fort  Hood  is  home  to  the  89th  Military  Police  Brigade,  a  "combat-ready,  deployable  force"  that  can  support  worldwide  operations,  according  to  the  brigade's  web  page.Phillip  Carter,  a  former  MP  captain  on  the  post,  said  he  believes  she  was  a  junior  enlisted  soldier  who  was  patrolling  by  herself.  He  credited  her  for  facing  the  threat."Most  police  officers  probably  would  have  stepped  back  and  waited  for  backup,  but  she  stepped  forward,"  he  said.Carter  told  CNN  her  training  would  have  been  18  weeks  and  included  a  "Shoot/No  Shoot,"  class  on  a  shooting  course."You  have  to  make  a  decision  on  the  range  as  to  whether  to  engage  or  not,"  he  said.  "They're  designed  to  create  that  split-second  impulse  because  that's  all  you  would  have  in  this  kind  of  a  situation."CNN's  Brian  Todd  and  Jason  Hanna  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

According  to  Yale  University  researchers,  they  can  actually  tell  good  from  evil,  even  at  just  a  few  months  old.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Kelly  Wallace  is  CNN's  digital  correspondent  and  editor-at-large  covering  family,  career  and  life.  She  is  a  mom  of  two.  Read  her  other  columns  and  follow  her  reports  at  CNN  Parents  and  on  Twitter.  Tune  in  to  "Anderson  Cooper  360"  at  8  p.m.  ET  tonight  to  watch  Anderson's  special  report:  Baby  brains:  What  are  they  really  thinking?(CNN)  --  I'm  thinking  back  to  when  my  girls,  now  6  and  7,  were  just  a  few  months  old.  "Delicious"  is  the  word  that  most  immediately  comes  to  mind.  As  I  spent  countless  hours  --  like  any  new  mom  --  looking  adoringly  at  each  of  my  daughters'  chunky  cheeks  and  dreamy  eyes,  I  often  wondered,  "What  is  going  through  your  mind?"Turns  out,  maybe  a  whole  lot  more  than  I  realized.According  to  researchers  at  Yale  University's  Infant  Cognition  Center,  also  known  as  "The  Baby  Lab,"  babies  can  actually  tell  good  from  evil,  even  as  young  as  3  months  old.  That  research  is  the  focus  of  a  three-part  series  this  week  on  "Anderson  Cooper  360,"  which  airs  weeknights  at  8  p.m.  ET.To  the  skeptics  who  say,  "Come  on,  how  can  an  infant  tell  the  difference  between  a  good  guy  and  a  bad  guy?"  --  I  can  relate.  It  certainly  runs  counter  to  our  notion  that  children  are  born  as  blank  slates  and  learn  right  from  wrong  entirely  from  us.But  the  research  paints  a  different  picture.  Puppets  are  used  to  demonstrate  good  and  bad  behavior.  In  one  case,  a  puppet  is  struggling  to  open  a  box.  Another  puppet,  the  "good"  puppet,  helps  it  open  the  box,  while  another,  the  "bad"  puppet,  slams  the  box  shut.More  than  80%  of  the  times  that  experiment  is  conducted,  babies  will  select  the  "good"  puppet  when  presented  with  both  puppets  and  given  the  chance  to  choose  either  one.READ:  What's  your  baby  really  thinking?"Humans  are  born  with  a  hard-wired  morality,  a  sense  of  good  and  evil  is  bred  in  the  bone,"  wrote  Paul  Bloom,  Yale's  Brooks  and  Suzanne  Ragen  professor  of  psychology,  in  an  opinion  piece  for  CNN.com.Bloom,  author  of  the  new  book  "Just  Babies:  The  Origins  of  Good  and  Evil,"  collaborated  on  the  research  with  his  wife,  Karen  Wynn,  a  professor  of  psychology  at  Yale  University."We  are  naturally  moral  beings,  but  our  environment  can  enhance  --  or  sadly,  degrade  --  this  innate  moral  sense,"  Bloom  said.So  now  I'm  wondering  if,  during  those  months  when  I  thought  my  babies  had  zero  clue  about  the  world  around  them,  I  did  anything  I  should  not  have  done.Lyz  Lenz,  a  contributor  to  the  parenting  site  Babble  and  mom  of  a  nearly  3-year-old  daughter  and  7-month-old  son,  wonders  the  same  thing."When  I  was  pregnant  with  my  daughter,  I  read  a  history  of  our  cultural  perceptions  of  the  devil  and  watched  a  lot  of  'Dexter,'"  said  Lenz  of  Cedar  Rapids,  Iowa,  referring  to  the  Showtime  show  about  a  serial  killer.PHOTOS:  CNN:  When  they  were  babies"Then,  during  my  maternity  leave,  I  watched  all  of  'Damages,'  a  show  where  Glenn  Close  plays  an  evil  lawyer.  So,  what  I'm  saying  is,  if  my  daughter  makes  it  to  her  5th  birthday  without  murdering  someone,  it  won't  be  for  lack  of  trying,"  joked  Lenz,  who  also  blogs  for  the  site  Baby  Zone.Many  women  I  chatted  with  over  e-mail  or  on  Facebook  weren't  really  surprised  to  learn  there's  much  more  going  on  in  the  brains  of  our  littlest  ones.Jessica  McFadden,  founder  of  the  blog  A  Parent  in  America  and  mother  of  three,  remembers  when  her  daughter  Alice  was  4  months  old."She  would  babble  animatedly  and  --  I  swear  --  as  if  she  were  'ticked  off'  at  the  large  family  photo  hanging  in  our  home,"  said  McFadden  of  Silver  Spring,  Maryland.  The  photo  was  taken  before  her  daughter  was  born  and  included  everyone  in  the  family  --  except  her."She  truly  seemed  put  out  that  she  was  not  in  the  picture,  and  this  was  before  she  was  even  eating  solids!  When  the  photo  was  replaced  with  a  new  one  including  her,  she  squealed,  smiled,  waved  her  hands  and  would  happily  look  at  it  each  time  she  passed  it,"  she  said.OPINION:  Do  babies  know  right  from  wrong?Beth  Engelman,  a  single  mom  of  an  8-year-old  in  Chicago,  recounts  what  happened  when  her  soon  to  be  "ex-mother-in-law"  came  to  visit  when  her  son  was  just  a  few  weeks  old."As  soon  as  she  picked  him  up,  he  cried  and  cried  and  cried.  When  she  handed  him  over  to  me,  he  was  fine,  giddy,  happy,"  said  Engelman,  co-founder  of  the  blog  Mommy  on  a  Shoestring.  "My  siblings  would  say  Jackson  was  an  excellent  judge  of  character,  even  at  two  weeks!"The  research  does  show,  according  to  Bloom,  that  children  just  a  few  months  old  can  judge  a  person's  character  --  siding  with  the  "good"  puppet  and  not  with  the  "bad"  puppet.But  Bloom  said  the  research  also  shows  something  else,  which  gives  this  parent  pause.  Babies,  Bloom  said,  are  born  with  an  inherent  bias,  and  start  off  as  "little  bigots,  eagerly  dividing  the  world  into  'us  versus  them'  and  strongly  favoring  their  own  group  over  everyone  else.""They  prefer  puppets  who  have  the  same  tastes  as  them  and  they  actually  want  the  puppets  with  the  different  tastes  --  they  like  other  puppets  who  punish  them,"  Bloom  said  during  a  Google+  hangout.  "So  early  on,  one  of  the  most  tragic  aspects  of  humanity  is  how  we  split  the  world  into  'us  versus  them'  and  we  find  this  from  the  earliest  age  we  can  test."Knowing  this  not  only  gives  us  more  respect  for  what's  going  on  in  our  children's  minds,  but  also  helps  us  as  parents  deal  with  certain  moral  issues,  such  as  racism,  Bloom  said.WATCH:  Baby  brains:  What  are  they  really  thinking?While  it  is  important  to  teach  children  that  humans  naturally  separate  ourselves  into  groups  such  as  families  and  friends  --  and  place  more  value  on  these  people  in  our  lives  --  it  is  also  important  to  clarify  that  it's  not  acceptable  to  value  people  according  to  group  traits  like  skin  color,  said  Bloom,  who  is  the  father  of  two  teens."So  if  you  realize  kids  come  in  a  world  with  their  own  beliefs  and  judgments  and  propensities  and  expectations,  it  gives  you  more  respect  for  them,  and  it  also  helps  you  parent  them,  helps  you  know  how  to  make  them  into  more  moral  people."On  that  point,  I  loved  what  Lenz,  the  Babble  contributor,  said:  "Children  know  the  world  is  deep  and  dark  and  bright  and  beautiful.  We  don't  have  to  teach  them  that.  Instead,  we  have  to  equip  them  to  slay  the  monsters  and  hold  fast  to  what  is  true  and  good."What  do  you  think  babies  really  know?

The  search  for  missing  Malaysia  Airlines  Flight  370  has  moved  again.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Forget  all  those  satellite  photos  showing  promising  patches  of  debris.  The  search  for  missing  Malaysia  Airlines  Flight  370  has  moved  again.In  a  stunning  turn,  Australian  authorities  announced  Friday  they  were  abandoning  the  remote  region  of  Indian  Ocean  where  search  crews  had  spent  more  than  a  week  looking  for  the  plane.  A  new  analysis  of  satellite  data  showed  the  plane  could  not  have  flown  that  far  south,  they  said."We  have  moved  on  from  those  search  areas,"  said  John  Young,  general  manager  of  emergency  response  for  the  Australian  maritime  authority.The  new  zone  is  680  miles  (about  1,100  kilometers)  to  the  northeast,  closer  to  the  Australian  coast.In  what  could  be  a  sign  the  search  is  on  the  right  track,  or  possibly  yet  another  letdown,  the  agency  said  five  of  the  10  planes  dispatched  to  the  new  search  zone  had  spotted  objects  in  the  waters  below.  Crews  took  photographs  of  the  objects,  and  those  images  will  be  analyzed  overnight,  the  authority  said."The  objects  cannot  be  verified  or  discounted  as  being  from  MH370  until  they  are  relocated  and  recovered  by  ships,"  the  authority  said  in  a  statement.CNN's  Kyung  Lah,  who  went  out  on  a  U.S.  Navy  P-8  search  plane  Friday,  said  the  crew  of  that  plane  spotted  white  objects,  orange  rope  and  a  blue  bag."At  one  point,  sure,  everybody  on  board  got  a  little  excited,  but  it's  impossible  to  tell  from  that  distance  what  anything  is,"  she  said.Exactly  what  the  planes  had  found  was  unclear,  but  if  the  finds  turn  out  to  be  something  other  than  plane  debris,  it  would  not  be  the  first  time.A  Chinese  aircraft  reported  spotting  possible  aircraft  debris  early  in  the  search,  but  that  sighting  turned  out  to  be  nothing.Malaysia  plane  saga:  Your  questions  answered'We  have  not  seen  any  debris'Friday's  developments  cap  three  weeks  of  frequent  false  leads  in  the  search  for  the  plane,  which  disappeared  on  March  8  with  239  people  aboard.Malaysian  authorities  announced  Monday  that  an  analysis  of  satellite  signals  sent  by  the  plane  indicated  that  it  must  have  gone  down  in  the  southern  Indian  Ocean.  Analysts  who  relied  on  sophisticated  mathematics  to  come  to  their  conclusion  couldn't  offer  a  specific  impact  spot,  however.The  decision  to  move  the  search  zone  came  after  additional  analysis  indicating  the  plane  didn't  fly  as  far  south  as  previously  thought,  acting  Malaysian  Transport  Minister  Hishammuddin  Hussein  said  Friday.The  old  area  had  seemed  promising  after  repeated  satellite  images  showed  multitudes  of  objects  floating  in  the  water.But  Young  said  Australian  authorities  had  concluded  the  images  did  not  show  aircraft  wreckage."In  regards  to  the  old  areas,  we  have  not  seen  any  debris,"  he  said,  adding  that  he  would  not  classify  anything  satellites  or  planes  have  spotted  as  debris.  "That's  just  not  justifiable  from  what  we  have  seen."Better  conditionsThe  new  zone  remains  vast  --  roughly  123,000  square  miles  (319,000  square  kilometers).  It  is  still  also  remote  --  1,150  miles  (1,850  kilometers)  west  of  Perth.But  Young  said  conditions  there  are  "likely  to  be  better  more  often"  than  they  were  in  the  old  search  area,  where  poor  weather  has  grounded  flights  two  days  this  week.Planes  will  be  able  to  spend  more  time  in  the  air  because  the  new  search  zone  is  closer  to  land,  Young  said.U.S.  flight  crews  involved  in  the  search  aren't  frustrated  or  disillusioned  by  the  sudden  change  in  the  search,  said  Cmdr.  William  Marks  of  the  Navy's  U.S.  7th  Fleet."For  the  pilots  and  the  air  crews,  this  is  what  they  train  for,"  he  said.  "They  understand  it."Wasted  time?Some  analysts,  however,  raised  their  eyebrows  at  the  sudden  shift."Really?  That  much  debris  and  we're  not  going  to  have  a  look  at  it  to  see  what  that  stuff  might  be?"  said  David  Gallo  of  the  Woods  Hole  Oceanographic  Institution,  who  helped  lead  the  search  for  the  flight  recorders  from  Air  France  Flight  447,  which  crashed  into  the  Atlantic  Ocean  in  2009.Others  lamented  the  amount  of  time,  money  and  resources  that  were  spent  in  the  old  search  area."This  is  time  that  has  been  wasted,  there's  no  question,"  said  CNN  aviation  analyst  Miles  O'Brien.Hishammuddin  disputed  that  suggestion."I  don't  think  we  would've  done  anything  different  from  what  we  have  done,"  he  said.CNN  safety  analyst  David  Soucie  said  it  was  "a  good  sign"  that  experts  had  adjusted  their  assumptions."Assumptions  are  the  key  to  all  of  this,"  he  said.  "If  you  assume  something  and  you  end  up  with  a  final  conclusion,  you  have  to  constantly  review  that."Vast,  evolving  searchThe  shifting  hunt  for  Flight  370  has  spanned  oceans  and  continents.It  started  in  the  South  China  Sea  between  Malaysia  and  Vietnam,  where  the  plane  lost  contact  with  air  traffic  controllers.After  authorities  learned  of  radar  data  suggesting  the  plane  had  turned  west  across  the  Malay  Peninsula  after  losing  contact,  they  expanded  the  search  into  the  Strait  of  Malacca.When  those  efforts  proved  fruitless,  the  search  spread  north  into  the  Andaman  Sea  and  northern  Indian  Ocean.It  then  ballooned  dramatically  after  Malaysia  announced  March  15  that  satellite  data  showed  the  plane  could  have  flown  along  two  huge  arcs,  one  stretching  northwest  into  the  Asian  landmass,  the  other  southwest  into  the  Indian  Ocean.The  search  area  at  that  point  reached  nearly  3  million  square  miles.On  Monday,  Malaysian  Prime  Minister  Najib  Razak  said  that  further  analysis  of  the  data  had  led  authorities  to  conclude  the  plane  went  down  in  the  southern  Indian  Ocean,  far  from  land.Malaysian  officials  told  the  families  of  those  on  board  that  nobody  would  have  survived.  But  many  relatives  have  said  that  only  the  discovery  of  wreckage  from  the  plane  will  convince  them  of  the  fate  of  their  loved  ones.'Unspeakable  challenge'  for  familiesMystery  surfaces  pain  of  1977  tragedyQuestions  lingerDid  flammable  cargo  doom  flight?How  they're  searching  for  debrisCNN's  Brian  Walker  and  Ben  Brumfield  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

They're  peacemakers,  and  they  knew  that  they  risked  this,"  Joe  Quigley,  attorney  for  Walli,  told  CNN  affiliate  WATE  in  May  after  their  trial.  "Nobody  is  happy  to  go  jail,  but  they  understand."In  response  to  the  incident,  Congress  has  held  a  series  of  hearings  and  issued  security  recommendations  to  the  Department  of  Energy  and  its  National  Nuclear  Security  Administration,  which  runs  Y-12  and  seven  other  nuclear  weapons  sites.In  March,  Deputy  Energy  Secretary  Daniel  Poneman  testified  before  the  House  Energy  and  Commerce  Committee  that  the  Department  of  Energy  had  taken  "several  major  actions  ...  to  improve  security"  since  the  breach,  including  management  changes  and  independent  security  reviews.CNN's  Tricia  Escobedo  contributed  to  this  report</TEXT></DOC>

President  Barack  Obama  would  make  a  final  decision.CNN  has  also  learned  key  members  of  Congress  have  been  aware  of  the  internal  debate.The  officials  spoke  to  CNN's  Barbara  Starr  on  condition  of  anonymity  because  of  the  sensitivity  of  the  situation.The  current  discussions  involve  both  military  commanders  in  the  special  forces  community  and  intelligence  officials.A  key  point  being  discussed  is  whether  it  is  better  to  maintain  surveillance  to  see  what  added  intelligence  can  be  gained  about  any  threats  to  the  United  States,  and  whether  additional  monitoring  might  lead  to  other  operatives  or  al  Qaeda  elements  to  target.Under  the  Obama  administration's  policy  for  targeting  Americans,  a  person  would  have  to  pose  an  imminent  threat  to  the  United  States  and  there  would  be  no  reasonable  prospect  of  capture.A  U.S.  official  said  drone  targeting  inside  Pakistan  is  very  sensitive  because  of  the  fragile  state  of  the  Pakistani  government,  which  is  under  pressure  to  ban  such  strikes.As  a  potential  strike  is  weighed,  some  officials  contend  that  good  relations  with  the  Islamabad  government  is  a  priority  so  the  United  States  can  maintain  some  type  of  long-term  surveillance  operation  of  potential  al  Qaeda  targets  there.If  all  U.S.  troops  leave  neighboring  Afghanistan  at  the  end  of  2014,  the  concern  is  it  may  be  harder  to  maintain  high  priority  efforts  such  as  conducting  further  drone  operations  over  Pakistan  and  to  also  monitor  Pakistan's  nuclear  programs.As  the  United  States  considers  a  strike  in  Pakistan,  there  are  also  recent  indications  that  al  Qaeda  in  Pakistan  and  its  affiliate  in  Somalia,  Al-Shabaab,  have  stepped  up  their  links,  a  second  official  told  CNN.Jehad  Serwan  Mostafa,  an  American  citizen,  is  currently  with  Al-Shabaab.  He  is  the  highest-ranking  American  in  the  group,  believed  to  be  in  a  remote  part  of  southern  Somalia.The  Justice  Department  currently  has  a  $5  million  reward  on  his  head.CNN  terrorism  analyst  Paul  Cruikshank  said  there  are  indications  Mostafa  has  contacts  with  senior  al  Qaeda  leadership  in  Pakistan.The  United  States  failed  to  kill  Al  Shabaab  leader  Ahmed  Abdi  Godane  in  a  drone  strike  in  southern  Somalia  just  a  few  weeks  ago.And  last  October,  Navy  SEALs  failed  to  capture  a  third  key  leader,  a  man  named  Ikrimah.  They  assaulted  a  compound  he  was  said  to  be  at  in  southern  Somalia  but  withdrew  under  heavy  fire.Although  Ikrimah  and  Godane  were  said  to  be  involved  in  the  deadly  attack  last  year  on  a  shopping  mall  in  Kenya,  U.S.  officials  have  told  CNN  that  one  reason  Ikrimah  was  targeted  was  there  was  critical  intelligence  he  had  been  communicating  with  operatives  of  al  Qaeda  in  the  Arabian  Peninsula.That  Yemen  based  al  Qaeda  group  is  considered  the  most  dangerous  of  its  affiliates  to  U.S.  security.Former  official  says  U.S.  justifiedThe  Obama  administration  would  be  justified  using  drones  to  kill  American  terrorists  abroad  and  at  home,  former  U.S.  Attorney  General  Alberto  Gonzales  told  CNN  on  Tuesday."They've  been  very,  very  effective  in  the  war  on  terror,"  the  former  George  W.  Bush  appointee  told  CNN's  "New  Day."  "It's  a  wonderful  technology."Two  key  decisions  would  be  involved  --  whether  to  put  an  American  on  a  kill  list  and  whether  to  execute  on  the  kill  order,  said  Gonzales,  who  is  now  in  private  practice  with  a  law  firm  in  Nashville."As  to  the  second,  I  think  the  President  has  the  authority  --  as  the  commander  in  chief  --  once  you  identify  where  an  'enemy  combatant'  is,  to  take  action,  to  take  him  out  on  the  battlefield  like  you  would  any  other  enemy,"  he  said.Due  process  would  be  a  concern  only  in  designating  someone  as  an  "enemy  combatant,"  he  said.Once  that  decision  has  been  made,  "then  the  commander  in  chief  should  be  able  to  execute  on  that  order  at  the  moment  of  his  choosing,  because  you  never  know  when  you  might  locate  that  individual  --  you  might  only  have  minutes,  you  might  only  have  hours."But  the  administration  has  reportedly  taken  months  to  decide  whether  to  target  someone,  a  pace  that  might  wind  up  working  against  it,  Gonzales  said.  "I  think  the  courts  are  going  to  ask,  if  they  finally  take  up  this  issue,  you  have  months  to  make  this  determination,  why  isn't  there  more  due  process  given  to  the  individual,  to  the  American  citizen?"Americans  targeted  beforeThe  United  States  has  targeted  an  American  before,  most  notably  Yemeni-American  cleric  Anwar  al-Awlaki,  a  key  member  of  al  Qaeda  in  the  Arabian  Peninsula  killed  by  a  drone  in  2011.Another  American,  Samir  Khan,  was  killed  in  the  same  strike,  though  he  was  not  the  target  of  the  operation.  Khan  was  behind  al  Qaeda's  English-language  Inspire  magazine,  which  aimed  to  influence  jihadis  and  wannabe  jihadis  around  the  world."What  I  would  worry  about  is  that  the  courts  have  seemed  to  indicate  that,  when  you're  talking  about  the  rights  of  American  citizens,  there  are  certain  due  process  considerations  that  have  to  be  taken  into  account  before  you  designate  someone  as  an  enemy  combatant,"  Gonzales  said."I  would  have  advised  the  President  that  Al-Awlaki  is  an  enemy  combatant  and,  Mr.  President,  you  do  have  the  authority  to  take  him  out  in  a  drone  strike.  But  I  would  also  caution  that,  given  recent  Supreme  Court  decisions,  I'm  not  sure  there  are  five  votes  on  the  court  that  would  agree  with  that  assessment."Gonzales,  who  supported  the  Bush  administration's  policies  that  many  derided  as  torture,  said  Congress'  continued  funding  of  anti-terrorism  efforts  "indicates  tacit  agreement  that  the  war  on  terror  can  continue,  and  that  these  kinds  of  actions  are  in  fact  lawful."  He  noted  that  Congress  gets  periodic  briefings  on  such  matters  and  "apparently  has  no  issues,  no  major  problems  with  these  kinds  of  tactics."Asked  whether  drones  might  be  used  to  kill  Americans  who  have  been  determined  to  be  pressing,  imminent  threats  to  U.S.  safety  on  U.S.  soil,  Gonzales  said  doing  so  was  probable,  even  though  it  might  worry  civil  libertarians."It's  very  likely  that  we're  going  to  confront  more  terrorists  here  in  this  country;  it's  very  likely  they  are  going  to  be  American  citizens.  And  if,  in  fact,  this  is  an  effective  technology,  why  wouldn't  you  use  this  technology  to  eliminate  this  threat?"ACLU  says  government  abusing  powerThe  American  Civil  Liberties  Union  contends  the  administration  abuses  its  power,  particularly  when  it  comes  to  drone  strikes."Even  in  the  context  of  an  armed  conflict  against  an  armed  group,  the  government  may  use  lethal  force  only  against  individuals  who  are  directly  participating  in  hostilities  against  the  United  States,"  the  group  says  on  its  website.  "Regardless  of  the  context,  whenever  the  government  uses  lethal  force,  it  must  take  all  possible  steps  to  avoid  harming  civilian  bystanders.  But  these  are  not  the  standards  that  the  executive  branch  is  using."Unofficial  estimates  based  on  reports  by  human  rights  groups  and  media  accounts  indicate  the  Obama  administration  has  carried  out  hundreds  of  drone  strikes  that  have  killed  hundreds  and  perhaps  thousands  of  people,  including  civilians,  in  an  escalation  of  the  practice  the  Bush  administration  started.Most  have  occurred  in  Afghanistan,  but  others  have  taken  place  in  countries  with  no  ground  war,  including  Yemen,  where  al-Awlaki  was  killed.Critics  say  the  government  oversteps  the  legal  boundaries  of  the  Constitution  and  international  law,  particularly  by  making  decisions  on  targeted  killings  in  secret  without  going  before  any  court.Hina  Shamsi,  who  directs  the  ACLU's  National  Security  Project,  told  CNN  that  the  Obama  administration  was  "fighting  hard"  to  prevent  a  judicial  review  of  the  strikes  that  killed  al-Awlaki  and  the  other  Americans,  including  the  terrorist's  16-year-old  son.Until  allegations  in  classified  documents  can  be  assessed  in  court,  she  said,  the  question  of  whether  they  amount  to  real  evidence  remains  unanswered.Shamsi  called  the  U.S.  actions  "one  of  the  most  extreme  and  dangerous  forms  of  authority  that  the  executive  branch  can  claim  --  the  power  to  kill  people  based  on  vague  and  shifting  legal  standards,  secret  evidence  and  no  judicial  review  even  after  the  fact."Critics:  Obama's  anti-terrorism  strategy  confusingObama  has  insisted  his  responsibility  as  commander  in  chief  to  protect  Americans  from  attack  justified  targeted  killings  such  as  the  drone  strike  on  al-Awlaki.In  a  May  speech,  he  rejected  targeting  an  American  citizen  without  what  he  called  due  process,  meaning  adherence  to  full  legal  procedures.Critics,  including  congressional  Republicans,  argue  the  President's  anti-terrorism  strategy,  which  in  many  ways  extended  programs  and  practices  started  under  the  Bush  administration,  have  failed  to  curtail  al  Qaeda.Asked  last  week  at  a  congressional  hearing  if  al  Qaeda  was  stronger  or  weaker  than  before  the  9/11  attacks,  Director  of  National  Intelligence  James  Clapper  conceded  the  terrorist  network  was  more  widespread.At  the  same  hearing,  House  Intelligence  Committee  Chairman  Mike  Rogers  argued  that  tighter  restrictions  on  targeted  killings  announced  last  year  had  weakened  the  government's  fight  against  terrorism.CNN's  Barbara  Starr  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

But  the  Gov.  Chris  Christie  bridge  scandal  is  bringing  the  old  Joisey  stereotypes  back  into  play."New  Jersey  smells  bad,"  "New  Jersey  drivers  are  the  worst!"  and,  quite  possibly  the  most  inaccurate  accusation,  "Jersey  made  Snooki  and  J-Woww!"  (Not  ours!  They're  both  from  New  York.)  We're  not  a  boorish  population  living  in  an  industrial  wasteland.The  same  old  disparaging  remarks  have  made  Garden  Staters  thick-skinned  underdogs.I'm  convinced  the  New  Jersey  Turnpike  was  built  to  keep  outsiders  out,  because  the  concrete  blight  along  many  stretches  shows  no  evidence  of  why  Jersey  is  called  the  Garden  State.  Once  you  get  off  on  any  exit,  you  will  see  Jersey  is  so  much  more  than  what  most  saw  in  the  "Sopranos"  introduction.I'm  here  to  clear  the  air:  New  Jersey  is  one  of  the  most  underestimated  states  in  the  country.Don't  knock  it  until  you've  traveled  it.Want  to  give  it  a  try?  Here  are  six  spots  to  check  out  from  north  to  south.Jersey  CityGo  on  a  food  tour  of  diverse  Jersey  City.  You'll  find  authentic  and  affordable  Mexican  food  at  Taqueria,  a  savory  crepe  at  French  restaurant  Madame  Claude's,  new  American  food  using  seasonal,  local  ingredients  at  Thirty  Acres,  and  don't  miss  Marco  and  Pepe's  for  brunch  (three  words:  croissant  French  toast).Once  you've  sufficiently  indulged,  catch  a  movie  at  the  Loew's  Jersey  Theatre,  a  not-for-profit  historic  landmark  built  in  1929  that  has  hosted  the  likes  of  Bing  Crosby,  Duke  Ellington,  Jean  Harlow,  Bob  Hope  and,  more  recently,  the  American  rock  band  Neutral  Milk  Hotel.  Cool,  right?If  you  want  to  get  in  touch  with  mother  nature  in  this  densely  populated  area,  head  north  for  a  hike  or  bike  ride  in  beautiful  Palisades  Interstate  Park,  a  historic  national  landmark,  and  one  of  my  favorite  places  in  the  world.West  New  York,  New  JerseyHungry  after  the  hiking  and  biking?  Luckily  you're  minutes  away  from  some  of  the  best  Hispanic  food  in  the  tri-state  area  in  West  New  York.Head  over  to  Bergenline  Avenue,  the  longest  commercial  avenue  in  New  Jersey,  and  go  for  a  nice  long  urban  stroll  with  ample  people-watching,  shopping  and  eats  from  El  Salvadorean  to  Mexican  to  Peruvian  or  Cuban.So  many  choices.  Having  trouble  deciding?  Start  stretching  your  stomach  at  Dulce  de  Leche,  an  Argentine  cafe  and  bakery  where  magical  dulce  de  leche  pastries  and  beef,  chicken,  ham,  cheese  or  spinach  empanadas  are  made  with  mucho  amor.PrincetonIf  you're  looking  for  a  mix  of  history,  an  art  scene  and  tree-lined  streets,  then  you're  hankering  for  Princeton.  Fancy.Take  a  walking  tour  of  Princeton  University's  Ivy  League  campus,  which  dates  to  1754.  It's  well  worth  it.As  for  art,  you'll  want  to  head  over  to  the  Princeton  University  Art  Museum,  which  houses  more  than  72,000  works  of  art.After  soaking  in  all  that  art  and  culture,  stop  for  a  treat.Now,  while  I've  heard  the  Bent  Spoon  is  where  "the  party  is  at"  for  their  gelatos,  I  can  only  vouch  for  Thomas  Sweet  Ice  Cream  on  Nassau  Street.  They're  famous  for  their  blend-ins,  way  before  a  chain  ice  cream  shop  became  popular  for  it.Since  you're  already  on  Nassau  Street,  you  might  as  well  shop.  It  only  makes  sense.  Bookstores,  dining  spots  and  gift  shops,  oh  my!FrenchtownNow  that  you're  an  unofficial  Garden  Stater,  you'll  want  to  get  in  your  car  and  drive  (it's  what  we  do)  to  Frenchtown,  along  the  banks  of  the  Delaware  River.  Rolling  hills,  green  fields  and  scenic  views  support  the  state's  lush  moniker.If  you're  there  anywhere  from  May  to  September,  slap  on  some  sunscreen  and  go  for  a  gentle  tube  ride  or  some  rafting.For  those  looking  for  some  imported  furniture  or  home  decor  from  Southeast  Asia,  go  to  Two  Buttons,  owned  by  the  author  of  "Eat,  Pray,  Love,"  Elizabeth  Gilbert,  and  her  husband.Asbury  ParkNow,  as  the  locals  say,  we're  "going  down  the  shore."Out-of-towners  have  a  stale  notion  of  caked  layers  of  fake  tanning  spray  and  so-called  guidos  galore  along  the  Jersey  Shore,  thanks  to  the  MTV  show.  The  state's  coast  is  actually  defined  by  its  historic  boardwalks,  arcades  and  amusement  parks  thick  with  nostalgia.When  I  want  to  stay  close  to  the  tri-state  area  but  still  want  to  feel  like  I  went  on  a  mini-getaway,  I  go  to  Asbury  Park.I  love  it's  old-timey  charm,  boardwalk,  lounges  and  restaurants,  and,  of  course,  beaches.  It  never  gets  completely  packed  with  people,  so  you'll  find  some  peace  and  quiet.If  you're  a  Bruce  Springsteen  fan  (of  course  you  are,  who  isn't!?),  you  should  make  it  a  point  to  go  to  the  historic  Stone  Pony,  where  he  got  his  start.  Not  far  is  Asbury  Lanes,  another  no-frills  but  fun  music  venue  and  vintage  bowling  alley.Cape  MayFinally,  for  a  real  getaway,  keep  driving  south  until  you  reach  the  southern  tip  of  Jersey  and  charming  and  quaint  Cape  May,  which  stakes  a  claim  as  the  nation's  oldest  seaside  resort.A  National  Historic  Landmark,  Cape  May  is  filled  with  lovely  Victorian  homes.You  can  stroll  on  the  boardwalk,  visit  the  historic  Cape  May  lighthouse,  go  whale  or  dolphin  watching  or  go  wine  tasting  at  the  Cape  May  Winery.Embrace  your  inner  Jersey  girl  and  enjoy  some  of  the  Garden  State's  finer  things  before  the  rest  of  the  out-of-towners  catch  on.But  if  you  don't,  it's  no  skin  off  our  back.

Letterman  was  the  guy  who  had  a  writer  come  on  to  read,  straight-faced,  from  "The  Family  Circus."Letterman  was  the  guy  who  let  his  stage  manager  recap  "Melrose  Place,"  let  two  Bangladeshi  gift-store  owners  named  Mujibur  Rahman  and  Sirajul  Islam  serve  as  "roving  correspondents,"  and  always  --  ALWAYS  --  bit  the  network  hand  that  fed  him.  (Or,  perhaps,  gave  the  "GE  handshake"  to  his  corporate  bosses.  )He  took  elements  of  Steve  Allen,  Ernie  Kovacs,  Johnny  Carson  and  Mad  Magazine,  ran  them  through  his  own  skewed  perspective,  and  came  up  with  something  new:  the  anti-talk  show.Letterman  announced  Thursday  that  he  was  stepping  down  from  "The  Late  Show  with  David  Letterman"  sometime  in  2015.If  you  were  a  celebrity  who  came  on  "Late  Night"  (his  1980s  NBC  show)  or  "The  Late  Show"  (his  CBS  successor)  simply  to  chat  about  your  new  movie  or  album  or  TV  show,  good  luck  to  you.  Dave  --  he  was  always  "Dave"  --  might  be  interested,  but  more  likely  he  was  bored  or  cranky.  He  much  preferred  the  Steve  Martins  or  Bill  Murrays  of  the  world  who  would  use  their  spot  to  do  something  silly.It  was  a  comedic  style  that  never  really  captured  Middle  America  --  for  most  of  their  20-year  rivalry,  Jay  Leno's  ratings  were  much  higher  than  Letterman's  --  but  influenced  a  generation  of  comedians  and  comedy  writers."The  Simpsons,"  Ben  Stiller,  Conan  O'Brien,  Jimmy  Kimmel,  any  comedian  or  comedy  that  used  irony,  silliness,  absurdity  and  a  little  bit  of  antagonism  as  their  stock  in  trade  --  Dave  made  network  television,  previously  an  irony-free  zone,  safe  for  all  of  them.  (There  was  more  than  a  little  Letterman  in  Garry  Shandling's  curdled,  insecure  faux  talk-show  host,  Larry  Sanders.)"He  did  the  thing  that  everyone's  tried  to  do  since  and  has  never  done,  which  is  to  take  the  talk-show  form  and  redo  it,"  Jerry  Seinfeld,  an  early  Letterman  guest,  told  Rolling  Stone  in  2011.  "The  mindset  was,  'We're  tired  of  pretending  there  are  no  cue  cards  and  no  cameras  and  nothing's  rehearsed.  It's  late,  and  we're  going  to  take  over  this  little  piece  of  territory  and  do  our  own  thing.'  Now  that  mindset  is  everywhere."Reveling  in  frictionAt  its  best,  Letterman's  late-night  show  was  unpredictable,  particularly  in  the  1980s,  when  it  was  all  new.  He  once  used  pictures  from  an  old  Sears  catalog  over  the  opening  credits.  He  did  a  "360-degree  show,"  letting  the  camera  rotate  all  the  way  around  during  the  course  of  the  hour.  (At  the  half-hour  mark,  Letterman  was  upside-down.)His  interviews  --  the  "talk"  of  talk  shows  --  were  often  deliberately  devoid  of  content.  Sometimes  he  used  his  guests  for  comedy  bits,  as  when  Steve  Martin  --  allegedly  on  the  set  to  promote  a  movie  --  deplored  Letterman's  questions  and  then  had  the  Late  Show  Gospel  Choir  launch  into  a  gospel  song  about  himself.Other  times  they  were,  shall  we  say,  antagonistic.  Perhaps  the  most  famous  example  was  an  appearance  by  actor  Crispin  Glover  ("Back  to  the  Future")  in  1987.  At  one  point,  Glover  got  up  to  demonstrate  a  roundhouse  kick.  Letterman  went  to  a  commercial  break.  When  he  returned,  Glover  was  gone.Of  course,  Letterman  reveled  in  friction.  Both  Cher  and  Madonna  had  tetchy  interviews  with  the  host.  He  made  much  of  an  alleged  feud  with  Oprah  Winfrey.  During  the  "Late  Night"  days,  he  booked  people  like  Brother  Theodore  or  "American  Splendor"  cartoonist  Harvey  Pekar  --  types  who  were  the  very  antithesis  of  talk-show  guests,  types  that  made  audiences  uncomfortable.Letterman  grew  up  a  bit  when  he  went  to  CBS  in  1993.  With  NBC,  he  wore  blazers  and  sneakers,  very  much  the  impish  college  boy.  Suddenly  he  was  in  nice  suits  and  shined  shoes.  The  guests  became  more  of  the  A-list  variety,  though  Dave  was  still  the  type  to  make  room  for  a  musician  like  Warren  Zevon,  a  personal  favorite  who  would  never  have  passed  muster  on  Leno's  "Tonight."But  it  probably  says  something  that  Letterman's  most  striking  moments  of  recent  years  came  when  he  dropped  the  ironic  pose  and  spoke  from  the  heart.  These  moments  --  paying  tribute  to  mentor  Johnny  Carson,  thanking  his  heart  surgeons,  talking  about  his  son,  confessing  to  an  affair  --  made  the  very  private  host  seem  a  little  more  approachable.Given  some  of  the  stories  about  Letterman's  self-loathing  that  his  former  partner  and  onetime  head  writer,  Merrill  Markoe,  has  told  over  the  years,  he  probably  hated  that.Who  shall  be  the  heir?Perhaps  all  that  irony  doesn't  make  sense  anymore.With  Jimmy  Fallon's  takeover  of  the  "Tonight  Show,"  commentators  have  been  making  much  of  a  "return  to  earnestness,"  playing  up  Fallon's  niceness  and  wide-eyed  wonder.  Fallon  himself  has  named  Steve  Allen  as  a  model,  not  so  much  Letterman.  (Conan  O'Brien  would  never  have  said  that.)And  there's  something  a  little  awkward  about  Letterman,  the  King  of  Absurdity,  still  presiding  over  his  anti-talk  show  circus  at  the  age  of  66.  (He  turns  67  on  April  12.)  It's  not  that  he  can't  pull  it  off  --  it's  that  he's  been  doing  it  for  so  long  that  his  original  college  student  audience  now  has  children  (and  grandchildren!)  of  their  own.  They  have  so  many  more  options,  and  Dave  is  now  one  of  many.Who  can  replace  him?  Craig  Ferguson,  whose  show  follows  Dave's  (and  is  produced  by  Letterman's  company,  Worldwide  Pants),  is  both  earnest  and  oddball  --  but  maybe  a  little  too  fringe-y  for  the  11:30  p.m.  ET  slot.  There  are  whispers  about  Stephen  Colbert,  fully  invested  in  his  own  ironic  character.But  maybe  the  point  is  that  nobody  can  replace  Dave.  After  all,  there's  a  little  Dave  in  all  of  them.Of  course,  Jay  Leno's  available.</TEXT></DOC>

All  five  children  had  been  vaccinated  against  the  poliovirus.  Treatment  did  not  seem  to  help  the  children  regain  their  motor  function.Samples  from  two  of  the  children  tested  positive  for  enterovirus  68,  a  rare  virus  that  has  been  linked  to  severe  respiratory  illness  in  the  past.  Samples  from  the  other  three  children  were  not  collected  or  tested  soon  enough  to  yield  conclusive  results,  said  Dr.  Emmanuelle  Waubant,  a  neurologist  at  the  University  of  California,  San  Francisco.Waubant  and  her  colleagues  will  present  a  case  report  about  these  patients'  illnesses  at  the  American  Academy  of  Neurology's  annual  meeting  in  late  April.  They  are  asking  health  care  providers  to  be  on  the  lookout  for  similar  cases  and  send  in  samples  from  any  patient  exhibiting  these  symptoms.Dr.  Carol  Glaser,  chief  of  the  Encephalitis  and  Special  Investigation  Section  at  the  California  Department  of  Public  Health,  said  the  state  is  aware  of  the  paralysis  cases  but  believes  the  risk  to  families  is  very  low."We  are  evaluating  cases  as  they  are  reported  to  us,"  Glaser  said  in  an  e-mail  to  CNN.  "We  have  not  found  anything  at  this  point  that  raises  any  public  health  concerns."The  poliovirus  has  been  eradicated  in  the  United  States  for  more  than  30  years.  Only  three  countries  in  the  world  are  not  yet  free  of  the  disease:  Afghanistan,  Pakistan  and  Nigeria,  according  to  the  World  Health  Organization.Why  polio  hasn't  gone  away  yetPoliovirus  is  part  of  the  Picornaviridae  family,  which  also  includes  enteroviruses  and  rhinoviruses  (better  known  as  the  common  cold).  There  are  more  than  100  types  of  enterovirus  that  cause  10  million  to  15  million  infections  in  the  United  States  each  year,  according  to  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention.Most  people  who  become  infected  with  an  enterovirus  do  not  get  sick  or  experience  only  mild  symptoms,  said  Dr.  Steven  Oberste,  chief  of  the  Polio  and  Picornavirus  Laboratory  Branch  at  the  CDC.  Common  symptoms  include  fever,  runny  nose,  cough,  skin  rash  and  body  aches.Enterovirus  is  often  the  cause  of  "summer  colds,"  whose  cases  spike  in  July,  August  and  September.  Children  and  teens  are  more  likely  to  fall  ill  because  they  have  not  yet  built  up  immunity  to  these  common  viruses.However,  some  types  of  enterovirus  are  more  serious.  These  can  cause  hand,  foot  and  mouth  disease;  viral  meningitis;  encephalitis  (inflammation  of  the  brain);  an  infection  of  the  heart;  and  paralysis  in  some  patients.Enterovirus  68  was  first  identified  in  a  California  lab  in  1962,  after  four  children  came  down  with  a  severe  respiratory  illness.  Between  1970  and  2005,  only  26  cases  of  enterovirus  68  in  the  United  States  were  reported  to  the  CDC.  Since  2000,  the  government  agency  has  kept  a  closer  watch  and  has  seen  47  cases,  Oberste  said.  Outbreaks  have  occurred  over  the  years  in  Asia  and  Europe,  but  it's  still  one  of  the  rarest  types  of  enterovirus.More  common  --  and  more  concerning  to  health  officials  --  is  enterovirus  71,  which  was  discovered  by  the  same  California  lab  in  1969,  Oberste  said.  Enterovirus  71  is  usually  associated  with  severe  neurological  issues,  including  aseptic  meningitis,  polio-like  paralysis  and  encephalitis.According  to  a  CDC  report,  several  outbreaks  of  paralysis  caused  by  enterovirus  71  were  seen  in  Europe  in  the  1960s  and  1970s.  In  the  late  1990s  and  early  2000s,  fatal  encephalitis  was  a  big  problem  in  Malaysia  and  Taiwan."Ever  since  then,  the  virus  has  circulated  in  high  levels  in  Southeast  Asia,"  Oberste  said.In  recent  years,  the  outbreaks  have  spread  to  Australia;  a  cluster  of  cases  near  Sydney  drew  media  attention  in  2013.Between  1983  and  2005,  270  cases  of  enterovirus  71  were  reported  in  the  United  States.  But  none  has  resulted  in  a  larger  outbreak,  despite  the  virus's  infectious  nature."That's  the  really  odd  thing,"  Oberste  said.  "We  see  cases  from  time  to  time  in  the  United  States.  Occasionally  they'll  be  severe.  Basically  it's  identical  to  what's  circulating  in  Asia  ...  but  it  doesn't  cause  the  same  big  outbreak  in  disease.  And  we  really  don't  know  why."The  CDC  is  aware  of  the  small  cluster  of  cases  in  California  but  is  not  actively  involved  in  an  investigation,  a  spokesman  told  CNN.  Waubant  and  her  colleagues  don't  want  to  alarm  anyone  with  their  case  report  presentation;  they're  simply  seeking  help  in  finding  the  cause  of  these  seemingly  connected  cases."We  would  like  to  stress  that  this  syndrome  appears  to  be  very,  very  rare,"  one  of  Waubant's  colleagues,  Dr.  Keith  Van  Haren,  said  in  a  prepared  statement.Parents  need  to  know  that  vaccination  is  key  to  preventing  polio  from  returning  to  the  United  States,  Glaser  said.  While  there  is  no  vaccine  to  protect  you  from  a  non-polio  enterovirus,  washing  your  hands  frequently  and  avoiding  close  contact  with  others  who  are  sick  can  help.</TEXT></DOC>

Instructors  claim  that  if  you  only  knew  the  right  moves,  your  trouble  zones  would  disappear  and  your  body  would  be  dimple-free.  But  can  certain  exercises  really  get  rid  of  cellulite?The  verdict:  Exercise  can  reduce  fat,  but  there's  no  way  to  spot-treat  cellulite"Getting  rid  of  cellulite  requires  proper  exercise,  nutrition,  proper  circulation  and  the  control  of  fat-storage  hormones  (that  are)  more  prevalent  in  the  lower  body,"  says  personal  trainer  Ariane  Hundt,  founder  of  Brooklyn  Bridge  Boot  Camp.upwave:  5-minute  easy  lower  body  workoutTo  some  extent,  genetics  determine  how  much  cellulite  a  person  has.  So  does  gender:  Women  are  more  prone  to  having  cellulite  because,  unlike  most  men,  they  tend  to  store  fat  in  their  thighs,  hips  and  buttocks.Unfortunately,  these  factors  mean  that  some  people  are  destined  to  have  cellulite  no  matter  how  hard  they  work  out.  But  there  are  ways  to  reduce  its  appearance.According  to  Hundt,  the  keys  to  a  good  anti-cellulite  training  program  are:  losing  body  fat,  firming  the  muscle  underneath  the  skin,  following  a  low-carb  diet,  and  boosting  circulation  and  blood  flow.upwave:  The  best  fat-loss  workoutHere  are  her  tips  for  doing  all  of  that:CirculationEnhance  your  circulation  by  getting  massages  and  doing  regular  exercise  that  involves  strength  training  and  cardio.  Taking  showers  that  switch  from  hot  to  cold  can  also  boost  circulation.DietEating  a  low-fat  diet  consisting  of  lean  proteins  and  veggies  is  one  way  to  lose  body  fat.  Avoid  sugar,  starches,  alcohol,  processed  foods  and  sugary  fruit.  Lowering  your  carb  intake  will  also  help:  Foods  with  a  low  glycemic  index  have  been  shown  to  aid  in  weight  loss,  according  to  the  Harvard  School  of  Public  Health.upwave:  Take  the  challenge!  Cut  back  on  sugarsCardioInterval  training  --  which  involves  varying  the  intensity  of  your  activity  --  is  a  great  way  to  burn  body  fat.Strength  trainingFirming  the  muscle  underneath  the  cellulite  will  help  smooth  the  skin's  appearance.  Focus  on  strength-training  moves  that  build  up  the  hamstrings,  quads,  buttocks  and  hips.  Aim  for  training  the  lower  body  at  least  two  times  a  week,  increasing  the  weight  over  time  to  challenge  your  muscles.  Among  the  most  effective  lower-body  exercises  are:--  Step-Ups:  Step  up  on  a  bench  or  fitness  step,  then  step  down  with  the  same  leg.  Aim  for  20  reps  on  each  leg.--  Lunges:  Walking  or  stationary  lunges  effectively  target  all  lower-body  muscles.  Take  one  large  step  forward  and  lower  your  body  so  both  of  your  knees  form  90-degree  angles,  keeping  your  front  knee  over  the  ankle.  Return  to  starting  position.  Aim  for  30  to  50  reps  on  each  leg.--  Squats:  Aim  for  50  reps,  keeping  your  weight  in  the  heels  and  your  back  straight  as  you  extend  your  hips  down  and  back  (like  you're  sitting  in  a  chair).  Try  to  lower  until  your  thighs  are  at  least  paralell  to  the  floor.  Don't  let  your  knees  extend  past  your  toes.This  article  was  originally  published  on  upwave.com.©  2013  upwave,  All  Rights  Reserved.</TEXT></DOC>

Besides  bread,  the  chemical  is  also  found  in  yoga  mats  and  shoe  soles  to  add  elasticity.But  it's  not  long  for  bread  at  Subway:  The  company  says  it's  coming  out."We  are  already  in  the  process  of  removing  azodicarbonamide  as  part  of  our  bread  improvement  efforts  despite  the  fact  that  it  is  (a)  USDA  and  FDA  approved  ingredient,"  Subway  said  in  a  statement.  "The  complete  conversion  to  have  this  product  out  of  the  bread  will  be  done  soon."The  controversial  chemical  has  been  used  by  commercial  bakers  for  the  purpose  of  strengthening  dough  but  has  been  poorly  tested,  according  to  the  Center  for  Science  in  the  Public  Interest.One  of  the  breakdown  products,  derived  from  the  original  substance,  is  called  urethane,  a  recognized  carcinogen,  the  organization  says.  Using  azodicarbonamide  at  maximum  allowable  levels  results  in  higher  levels  of  urethane  in  bread  "that  pose  a  small  risk  to  humans,"  CSPI  said.Another  breakdown  product  is  semicarbazide,  which  poses  "a  negligible  risk  to  humans"  but  was  found  to  cause  cancers  of  the  lung  and  blood  vessels  in  mice,  CSPI  said.CSPI  advocates  for  reducing  the  amount  of  the  chemical  that  is  allowed  to  be  used."We  urge  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration  to  consider  whether  the  Delaney  amendment,  which  bars  the  use  of  food  additives  that  cause  cancer  in  humans  or  animals,  requires  the  agency  to  bar  its  use,"  CSPI  said.The  FDA  has  said  that  the  additive  cannot  exceed  0.0045%  by  weight  of  the  flour  when  used  in  as  a  "dough  conditioner."The  American  Bakers  Association  told  CNN:  "Past  FDA  sampling  results  have  indicated  appropriate  low  level  use  in  products.  As  a  dough  conditioner  it  has  a  volume/texture  effect  on  the  finished  loaf.  It  is  a  functional  ingredient  that  improves  the  quality  of  bread  and  any  substitutes  are  likely  not  to  work  as  well  as  ADA  (azodicarbonamide)."Food  blogger  Vani  Hari,  of  the  popular  food  blog  Food  Babe,  originally  drew  public  attention  to  this  issue,  CSPI  said.  She  has  written  about  Subway  ingredients  several  times  since  2012,  this  week  she  launched  a  petition  urging  Subway  to  stop  using  azodicarbonamide.  More  than  67,000  people  signed.Grocery  store  breads  and  restaurant  breads  also  contain  this  chemical.  Other  major  fast  food  chains  have  products  with  the  ingredient  too,  including  McDonald's,  Starbucks  and  Arby's.McDonald's  has  also  responded  to  concerns  about  the  chemical  with  regard  to  its  McRib  sandwich  buns,  but  continues  to  use  the  chemical  in  that  product.McDonald's  notes  on  its  website  that  a  "variation  of  Azodicarbonamide  has  commercial  uses  and  is  used  in  the  production  of  some  foamed  plastics,  like  exercise  mats.

WE  ARE  SO  #HAPPY  to  announce  PHARRELL  WILLIAMS  =  #NewVoiceCoach  for  SEASON  7,"  the  tweet  read.That's  music  to  the  ears  of  many  fans  who  have  been  clamoring  for  Williams  to  be  involved  with  the  show.  In  2013,  one  of  the  show's  coaches,  Usher,  brought  Williams  in  as  a  guest  mentor  for  his  team  and  the  "Happy"  singer  brought  it.  So  much  so  that  it  prompted  the  New  York  Magazine's  Vulture  column  to  headline  one  of  their  recaps  "Pharrell  should  be  a  coach.""It's  been  a  huge  year  for  Pharrell,  with  recognition  for  his  contribution  in  the  world  of  music  --  the  Despicable  Me  franchise  soundtracks,  his  Oscar-nominated  song  'Happy'  and  his  Grammy-winning  collaboration  with  Daft  Punk  on  the  breakout  dance  hit  'Get  Lucky.'  His  dominance  in  record  sales  in  2014,  coupled  with  his  incomparable  accomplishments  in  the  world  of  fashion  and  design,  make  him  an  irresistible  addition  to  The  Voice  family,"  said  Paul  Telegdy  of  NBC  Entertainment."He  has  already  made  a  considerable  impact  as  a  mentor,  drawing  on  an  impressive  track  record  as  both  a  producer  and  performer.  It  is  a  perfect  fit  for  'The  Voice'  as  we  evolve  and  reach  for  new  heights  with  this  franchise.  It  feels  like  we  are  welcoming  an  existing  family  member  home."On  Monday  Williams  retweeted  the  NBC  tweet  adding:  "This  is  going  to  be  so  fun."</TEXT></DOC>

Was  it  a  Super  Bowl  commercial?  Something  having  to  do  with  Seinfeld's  Web  series  "Comedians  in  Cars  Getting  Coffee"?  Or  was  it  perhaps,  like  the  sitcom,  a  whole  bunch  of  nothing?The  answer  is  yes.In  addition  to  the  comic,  the  mini-"Seinfeld"  reunion  included  Alexander,  who  played  George  Costanza  on  the  show,  and  Wayne  Knight,  who  played  Newman  the  postal  carrier.  It  turned  out  to  be  a  bit  of  a  commercial  for  Seinfeld's  "Comedians  in  Cars  Getting  Coffee."  On  that  show,  Seinfeld  often  sits  down  for  a  chat  with  fellow  comedians  and  celebs.In  this  case,  Seinfeld  was  in  character  as  Seinfeld  hanging  out  with  his  old  buddy  Costanza  in  search  of  some  grub  during  the  Super  Bowl.  The  pair  bantered  about  a  friend's  Super  Bowl  party  and  a  discussion  ensued  about  "over  cheering"  football  games.Then  Jerry's  nemesis,  Newman,  showed  up.In  all,  it  really  was  straightforward.  Though  keep  in  mind  "Seinfeld"  celebrates  its  25th  anniversary  this  year,  so  perhaps  there  is  something  more  to  the  mystery  after  all.</TEXT></DOC>

No,  he  hadn't  pinned  her  down,  or  threatened  violence.  But  Espinosa  insists  that  he  coerced  her,  psychologically  and  physically,  into  having  sex  against  her  will  for  most  of  their  three-year  relationship.  She  resisted,  told  him  no,  pushed  him  away.  More  often  than  not,  he  persisted  and  she  gave  in  "just  to  get  it  over  with,"  she  says."I  knew  that  it  was  sexual  assault,  but  at  the  time,  I  felt  extreme  shame  and  was  not  ready  nor  willing  to  fully  accept  what  was  happening,"  said  Espinosa,  24.  "Like  most  unpleasant  truths,  I  buried  it  until  the  end  of  my  relationship,  when  I  realized  I  was  holding  onto  a  relationship  with  a  man  who  was  abusive."The  relationship  came  to  an  end  in  February  2013.  The  next  month,  Espinosa  filed  a  sexual  harassment  claim  against  her  former  boyfriend  with  her  school,  the  University  of  Texas-Pan  American,  where  some  of  the  incidents  occurred.She  says  she  went  to  the  school  first  because  she  thought  that  without  concrete  evidence  law  enforcement  would  not  take  her  seriously  --  a  common  experience  among  people  who  report  rape  to  law  enforcement,  experts  say.  Besides,  she  knew  that  colleges  and  universities  are  federally  mandated  to  investigate  sexual  violence  under  Title  IX,  a  federal  civil  rights  law  that  guarantees  students  the  right  to  an  education  free  of  sexual  violence,  which  is  considered  a  form  of  discrimination.Indeed,  when  she  went  to  the  city  of  Edinburg  Police  Department  a  few  days  later,  she  says  they  told  her  that  her  case  would  be  difficult  to  prove  and  took  her  phone  number.  She  never  heard  back  from  them,  she  says.Her  experience  with  UTPA  administrators  was  no  better,  she  says.  At  various  stages  of  the  investigation,  they  questioned  why  she  did  not  come  forward  sooner  with  the  abuse  claims,  suggesting  she  was  acting  out  as  a  spiteful  ex-girlfriend.  In  one  meeting,  she  says,  administrators  asked  whether  their  relationship  was  "Facebook  official"  or  whether  there  was  a  "promise  of  marriage."It  took  five  months  for  school  administrators  to  reach  the  conclusion  that  Espinosa's  complaint  was  "unsubstantiated."  They  did,  however,  conclude  her  ex-boyfriend  abused  his  access  to  university  facilities,  and  placed  him  on  disciplinary  probation  for  the  remainder  of  his  academic  career,  according  to  documents  provided  by  Espinosa.Espinosa's  voice  quivers  as  she  recalls  the  ordeal,  which  led  her  in  2013  to  drop  one  class  in  the  first  summer  session  and  request  an  incomplete  in  the  second.It  was  a  punch  in  the  gut  after  sleepless  nights  and  constant  self-doubt,  she  said.  She  believes  the  school  violated  her  civil  rights  by  mishandling  the  complaint  and  creating  a  sexually  hostile  environment.This  week,  Espinosa  filed  a  complaint  with  the  Department  of  Education's  Office  of  Civil  Rights  alleging  violations  of  Title  IX.A  UTPA  spokeswoman  said  the  school  had  not  seen  Espinosa's  complaint,  but  noted  the  school  does  not  comment  on  pending  investigations.Espinosa's  complaint  makes  UTPA  the  latest  school  to  face  criticism  for  its  handling  of  a  sexual  assault  report.  So  far  in  fiscal  year  2014,  the  Department  of  Education's  Office  of  Civil  Rights  says  it  has  received  16  complaints  that  included  Title  IX  allegations  specifically  related  to  sexual  violence.Those  numbers  come  on  the  heels  of  a  marked  year-to-year  increase  in  complaints  the  department  received,  from  17  in  2012  to  30  in  2013.The  U.S.  Department  of  Education  laid  out  minimal  requirements  in  a  2011  "Dear  Colleague"  letter  for  schools  to  follow  in  responding  to  reports  of  sexual  harassment,  or  risk  loss  of  federal  funding.The  19-page  letter  reminded  schools  that  under  Title  IX,  which  prohibits  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  sex,  colleges  and  universities  must  apply  a  "preponderance  of  evidence"  standard  to  reviewing  rape  cases,  which  means  they  must  operate  under  the  assumption  that  "more  likely  than  not  that  sexual  violence  occurred."Now,  many  are  under  scrutiny  from  the  federal  government.  The  U.S.  Department  of  Education's  Office  of  Civil  Rights  has  35  pending  Title  IX  investigations  involving  allegations  of  sexual  violence  at  schools  such  as  the  University  of  North  Carolina,  Princeton,  Harvard,  Swarthmore,  the  University  of  Southern  California,  Dartmouth  and  Occidental,  a  Department  of  Education  spokesman  told  CNN.Rape  is  a  longstanding  issue  on  college  campuses,  but  the  latest  movement,  led  by  student  activists,  survivors  and  faculty,  recasts  sexual  violence  as  a  cultural  problem  on  campuses  nationwide  --  not  just  a  series  of  isolated  incidents.Students  are  taking  matters  into  their  own  hands,  filing  complaints  en  masse  and  speaking  out  publicly.They've  flocked  to  advocacy  groups  such  as  End  Rape  on  Campus  and  Know  Your  IX,  which  sprang  from  grassroots  activism  around  university  handling  --  or  mishandling  --  of  sexual  violence.President  Barack  Obama  recently  called  the  nationwide,  student-led  movement  a  catalyst  for  a  federal  task  force  to  protect  college  students  from  sexual  violence  on  campus.The  bravery  of  students  who've  spoken  out  --  and  their  ability  to  connect  to  each  other  through  social  media  --  has  sparked  a  paradigm  shift  on  campuses,  said  Gina  Smith,  an  attorney  who  has  consulted  with  schools  around  the  country  on  sexual  assault  policy."What  we're  seeing  is  a  demand  that  schools  treat  complainants  with  compassion,"  Smith  said.  "Schools  are  stepping  up  and  taking  notice."From  one  campus  to  the  next,  the  concerns  are  mostly  the  same,  said  sexual  assault  policy  consultant  Leslie  Gomez:  lack  of  clarity,  students  being  mistreated,  complex  procedures  and  insufficient  training  among  those  leading  the  processes.When  evidence  goes  viralAt  the  UTPA,  Espinosa  appealed  the  decision  in  her  case,  but  the  administration  upheld  it.  She  reached  out  to  advocacy  group  End  Rape  on  Campus,  and  a  member  of  the  group  helped  her  file  a  complaint  with  the  federal  Office  of  Civil  Rights."I'm  not  sure  I  would've  come  forward  if  all  these  people  hadn't  done  it  before  me,"  Espinosa  said.  "I  needed  the  validation.  I  needed  someone  to  confirm,  'You're  right  you're  not  blowing  things  out  of  proportion."It  was  a  relief  to  hear  someone  tell  me,  'You  have  a  case,  and  they  shouldn't  treat  you  this  way.'"Here  are  just  some  of  the  students  and  activists  trying  to  change  the  way  their  schools  handle  sexual  violence  --  for  good.  CNN  does  not  name  survivors  of  sexual  assault,  but  is  doing  so  in  this  case  because  these  people,  including  Espinosa,  chose  to  come  forward  in  the  hopes  of  holding  their  schools  accountable  and  encouraging  others  to  speak  up.Sarah  O'Brien,  Vanderbilt  UniversityDespite  an  ongoing,  high-profile  rape  case  involving  four  football  players,  Nashville's  Vanderbilt  University  community  hasn't  exactly  rallied  to  change  campus  culture,  alumna  Sarah  O'Brien,  22,  said.  But  that  hasn't  stopped  O'Brien  and  others  from  working  with  administrators  to  clarify  the  school's  policies  around  sexual  violence,  and  raise  awareness  of  how  the  school  can  help."Our  campus  is  not  liberal  and  it's  not  activist,  so  when  a  group  of  students  come  together  around  an  issue  it  stands  out,"  says  O'Brien,  who  graduated  from  Vanderbilt  in  December.In  2010,  an  acquaintance  raped  her  while  she  was  drunk,  she  said.  A  series  of  frustrating  encounters  with  school  administrators  led  O'Brien  to  come  out  publicly  as  a  rape  survivor  in  fall  2012.One  administrator  attributed  her  PTSD  to  the  stress  of  being  a  student  athlete;  another  told  her  a  statute  of  limitations  prevented  her  from  reporting  the  rape.She  later  found  that  Title  IX  gave  her  the  option  of  seeking  academic  leniencies  due  to  her  PTSD  diagnosis,  but  such  provisions  were  not  laid  out  Vanderbilt's  policy,  she  said."I  just  felt  that  university  failed  me  in  a  lot  of  ways,"  O'Brien  said.  "As  I  started  talking  to  other  women  [at  Vanderbilt],  it  became  a  common  complaint."After  going  public,  she  organized  a  Take  Back  the  Night  event  and  began  working  with  student  athletes  and  survivors.  She  reached  out  to  Know  Your  IX's  founders,  culminating  in  a  complaint  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Education  accusing  Vanderbilt  of  violating  of  Title  IX  and  the  Clery  Act,  a  federal  law  that  requires  public  disclosure  of  crimes  on  campus.The  same  month,  campus  group  Vanderbilt  Students  of  Nonviolence  delivered  an  11-page  list  of  demands.  Students  asked  the  school  for  a  single  office  focused  on  sexual  assault  prevention  and  treatment;  a  website  that  pulls  together  all  campus  resources  and  protections  afforded  under  Title  IX;  posters  around  campus  discouraging  sexual  violence;  inclusion  of  students  on  boards  related  to  campus  life  and  sexual  assault  policies;  and  more  training  in  sexual  assault  prevention  for  people  on  those  committees.It's  what  O'Brien  looked  for  and  couldn't  find  after  her  alleged  assault,  she  said."The  last  thing  you  want  to  is  dig  through  a  bunch  of  websites  and  contact  administrators  who  don't  know  even  know  the  policy  when  you're  dealing  with  a  sexual  assault,"  she  said.Already,  changes  are  under  way.  The  campus  hosted  an  open  forum  on  sexual  violence  led  by  a  lawyer.In  an  e-mailed  statement,  Beth  Fortune,  Vanderbilt's  vice  chancellor  for  public  affairs,  said  posters  are  up  that  say,  "Sex  without  consent  is  sexual  assault."  The  Project  Safe  website  is  live  and  the  office  is  underway,  among  other  efforts."We  want  to  make  it  as  easy  as  possible  for  victims  of  sexual  misconduct  to  get  the  services  they  need,"  Fortune  said.Since  graduating,  O'Brien  is  still  involved  with  Vanderbilt  Students  of  Nonviolence.  She's  also  working  to  build  a  shelter  for  survivors  of  sexual  violence  in  Nashville."I  think  change  will  be  a  slow  process,"  she  said,  "but  we're  starting  to  see  it."John  Kelly,  Tufts  UniversityRape  is  something  anyone  can  experience,  regardless  of  gender  or  sexual  orientation.  It's  something  John  Kelly  knows  firsthand,  and  wants  others  to  remember.In  just  18  months,  the  20-year-old  Tufts  University  student  has  gone  from  admitting  to  himself  he  had  experienced  partner  rape  to  becoming  a  leading  LGBTQ  voice  on  education  policy  about  sexual  assault.Like  many  survivors  who  go  public,  he  did  so  out  of  frustration  with  his  school's  adjudication  process.  Kelly  believes  the  Massachusetts  university  let  his  attacker  off  easy  --  he  was  suspended,  rather  than  expelled  --  because  the  school  didn't  consider  oral  sex  to  be  rape."It  was  really  traumatic,  trying  and  poorly  executed,"  Kelly  said  of  Tufts'  adjudication  process.But  other  parts  of  the  process  revealed  where  Tufts  "did  a  fantastic  job."  The  Title  IX  office  performed  a  thorough  investigation  and  advocated  on  his  behalf  when  he  was  hospitalized  after  a  suicide  attempt,  Kelly  said.  It  facilitated  a  no-contact  order  for  his  attacker,  arranged  therapy  and  made  sure  he  could  return  to  classes."I  saw  the  potential  for  Tufts  to  have  a  really  strong  policy,"  he  said.  "We  were  halfway  there;  the  problem  was  in  the  punishment  phase."Kelly  ran  for  student  senate  and  got  involved  with  the  campus  group  Action  for  Sexual  Assault  Prevention.  It  teamed  up  with  another  group,  Consent  Culture  Network,  on  an  April  2013  letter  to  Tufts  officials,  calling  for  eight  major  policy  changes.A  Tufts  University  spokeswoman  said  the  school  began  to  "take  a  deep  look  at  all  of  its  policies  and  procedures  regarding  sexual  misconduct,"  after  the  2011  U.S.  Department  of  Education  letter,  and  continued  those  efforts  in  2013,  when  the  university  president  convened  the  Task  Force  on  Sexual  Misconduct  Prevention.School  officials  would  not  comment  on  Kelly's  case,  and  he  has  not  filed  a  Title  IX  complaint  against  the  school.  He  says  he  is  trying  to  make  headway  by  working  on  a  task  force  subcommittee  addressing  prevention  through  policy  and  campus  culture.He's  also  working  with  the  national  organization  Ed  Act  Now,  which  drew  more  than  175,000  signatures  on  a  petition  urging  Education  Secretary  Arne  Duncan  to  hold  schools  accountable  for  failing  to  comply  with  Title  IX  and  Clery  laws.Kelly  and  others  met  with  Duncan  and  others  from  the  Obama  administration  and  Department  of  Justice.  He  now  serves  on  the  Department  of  Education's  Negotiated  Rulemaking  Committee  on  the  Violence  Against  Women  Act,  helping  to  shape  the  regulations  surrounding  recent  changes  to  the  law."We  want  to  make  things  more  survivor-centered,  make  sure  support  systems  are  in  place  to  increase  students'  mental,  emotional  and  physical  safety,"  he  said.Sofie  Karasek,  University  of  California,  BerkeleyThe  University  of  California,  Berkeley  was  Sofie  Karasek's  dream  school,  a  progressive  campus,  perfect  for  an  activist  like  herself.  She  never  imagined  she'd  be  advocating  for  herself.Karasek  said  her  path  took  a  detour  one  night  in  her  first  year,  when  she  was  sexually  assaulted  at  an  off-campus  event.  Ashamed,  she  told  just  a  few  others,  and  buried  the  incident  --  until  she  learned  the  same  person  had  assaulted  three  other  students.  In  April  2012,  they  met  with  administrators  to  tell  their  story.  The  following  month,  Karasek  and  two  others  filed  a  report  against  him  with  the  school,  and  waited  to  hear  back.Six  months  later,  Karasek  said  she  heard  through  a  mutual  friend  about  the  resolution:  He  would  be  graduating  early.  No  investigation  had  been  conducted  as  far  as  she  knew;  at  least  none  involving  her  or  the  other  women."I  gave  them  the  benefit  of  doubt,"  she  said.  It  turned  out  they  weren't  talking  to  anyone  except  him,  she  said,  "to  resolve  it  on  his  terms."The  school  responded  to  Karasek's  request  for  an  update  two  days  before  his  December  2012  graduation,  saying  that  he  had  been  found  in  violation  of  the  student  code  of  conduct  and  that  the  case  was  solved  through  an  early  resolution  process,  she  said.  The  school  only  confirmed  in  September  2013  that  he  had  graduated  in  December,  she  said.UC  Berkeley  did  not  respond  to  requests  for  comment.Karasek  was  emboldened  to  speak  out  about  her  experience.  With  the  help  of  students  from  other  universities,  she  and  eight  other  students  filed  a  Clery  complaint  against  UC  Berkeley  in  May.  But  instead  of  filing  the  complaint  silently,  she  and  another  student  issued  a  press  release  while  attorney  Gloria  Allred  held  a  press  conference  to  announce  that  complaints  had  been  filed  against  Berkeley,  Dartmouth,  Swarthmore  and  the  University  of  Southern  California.The  experience  has  launched  Karasek  into  the  activist  spotlight.  She  testified  at  a  joint  legislative  committee  hearing  in  August  2013,  leading  the  state  legislature  to  order  an  audit  of  sexual  assault  policies  at  UC  Berkeley  and  three  other  state  schools.  The  results  are  expected  in  April.In  December,  an  aide  from  California  Assemblyman  Mike  Gatto's  office  reached  out,  asking  whether  she  would  testify  on  behalf  of  a  bill  requiring  universities  to  report  all  sexual  assaults  and  violent  crimes  to  local  law  enforcement.  Karasek  suggested  modifying  the  bill  to  require  that  that  all  violent  crimes  be  reported  except  in  cases  where  survivors  request  otherwise.  He  listened  and  introduced  the  amended  bill  to  the  state  education  code  with  her  suggested  caveat.But  progress  at  UC  Berkeley  has  been  "lackluster,"  Karasek  said.  In  September,  the  school  introduced  an  interim  policy  that  allows  survivors  to  appeal  their  cases,  among  other  changes.  But  Karasek  wishes  more  meaningful  improvements  would  come,  including  more  staff  dedicated  to  the  issue,  as  well  as  Title  IX  coordinators,  and  for  the  "preponderance  of  evidence"  standard  written  into  UC  Berkeley's  policy.Really,  what  Karasek  wants  is  the  school  to  implement  a  process  for  formal  hearings  and  investigations  in  sexual  assault  reports  --  something  that  was  missing  from  her  experience  with  the  reporting  process,  she  said.But  a  Title  IX  advisory  committee  convened  by  the  school  chancellor  to  review  policies  that  she  sits  on  has  only  met  once,  she  said.  Otherwise,  nothing  much  changed,  she  said."The  people  who  are  dedicated  to  changing  policy  are  students,"  she  said.  "We're  recognizing  the  snowball  effect  that  comes  from  speaking  out."Caroline  Heldman,  Occidental  CollegeCaroline  Heldman  remembers  how  it  feels  to  go  to  bed  hungry  or  cold.  She  grew  up  poor  in  rural  Washington  state,  and  remembers  the  "pain  of  people  looking  down  on  you,"  of  being  the  first  person  accused  when  something  went  missing,  and  being  shunned  and  teased.  Still,  her  father's  Pentecostal  leanings  ingrained  in  her  a  duty  to  serve  others  and  the  view  that  "someone  else's  suffering  is  my  own  suffering,"  she  said.Heldman,  an  Occidental  College  professor,  has  become  one  of  the  leading  faculty  figures  helping  students  file  federal  complaints  involving  the  handling  of  sexual  assault  cases."There's  not  a  single  school  that  isn't  thinking  about  this,"  Heldman  said.Heldman  and  colleague  Danielle  Dirks  helped  37  students  and  alumna  file  a  Title  IX  complaint  in  2013.  She  served  as  a  faculty  advisor  to  End  Rape  on  Campus,  which  connects  survivors  with  resources  for  treatment  and  options  for  holding  schools  accountable.This  past  week,  in  a  Google  Hangout,  she  walked  Espinosa,  the  University  of  Texas-Pan  American  student,  through  the  process  to  file  her  complaint."My  work  is  very  much  driven  by  the  fact  that  we  don't  live  in  a  meritorious  society  and  some  people  are  more  likely  to  experience  pain  and  suffering  than  others,"  she  said.  "A  lot  of  us  are  very  comfortable  acknowledging  that  given  certain  circumstances,  we  could  be  in  the  same  bad  situation  as  someone  else.  But  it's  more  than  that  --  it's  about  seeing  yourself  in  others."As  a  young  idealist,  Heldman  thought  she  could  fix  everything  that  was  wrong  in  the  world  --  from  the  headlight  ordinances  she  argued  for  as  a  child  in  Washington  to  the  social  justice  causes  she  took  up  as  an  undergrad.As  a  full-time  professor  with  tenure  at  Occidental,  Heldman  feels  a  responsibility  to  speak  up  about  how  schools  treat  victims  of  sexual  violence.  Many  educators  have  less  freedom  to  speak  out  about  controversial  topics,  she  said,  which  puts  her  in  a  unique  position  to  help."Power  in  colleges  has  shifted  dramatically  in  recent  years  to  the  administrative  side,"  she  said."Those  of  us  who  are  tenured  need  to  use  our  academic  freedom  because  we're  the  only  ones  at  institutions  who  have  power  to  speak  out  when  administrations  mistreat  students."Anusha  Ravi,  Emory  UniversityAs  far  as  Anusha  Ravi  is  concerned,  how  a  school  deals  with  sexual  assault  is  a  reflection  of  the  entire  campus  community  --  and  it's  everyone's  job.As  more  schools  made  national  headlines  with  students'  allegations  of  mishandling  of  sexual  assault  reports,  Ravi  began  to  wonder,  how  are  handling  these  kinds  of  things  at  handled  at  her  school,  Emory  University  in  Atlanta?That's  why  the  20-year-old  political  science  student  joined  the  student  group  Sexual  Assault  Peer  Advocates.  The  group  provides  training  to  undergraduate  and  graduate  students  about  how  to  talk  to  sexual  assault  survivors.It's  a  skill  most  college  students  will  need  at  some  point,  Ravi  said.  She  has  not  personally  experienced  sexual  assault,  but  she  knows  people  who  have.  Understanding  how  to  talk  about  sexual  assault  fosters  a  climate  of  openness  within  the  school  community,  she  said.Because  sexual  assault  affects  women  more  often  than  men,  she  said,  a  school's  mishandling  of  sexual  assaults  projects  a  sexist  image,  and  for  better  or  worse,  so  much  has  to  do  with  image."It  doesn't  look  good  for  higher  education  in  general  and  doesn't  make  an  institution  look  good,"  she  said.  "As  a  college  student,  I  do  believe  that  when  people  are  evaluating  their  own  education,  they're  not  only  looking  at  classes,  but  campus  culture  and  safety."So  far,  Ravi  is  satisfied  with  Emory's  approach.After  the  2011  Department  of  Education  letter,  Emory  created  a  university-wide  sexual  misconduct  policy  and  adjudication  process  in  2013,  a  university  spokeswoman  said  in  an  e-mail.The  school  now  has  Title  IX  coordinators  for  each  college  and  supports  groups  such  as  Sexual  Assault  Peer  Advocates  in  its  efforts  to  improve  campus  culture.The  group  has  trained  more  than  1,000  people,  from  fraternity  groups  to  residence  advisers,  Ravi  said."Nobody  wants  to  be  the  school  that  treats  people  poorly,  especially  sexual  assault  survivors,"  she  said.  "We  all  have  a  role  to  play."Teens  trained  to  spot  drama  before  it  turns  dangerousCNN's  Jamie  Gumbrecht  and  Toby  Lyles  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

"In  that  sense,  it's  amazing."Watson  --  who  works  for  Turner  Broadcasting  System,  an  entity  that  includes  CNN  --  and  her  partner  were  one  of  57  couples  to  get  same-sex  marriage  licenses  in  Ingham  County,  according  to  county  clerk  Barb  Byrum.Byrum,  a  Democrat  elected  to  the  county  clerk  post,  said  that  she  personally  performed  30  ceremonies  in  Mason."Today  was  an  awesome  day,"  Byrum  tweeted.Not  all  county  clerks  followed  suit  by  taking  the  abnormal  step  of  opening  up  their  offices  on  a  weekend.  But  there  were  a  few  others,  such  as  in  Oakland  County,  according  to  CNN  affiliate  WDIV.There,  in  Pontiac,  Frank  Colasonti  and  James  Ryder  arrived  early  for  the  chance  to  marry  after  26  years  together.Colasonti  told  WDIV  that  "we  wanted  to  get  married  as  soon  as  possible"  in  the  wake  of  the  court  ruling  issued  late  Friday  afternoon.  Their  motivation  was  simple:  "We  love  each  other,  and  we  want  to  make  sure  that  we  protect  each  other."As  to  being  among  the  first  gay  couples  married  in  Michigan,  Colasonti  said,  "It's  historic,  and  we're  glad  we're  a  part  of  it.  And  we  are  just  happy."There's  a  chance  that  their  marriage  could  be  among  the  last,  too.Michigan  Attorney  General  Bill  Schuette,  a  Republican  whose  term  expires  later  this  year,  announced  on  Friday  evening  he'd  filed  an  emergency  request  for  U.S.  District  Judge  Bernard  Friedman's  order  to  be  stayed  and  appealed."In  2004,  the  citizens  of  Michigan  recognized  that  diversity  in  parenting  is  best  for  kids  and  families  because  moms  and  dads  are  not  interchangeable,"  Schuette  said.  "Michigan  voters  enshrined  that  decision  in  our  state  constitution,  and  their  will  should  stand  and  be  respected."The  U.S.  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Sixth  Circuit  issued  an  order  Saturday  to  temporarily  stay  through  at  least  Wednesday  the  decision  by  Friedman.  In  its  brief  order,  the  court  explained  that  it  did  so  "to  allow  a  more  reasoned  consideration  of  the  motion  to  stay."Earlier,  the  same  court  had  said  that  those  opposed  to  Schuette's  request  have  until  noon  Tuesday  to  respond.It's  not  immediately  clear  what  will  happen,  then,  with  the  same-sex  marriages  that  took  place  earlier  Saturday.Watson  said  she  isn't  surprised  by  the  stay  and  is  bracing  for  the  idea  she  and  Sherman  won't  immediately  have  full  benefits  available  to  them  in  Michigan  --  though  she  expects  that,  at  least,  they'll  now  have  federal  benefits  available  to  marriage  same-sex  couples."It  is  what  we  expected,"  Watson  said.  "We  know  that  we  are  on  the  right  side  of  history."In  fact,  Friedman's  ruling  was  the  latest  in  a  series  of  recent  district  judge  decisions  --  which  have  also  affected  Texas,  Virginia,  Kentucky,  Oklahoma  and  Utah  --  striking  down  state  laws  restricting  marriage  to  one  man  and  one  woman.  Judges  later  issued  stays  of  those  decisions  until  higher  courts  weigh  in.Carl  Tobias,  a  professor  at  the  University  of  Richmond's  law  school,  explained  that  appellate  judges  must  weigh  in  on  all  these  cases.  The  Supreme  Court  likely  won't  add  its  input  until  its  next  term,  which  starts  in  October.  Still,  the  trend  in  the  courts  --  which  also  happens  to  mirror  that  in  public  opinion  polls  --  so  far  is  clear."It's  all  in  one  direction  right  now,"  Tobias  said.Regardless  of  the  fact  her  situation  is  in  limbo,  Watson  and  her  partner  are  celebrating,  nonetheless.  They  have  family  members  expressing  joy  and  solidarity  along  with  them,  such  as  a  brother-in-law  who  noted  the  two  are  finally  "acting  out  what's  been  in  place  for  years."But  most  importantly,  they  have  their  16-year-old  daughter  to  savor  the  moment  with  --  who  they  were  able  to  jointly  adopt  years  ago  in  Georgia  and  who  was  at  her  parents'  wedding  ceremony  in  Mason."She's  excited  about  it,"  Watson  said.CNN's  Bill  Mears  contributed  to  this  report</TEXT></DOC>

What  if  you  liked  downloading  music  from,  say,  Last.fm  or  Soundcloud,  but  those  sites  suddenly  became  infinitely  slower  than  bigger  sites  like  Amazon  or  iTunes?Those  are  the  kind  of  major  changes  to  the  Internet  some  folks  are  envisioning  after  a  federal  court  ruling  this  week  on  what's  come  to  be  called  "net  neutrality."This  stuff  can  get  really  confusing,  with  all  the  government  jargon,  Internet  lingo  and  competing  arguments  mixed  up  in  it.But  it's  also  really  important  and  could  rework  the  Web  as  we  know  it  --  like  allowing  the  hypothetical  situations  above  become  realities.Here's  a  breakdown  of  what  this  week's  ruling  could  mean  to  you.What  is  "net  neutrality?"Generally  speaking,  when  folks  talk  about  neutrality,  they're  referring  to  the  ideas  that  led  to  a  set  of  rules  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  approved  in  2010.  The  point  of  the  rules  was  to  keep  the  companies  that  hold  the  keys  to  the  Web  from  playing  favorites.The  "open  Internet"  rules  prevent  Internet  service  providers  from  blocking  or  "unreasonably  discriminating"  against  any  legal  website  or  other  piece  of  online  content.The  philosophy  behind  it  all,  preached  vociferously  by  Web  activists,  is  that,  in  2014,  Internet  access  is  a  human  right.  Denying  access,  even  in  part,  or  giving  preferential  treatment  to  one  user  over  another,  violates  that  right,  they  say.(The  term  itself  was  coined  by  Columbia  law  professor  Tim  Wu.)What  happened  this  week?A  federal  appeals  court  ruled  on  Tuesday  that  the  FCC  doesn't  have  the  right  to  enforce  those  rules.  The  court  said  that  the  government  is  tasked  with  overseeing  crucial  utilities  like  telephone  service  and  electricity,  but  that  the  Internet  isn't  considered  to  be  one  of  those  utilities  under  current  law.The  decision  harks  back  to  statements  and  decisions  made  by  the  FCC  and  other  government  agencies  in  the  early  2000s,  when  molasses-slow  dial-up  connections  were  the  norm  and  Web  access  wasn't  nearly  as  common  or,  some  would  say,  necessary  as  it  is  today.The  FCC  has  suggested  it  will  appeal  the  ruling.So  what?Everybody  who  accesses  the  Internet  does  so  through  an  Internet  service  provider.  And  these  providers  have  been  pushing  for  the  ability  to  dole  out  that  access  to  us  on  their  own  terms.What  does  that  mean?  For  one,  companies  like  Verizon,  who  sued  the  FCC  over  the  rules,  would  be  able  to  pick  and  choose  who  gets  the  best  access.So,  for  example,  they  might  start  charging  big  fees  for  websites  to  get  in  the  "fast  lane."  Those  fees  presumably  would  be  no  problem  for  the  Web's  monster  moneymakers  but  tougher  to  take  for  the  little  guys.Then,  all  of  a  sudden,  you're  starting  to  get  two  Internets  --  a  quick,  smooth  highway  for  the  major  players  and  a  slow,  bumpy  trail  for  everybody  else.The  providers  could  also  just  blatantly  play  favorites.  So  imagine  AT&T,  a  major  provider,  making  traffic  quicker  on  the  websites  of  smartphone  companies  that  use  its  mobile  service  and  slower  on  the  sites  of  phone  makers  who  don't.  We're  not  saying  they'd  do  that,  of  course.  But,  theoretically,  they  could.Has  this  ever  actually  happened?In  2007,  Comcast  started  blocking  some  peer-to-peer  networks  --  the  kind  customers  use  to  transfer  data-heavy  files  like  entire  movies  and  the  like.The  FCC  ordered  them  to  stop.  Comcast  sued  the  FCC.  An  appeals  court  ultimately  sided  with  the  FCC,  but  by  that  time,  the  backlash  had  been  enough  for  Comcast  to  quit  on  its  own  (after  paying  $16  million  to  settle  a  lawsuit,  that  is).For  what  its  worth,  the  Web's  major  service  providers  put  out  statements  Tuesday  saying  they  don't  have  plans  to  change  anything  based  on  the  court's  decision.  Of  course,  it  would  probably  be  bad  business  to  make  a  multimillion-dollar  move  before  the  case  has  played  itself  all  the  way  out  to  the  Supreme  Court,  which  is  where  this  one  might  ultimately  be  decided.What's  the  argument  against  the  rules?The  service  providers  and  their  supporters  essentially  say  this  is  a  free-enterprise  issue.  They  say  they  provide  a  service  and,  therefore,  should  be  able  to  decide  how  to  deliver  it  and  how  they  charge  customers  for  it.When  the  FCC  approved  net  neutrality  on  a  3-2  party-line  vote,  Commissioner  Robert  McDowell,  one  of  two  Republicans  who  opposed  it,  called  the  vote  a  "radical  step.""Nothing  is  broken  in  the  Internet-access  market  that  needs  fixing,"  he  said  at  the  time.Randal  Milch,  a  Verizon  executive  vice  president,  said  in  a  statement  that  Tuesday's  ruling  "struck  down  rules  that  limited  the  ability  of  broadband  providers  to  offer  new  and  innovative  services  to  their  customers."Bottom  line  --  could  it  cost  me  money?It's  possible.If  providers  start  charging  a  premium  to  websites  for  services,  you  can  bet  those  sites  will  turn  around  and  pass  the  cost  on  to  their  customers.Netflix,  whose  movie  streaming  is  one  of  the  Internet's  biggest  bandwidth  hogs,  already  took  a  ding  to  its  stock  price  after  the  court  ruled.  The  presumption  by  some  investors  was  that  providers  are  most  likely  to  charge  more  to  sites  like  Netflix  that  use  so  much  data.For  fee-based  services  like  Netflix,  it's  hard  to  imagine  monthly  fees  not  increasing  if  their  cost  of  doing  business  increases.  And  while  it's  obviously  all  still  speculation,  it's  possible  that  currently  free  services  like  Google-owned  YouTube  --  which  already  offers  paid  subscriptions  --  could  adopt  adopt  more  pay  models  to  make  up  the  difference.What's  next?The  ruling  wasn't  a  complete  blasting  of  the  FCC's  position.  In  fact,  it  said  the  body  still  has  the  right  to  make  rules  for  the  Web,  so  the  commission  could  possibly  try  again  with  a  new  set  of  rules.Congress  could  settle  the  issue  once  and  for  all  with  a  new,  clearly  worded  law.  And  there's  always  the  Supreme  Court  if  the  FCC  does,  in  fact,  decide  to  appeal.</TEXT></DOC>

Whitaker  is  an  ASU  Foundation  professor  of  history  and  founding  director  of  the  Center  for  the  Study  of  Race  and  Democracy  at  Arizona  State  University.  He  is  the  author  of  "Peace  Be  Still:  Modern  Black  America  From  World  War  II  to  Barack  Obama."  He  can  be  followed  on  Twitter  at  @Dr_Whitaker.(CNN)  --  Arizona  set  itself  up  for  yet  another  self-inflicted  political  wound,  international  humiliation,  costly  boycotts  and  historical  shame  now  that  its  legislature  has  passed  a  bill  giving  people  the  right  to  discriminate.The  bill  was  written  by  the  Center  for  Arizona  Policy  and  a  Christian  legal  organization  called  the  Alliance  Defending  Freedom.  They  were  inspired,  in  part,  by  the  case  of  a  New  Mexico  wedding  photographer  who  was  taken  to  court  after  refusing  to  shoot  a  gay  commitment  ceremony.  The  bill  seeks  to  shield  Christians  from  members  of  the  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual  and  transgender  community  who  dare  to  seek  equal  protection  under  the  law.Specifically,  the  bill  protects  all  individuals,  businesses  and  religious  institutions  from  discrimination  lawsuits  if  they  can  show  that  their  discriminatory  actions  were  motivated  by  religious  convictions.Under  the  guise  of  religious  freedom,  however,  the  bill  would  enable  businesses  potentially  to  discriminate  against  virtually  anyone  --  not  just  Jews,  Muslims,  Sikhs,  agnostics  and  atheists,  but  also  unwed  mothers,  Rastafarians  and  Budweiser  T-shirt  wearers.  This  bill  is  arbitrary,  capricious  and  antithetical  to  the  spirit  of  brotherhood  and  sisterhood  that  inform  our  documents  of  freedom.It  will  lead  to  marginalization  and  oppression  by  allowing  bigots  to  deny  gay  people  access  to  virtually  any  business  or  service.  The  road  to  Indian  genocide,  Jim  Crow,  Japanese-American  internment,  the  Holocaust  and  other  iterations  of  human  persecution  began  with  laws  that  isolated  and  dehumanized  entire  groups  of  people.Arizona's  race  relations  and  cultural  politics  are  often  misunderstood  by  the  rest  of  the  country.  Racial  diversity  and  progressivism  exist  within  the  predominantly  white  and  conservative  power  structure  of  the  Grand  Canyon  State.  This  has  created  an  interesting  dynamic.Arizona  has  sometimes  made  racial  and  cultural  inroads  ahead  of  the  national  curve,  while  fear  of  major  demographic  shifts,  including  a  growing  LGBTQ  community,  and  the  erosion  of  white  privilege  have  unearthed  racial  stereotyping,  homophobia  and  xenophobic  policies.  Many  outside  the  state  misunderstand  this  dynamic,  assuming  we  are  a  wholly  backward  place  without  understanding  that  it  is  much  more  complicated  than  that.Nevertheless,  Arizona  now  has  the  dubious  designation  as  the  first  state  to  pass  an  anti-gay  bill  that  seeks  to  shun  and  segregate  in  the  name  of  religion.Similar  legislation  has  been  put  forward  in  Idaho,  Mississippi,  Ohio,  Oklahoma,  South  Dakota  and  Tennessee.  The  Arizona  measure  is  the  only  bill  that  has  passed.There  is  a  saying:  "history  doesn't  repeat  itself,  but  it  rhymes."  The  rhythm  of  chauvinism  and  acrimony  in  Arizona  endures.  The  state  long  resisted  creating  a  holiday  honoring  Martin  Luther  King  Jr.,  which  it  finally  did  in  1992.  It  is  not  too  late  to  shift  course,  however.  Gov.  Jan  Brewer  has  the  power  to  put  Arizona  back  on  the  right  side  of  history.  The  "right  to  discriminate"  bill  now  sits  on  her  desk.The  bill  passed  Thursday,  She  has  five  days  to  reject  it  or  sign  it  into  law.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Matthew  C.

"President  Obama  and  I  want  to  make  it  clear  to  Russia  and  to  everybody  in  the  world  that  we  are  not  seeking  confrontation."However,  he  continued,  "if  Russia  does  not  choose  to  de-escalate,  if  it  is  not  willing  to  work  directly  with  the  government  of  Ukraine,  as  we  hope  they  will  be,  then  our  partners  will  have  absolutely  no  choice  but  to  join  us  to  continue  to  expand  upon  steps  we  have  taken  in  recent  days  in  order  to  isolate  Russia  politically,  diplomatically  and  economically."What  are  U.S.  options?One  possible  move,  hinted  at  by  Kerry,  would  be  to  kick  Russia  out  of  the  G8  group  of  industrial  powers  that  also  includes  the  United  States,  Britain,  France,  Germany,  Italy,  Japan  and  Canada.  Those  nations  already  are  skipping  a  preparatory  meeting  for  the  next  G8  summit  set  to  be  hosted  by  Putin  in  June  in  Sochi."It  is  not  appropriate  to  invade  a  country  and,  at  the  end  of  a  barrel  of  a  gun,  dictate  what  you  are  trying  to  achieve,"  Kerry  said.  "That  is  not  21st  century  G8,  major  nation  behavior."The  United  States  "will  stand  by  the  Ukrainian  people,"  he  said  after  accusing  Russia  of  making  up  reasons  for  further  military  intervention  in  Ukraine  based  on  alleged  persecution  of  Russian  speakers  and  native  Russians."Not  a  single  piece  of  credible  evidence  supports  any  one  of  these  claims,"  he  said,  adding  that  it  was  clear  "that  Russia  has  been  working  hard  to  create  a  pretext  to  invade  further."Told  by  a  reporter  that  Putin  had  earlier  indicated  no  Russian  troops  were  in  Crimea,  Kerry  shook  his  head  with  disbelief  and  asked:  "He  really  denied  there  were  troops  in  Crimea?"Putin  decision  near?A  U.S.  official  familiar  with  the  latest  administration  assessment  said  Tuesday  that  national  security  agencies  believe  Putin  will  decide  in  the  next  few  days  whether  to  send  more  troops  into  Ukraine.  According  to  the  official,  the  diplomatic  pressure  by  Obama  and  Kerry  sought  to  influence  Putin's  decision.In  remarks  Tuesday,  Obama  said  Putin  realized  that  the  United  States  and  its  European  allies  consider  the  Russian  military  buildup  in  Ukraine  a  violation  of  international  law."There  have  been  some  reports  that  President  Putin  is  pausing  for  a  moment  and  reflecting  on  what's  happened,"  Obama  said."I  know  President  Putin  seems  to  have  a  different  set  of  lawyers  making  a  different  set  of  interpretations  but  I  don't  think  that's  fooling  anybody,"  Obama  continued.  "I  think  everybody  recognizes  that  although  Russia  has  legitimate  interests  in  what  happens  in  a  neighboring  state,  that  does  not  give  it  the  right  to  use  force  as  a  means  of  exerting  influence  inside  of  that  state."U.S.  moving  fast  on  possible  sanctionsIn  another  sign  of  increasing  pressure  on  Putin,  a  Chinese  government  statement  Tuesday  quoted  President  Xi  Jinping  as  calling  for  a  diplomatic  solution."The  situation  is  highly  complicated  and  sensitive,  affecting  both  regional  and  entire  global  situations,"  said  the  statement  attributed  to  Xi.  "I  believe  Russia  can  coordinate  with  all  sides,  use  political  means  to  resolve  the  issue,  and  maintain  peace  and  stability  for  the  region  and  the  world.  China  supports  conciliatory  measures  from  the  international  community  that  help  mitigate  the  situation."Critics  want  a  more  robust  U.S.  responseNo  one  calls  for  a  U.S.  military  response  in  Ukraine,  and  polls  show  strong  public  opposition  to  the  United  States  assuming  the  role  of  global  policeman  by  taking  the  lead  in  international  conflicts.During  his  presidency,  Obama  has  sought  a  more  international  approach  to  crises,  as  exemplified  by  the  NATO  coalition  that  imposed  a  "no-fly"  zone  on  Libya  with  logistical  help  from  the  United  States.However,  his  inability  to  build  an  international  coalition  to  attack  Syria  for  its  use  of  chemical  weapons  resulted  in  criticism  that  Obama  failed  to  fulfill  his  earlier  threat  to  act.Hawkish  U.S.  politicians  want  a  more  robust  response  by  the  Obama  administration  to  the  Russian  aggression,  calling  for  tough  economic  sanctions  and  reviving  plans  to  build  a  missile-defense  shield  in  Poland  that  Putin  opposed.Republican  Rep.  Ed  Royce  of  California,  the  chairman  of  the  House  Foreign  Affairs  Committee,  called  for  pursuing  aggressive  sanctions  that  would  undermine  the  ruble  and  Russia's  state-owned  banks."We  should  do  it,  frankly,"  he  told  CNN,  but  adding  that  Russia  should  be  offered  an  "exit  ramp"  out  of  the  crisis  through  negotiations.Jim  Walsh,  an  international  security  analyst  with  the  MIT  Security  Studies  Program,  told  CNN  that  any  sanctions  must  be  in  concert  with  European  allies  to  be  effective.  So  far,  Walsh  noted,  there  has  been  little  sign  of  support  from  key  allies  Britain  and  Germany  for  tough  economic  sanctions  against  Russia.Meanwhile,  House  Speaker  John  Boehner  called  for  Obama  to  speed  up  government  approval  of  U.S.  natural  gas  exports  to  the  Ukraine."We  should  not  force  our  allies  to  remain  dependent  on  Putin  for  their  energy  needs,"  Boehner  said,  describing  the  current  approval  process  as  a  "de  facto  ban.""Expediting  approval  of  natural  gas  exports  is  one  clear  step  the  U.S.  can  take  to  stand  by  our  allies  and  stand  up  to  Russian  aggression,  while  creating  American  jobs  at  the  same  time,"  he  said.Putin:  Russia  has  no  plans  to  annex  CrimeaTo  Obama  and  his  supporters  pursuing  what  they  consider  to  be  a  21st  Century  world  order,  the  Russian  military  moves  would  arouse  the  suspicions  of  other  countries  in  the  region."If  anything,  it  will  push  many  countries  further  away  from  Russia,"  Obama  said.  "There  is  the  ability  for  Ukraine  to  be  a  friend  of  the  West  and  a  friend  of  Russia's  as  long  as  none  of  us  are  in  Ukraine  trying  to  meddle  and  intervene,  certainly  not  militarily,  with  decisions  that  properly  belong  to  the  Ukrainian  people."Loan  guaranteesThe  loan  guarantees  announced  Tuesday  will  help  Ukraine  move  forward  with  an  assistance  package  from  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  which  is  calling  for  the  country  to  raise  energy  prices.Obama  administration  officials  traveling  with  Kerry  said  Treasury  Department  technical  advisers  would  travel  to  Ukraine  to  help  its  national  bank  and  finance  ministry  deal  with  economic  challenges  and  implement  energy  sector  reforms.The  United  States  also  will  train  observers  for  the  May  25  elections,  and  is  sending  a  team  of  experts  to  help  identify  stolen  assets  and  support  anti-corruption  measures.With  Ukraine  looking  to  reduce  dependence  on  Russian  energy,  the  United  States  also  will  provide  assistance  and  financing  to  help  businesses  find  new  export  markets  and  will  offer  technical  advice  to  the  government  on  Ukraine's  World  Trade  Organization  rights  with  respect  to  Russia.Obama  and  Kerry  both  urged  Russia  to  pull  its  forces  back  into  their  barracks  and  agree  to  international  observers  in  Ukraine  to  monitor  the  situation.The  Organization  for  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe,  a  regional  security  bloc,  sent  in  10  monitors  Monday,  and  Kerry  called  for  a  larger  mission."These  are  the  people  who  could  actually  identify  legitimate  threats,  and  we  are  asking,  together  with  the  government  of  Ukraine,  together  with  the  European  community,  for  large  numbers  of  observers  to  be  able  to  come  in  here  and  monitor  the  situation  and  be  the  arbiters  of  truth  versus  fiction,"  he  said,  alluding  to  the  Russian  claims  of  persecution.CNN  Foreign  Affairs  Reporter  Elise  Labott  reported  from  Kiev  and  Tom  Cohen  from  Washington,  and  CNN's  Paul  Steinhauser  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

So  we  assembled  a  panel  to  do  just  that.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Generalized  anxiety  disorder  is  the  single  most  common  mental  health  diagnosis,  and  yet  it's  still  taboo  to  talk  about  it.  I  recently  went  public  with  a  very  personal  essay  about  my  battle  with  it,  and  in  doing  so,  realized  an  awful  lot  of  people  have  been  aching  for  a  chance  to  talk  about  their  struggles.After  comments  poured  in  through  CNN.com,  e-mails,  Facebook,  Twitter  and  other  channels,  CNN  Living  hosted  a  live  Google  Hangout  to  address  some  of  the  issues.  Scott  Stossel,  author  of  "My  Age  of  Anxiety:  Fear,  Hope,  Dread,  and  the  Search  for  Peace  of  Mind";  Daniel  Smith,  author  of  "Monkey  Mind:  A  Memoir  of  Anxiety";  and  psychiatrists  Dawn  M.  Porter  and  Scott  Krakower  joined  me  for  a  robust,  hourlong  video  chat  about  treatment,  taboos,  triggers  and  the  breaking  of  bad  habits.Here  are  10  things  we  learned  from  that  conversation:Military  families  may  be  especially  susceptible  to  anxietyPorter  is  a  military  spouse  and  treats  people  in  the  community.  She  says  that  anxiety  --  and  stressors  --  are  present  and  constant."There  are  a  lot  of  issues  that  our  families  go  through  with  every  transition,"  she  said.  "You're  moving  every  two  to  four  years,  depending  on  what  your  service  member's  responsibilities  are.  The  service  member  has  to  settle  into  a  new  position  and  figure  his  or  her  way  out;  the  spouse  or  partner  also  has  to  navigate  a  new  environment  and  connect  with  a  new  community.  If  there  are  children  involved,  they  have  to  get  settled  into  a  new  school."The  general  public  isn't  aware  of  such  adjustments,  Porter  said,  making  it  difficult  for  military  families  to  assimilate  into  life  outside  a  base.  "They  don't  get  that  our  children  are  struggling,  and  their  children  don't  pick  up  on  it.  They  have  their  stability  and  structure  and  don't  bring  the  military  families  in  --  which  makes  it  even  more  difficult."She  said  she  believes  her  own  experiences  help  make  her  a  more  effective  therapist  for  military  families.Physical  symptoms  are  par  for  the  course,  but  they'll  passA  viewer  wrote  in,  describing  "feeling  like  I  am  going  to  faint,  my  heart  will  race  and  I  get  hot.  I  went  to  the  doctor  and  they  ran  blood  tests.  Now  they  are  sending  me  to  a  cardiologist.  After  looking  up  my  symptoms  it  kind  of  sounds  like  anxiety  but  I  am  not  sure.  Since  I  ...  went  to  the  doctor  I  keep  feeling  this  tight  pressure  in  my  chest  and  I  keep  crying  for  no  reason.  Does  this  sound  familiar?﻿"Members  of  the  panel  all  shook  their  heads  emphatically.  "That's  the  remarkable  thing  about  anxiety:  It's  so  embodied,  such  a  physical  experience,"  said  Smith,  who  has  undergone  botox  injections  to  counter  excess  sweating.Stossel,  whose  memoir  vividly  detailed  gastric  symptoms  he's  suffers,  said,  "My  physiology  has  commandeered  my  sympathetic  nervous  system."I  also  fight  a  rapidly  beating  pulse,  twitching  muscles  and  deeply  painful  acid  reflux.  These  symptoms  are  no  picnic  --  and  sufferers  and  ER  doctors  often  mistake  them  for  a  heart  attack  --  but  they're  not  fatal.Living  with  anxiety,  searching  for  joyAnxiety  begets  more  anxietyKrakower  noted  even  seeing  a  specialist  to  deal  with  treatment  can  cause  more  stress.  "We  can't  rule  out  a  medical  problem,  but  that,  in  turn,  can  feed  the  anxiety."That  response  is  "definitive  of  anxiety,"  Smith  said.  "You're  anxious  about  something,  which  leads  you  to  focus  more  attention  on  the  feeling  --  which  leads  you  to  be  more  anxious.  Before  you  can  snap  your  fingers,  you're  on  that  merry-go-round,  which  once  it  starts,  can  be  inordinately  difficult  to  jump  off  of."Stossel  agreed  the  cycle  is  hard  to  break.  "I  know  a  lot  about  the  neuromechanics  and  the  physiology  of  panic,"  he  said.  "I  feel  myself  having  anxious  thoughts  and  I'll  tell  myself,  'You've  been  through  this  a  million  times,  and  this  is  probably  a  panic  attack.'  More  often  than  not  I  can  tell  myself  that  it's  just  a  panic  attack  ...  but  every  once  in  a  while,  I'll  think,  'But  this  feels  slightly  different  than  the  previous  782  times.  Maybe  I  am  having  a  heart  attack!'  "Medications  aren't  one  size  fits  allPeople  may  not  be  able  to  benefit  from  talk  therapy  if  they're  in  a  state  of  panic.  "If  the  level  of  anxiety  is  very  high,  it  may  be  necessary  to  bring  that  down  so  they  can  use  some  relaxing  techniques,"  Porter  said.Stossel  started  his  journey  with  medication  at  age  11  or  12,  using  Thorazine  in  the  1980s.  He's  studied  all  sides  of  the  argument,  from  those  who  feel  a  "rapacious"  pharmaceutical  industry  makes  issues  worse  and  prefer  a  med-free  treatment,  to  physicians  who  believe  that  drug  therapy  should  be  the  first  recourse.  His  view  falls  somewhere  in  the  middle."Medication  can  be  part  of  a  psychotropic  arsenal,"  he  said,  discussing  one  therapist  who  urged  him  to  stop  taking  Xanax  so  he  could  address  his  anxiety  directly  and  not  mask  the  physical  symptoms.But  a  psychopharmacologist  felt  his  physical  symptoms  were  so  extreme  that  unless  he  tamped  those  down,  he  couldn't  benefit  from  other  coping  techniques,  according  to  Stossel."Some  drugs  have  worked  some  of  the  time,"  Stossel  said.  "I  couldn't  have  gotten  through  my  book  tour  without  benzodiazepines,  but  there  are  reasons  to  be  wary  of  dependence,  abuse  and  masking  the  symptoms  but  not  treating  the  underlying  source  of  the  anxiety."Here's  what  to  do  about  your  anxietyYounger  people  may  feel  less  stigma  about  mental  health  than  their  parents"There's  more  publicity  about  anxiety,"  Krakower  said,  "and  it's  becoming  more  acceptable  in  the  community."But  there  are  certain  things  to  consider  when  dealing  with  children  and  adolescents,  these  experts  said."You  first  have  to  work  at  trying  to  engage  them.  If  they're  not  on  board,  it's  not  going  to  work,"  he  said.Krakower,  a  child  and  adolescent  psychiatrist,  uses  a  two-pronged  approach  of  cognitive  behavioral  therapy  and  gradual  medication  if  needed.  He  said  he  pays  close  attention  to  which  treatment  is  working  best  and  tries  to  make  younger  patients  feel  comfortable  with  the  process.He  also  said  some  youths  self-medicate  by  smoking  pot,  but  the  temporary  relief  often  results  in  a  loss  of  motivation  at  school.Porter  agreed  that  it's  important  to  relate  to  children  and  teens.  "They're  very  perceptive  about  if  you're  really  interested  in  helping  them."  She  said  she  also  tends  to  steer  clear  of  certain  groups  of  medications  with  that  age  group,  so  these  drugs  don't  become  a  crutch  in  the  midst  of  change,  or  trigger  suicidal  impulses.She  also  cautioned  parents  against  overloading  children  with  too  many  activities,  expectations  and  pressures.  "They  have  no  downtime  to  be  themselves.  How  do  we  balance  their  lives?"Cultural  taboos  can  get  in  the  way  of  people  seeking  help"Especially  in  the  African-American  community,  there  are  a  lot  of  issues  that  we  face,"  Porter  said.  "There's  always  the  stigma,  there's  always  the  feeling  that  you  have  to  be  twice  as  good  to  get  half  as  much.  Because  of  this,  there's  always  a  fear  that  anything  someone  finds  out  about  you  will  be  used  against  you.  We're  also  a  strong  community,  based  in  our  religion.  With  that,  there's  a  feeling  that  if  you  have  an  issue,  you  need  to  take  it  to  God."As  a  Christian,  she  said,  she  leans  into  her  faith  --  but  she  also  believes  it's  God  who  brings  people  to  a  psychiatrist  and  provides  the  medication  that  helps  people  to  do  better  or  feel  better.  Porter  said  pastors,  community  groups  and  even  celebrities  are  normalizing  the  notion  of  seeking  help  and  encouraging  people  to  share  their  own  stories.National  Depression  Screening  Day:  Sharing  experiences  can  helpAnxiety  can  be  the  enemy  of  romanceIn  Smith's  research  for  "Monkey  Mind,"  he  saw  a  pattern  emerge  when  it  came  to  love.  "When  you're  anxious,  you  tend  to  scan  around  for  what  may  be  causing  it.  And  often  you  alight  upon  that  person  who  is  right  next  to  you."In  addition  to  assuming  a  relationship  is  the  root  of  a  problem,  he  noted  some  people  often  experience  shame  that  their  partners  will  see  them  as  weak.In  his  own  life,  Smith  pushed  away  a  partner,  and  then  in  midst  of  the  resulting  sadness,  felt  he  needed  her  and  pulled  her  back.  "That  speaks  to  the  whole  stigma,"  he  said,  "the  whole  worry  that  if  someone  knows  you  are  suffering  from  anxiety,  they  will  consider  you  to  be  somehow  less."Can  anxiety  kill  your  ability  to  love?Gender  expectations  take  a  tollWriter  Stossel  was  struck  by  the  extra  burden  many  men  face  when  it  comes  to  anxiety.  "There's  a  stigma  around  vulnerability,"  he  said."Women  have  higher  rates  of  diagnosis  of  anxiety  disorder  than  men  do,"  Stossel  said.  "That  could  be  for  temperamental  reasons  or  for  social  reasons  --  because  of  glass  ceilings  or  extra  pressures.  It  could  also  be  because  it's  more  acceptable  for  women  to  seek  out  treatment  and  accept  a  diagnosis.  Whereas  men  have  higher  rates  of  alcoholism,  and  it  may  be  that  we're  all  just  trying  to  sublimate  and  are  afraid  to  seek  help."Krakower  said  he  believes  it's  important,  when  working  with  young,  male  patients,  to  understand  they  may  feel  more  stigmatized  by  school  and  friends  than  their  female  peers.  "It's  important  to  make  them  feel  accepted  in  the  individual  therapy  sessions  and  then  teach  them  more  ways  to  control  their  anxiety."  These  may  include  learning  relaxation  techniques,  or  how  to  be  more  assertive  and  not  feel  so  nervous.Anxiety  doesn't  have  to  define  you,  so  make  peace  with  itSmith  was  diagnosed  in  college  --  by  his  mother,  a  therapist  who  specializes  in  anxiety  --  and  he  called  the  diagnosis  a  doubled-edged  sword.  "It's  helpful  to  name  something,  but  at  the  same  time  makes  you  feel  trapped  in  that  particular  diagnosis,"  he  said."It's  important  not  just  to  think  of  it  as  a  disorder  or  a  mental  construct,  but  as  an  emotion  --  a  universally  held  and  rather  important  emotion.  We  need  anxiety,  and  if  we  didn't  have  it,  we'd  be  hit  by  cars  far  more  frequently,"  Smith  said.  "You  don't  necessarily  want  to  banish  your  anxiety;  you  want  it  to  be  there  to  some  extent  but  not  rule  your  life."Stossel,  now  44,  spent  the  first  43  years  of  his  life  trying  to  hide  his  condition  --  before  penning  a  wildly  popular  and  public  memoir  about  it.  "There  are  times  when  the  level  of  suffering  (is)  so  high,  not  to  treat  it  as  an  illness  ...  is  unfair  and  almost  handicapping  the  therapist's  ability  to  treat  it.  Even  then,  I've  had  to  come  to  terms  with  thinking  of  this  as  woven  into  my  personality  and  part  of  my  temperament,  but  not  what  completely  defines  who  I  am."Anxiety,  you're  not  the  boss  of  meIt  might  not  feel  like  it  in  the  thick  of  things,  but  it's  possible  to  fight  backPorter  starts  by  asking  her  patients  to  make  a  list  of  what  relaxes  them  and  what  activities  they  enjoy.  These  might  include  exercising,  taking  a  walk  around  the  block,  deep  breathing,  talking  to  family  members  or  listening  to  music.  When  in  the  throes  of  a  panic  attack,  they  will  have  some  solutions  at  the  ready  and  can  pick  out  which  are  the  most  effective  in  the  moment.Smith  has  found  cognitive  behavioral  therapy  effective  in  changing  some  of  his  patterns  and  also  seeks  peace  through  Buddhist  meditation,  and  in  particular  Zen.  Both  methods  focus  on  mindfulness  and  paying  attention  to  thoughts  that  trigger  anxiety."The  one  thing  you're  not  doing  when  you're  anxious  is  existing  in  the  present  moment,"  Smith  said.Stossel  recalled  that  when  an  excerpt  of  "My  Age  of  Anxiety"  ran  in  The  Atlantic,  strangers  inundated  him  with  advice  to  cut  out  gluten,  sugar  and  caffeine,  eat  more  fish  oil  and  magnesium,  try  massages  or  yoga  and  smoke  pot.  But  the  things  that  sound  the  most  banal  are  the  most  effective,  he  said."They're  the  things  that  your  internist  and  your  mother  and  your  grandmother  told  you,"  he  said.  "Get  enough  sleep.  It's  good  for  you  physically;  it  reduces  depression  and  anxiety."  He  also  swears  by  exercise,  breathing  techniques  and  cognitive  behavioral  therapy."So  many  of  us  with  generalized  anxiety  disorder  are  gifted  catastrophizers  and  worry  that  any  decision  we  make  or  anything  we  enter  into  is  going  to  be  absolutely  catastrophic  and  existentially  damaging,"  Stossel  said."But  if  you  actually  think  it  through  and  imagine  the  worst  thing  that  could  happen,  well,  did  anybody  die?  Is  it  really  that  bad?  Then  use  that  to  try  to  calm  yourself."Do  you  deal  with  anxiety?  How  do  you  try  to  fight  it?  Let  us  know  in  the  comments  below.</TEXT></DOC>

"His  time  to  take  the  load  off.  He  usually  listened  to  music  or  talked  on  the  phone.  It  was  a  few  minutes  of  calmness."That  peace  was  shattered  Thursday  evening  as  Rojas  shuttled  between  jobs,  hoping  to  make  a  quick  stop  at  home  to  see  his  wife  and  two  children.  It  was  his  final  bus  trip.A  young  man  boarded  the  bus,  police  said.  In  the  rear,  a  14-year-old  boy  police  described  as  a  member  of  a  street  gang  called  the  Stack  Money  Goons  allegedly  spotted  a  member  of  a  rival  gang  and  pulled  out  a  .357-caliber  revolver.Shots  were  fired,  the  bullets  missing  the  intended  target,  police  said.Rojas,  39,  was  hit  in  the  head  and  declared  dead  later  at  a  hospital  near  where  his  bus  trip  began."Pretty  big  gun  for  a  pretty  small  man,"  Police  Commissioner  William  Bratton  said  of  the  suspected  gunman.On  Friday,  Kathon  Anderson  was  charged  with  second-degree  murder  and  criminal  possession  of  a  weapon,  according  to  the  Brooklyn  district  attorney's  office.  He  is  to  be  tried  as  an  adult."Just  as  everyone  in  New  York  probably  feels  terrible  about  it,  we  feel  terrible  about  it  too,"  Anderson's  lawyer,  Frederic  Pratt,  told  reporters,  according  to  CNN  affiliate  WCBS.  "I'm  just  going  to  ask  everyone  not  to  rush  to  judgment."Anderson  allegedly  belonged  to  Stack  Money  Goons  and  targeted  a  rival  from  another  group  known  as  TWAN  Family,  police  said."The  stupidity  of  those  gangs  that  basically,  over  nothing,  are  trying  to  kill  each  other  and,  unfortunately,  in  the  process,  kill  innocents  as  they  did  with  this  hard  working  young  man  trying  to  raise  his  family,"  Bratton  said.  "A  life  needlessly  lost,  taken  by  a  14-year-old  who  felt  it  necessary  to  carry  a  gun  on  a  city  bus  and  shoot  it."On  Saturday,  Rojas'  wife  was  raising  money  for  a  wake  and  to  fly  her  husband's  body  home  to  his  native  Dominican  Republic."He  was  the  sole  provider,"  Guerrero  said.  "She  never  thought  she  would  have  to  bury  her  husband  and  raise  the  children  alone."The  couple  has  two  children:  a  12-year-old  son,  Saury,  and  8-year-old  daughter,  April."Why  he  did  that  to  my  dad?"  Saury  asked,  according  to  WCBS.Guerrero  said,  "He  was  just  sitting  on  a  bus.  He  had  nothing  to  do  with  this."Angel  Rojas  and  his  wife  came  to  New  York  from  the  Dominican  Republic  about  five  years  ago,  Guerrero  said.  She  held  occasional  part-time  jobs;  he  stocked  shelves  at  two  Brooklyn  bodegas."He  was  a  hard  worker  and  a  family  man  devoted  to  giving  his  family  a  better  life,"  Guerrero  said.  "He  was  the  funniest  man  you  would  ever  meet.  Everyone  loved  him.

Read  this  article  in  Spanish(CNN)  --  Dangerous  cold  and  treacherous  driving  conditions  left  millions  of  Americans  along  the  Eastern  Seaboard  stuck  at  home  Wednesday.And,  try  as  we  might,  we  couldn't  get  any  glimmers  of  hope  from  the  CNN  weather  department's  forecast  for  what's  ahead.The  storm  system  that  dumped  record-breaking  piles  of  snow  --  including  18-inch  snowdrifts  in  Plymouth,  Massachusetts  --  is  moving  off  the  coast,  and  remaining  blizzard  warnings  are  expiring.  But  the  freezing  weather  is  going  to  stick  around."Another  clipper  will  reinforce  the  cold  air  already  in  place,  so  any  snow  on  the  ground  is  expected  to  hang  around,"  CNN  meteorologist  Indra  Petersons  said.And  "more  surges  of  cold  Arctic  air  are  on  tap  for  next  week,"  added  CNN  meteorologist  Sean  Morris.  "New  York  stays  well  below  freezing  for  the  foreseeable  future  --  possibly  holding  until  the  end  of  the  month,  though  there's  a  chance  they  could  briefly  rise  above  32  degrees  Saturday  afternoon.  Washington,  D.C.,  isn't  expected  to  rise  above  freezing  until  Saturday  afternoon,  when  it  will  be  a  balmy  37  degrees.  But  there's  more  cold  and  snow  on  the  way  early  next  week."Meanwhile,  in  California,  some  cities  are  tying  records  --  for  heat.  Paso  Robles  reached  75  degrees  Tuesday,  while  Camarillo  reached  84.But  through  the  Midwest,  Southeast  and  Northeast,  temperatures  were  15  to  25  degrees  below  average  Wednesday.Washington's  Dulles  International  Airport  recorded  about  8  inches  of  snow  Tuesday.  New  York's  Central  Park  saw  11  inches.  Bridgeport,  Connecticut,  had  6½.Governors  in  Delaware,  New  Jersey  and  New  York  issued  states  of  emergency.This  blizzard  did  not  follow  a  typical  pattern,  Petersons  said.  The  heaviest  snowfall  was  closer  to  the  coast  rather  than  inland,  even  though  the  system  was  moving  from  west  to  east.  The  storm  system  strengthened  off  the  coast,  picking  up  moisture  from  the  Atlantic  to  bump  up  the  snowfall.Staying  home  and  heading  outRich  Schultz,  father  of  three  in  Fair  Lawn,  New  Jersey,  told  CNN  he  was  spending  the  day  cooking  and  planning  meals  for  the  week,  including  shepherd's  pie  and  tomato,  corn  and  basil  soup.Others  have  been  venturing  out.Nature  photographer  Candice  Trimble  spent  Tuesday  catching  and  photographing  snowflakes  up  close  in  Front  Royal,  Virginia,  she  said  in  a  CNN  iReport.It  was  a  time  for  play  for  some  in  Philadelphia.  With  about  a  foot  of  snow  falling  on  the  city,  the  steps  at  the  Museum  of  Art  became  a  sledding  hill.On  Facebook,  dozens  of  people  told  CNN  about  the  silver  linings  they've  been  finding  in  the  storm.

He  was  given  a  life  sentence.The  corrections  department's  Board  of  Parole  Hearings  granted  parole  for  the  71-year-old  Davis  following  his  28th  parole  suitability  hearing  on  Wednesday.But  the  board's  decision  is  not  the  end  of  the  case.  There's  a  120-day  internal  review  period.  When  that's  done,  Gov.  Jerry  Brown  will  have  30  days  more  to  nullify  or  modify  the  decision  --  meaning  that,  if  everything  goes  his  way,  Davis  could  still  be  looking  at  another  four  months  behind  bars.In  fact,  there's  precedent  for  him  not  to  be  released.  Twice,  Davis  has  gotten  an  initial  victory  only  to  have  his  hopes  of  getting  out  dashed.In  January  2010  and  October  2012,  the  parole  board  granted  him  parole.  In  the  second  case,  the  board  explained  it  made  such  a  recommendation  because  of  Davis'  "positive  adjustment,  record  of  no  recent  disciplinary  problems,  and  for  successfully  completing  academic  and  vocational  education  and  self-help  programs."Both  times,  the  sitting  governors  --  first  Arnold  Schwarzenegger  and  later  Brown  --  reversed  that  decision."When  considered  as  a  whole,  I  find  the  evidence  ...  shows  why  he  currently  poses  a  danger  to  society  if  released  from  prison,"  Brown  wrote  in  2013  to  explain  his  reversal.If  this  time  proves  different,  Davis  would  become  the  first  Manson  "family"  member  to  be  freed  solely  for  good  behavior.The  group's  gruesome  killings  inspired  the  best-selling  book  "Helter  Skelter"  and  made  their  undisputed  ringleader  Manson  a  cult  figure.The  1969  spree  ensnared  several  victims,  including  8-months-pregnant  actress  Sharon  Tate.Manson  is  serving  a  life  sentence  for  his  role  in  nine  murders.  He  was  denied  parole  for  the  12th  time  in  2012;  his  next  such  hearing  is  set  for  2027,  at  which  time  he'd  be  92  years  old.LAPD  hopes  decades-old  tapes  hold  clues  to  Manson  murder  mysteryManson  follower  accused  of  trying  to  smuggle  phone  to  cult  leaderCNN's  Mayra  Cuevas  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

So  she  paid  for  a  $100,000  investigation  that  blew  the  case  wide  open.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>For  more,  watch  "Death  Row  Stories,"  a  CNN  Original  series,  at  9  p.m.  ET/PT  Sunday.  Follow  us  at  facebook.com/cnn  or  Twitter  @CNNorigSeries  using  #DeathRowStories.(CNN)  --  After  almost  17  years  in  prison,  this  was  it:  This  was  The  Moment.Gloria  Killian's  murder  conviction  had  been  overturned.  Carrying  a  small  bag  of  her  belongings,  she  walked  out  of  prison  as  a  free  woman.Only  ex-prisoners  can  fully  know  the  emotions  that  overtake  someone  during  such  a  moment.  It's  a  mix  of  two  feelings:  joy  --  for  surviving  their  ordeal  --  and  fear  about  the  challenges  they  surely  will  face  in  the  outside  world.For  Killian's  friend  Joyce  Ride,  then  in  her  late  70s,  picking  up  Killian  was  also  very  emotional.  "Seeing  her  walk  out  was  a  really  great  joy,"  Ride  told  CNN,  recalling  that  day  in  2002.  "It  was  like  a  load  was  lifted  off  my  shoulders."The  two  women  noticed  a  crowd  of  inmates  and  visitors  had  gathered  to  watch  this  magic  moment.  Suddenly  the  inmates  started  waving  goodbye.The  sendoff  was  sort  of  a  thank-you  note.  "Gloria  was  very  popular,"  Ride  said.  Killian  had  used  her  education  as  a  former  law  student  to  perform  legal  work  for  some  of  the  inmates.Killian  settled  into  Ride's  passenger  seat  and  Ride  steered  toward  the  exit.  "We  did  a  lap  around  the  parking  lot  to  wave  back  at  them,"  said  Ride.Half  an  hour  later,  the  two  friends  enjoyed  a  meal  at  an  Italian  restaurant,  where  Killian  savored  her  first  glass  of  wine  since  1986.  For  someone  sentenced  to  32  years  to  life,  it  was  a  sweet  victory  following  a  hard-fought  journey."I'm  annoyed  by  injustice.  Profoundly  annoyed,"  Ride  said.  "This  was  clearly  an  injustice."Six  suitcases  of  silverIt  all  started  in  1981,  when  Stephen  DeSantis  --  disguised  as  a  phone  repairman  --  entered  the  home  of  elderly  coin  collector  Ed  Davies  and  his  wife,  Grace,  in  suburban  Sacramento,  California.  According  to  the  Ninth  U.S.  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals,  DeSantis  tied  up  the  couple  and  was  joined  inside  the  house  by  his  cousin  Gary  Masse.  Ed  Davies  was  shot  and  killed.  His  wife  was  also  shot,  but  survived.  The  cousins  stole  six  suitcases  of  silver.After  an  anonymous  phone  tip  accused  Masse  and  DeSantis,  police  went  on  the  hunt.  "When  officers  attempted  to  find  Masse,  they  encountered  his  wife,  Joanne,  who  told  the  officers  that  a  woman  named  Gloria  planned  the  robbery,"  appeals  court  documents  said.Killian  was  a  former  law  student  in  her  30s  who'd  never  been  in  trouble  with  the  law.  Masse's  wife  told  police  her  husband  had  met  Killian  through  a  mutual  friend,  according  to  Killian's  book,  "Full  Circle."  Police  questioned  Killian  and  held  her  without  bail  for  about  four  months.She  told  police  she  was  innocent  and  had  never  met  Masse,  and  was  released  for  lack  of  evidence.  Then,  without  warning  a  year  later,  police  locked  Killian  away  again  without  bail.  Masse  had  suddenly  told  authorities  that  Killian  was  the  crime's  mastermind.For  a  time,  the  death  penalty  loomed  over  Killian,  but  in  1983  the  California  Supreme  Court  changed  the  rules  regarding  the  execution  of  accomplices  to  murder.  That  ruling  made  Killian  eligible  for  bail  until  her  trial  began,  more  than  two  years  later.Although  Masse  implicated  Killian  at  the  trial,  his  cousin  DeSantis  had  testified  at  his  separate  trial  that  "Killian  was  not  involved  in  the  crime  in  any  way  and  that  he  had  never  even  met  or  heard  of  Killian,"  according  to  court  documents.But  the  jury  believed  Masse's  story  and  convicted  Killian  on  charges  of  murder,  robbery  and  conspiracy.  She  was  locked  up  at  the  California  Institution  for  Women  prison  at  Chino.'She  probably  wasn't  a  criminal'It  wasn't  until  the  early  1990s  that  Joyce  Ride  came  to  the  rescue.She  was  visiting  women  inmates  as  a  member  of  Friends  Outside,  one  of  many  nonprofits  across  the  nation  that  help  inmates  and  their  families  cope  with  incarceration  and  transitioning  to  and  from  prison  life.  By  supporting  prisoner  visits  by  friends  and  family  members,  Friends  Outside  says,  it  reduces  stress  among  prisoners,  preventing  despair  and  unhealthy  behavior.Ride  had  already  raised  two  daughters  as  a  California  housewife.  One  had  grown  up  to  become  a  Presbyterian  minister.  The  other,  the  late  Sally  Ride,  had  become  NASA's  first  woman  astronaut.A  nun  who  volunteered  by  visiting  women  in  jail  inspired  Ride  to  learn  more  about  why  so  many  women  who  are  victims  of  domestic  abuse  end  up  in  prison.  After  her  husband  died,  Ride  began  dedicating  many  of  her  days  to  visiting  incarcerated  women.  "It  interested  me,"  she  said.Ride's  younger  daughter,  the  minister,  understood.  But  it  confused  her  astronaut  daughter.  "Sally  couldn't  figure  out  why  I  was  visiting  prisons,"  Ride  said.  Compared  to  her  work  at  NASA,  she  said,  "it  was  a  whole  other  world."It  was  pure  coincidence  that  Joyce  Ride  met  Killian  in  prison.  They  hoped  to  work  together  to  help  women  inmates  who  had  suffered  from  domestic  violence."Gloria  had  a  good  sense  of  humor  and  we  just  got  along  very  well,"  Ride  remembered.  After  about  a  year  of  visits,  "it  dawned  on  me  she  probably  wasn't  a  criminal.  So  I  asked  her  why  she  was  there."Killian  told  Ride  her  story.Ride  was  convinced  Killian  was  innocent.  She  felt  that  she  had  to  do  something.Despite  Killian's  objections,  Ride  started  financing  a  private  investigation  and  legal  battle  that  eventually  would  win  Killian's  freedom."I  was  willing  to  be  stubborn  and  do  what  it  takes,"  Ride  said.  "Of  course  when  I  started  out  I  didn't  know  what  it  was  going  to  cost."  The  decade-long  battle  cost  Ride  about  $100,000.  She  sold  stocks  to  raise  money  for  Killian's  defense  and  had  to  pay  taxes  on  that  income,  she  said.Ride's  private  investigator,  Darryl  Carlson,  uncovered  a  damning  piece  of  evidence:It  was  a  letter  that  proved  the  prosecution's  star  witness,  Masse,  had  struck  a  deal.  In  exchange  for  leniency,  Masse  testified  that  Killian  was  the  master  planner  of  the  home  invasion  and  murder.Killian's  prosecutor  had  never  shared  that  letter  with  Killian's  lawyers  during  the  original  trial.Read  the  prosecutor's  letterIn  hopes  of  overturning  the  conviction,  Killian's  lawyers  used  this  and  two  other  letters  to  appeal  to  the  U.S.  Ninth  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals.Circuit  Judge  Michael  Daly  Hawkins  wrote  that  the  letters  "exposed  Masse's  motivation  to  lie  and  tended  to  show  that  he  did  lie."  The  letters  made  Masse's  testimony  worthless  and  "without  it,  there  was  no  case,"  Hawkins  wrote.Hawkins  noted  that  one  of  the  other  documents  discovered  by  Killian's  team  was  a  letter  Masse  "wrote  to  the  prosecutor  shortly  after  Killian's  trial  in  which  he  emphasized  that  he  'lied  (his)  ass  off  on  the  stand'  for  the  government."Read  the  official  transcript  of  Masse's  letterRead  the  opinion  of  the  Ninth  U.S.  Circuit  Court  of  AppealsEventually,  prosecutors  dismissed  the  charges  against  Killian.The  ordeal  was  over.But  not  before  Killian  had  spent  nearly  two  decades  behind  bars.HousematesIn  2008,  State  Bar  of  California  prosecutors  brought  "prosecutorial  misconduct"  disciplinary  charges  against  the  prosecutor,  Christopher  Cleland.  The  court  ruled  Cleland  was  "culpable  of  failing  to  disclose  exculpatory  evidence  (one  letter)  to  the  defense..."  As  a  result,  the  court  determined  Cleland  should  receive  an  "admonishment"  —  which  is  considered  neither  discipline  nor  exoneration.Read  the  California  State  Bar  Court's  decisionNow,  a  dozen  years  after  her  release,  Killian  and  Ride  are  still  supporting  each  other  as  the  best  of  friends  --  sharing  Ride's  home  in  Claremont,  California."All  of  Gloria's  relatives  died  while  she  was  in  prison,"  Ride  said.  "So,  when  she  got  out,  I  offered  her  a  place  to  stay."  They've  recently  taken  in  a  third  housemate,  a  woman  Killian  befriended  in  prison.In  the  decade  since  her  release,  Killian  has  raised  money  to  help  women  prisoners.  She  has  founded  an  advocacy  group,  the  Action  Committee  for  Women  in  Prison.  She  also  tells  her  story  on  the  speaking  circuit.At  age  90,  Ride  isn't  stopping  either.  She's  still  volunteering  and  visiting  inmates."Prisoners  are  persons  like  the  rest  of  us,  and  they've  made  mistakes,"  Ride  said.  "I  think  prisoners  need  friends  on  the  outside."For  Killian,  having  that  friend  made  all  the  difference  in  the  world.Ride  says  America  should  do  more  to  support  the  nation's  prison  population.

I'm  trying  to  make  sense  of  what  happened  that  day.  My  boys  went  to  watch  a  friend  run  the  marathon,  and  one  came  home  46  days  later.  The  other  one,  32  days  later.  And  their  lives  are  forever  changed,"  she  told  CNN's  Wolf  Blitzer.  "So  I  want  to  try  and  find  out,  somehow,  to  make  some  sense  of  how  somebody  could  do  this  to  all  these  innocent  people."Authorities  allege  Tsarnaev,  a  Chechnya-born  American,  and  his  brother  Tamerlan  planted  two  homemade  bombs  near  the  finish  line  of  the  marathon,  then  killed  a  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  police  officer  three  days  later.The  attacks  triggered  the  massive  manhunt  that  led  to  Tsarnaev's  capture.  Police  shot  and  killed  Tamerlan  Tsarnaev  during  the  manhunt."The  nature  of  the  conduct  at  issue  and  the  resultant  harm  compel  this  decision,"  U.S.  Attorney  General  Eric  Holder  said  in  a  statement  released  by  the  Justice  Department.Death  penalty  in  the  United  States  gradually  decliningAfter  Holder  made  his  decision,  prosecutors  filed  a  notice  with  a  federal  court  that  they  would  seek  the  death  penalty  in  the  case.The  notice  lists  factors  that  prosecutors  argue  justify  a  death  sentence  in  the  case.  Among  them:  The  attack  killed  multiple  people,  involved  substantial  planning  and  premeditation  and  involved  betrayal  of  the  United  States,  prosecutors  said.Dzhokhar  Tsarnaev  is  charged  with  30  federal  counts  stemming  from  the  attack.  He  has  pleaded  not  guilty  to  all  charges.The  decision  announced  Thursday  is  no  surprise,  CNN  senior  legal  analyst  Jeffrey  Toobin  said."This  is  a  case,  that,  if  you  believe  in  the  death  penalty,  seems  to  cry  out  for  the  death  penalty,  even  though  the  defendant  is  only  19  years  old,  and  potentially  the  junior  partner  to  his  late  brother,"  Toobin  said.But  that  doesn't  mean  it's  an  open-and-shut  case."One  of  the  most  interesting,  difficult,  strategic  decisions  the  defense  faces,"  Toobin  said,  is  whether  to  push  for  a  change  of  venue  for  the  trial."Boston  was  obviously  deeply  traumatized  by  this  incident.  And  the  jury  pool  is  Boston,  if  the  case  remains  where  it  is.  But  Boston  is  also  probably  the  most  liberal  city  in  the  country.  Death  penalty  opposition  there  is  higher  than  anywhere  else,"  Toobin  said.  "So  does  the  defense  go  somewhere  else,  where  people  don't  have  the  immediate  association  with  the  crime?  Or  do  they  go  somewhere  that  might  not  oppose  the  death  penalty  in  the  same  numbers?"Massachusetts  abolished  the  death  penalty  three  decades  ago,  but  prosecutors  can  seek  the  death  penalty  against  Tsarnaev  because  federal  law  allows  for  the  penalty  in  certain  circumstances.Despite  Holder's  decision  to  authorize  the  death  penalty  in  the  Tsarnaev  case,  prosecutors  still  could  reach  a  plea  deal  for  a  lesser  sentence  with  his  attorneys,  who  include  death  penalty  lawyer  Judy  Clarke.Boston  Marathon  terror  attack  timelineHolder  issued  a  memo  in  2011  that  forbids  using  the  death  penalty  threat  to  obtain  guilty  pleas.  But  that  doesn't  prohibit  plea  deals  coming  after  the  attorney  general's  recommendation.Federal  officials  weighed  a  number  of  factors  before  they  announced  their  decision,  including  the  opinions  of  victims  of  the  deadly  attack.Survivors  were  asked  to  fill  out  a  questionnaire  about  what  they  thought  about  the  death  penalty.In  a  statement  Thursday,  Gov.  Deval  Patrick  urged  the  state's  residents  to  stay  strong."One  way  or  another,  based  on  the  evidence,  Tsarnaev  will  die  in  prison.  In  each  milestone  of  the  case  --  today's  announcement,  the  trial  and  every  other  significant  step  in  the  justice  process  --  the  people  hurt  by  the  Marathon  bombings  and  the  rest  of  us  so  shocked  by  it  will  relive  that  tragedy,"  he  said.  "The  best  we  can  do  is  remind  each  other  that  we  are  a  stronger  Commonwealth  than  ever,  and  that  nothing  can  break  that  spirit."Tsarnaev's  attorney  did  not  immediately  respond  to  a  request  for  comment.Reached  before  federal  authorities  announced  their  decision  to  seek  the  death  penalty,  Zubeidat  Tsarnaev,  the  suspect's  mother,  did  not  comment  on  the  specifics  of  the  case."We  are,  you  know,  sickened  about  our  child.  ...  We  have  nothing  in  our  heads  or  in  our  hearts,  so  what  should  I  say?  We  are  just  really  sick,"  she  told  CNN's  Nick  Paton  Walsh  in  a  telephone  interview."The  only  thing  I  want  to  say,"  she  said,  "is  I  want  the  whole  world  to  hear  that  I  love  my  son,  my  precious  Dzhokhar.  That's  it."Norden  said  she  hopes  to  learn  more  about  Tsarnaev  during  the  trial,  to  try  to  understand  why  the  deadly  attacks  occurred."I  watch  my  sons,  and  it's  sad.  Their  lives  have  changed,  and  they're  OK  with  it.  They've  learned  to  accept  it.  But  I  can't,"  she  said,  her  voice  cracking.  "You  know,  those  are  my  kids,  and  they  went  to  watch  a  marathon  on  the  streets  of  Boston,  and  it  shouldn't  have  happened."For  Boston  Marathon  bombing  victims:  $8.4  million  of  assistanceCNN's  Evan  Perez,  Susan  Candiotti,  Chuck  Johnston  and  Jason  Hanna  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

It's  real  and  we  got  very  good  information,"  a  government  source,  who  also  did  not  want  to  speak  for  full  attribution,  told  CNN.  "It's  based  on  a  credible  source.  We're  taking  it  seriously  so  are  other  countries  taking  it  very  seriously."The  assumption  is  the  threat  would  be  on  a  departing  flight  from  Russia,  that  source  added.The  Homeland  Security  Department  said  in  a  statement  that  "out  of  an  abundance  of  caution"  it  routinely  shares  "relevant  information"  with  domestic  and  international  entities,  "including  those  associated  with  international  events"  like  the  Sochi  Olympics.Russian  transportation  officials  have  banned  liquids  in  airline  carry-on  luggage  ahead  games,  according  to  a  report  from  the  Russian  news  agency  RIA  Novosti.Rep.  Peter  King,  chairman  of  the  House  Homeland  Security  Committee's  subcommittee  on  Terrorism  and  Intelligence,  said  on  CNN's  "The  Situation  Room"  that  Americans,  the  airlines  and  those  at  the  Olympics  should  take  the  threat  "very  seriously."King,  New  York  Republican,  believes  that  the  athletes  and  American  spectators  are  "reasonably  safe,"  but  noted  that  he  would  not  go  himself."Just  as  a  spectator,  I  don't  think  it's  worth  the  risk.  I  mean,  odds  are  nothing  is  going  to  happen,  but  the  odds  are  higher  than  for  any  other  Olympics,  I  believe,  that  something  could  happen,"  he  said.King  said  he  has  some  confidence  in  how  the  Russians  are  handling  security,  but  "really  not  enough  because  they  are  not  sharing  enough  intelligence"  about  what's  happening  inside  the  country."We  are  getting  some  information  about  what's  happening  outside  of  Russia,  some  external  threats,  that  type  thing,  or  potential  threats.  I  don't  want  to  overstate  that,  he  said.He  noted  a  "ring  of  steel  right  around  the  Olympics  itself"  but  said  "there's  a  real  cause  for  concern"  about  getting  to  Sochi  and  surrounding  areas.The  Obama  administration  has  not  indicated  it  is  not  safe  to  travel  to  the  Olympics.Secretary  of  State  John  Kerry,  in  an  exclusive  interview  with  CNN's  "The  Lead  with  Jake  Tapper"  before  the  toothpaste  alert  broke,  said  that  "anybody  who  wants  to  go  to  the  Olympics,  which  are  just  a  great  event,  should  go.  And  we're  not  telling  people  not  to  go."Kerry  added  that  people  should  be  alert  and  take  precautions,  advice  he  says  has  been  requisite  since  the  9/11  attacks."We've  got  a  new  consciousness  about  this,"  he  said.A  senior  administration  official  said  that  it  would  make  any  information  public  through  the  State  Department  should  it  receive  information  that  "changes  our  assessment  of  whether  people  should  travel  to  Sochi."Matthew  Olsen,  a  top  U.S.  counter-terrorism  official,  highlighted  concern  in  testimony  to  Congress  on  Tuesday  about  whether  Muslim  fundamentalists  in  disputed  regions  of  Russia  --  or  other  groups  --  could  launch  attacks  on  selected  targets."There  are  a  number  of  specific  threats  of  varying  degrees  of  credibility  that  we're  tracking,"  he  said.  "And  we're  working  very  closely  with  the  Russians  and  with  other  partners  to  monitor  any  threats  we  see  and  to  disrupt  those."Terrorism  experts  say  that  airlines  continue  to  be  a  target  of  terrorists  wishing  to  make  a  spectacular  impact  with  an  attack.  The  focus  since  2001  has  shifted  from  hijackings  to  bombs,  especially  those  that  might  be  hidden  in  luggage.U.S.  authorities  are  also  mindful  of  creative  package  or  other  novel  ways  to  conceal  explosives.  For  instance,  a  failed  attempt  to  blow  up  an  overseas  flight  heading  to  Detroit  on  Christmas  Day  in  2009  involved  a  bomb  concealed  in  a  passenger's  underwear.Shortly  after  9/11  a  man  was  convicted  of  trying  to  blow  up  a  transAtlantic  flight  with  explosives  hidden  in  his  shoes.CNN's  Jim  Acosta,  Ten  Barrett,  Evan  Perez  and  Jake  Tapper  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

That  area  where  asteroids  hang  out  is  called  the  main  asteroid  belt</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  If  you  want  to  find  an  asteroid,  the  region  between  Mars  and  Jupiter  is  a  great  place  to  look.  That  area  where  asteroids  hang  out  is  called  the  main  asteroid  beltA  study  in  the  journal  Nature  throws  a  new  light  on  this  strip  of  our  solar  system,  where  most  of  the  asteroids  in  our  solar  system  reside.  Whereas  scientists  once  believed  that  these  asteroids  formed  more  or  less  in  place,  new  modeling  suggests  they  have  been  scattered  all  over.Scientists  believe  "the  asteroid  belt  is  a  melting  pot  of  bodies  that  formed  all  over  the  solar  system,"  said  Francesca  DeMeo,  lead  study  author  and  an  astronomer  at  the  Harvard  Smithsonian  Center  for  Astrophysics.Back  in  the  1980s,  when  only  about  10,000  asteroids  were  known,  it  seemed  that  asteroids  that  appeared  to  have  formed  in  a  cold  environment  were  farther  away  from  the  sun,  while  those  that  formed  in  a  hot  environment  were  closer  to  the  sun.But  DeMeo  and  co-author  Benoit  Carry  of  the  Paris  Observatory  studied  hundreds  of  thousands  of  asteroids  and  they  found  that  this  trend  did  not  hold.  Instead  they  spotted  many  "rogue"  asteroids:  Rocks  formed  in  hot  environments  that  were  in  regions  where  cold-environment-formed  asteroids  were  expected,  and  so  on.The  main  asteroid  belt  is  much  more  diverse  than  originally  thought,  the  study  shows.  Dante  Lauretta,  lead  scientist  on  the  asteroid  sample  return  mission  OSIRIS-REx  and  professor  at  the  University  of  Arizona,  said  in  an  e-mail  that  the  study  "represents  a  new  paradigm  in  our  understanding  of  the  compositional  diversity  of  the  asteroid  belt."  Lauretta  was  not  involved  in  the  Nature  study.Although  astronomers  cannot  directly  measure  temperatures  of  asteroids,  they  can  infer  a  rock's  origin  through  geology.  For  instance,  an  asteroid  with  a  lot  of  carbon  probably  formed  far  from  the  sun,  in  colder  temperatures.The  theory  is  that  the  planets  of  our  solar  system  have  moved  over  time.  Jupiter,  the  largest  planet  in  our  solar  system  and  the  one  with  the  most  gravitational  pull,  had  a  big  part  to  play.  As  Jupiter  moved  toward  the  sun,  it  scattered  asteroids,  "like  a  snow  globe,"  DeMeo  said.Over  time,  she  said,  there  was  "a  big  mess  of  asteroids  everywhere."  The  only  place  for  them  to  remain  was  the  asteroid  belt.Why  asteroids  don't  surprise  us  anymoreNear-Earth  asteroids,  space  rocks  that  approach  our  planet's  orbit,  originated  between  Mars  and  Jupiter,  she  said.  By  understanding  the  diversity  of  the  main  asteroid  belt,  we  can  understand  better  the  asteroids  that  come  close  to  Earth,  DeMeo  said.Such  a  large  amount  of  mixing  in  the  asteroids  is  not  surprising,  Lauretta  said."This  study  shows  that,  indeed,  a  dynamical  process  has  stirred  the  asteroid  pot,  so  to  speak,"  he  said.Computer  simulations  called  dynamical  models  simulate  the  behavior  of  thousands  of  asteroids  over  time  --  even  over  millions  of  years.  In  this  way,  scientists  can  see  how  the  solar  system  might  have  evolved,  how  the  giant  planets  may  have  migrated,  and  how  the  migration  could  have  affected  the  distribution  of  various  types  of  asteroids.Dynamical  models  over  the  last  decade  have  suggested  the  main  asteroid  belt  has  been  sculpted  by  giant  planet  resonance,  a  position  where  an  asteroid  feels  a  regular  gravitational  pull  from  Jupiter  or  Saturn,  Lauretta  said.Astronomers  have  figured  out  that  this  happens  in  connection  with  a  mathematical  relationship  between  the  asteroid's  orbital  period  and  the  planet's  orbital  period.  When  the  orbital  period  --  how  long  it  takes  go  to  around  the  sun  --  of  the  asteroid  is  an  integer  multiple  of  the  planet's  orbital  period,  you  see  this  effect  --  and  there  tend  not  to  be  any  large  asteroids  in  these  locations.For  example,  there  is  a  location  where  an  asteroid  would  go  around  the  sun  twice  for  every  time  that  Jupiter  circles  once.  The  asteroid  feels  regular  tugging  from  the  planet,  and  its  orbit  become  unstable.  That  explains  the  emptiness  of  that  part  of  the  asteroid  belt.There  are  several  sky  surveys  that  look  out  for  asteroids  on  a  regular  basis  as  part  of  NASA's  Near  Earth  Object  Program.  The  program  found  that  a  very  small  asteroid  entered  the  Earth's  atmosphere  over  the  mid-Atlantic  Ocean  at  the  beginning  of  January  and  probably  broke  up.Today  we  know  of  about  500,000  asteroids  in  the  main  belt,  but  astronomers  believe  there  are  at  least  1  million  asteroids  there  that  are  larger  than  1  kilometer  in  diameter,  and  even  more  that  are  small.  The  next  one  we  spot  will  also  come  from  this  shaken  solar  system.Follow  Elizabeth  Landau  on  Twitter  at  @lizlandau</TEXT></DOC>

Then  put  that  energy  to  work  hiking  Acadia's  Cadillac  Mountain,  whose  1,532-foot  peak  overlooks  the  Atlantic.Travel  +  Leisure:  Great  spring  weekend  getawaysGeorge  Washington  Memorial  Parkway,  Maryland  and  Virginia  The  route:  25  milesThis  green  parkway  reveals  one  floral  show  after  another  --  591  wildflower  species,  from  large-flowered  valerians  to  Virginia  bluebells  --  as  you  drive  from  the  Great  Falls  of  the  Potomac  through  D.C.  and  south  to  Mount  Vernon.  The  most  famous  are  the  cherry  trees  that  bloom  around  the  Tidal  Basin  in  D.C.Where  to  stop:  Hike  the  many  trails  that  crisscross  the  700-acre  Turkey  Run  Park  (just  seven  miles  north  of  D.C.),  which  is  carpeted  in  bluebells  come  late  April.Antelope  Valley,  California  The  route:  70  milesFrom  Los  Angeles,  drive  north  to  the  town  of  Lancaster  via  Route  14,  better  known  as  the  Antelope  Valley  Freeway.  Golden  poppies  bloom  throughout  the  Mojave  Desert  region  in  March,  but  the  17,600-acre  Antelope  Valley  Poppy  Reserve  claims  the  finest  concentration  of  California's  state  flower  --  not  to  mention  glorious  showings  of  fiddlenecks,  creamcups,  goldfields  and  tidytips  starting  in  late  March.Where  to  stop:  Drive  the  seven-mile  Antelope  Loop  Trail  within  the  Poppy  Reserve  and  continue  on  to  Antelope  Butte  Vista  Point,  a  high  lookout  (the  valley  reaches  an  elevation  of  nearly  3,000  feet)  that  offers  the  most  sweeping  desert  panoramas.Cherokee  Foothills  Scenic  Highway,  South  Carolina  The  route:  120  milesThis  National  Scenic  Byway  sticks  to  an  early  Native  American  trail  (the  Cherokees  called  these  foothills  the  Great  Blue  Hills  of  God)  that  weaves  through  the  low  Piedmont  Hills  past  waterfalls,  covered  bridges  and  brooks.  To  catch  peach  orchards  and  trees  in  full  bloom,  time  your  drive  to  late  spring  or  early  summer.Where  to  stop:  Hundreds  of  roadside  stands  that  begin  filling  with  fruit  in  early  June.  The  famous  Peachoid  water  tower,  painted  to  look  like  a  colossal  peach,  is  in  the  town  of  Gaffney,  where  mountain  laurels  begin  to  blossom  in  late  May.Travel  +  Leisure:  Easy  weekend  getawaysHistoric  Columbia  River  Highway,  Oregon  The  route:  70  milesThe  Columbia  River  area  has  long  been  Oregon's  premier  scenic  attraction.  Explore  by  driving  from  Portland  through  the  Columbia  River  Gorge  and  on  to  volcanic  Mount  Hood,  Oregon's  highest  peak  at  over  11,000  feet.  Multnomah  Falls,  one  of  the  tallest  yearlong  waterfalls  in  the  U.S.,  is  another  showstopper.  Beginning  in  late  March,  look  for  wildflowers  like  purple  Columbia  kittentails  on  the  shaded  banks  of  waterfalls.Where  to  stop:  3  Rivers  Grill  (541-386-8883),  in  a  Victorian  house  overlooking  Hood  River,  for  lunch.  Detour  over  to  the  Washington  side  for  the  Maryhill  Museum  of  Art  and  enjoy  unparalleled  views  of  the  gorge.Louisiana  Great  River  Road  The  route:  70  milesLet  the  Mississippi  River  be  your  guide  on  this  winding  route  from  Baton  Rouge  through  Creole  Country  to  New  Orleans.  Look  out  for  former  sugar  plantations  and  majestic  antebellum  plantation  houses  --  until  the  Civil  War  this  area  was  one  of  the  richest  in  America.  Giant  moss-draped  oak  trees  nearly  obscure  the  Creole  cottages,  surrounded  by  patches  of  budding  wildflowers.Where  to  stop:  Oak  Alley  Plantation  in  Vacherie.  This  Greek  Revival  mansion  was  built  in  1839  and  stands  at  the  end  of  a  long  avenue  lined  with  oak  trees.  In  New  Orleans,  check  into  the  buzzy  Saint  Hotel,  in  the  former  Audubon  Building  in  the  French  Quarter.Hana  Highway,  Hawaii  The  route:  52  milesTropical  flowers  bloom  each  spring  along  the  Road  to  Hana,  which  paves  its  way  through  bamboo  fields,  rainforests  and  waterfalls  like  80-foot  Wailua  Falls,  which  appeared  in  the  credits  of  TV  show  "Fantasy  Island."  Start  in  Kahului,  and  head  down  Maui's  northeastern  coast.  Just  don't  be  fooled  by  the  52-mile  count  --  this  is  an  intense  drive  that  can  take  up  to  four  hours  as  you  navigate  over  600  hairpin  turns  and  more  than  50  one-lane  bridges.  The  payoff  comes  from  the  spectacular  views  and  bragging  rights.Where  to  stop:  Fuel  up  with  pancakes  soaked  in  coconut  syrup  at  Anthony's  Coffee  Co.  in  the  funky  small  town  of  Paia.

While  that  name  could  easily  describe  the  views,  it  actually  refers  to  the  massive  amounts  of  silver  and  gold  once  carted  through  these  passes.  Four-wheelers  can  also  attempt  to  traverse  the  rugged  65-mile  Alpine  Loop  Back  Country  Byway  past  the  19th-century  ghost  towns  of  Howardsville,  Eureka  and  Animas  Forks.Where  to  stop:  Mesa  Verde  National  Park,  famous  for  Anasazi  Indian  cliff  dwellings  that  were  abandoned  200  years  before  Columbus  arrived  in  America.

A  former  speaker  of  the  House,  he  was  a  candidate  in  the  2012  Republican  presidential  primaries.(CNN)  --  The  United  States  has  been  rudely  reminded  that  Russia  is  a  major  power  with  different  values,  ambitions  and  goals  than  America's.Putin's  brazen  move  to  assert  Russian  interests,  in  Crimea  in  particular  and  Ukraine  in  general,  seems  to  have  come  as  a  shock  to  many  leaders  in  the  Obama  administration  and  to  most  of  the  American  news  media.President  Barack  Obama  had  after  all  ridiculed  Sen.  John  McCain  in  2008  and  Gov.  Mitt  Romney  in  2012  for  suggesting  that  Russian  policy  could  become  a  major  problem.Then  Secretary  of  State  Hillary  Clinton  dramatically  pushed  a  reset  button  to  demonstrate  the  Obama  team's  commitment  to  working  with  Russia.President  Obama,  not  realizing  he  was  on  an  open  microphone,  promised  then-Russian  President  Dmitry  Medvedev  that  once  he  was  past  the  election  he  could  be  more  flexible  in  accommodating  Russian  concerns.All  this  naive  fantasy  of  a  "good  Russia"  has  been  shattered  in  the  last  week.The  earlier  overly  positive  statements  have  been  replaced  with  a  tendency  to  demonize  President  Vladimir  Putin.  For  example,  Clinton  has  moved  from  her  reset  button  to  comparing  Putin  to  Adolf  Hitler  (a  comparison  she  can't  possibly  have  meant  but  which  is  a  perfect  case  study  in  the  hysteria  to  which  symbolic  liberalism  is  prone).Strong  words  mask  a  position  of  weakness.  As  former  Secretary  of  State  Henry  Kissinger  has  observed,  calling  Putin  names  is  not  a  substitute  for  a  strategy.The  United  States  has  virtually  no  tactical  cards  it  can  play  in  the  Crimea.  We  are  not  going  to  confront  the  Russians  militarily.  The  local  population  of  Crimea  is  at  least  60%  Russian-speakers.  Association  with  Russia  might  win  a  popular  referendum  (thus  putting  the  democracies  in  a  real  dilemma).On  the  other  hand,  Putin  may  reconsider  the  idea  of  independence  for  Crimea  because  the  pro-Russian  voters  are  needed  to  win  in  Ukraine  overall.  If  the  heavily  pro-Russian  Crimea  were  no  longer  in  Ukraine,  the  pro-Western  forces  would  be  substantially  stronger  in  Kiev.Whatever  happens  in  the  next  few  weeks  in  Crimea,  the  United  States  has  a  very  limited  tactical  ability  to  affect  it.  The  United  States  and  our  allies  can  do  a  fair  amount  to  help  the  rest  of  Ukraine  stay  independent  and  we  should  commit  to  that  project.However,  in  the  long  run  there  is  a  much  greater  threat  that  the  United  States  has  to  confront.The  very  principles  that  led  Putin  to  use  force  in  Crimea  could  be  applied  to  the  Baltic  states  of  Latvia,  Lithuania  and  Estonia.  There  are  a  lot  of  ethnic  Russians  in  all  three  countries  (and  especially  in  Estonia).  They  are  much  closer  to  Russia  than  is  Crimea  --  it  is  228  miles  from  Tallinn,  the  capital  of  Estonia,  to  St.  Petersburg.The  great  difference  is  that  the  three  Baltic  states  are  members  of  NATO.  Any  Russian  adventurism  in  this  area  could  force  the  enormous  choice  of  either  directly  confronting  Russia  in  its  own  neighborhood  or  allowing  NATO  to  collapse  because  we  are  unwilling  to  meet  our  treaty  obligations.Convincing  Putin  that  we  take  seriously  his  toughness  and  his  determination,  and  we  are  prepared  to  meet  it,  could  be  a  vital  step  toward  avoiding  a  future  disaster.There  are  some  key  steps  we  can  take  toward  achieving  that  goal:--  First,  move  to  increase  the  production  of  oil  and  gas,  thus  dramatically  lowering  the  price  of  oil,  thereby  cutting  into  Putin's  ability  to  earn  hard  currency.--  Second,  wean  the  Europeans  off  their  dependence  on  Russian  natural  gas  as  one  of  their  biggest  suppliers,  thus  lowering  Putin's  ability  to  exercise  influence  over  the  European  community.--  Third,  strengthen  the  ability  of  Ukraine  to  produce  its  own  energy  so  it  has  both  a  healthier  economy  and  no  longer  relies  on  Putin  and  Russia  as  its  main  source  of  energy.--  Fourth,  strengthen  American  military  capabilities  to  show  that  we  recognize  that  Putin  is  more  dangerous  than  we  thought  and  that  we  are  prepared  to  strengthen  our  ability  to  deal  with  any  threat  he  might  bring  to  bear,  particularly  on  our  NATO  allies  in  the  Baltic.The  Congress  should  call  on  the  President  to  immediately  issue  an  executive  order  to  approve  the  Keystone  XL  pipeline,  which  will  reduce  the  price  of  oil  worldwide  by  getting  more  oil  to  market  faster.  Each  drop  in  the  dollars  that  Putin  can  get  weakens  his  ability  to  undertake  foreign  adventures.The  President  should  also  sign  an  executive  order  lifting  the  ban  on  selling  natural  gas  to  Europe.  After  all,  since  the  executive  order  the  President  issued  on  Thursday  indicates  this  is  "a  national  emergency,"  then  there  are  serious  things  we  can  do  in  a  national  emergency.This  President  has  already  proven  a  willingness  to  use  executive  orders  widely.  This  would  be  one  that  would  weaken  and  undermine  Putin,  while  also  beginning  to  liberate  the  Europeans  from  dependence  on  Russia.Obama  should  also  immediately  open  closed  offshore  and  federal  land  to  drill  for  natural  gas  and  oil.  The  more  oil  and  gas  the  United  States  produces,  the  further  we  can  drive  down  costs,  leaving  the  Russians  weaker  and  with  fewer  resources.There  are  24  liquid  natural  gas  projects  tied  up  in  the  federal  bureaucracy.  A  presidential  executive  order  could  liberate  them  and  send  the  clear  signal  the  United  States  is  prepared  to  replace  Russia  as  the  natural  gas  supplier  of  last  resort.  This  would  clearly  signal  the  Europeans  that  in  the  next  few  years  they  will  have  an  alternative  to  being  blackmailed  by  Putin.Remember,  it  was  President  Reagan's  strategy  to  drive  down  the  price  of  oil  to  $11  a  barrel  that  eventually  bankrupted  the  Soviet  Union  and  gave  Soviet  leader  Mikhail  Gorbachev  no  choice  but  to  sign  a  series  of  agreements  that  recognized  the  decline  of  the  Soviet  Union.If  Clinton  was  both  sincere  and  serious  in  comparing  Putin  to  Hitler  when  she  related  the  action  in  the  Crimea  to  the  action  that  Hitler  took  in  Czechoslovakia  in  1938,  then  she  would  be  demanding  that  we  dramatically  strengthen  rather  than  weaken  American  defense.The  President  should  announce  that  he  is  directing  the  Joint  Chiefs  to  significantly  re-evaluate  the  budget  in  order  to  be  more  than  adequately  prepared  for  any  possible  contingency.  This  would  send  a  signal  in  the  real  world  that  the  Russians  would  understand.What  we  have  so  far  is  symbolic  liberalism  offering  words,  symbolic  liberalism  flying  around  the  world  from  capital  to  capital  having  meetings,  and  symbolic  liberalism  targeting  narrowly  a  handful  of  people  in  a  way  that  will  have  no  impact  on  Putin.What  we  could  have  is  serious,  robust  action  that  would  have  a  genuine  and  immediate  impact  and  would  weaken  Russia's  ability  to  act  aggressively  toward  its  neighbors.This  is  the  time  to  determine,  are  we  serious  about  confronting  Putin  over  the  long  run?  Or  after  a  few  symbolic  games,  is  the  administration  going  to  accommodate  the  new  reality  that  Putin  is  creating?Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Newt  Gingrich.</TEXT></DOC>

He  is  the  author  of  books  on  writing  and  language,  including  "How  to  Write  Short:  Word  Craft  for  Fast  Times."  This  essay  contains  some  words  and  ideas  taken  from  his  earlier  essays  on  the  topic  of  language  taboos.  He  can  be  reached  at  rclark@poynter.org.(CNN)  --  Not  long  ago  I  received  a  complaint  from  a  co-worker  that  I  had  used  the  f-word  in  a  tweet.  I  was  quoting  a  lyric  from  the  band  Vampire  Weekend:  "Who  gives  a  f---  about  an  Oxford  comma?"  My  answer  was,  of  course,  "I  do."  The  full  quote,  without  the  fig  leaf,  appears  in  my  book  "The  Glamour  of  Grammar."I  come  by  my  f-wordiness  honestly.  My  grandmother  used  it  easily  and  could  swear  in  three  languages.  My  mother  --  at  the  age  of  94  --  drops  an  f-bomb  in  every  telephone  conversation.  During  a  trivia  game  at  her  assisted  living  home,  she  could  not  think  of  the  name  of  Peter,  Paul,  and  Mary's  magic  dragon,  so  she  blurted:  "F---  the  Magic  Dragon,"  which  now  has  become  the  family's  official  title  for  the  song.The  f-word  is  almost  everywhere.  While  still  not  fit  for  polite  society,  it  no  longer  carries  the  depth  of  taboo  attributed  to  it  in  1978  by  that  hero  of  foul  mouthery  George  Carlin,  who  said  in  a  comic  monologue:  "The  big  one,  the  word  f---,  that's  the  one  that  hangs  them  up  the  most."Its  common  usage  in  popular  culture  today  may  have  transformed  it  into  one  of  the  most  versatile  words  in  American  English.  It  might  qualify  as  the  word  of  the  new  century.But  is  that  a  good  thing?Setting  records  on  screenThe  recent  opening  of  the  Martin  Scorsese  film  "The  Wolf  of  Wall  Street"  has  inspired  critical  and  popular  complaints  about  its  excesses,  including  its  language.  I  have  not  yet  seen  the  film,  but  am  grateful  to  the  dirty  word  counters,  who  have  recorded  a  total  of  506  uses  of  the  f-word  in  the  three-hour  movie.  Wikipedia,  Variety,  Time  and  various  other  sources  cite  this  as  a  record  for  a  non-documentary  film,  beating  Spike  Lee's  "Summer  of  Sam"  (435),  and  two  earlier  Scorsese  projects:  "Casino"  (422)  and  "Goodfellas"  (300).Versions  of  the  f-word  appear  so  often  in  "Wolf"  that  an  accurate  count  might  be  impossible.  Slate's  total  comes  in  at  544.  (I  hope  I  don't  see  a  Politifact  report  contesting  these  numbers.)("Summer  of  Sam"  appears  to  keep  the  record  for  most  fpm:  f-words  per  minute,  at  3.1.  "Wolf"  does  beat  "Casino"  on  this  metric.  In  his  mischievous  book  of  lists,  Karl  Shaw  calculates  that  a  viewer  of  "Casino"  will  hear  the  f-word  on  the  average  of  2.4  times  per  minute.  For  "Wolf"  it's  2.8  times.)How  things  have  changed.I  remember  with  surprising  clarity  the  first  time  I  used  the  f-word.  One  of  the  Masterson  brothers  told  me  a  joke,  and  he  thought  it  was  so  funny  I  ran  home  to  tell  my  mother.  She  didn't  laugh  and  made  me  repeat  it  to  my  father.  It  was  1956  or  so.  I  was,  maybe,  8  years  old.  Things  did  not  go  well.I  went  to  work  with  my  dad  one  day,  a  United  States  Customs  officer  on  one  of  the  New  York  piers.  A  group  of  men  stood  inside,  including  some  rough-looking  longshoremen,  who  dropped  the  f-word  loudly  and  often  into  their  gritty  conversation.  Several  men,  alerting  them  to  my  presence,  told  them  to  stick  a  cork  in  it.  Even  in  their  gruffness,  they  looked  sheepish  and  apologetic.First  encountersI  remember  exactly  where  I  was  standing  the  first  time  I  heard  a  girl  my  age  use  the  f-word.  It  was  1967  and  I  was  a  sophomore  in  college.  She  sat  on  the  ground,  a  hippie  chick,  smoking  and  grousing  about  her  inability  to  score  tickets  for  the  Newport  Folk  Festival.And  I  know  exactly  where  I  first  encountered  the  f-word  in  print.  I  was  a  freshman  in  high  school,  and  the  book  was  called  "The  Catcher  in  the  Rye,"  a  work  on  many  lists  of  the  most  often  banned  books.  J.D.  Salinger  uses  the  word  five  times  in  "Catcher"  with  great  power  and  specificity.  I  still  own  the  book  where  I  underlined  each  use  of  the  word.I  remember  the  teachers  who  tried  to  convince  me  that  the  main  problem  with  the  f-word  was  not  its  power  to  offend,  but  the  evidence  it  gave  of  your  limited  vocabulary.  I  blew  that  criticism  off  back  then,  but  I'm  beginning  to  think  they  were  on  to  something.Not  that  the  f-word  isn't  an  amazingly  versatile  piece  of  our  four-letter  Anglo-Saxon  heritage.  Think  about  it.  It  can  express  surprise,  outrage,  anger,  humor,  delight  or  desire.  And  it  can  stand  in  for  several  parts  of  speech:  noun,  verb  (in  any  tense),  gerund,  participle,  imperative,  interrogative,  interjection,  to  mention  just  the  most  common  uses.It  can  be  used  with  other  little  prepositional  helpers.  You  can  f---  with  someone's  mind.  You  can  be  too  f---ed  up  to  walk.  You  can  get  f---ed  over  by  the  IRS.A  rare  language  formLet's  not  forget  use  of  the  f-word  as  one  of  the  rarest  of  language  forms,  the  infix.  A  prefix  comes  before  a  word.  A  suffix  comes  after.  An  infix  appears  in  the  middle  of  a  normal  word  or  phrase,  as  in  "You  are  damn  f---ing  right."  Or  "un-f---ing-believable."  Or  as  they  like  to  moan  in  Boston  when  thinking  of  the  New  York  Yankees  victory  in  the  1978  playoff  game:  "Bucky  F---ing  Dent!"  It  was  the  light-hitting  Dent's  timely  home  run  that  ruined  the  Red  Sox  season.All  this  and  more  is  chronicled  in  the  recent  270-page  lexicon  titled  "The  F-Word,"  by  Jesse  Sheidlower,  editor  at  large  of  the  Oxford  English  Dictionary.  Lex  meets  sex.Perhaps  the  ultimate  expression  of  the  f-word's  versatility  comes  in  a  famous  scene  from  David  Simon's  HBO  series  "The  Wire"  in  which  two  detectives  explore  a  crime  scene.The  scene  takes  less  than  four  minutes,  during  which  the  cops  use  versions  of  the  f-word,  by  my  count,  34  times.  It  is  the  only  word  used  in  the  scene.As  they  look  at  crime  scene  photos  of  naked  and  murdered  women,  the  word  expresses  disgust.  As  they  examine  the  conflicting  evidence,  the  word  describes  frustration.  As  they  begin  to  piece  things  together,  it  describes  mounting  excitement.  When  they  find  a  key  piece  of  evidence,  it  is  a  word  of  celebration.Offensive  from  the  beginningThe  f-word  has  a  long  history,  and,  unlike  some  other  taboo  words,  seems  to  have  been  offensive  from  the  start.  Just  as  newspapers  and  this  website  put  a  veil  over  the  word  by  eliminating  some  letters,  the  earliest  known  version  of  the  word  in  English  was  written  in  code.According  to  the  American  Heritage  Dictionary,  an  English  poem  dated  about  1500  makes  fun  of  clerics  who  don't  keep  their  vows,  including  a  line  that  translates:  "They  are  not  in  heaven  because  they  f---  wives  of  Ely"  (a  town  near  Cambridge).  In  the  text,  the  f-word  appears  in  the  form  of  a  letter  substitution  code.Though  still  considered  vulgar  slang,  the  f-word  is  more  prevalent  than  ever,  and  is  often  cited  as  evidence  of  the  coarsening  of  our  culture.  The  publisher  of  "The  Naked  and  The  Dead"  asked  Norman  Mailer  to  substitute  "fug"  in  1947.  Six  decades  later,  the  f-word  is  a  staple  in  hip-hop  music,  stand-up  comedy  routines,  locker  room  harangues,  pornographic  repartee,  and  any  movie  or  cable  television  series  that  tries  to  portray  gritty,  realistic  dialogue.  Cops  use  it,  thugs  use  it,  even  grads  with  Ph.Ds  use  it.I  am  making  the  case  that,  given  its  ubiquity  and  versatility,  the  "f-word"  is  one  of  the  most  important  words  of  the  21st  century,  which  is  why  we  should  pay  close  attention  to  how  it  can  be  used  well.In  previous  essays  on  language,  I  have  offered  these  justifications  for  dropping  the  occasional  f-bomb:1.  As  an  authentic  expression  of  realistic  human  speech.2.  As  a  single,  shocking,  almost-out-of  context  blow  to  the  solar  plexus.3.  As  a  neutralizer  to  the  poison  of  piety,  fastidiousness  and  erudition.4.  As  a  way  of  defining  character.None  other  than  Theodore  Bernstein,  the  influential  style  czar  of  The  New  York  Times,  once  published  this  opinion:  "There  is  not  ...  a  single  transitive  verb  in  respectable  or  even  in  scientific  language  that  expresses  the  idea  of  the  slang  verb  f---."Using  and  overusing  the  f-wordPerhaps  the  most  moving  use  of  the  f-word  I  ever  encountered  came  in  the  documentary  9/11  by  two  French  brothers,  who  were  telling  the  story  of  a  firehouse  in  New  York.  During  the  filming,  two  jetliners  flew  into  the  Twin  Towers,  changing  the  way  Americans  look  at  the  world.  Even  though  the  show  ran  on  commercial  television,  we  were  given  a  chance  to  hear,  uncensored,  the  rough  emotional  language  of  a  fraternity  of  brave  men  facing  their  greatest  challenge.  Real  life.There  is  a  numbing  quality  to  overuse  of  the  f-word.  Shock  and  stark  realism  can  be  created  without  it.  You  won't  find  it  in  the  novel  "The  Great  Gatsby,"  or  the  recent  film  version,  which,  like  "Wolf,"  stars  Leonardo  DiCaprio.  I  don't  remember  hearing  it  in  a  Jerry  Seinfeld  monologue.I  like  it  best  when  it  is  used  rarely  and  in  a  perfect  context,  as  when  it  comes  out  of  the  mouth  of  the  character  Walter  White,  the  high  school  chemistry  teacher  who  becomes  the  drug  lord  of  "Breaking  Bad."  When  he  first  utters  it  in  rage  and  frustration  at  a  moment  of  great  pain,  it  has  as  much  power  as  a  gun  blast.It  works  best  when  delivered  at  just  the  right  dramatic  moment.  To  keep  up  with  the  Scorsese  rate,  the  characters  in  "Breaking  Bad"  would  have  to  utter  the  f-word  about  140  times  --  in  each  47-minute  episode.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Roy  Peter  Clark.</TEXT></DOC>

The  document  did  not  say  what  the  statement  was.The  suspect's  alleged  statement  surfaced  during  the  prosecution's  opposition  to  a  defense  motion  to  do  away  with  restrictions  known  as  Special  Administrative  Measures,  or  "SAMs,"  which  include  that  prison  visits  be  monitored.A  defense  motion  to  vacate  the  measures  --  which  was  unsealed  Friday  --  describes  the  SAMs  as  "unlawful  and  unwarranted."The  measures  were  imposed  in  August  and  restrict  Tsarnaev's  access  to  mail,  media,  the  telephone,  and  visitors.The  defense  motion  claims  the  SAMs  "impose  extraordinary  and  severe  restrictions  impairing  the  ability  of  defense  counsel  to  provide  competent  representation."Tsarnaev,  20,  is  being  held  without  bail  on  federal  charges  in  connection  with  the  April  15  bombings  that  killed  three  people  and  wounded  more  than  250  others.  He's  also  charged  with  the  killing  of  an  MIT  police  officer  several  days  later.His  trial  is  set  for  November  3.  Federal  prosecutors  said  last  month  they'll  seek  the  death  penalty  against  Tsarnaev,  arguing  that  he  acted  in  "an  especially  heinous,  cruel  and  depraved  manner."The  government  argued  that  the  defense  motion  was  not  about  the  restrictions,  but  about  the  fact  that  Tsarnaev  allegedly  made  a  detrimental  comment  in  front  of  an  FBI  agent,  according  to  the  court  document.The  defense  motion  "has  nothing  to  do  with  the  SAMs  and  everything  to  do  with  the  fact  that  Tsarnaev,  despite  the  presence  of  an  FBI  agent  and  an  employee  of  the  Federal  Public  Defender,  was  unable  to  temper  his  remarks  and  made  a  statement  to  his  detriment  which  was  overheard  by  the  agent,"  the  court  document  states.The  government  said  the  FBI  agent  was  in  "a  legally  obtained  vantage  point  making  his  ability  to  see  and  hear  all  which  occurred  lawful."Authorities  allege  Tsarnaev,  a  Chechnya-born  American,  and  his  brother,  Tamerlan,  planted  two  homemade  bombs  near  the  finish  line  of  the  marathon  before  allegedly  killing  a  police  officer  three  days  later.The  attacks  triggered  the  massive  manhunt.  Police  shot  and  killed  the  suspect's  brother,  Tamerlan  Tsarnaev,  during  the  manhunt.Calls  to  Tsarnaev's  attorneys  were  not  immediately  returned  Saturday.For  victim's,  death  penalty  decision  a  'step  forward'</TEXT></DOC>

So  he  stopped,  cold  turkey.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Do  you  have  a  weight-loss  success  story  to  share?  Tell  us  how  you  did  it,  and  you  could  be  featured  in  our  weekly  weight-loss  story  on  CNN.com.(CNN)  --  Mario  Colao  jolted  out  of  bed  at  3  in  the  morning.  He  was  covered  in  sweat,  his  left  arm  was  completely  numb  and  his  heart  was  pounding  violently.He  started  crying  because  he  was  terrified  of  what  was  happening  to  him.That  night  in  January  2010  was  the  third  time  in  two  weeks  his  sleep  had  been  interrupted  by  heart  attack-like  symptoms,  and  he  thought  he  knew  why."It's  sad  to  say,  but  I  felt  like  I  deserved  this  because  I  never  took  care  of  myself,"  Colao  says.He  was  28,  weighed  460  pounds  and  wore  size  6X  clothing.  He  knew  his  habits  of  binge  drinking,  smoking  two  packs  of  cigarettes  a  day  and  overindulging  in  food  were  slowly  killing  him."I  asked  God  to  give  me  another  chance,"  Colao  says,  "and  I  passed  out."The  Chicago  native  had  been  overweight  since  childhood.  He  was  born  into  an  Italian  family  where  food  was  at  the  center  of  everything.  His  parents  worked  long  hours,  so  his  grandfather  played  a  large  role  in  raising  him.In  school,  Colao  was  bullied  because  of  his  weight,  and  his  grandfather  was  his  only  friend.  But  when  Colao  was  9,  his  grandfather  died.  He  turned  to  food  to  comfort  the  loneliness  he  felt."Food  became  a  total  escape,"  he  says.  "I  always  considered  it  my  drug."The  weight  kept  piling  on  through  adolescence  and  beyond.  At  18,  he  started  smoking.  He  began  to  drink  heavily  when  he  was  22.  All  the  while  he  continued  to  eat  unhealthy  foods  day  and  night.On  his  blog,  I've  Said  It  All  Before,  Colao  gives  examples  of  some  of  his  regular  meals  at  the  time.  One  included  two  burgers,  a  large  soda,  large  French  fries  and  chicken  nuggets,  totaling  more  than  2,400  calories.By  2010,  Colao  was  drinking  up  to  10  drinks  in  one  night  and  smoking  two  packs  of  cigarettes  a  day.  But  after  those  scary  symptoms  kept  waking  him  up,  he  made  a  pact  with  himself  to  change."I  quit  smoking  and  stopped  eating  everything  that  was  bad,"  he  says.Colao's  parents  bought  him  a  treadmill  because  he  was  uncomfortable  exercising  in  a  gym.  "That's  what  really  helped  me  the  most  --  being  able  to  gain  the  physical  and  mental  stability  and  work  out  on  my  own,"  he  recalls.He  started  by  walking  and  slowly  worked  his  way  up  to  jogging  and  weightlifting.Colao  overhauled  his  diet  as  well.  He  stopped  eating  fast  food,  fried  food  and  red  meat  and  drinking  soda.  He  forced  himself  to  get  accustomed  to  healthy  alternatives  while  allowing  himself  to  indulge  in  small  things  so  he  wouldn't  feel  overwhelmed.He  was  motivated  to  change  his  eating  habits  by  realizing  how  much  time  he  would  have  to  exercise  to  burn  off  the  foods  he  was  consuming.Over  the  first  couple  of  months,  Colao  dropped  50  pounds.  The  loss  drove  him  to  continue,  and  he  set  a  goal  of  losing  200  pounds.When  he  had  lost  down  to  305  pounds,  Colao  went  through  a  difficult  breakup  and  eased  up  on  his  calorie  counting  and  exercising  habits.  Six  months  later,  he  had  gained  back  40  pounds.Scared  he  would  continue  gaining  weight,  he  got  back  on  the  wagon."I  ended  up  being  so  angry  at  how  bad  I  had  gotten  again,  that  I  forced  myself  to  get  back  on  track,"  he  remembers.He  began  monitoring  his  caloric  intake  again  and  started  exercising  two  hours  a  day,  five  days  a  week.As  a  reward  for  reaching  his  goal  of  a  200-pound  weight  loss,  Colao  booked  a  trip  to  Philadelphia  to  run  up  the  steps  of  the  Philadelphia  Museum  of  Art  and  re-create  a  famous  scene  from  the  movie  "Rocky."  He  was  on  course  to  hit  his  goal  when  a  foot  fracture  sidelined  him  for  a  few  weeks.When  the  trip  to  Philadelphia  approached,  Colao  had  lost  185  pounds  and  was  just  shy  of  his  goal.  Regardless,  he  decided  to  go  and  run  up  those  stairs.Colao  finally  hit  his  goal  weight  of  260  pounds  in  October.  He  still  wants  to  lose  another  20  to  30  pounds,  but  his  focus  has  moved  toward  challenging  himself  with  new  exercises.  He's  also  weightlifting  to  tone  up  some  loose  skin  that  has  developed  around  his  arms  and  stomach.Through  his  journey,  Colao  has  found  support  and  motivation  in  his  parents  and  girlfriend,  Julia  Gonzalez.  He  says  he  still  struggles  to  see  himself  in  his  slimmer  body,  and  Gonzalez  pushes  him  to  look  on  the  bright  side."I'm  always  going  to  be  a  positive  voice  for  him  to  remember  what  a  great  thing  he's  accomplished,"  she  says.  "He  inspires  so  many  people.  People  see  him,  and  they  realize  that  they  can  do  it,  too."Colao  is  using  his  experience  to  become  a  certified  personal  trainer."My  main  desire  is  to  help  people  like  me  --  people  that  are  obese  and  feel  hopeless  about  the  situation,"  he  says.Four  years  ago,  Colao  could  not  tie  his  shoes  without  losing  his  breath.  A  few  weeks  ago,  he  did  a  push-up  for  the  first  time.  In  two  months,  he  hopes  to  be  a  certified  personal  trainer  and  well  on  his  way  to  helping  others  reach  their  weight-loss  goals.</TEXT></DOC>

Of  course  she  hasn't  said  she  will  run  --  that's  a  decision  she  said  she'll  make  this  year  --  but  she  must  feel  pretty  good  about  the  tea  leaves.  But  what  if  she  doesn't  run?</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Washington  (CNN)  --  An  air  of  inevitability  exists  around  Hilary  Clinton  for  2016.  Of  course  she  hasn't  said  she  will  run  --  that's  a  decision  she  said  she'll  make  this  year  --  but  she  must  feel  pretty  good  about  the  tea  leaves.A  new  CNN/ORC  poll  out  this  week  found  that  70%  of  Democrats  said  they  are  likely  to  support  her  if  she  launches  a  presidential  bid.Additionally,  she  is  beating  top-tier  Republican  contenders,  including  New  Jersey  Gov.  Chris  Christie  and  former  Florida  Gov.  Jeb  Bush,  in  hypothetical  matchups.Democratic  strategist  Maria  Cardona  predicted,  with  the  caveat  that  a  lot  can  happen  between  now  and  then,  that  if  she  runs,  "I  don't  think  she'll  have  anyone  running  against  her."That's  because  she  is  in  such  a  strong  position  with  her  name  recognition  and  her  vast  network  of  supporters,  donors  and  campaign  infrastructure  ready  to  go.Emory  political  science  professor  Alan  Abramowitz  said  the  chances  of  Clinton  being  upset,  like  what  happened  in  the  2008  primaries,  are  slim."I  don't  see  who's  going  to  be  the  Obama  of  2016,"  he  said.Would  she  say  no?But  plenty  of  reasons  exist  for  her  to  simply  say  no.Presidential  campaigns  are  unbelievable  grinds  and  they  can  exact  a  substantial  personal  toll.  They're  full  of  endless  days,  personal  attacks,  and  heart-clogging  food.  There  are  infinite  details  to  master,  personalities  to  manage,  debates,  and  then  throw  in  the  unknowns.She  will  be  69  on  Election  Day  2016  and  would  have  been  in  the  political  spotlight  for  a  quarter  century  by  then.She  would  have  run  once  as  the  favorite  for  her  party's  nomination  and  lost.  Many  people  might  reflect  on  a  similar  public  service  career  and  conclude  there's  nothing  left  to  prove,  or  that  it's  time  for  others  to  get  in  the  game  even  if  becoming  the  first  woman  president  was  the  prize.But  what  if  Clinton  doesn't  run?Multiple  people  associated  with  the  Democratic  Party  say  there  is  a  host  of  promising  potential  contenders.But  one  strategist,  a  veteran  of  several  Democratic  presidential  campaigns  who  asked  not  to  be  identified  so  he  could  speak  freely,  said,  "People  saw  Governor  Clinton  and  Senator  Obama  as  superstars."  As  for  the  potential  2016  crop:  "No  one  talks  about  the  rest  of  the  field  that  way."Except  for  Joe  Biden."The  truth  is  that,  if  Hillary  doesn't  run  Biden  becomes  the  class  of  the  field  by  far,"  the  veteran  Democratic  strategist  told  CNN.  "It's  gotta  be  Hillary  or  Joe  or  we're  in  trouble."Biden  has  been  cagey  with  his  intentions,  dropping  humorous  references  but  refusing  to  commit.But  his  name  recognition  as  vice  president  and  as  a  veteran  of  the  presidential  campaign  trail,  some  in  the  party  think  Biden  is  in  a  good  position.Though,  he  would  be  73  on  Election  Day  2016  and  74  on  Inauguration  Day.  That's  "middle  age"  for  a  U.S.  senator,  but  no  one  has  ever  walked  into  the  Oval  Office  on  their  first  day  of  work  at  that  age.Jim  Manley,  a  former  top  Senate  aide,  thinks  Biden  "deserves  a  shot"  because  he's  been  "outstanding"  as  vice  president.But  Joe  is  Joe.  People  either  love  him,  hate  him  or  forget  about  him.For  some  Democratic  operatives,  Biden  is  almost  an  afterthought.  People  spouted  off  numerous  potential  Democratic  candidates  and  Biden's  name  would  come  up,  eventually."Oh  yes,  Joe  Biden,"  said  one  strategist  after  gently  jogging  his  memory.The  progressive  wing  of  the  party  is  not  impressed.Adam  Green,  co-director  of  the  Progressive  Change  Campaign  Committee,  left  it  at  this:  "Joe  Biden  has  had  a  great  career  in  public  service."After  the  interview  concluded,  Green  e-mailed  to  say  that  his  co-director,  Stephanie  Taylor,  has  this  to  say  about  a  Biden  run:  "That  would  be  funny,"  Taylor  said.Martin  O'MalleyDemocratic  pollster  Margie  Omero  said  Democrats  Biden  and  Clinton  aren't  the  only  two  who  can  appeal  to  Democratic  voters.The  party  has  "a  really  strong  bench  of  candidates  that  people  are  excited  about  that  have  progressive  appeal."She  included  Maryland  Gov.  Martin  O'Malley,  saying  he  has  "quietly  and  consistently"  built  a  strong  record  of  good  schools  and  good  economy  in  Maryland.Interestingly,  in  this  informal  survey  of  half  a  dozen  Democratic  operatives  and  one  political  science  professor,  people  mentioned  O'Malley  most  often  than  any  other  possible  contender,  including  Biden,  but  their  reaction  was  far  more  muted.Manley  said  the  "jury  is  out"  and  Abramowitz  mused,  "I  just  don't  know  what  kind  of  candidate  he'd  be."Green  called  O'Malley  "a  blank  slate."O'Malley  is  laying  the  groundwork  for  a  run  in  the  event  Clinton  doesn't,  a  source  close  to  the  governor  told  CNN.O'Malley  amplified  2016  speculation  when  he  told  the  Washington  Post  last  week  that  he  can't  wait  for  the  former  first  lady  and  secretary  of  state  to  make  a  decision.Elizabeth  WarrenThe  first-term  Massachusetts  senator  would  have  even  less  experience  in  public  office  than  Obama  when  he  ran  in  2008.But  Democrats  have  a  high  opinion  of  the  former  Harvard  professor  whose  advocacy  paved  the  way  for  the  Consumer  Federal  Protection  Bureau.Former  Obama  aide  Bill  Burton  said  Warren  was  one  of  a  handful  of  "impressive"  Democrats  who  could  fill  the  bill  should  Clinton  stay  out.Cardona  said  Warren  has  to  be  "put  on  any  list."The  progressives  love  her  for  her  populist  agenda.  Green  said  Warren  is  "the  north  star"  of  the  Democratic  Party.Kirsten  GillibrandNew  York  Sen.  Kirsten  Gillibrand's  name  also  came  up  as  a  potential  contender.  But  Cardona  said  she  would  have  to  get  over  her  lack  of  name  recognition,  which  she  said  is  relatively  easy  to  do.Manley,  however,  said  it's  "too  soon"  for  New  York  Sen.  Kirsten  Gillibrand.  She  should  show  her  campaigning  and  fundraising  capabilities  as  head  of  the  Democrat's  Senate  campaign  arm.Andrew  CuomoThe  New  York  governor  received  the  most  negative  response  from  respondents,  if  he  was  mentioned  at  all.Manley  said  Andrew  Cuomo  should  "stick  to  being  the  governor  of  New  York."Green  said  he  represents  the  Democratic  Party  from  the  90s  and  would  not  fit  in  well  with  today's  voters,  adding  that  he  "pays  lip  service"  to  progressives.More  on  the  bench?There  are  other  possibilities,  including:  Montana  Gov.  Brian  Schweitzer,  Colorado  Gov.  John  Hickenlooper  and  Massachusetts  Gov.  Deval  Patrick.But  even  though  lifelong  people  had  little  to  say  as  they  are  so  unknown  on  a  national  scale."I'm  not  sure  what  I  can  say,"  Manley  said."Untested"  is  how  Emory  professor  Abramowitz  described  the  field  outside  of  Biden  and  Clinton."All  these  other  candidates  have  never  run  for  national  office  so  we  don't  know  how  they'd  do."</TEXT></DOC>

I  have  been  a  cancer  screening  expert  for  more  than  two  decades  and  the  headlines  are  often  confusing  to  me.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  CNN  conditions  expert  Dr.  Otis  Brawley  is  the  chief  medical  officer  of  the  American  Cancer  Society  and  a  practicing  oncologist.  He  is  also  the  author  of  the  book  "How  We  Do  Harm:  A  Doctor  Breaks  Ranks  About  Being  Sick  in  America."(CNN)  --  The  subject  of  breast  cancer  screening  is  often  in  the  news  as  ongoing  clinical  studies  publish  updates  and  experts  debate  the  merits  of  the  findings.Breast  cancer  is  an  emotional  issue  because  it  kills  thousands  of  women  per  year.  Many  are  in  the  prime  of  their  lives.There  seems  to  be  conflicting  messages  regarding  screening,  so  I  can  understand  how  it  can  be  confusing  to  the  layman.  I  have  been  a  cancer  screening  expert  for  more  than  two  decades,  and  the  headlines  are  often  confusing  to  me.  Perhaps  I  can  bring  some  clarity  to  the  issue.Mammography  (breast  X-ray)  was  developed  in  the  1950s.  The  concept  of  using  it  to  search  for  early  cancer  came  about  soon  thereafter.Does  breast  screening  save  lives?Simply  finding  cancer  is  not  proof  of  a  test's  benefit.  One  must  find  the  cancer,  provide  treatment  and  demonstrate  that  patients  who  would  have  died  do  not.  Several  screening  tests  for  other  cancers  have  been  found  not  just  useless  but  also  harmful  because  the  nature  of  the  cancer  was  that  early  detection  and  treatment  did  not  save  lives.Long-term  study  questions  benefits  of  mammogram  screeningThe  best  way  to  determine  whether  a  breast  screening  test  is  beneficial  is  through  a  prospective  randomized  study  in  which  women  are  enrolled  and  randomly  assigned  to  be  screened  or  not,  then  followed  over  time.  The  goal  is  to  determine  that  there  are  less  breast  cancer  deaths  in  the  heavily  screened  group.A  number  of  these  clinical  trials  have  and  are  being  conducted  in  North  America  and  Europe.  The  earliest  began  in  1963.  The  last  began  in  Europe  and  Canada  in  the  1980s.  Unfortunately,  no  study  is  perfect;  each  has  flaws.These  studies  are  huge  and  follow  women  for  decades.  The  smallest  enrolled  45,000  women  and  the  largest  more  than  160,000.  The  studies  are  logistical  challenges;  some  have  even  reported  different  numbers  of  women  enrolled  in  different  publications.The  studies  ask  different  questions.  Most  studied  women  50  and  older.  Only  two  were  designed  to  look  at  women  40  to  49.  Some  asked  whether  mammography  is  better  than  no  screening.  Some  studied  whether  screening  with  mammography  and  clinical  breast  examination  is  better  than  clinical  breast  examination.HealthMakers:  Otis  Brawley:  Who  should  have  a  mammogram?When  looking  at  these  trials  in  2014,  there  are  challenges  common  to  every  study:•  First,  some  women  in  the  "do  not  screen"  group  began  getting  screened  as  initial  reports  of  some  studies  showed  a  benefit  to  screening.  The  studies  began  assessing  the  long-term  outcomes  of  groups  of  women  who  had  been  intensively  screened  over  the  years  versus  groups  lightly  screened  over  the  past  decades.•  The  quality  of  the  mammography  equipment  has  improved  such  that  all  the  studies  available  used  what  is  now  obsolete  imaging  equipment.•  Treatment  of  breast  cancer  has  improved.  Early  detection  may  be  less  important  today  than  two  decades  ago.These  are  the  studies  we  have  to  make  decisions  from.  It  is  unethical  to  start  new  studies  because  the  consensus  is  that  screening  has  some  benefit;  we  cannot  randomize  women  to  the  nonscreening  arm  of  a  new  trial.Study  questions  benefit  of  yearly  mammogramsIt  is  up  to  the  screening  expert  to  look  at  each  of  these  studies  and  handicap  them.  The  expert  has  to  take  into  account  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  each  and  try  to  distill  the  truth.  No  one  finding  and  certainly  no  one  update  on  a  single  trial  should  change  a  recommendation.It  is  true  some  of  the  trials  have  failed  to  show  a  benefit  to  mammography  when  compared  with  a  population  getting  clinical  breast  examination.  Some  of  the  studies  show  a  benefit  with  mammography  screening  decreasing  risk  of  death  by  15%.  Others  say  it's  35%.Mammograms  should  be  used  with  cautionThere  are  huge  inconsistencies  even  in  the  studies  showing  benefit.  The  predominance  of  medical  opinion  is  there  is  some  lifesaving  benefit  to  screening  women  40  to  75.Screening  messages  are  complicated,  and  we  in  medicine  often  are  not  good  at  explaining  them.  A  number  of  medical  organizations  regularly  put  together  groups  of  experts  to  review  breast  cancer  screening  data  objectively  and  make  recommendations  about  screening.  Most  review  all  the  trials  every  five  to  seven  years.The  following  organizations  suggest  that  average-risk  women  begin  yearly  screening  with  high-quality  mammography  and  clinical  breast  examination  at  40,  with  screening  continuing  until  the  woman  is  no  longer  in  good  health.  The  year  of  recommendation  is  noted  in  parentheses:•  American  Cancer  Society  (2003)•  American  Medical  Association  (2002)•  National  Comprehensive  Cancer  Network  (2009)•  American  College  of  Obstetricians  and  Gynecologists  (2010)•  American  College  of  Radiology  (2012)•  American  Society  of  Breast  Surgeons  (2011)The  U.S.  Preventive  Services  Task  Force  (2009)  and  the  American  Association  of  Family  Physicians  (2012)  recommend  women  40  to  49  make  an  individual  decision  about  screening  with  their  doctors.  Those  concerned  about  breast  cancer  should  get  screening  every  one  to  two  years  while  in  their  40s.  These  two  organizations  recommend  screening  every  two  years  from  50  to  74.Professors:  Komen  overstating  benefits  of  mammogramsMost  of  these  organizations  have  statements  that  women  should  be  informed  of  the  limitations  of  mammography,  including:•  Screening  is  a  better  test  for  women  in  their  50s  and  60s  versus  women  in  their  40s.•  Screening  will  have  some  false  alarms.  Some  women  will  be  told  they  have  a  finding  that  requires  further  testing.  Most  of  these  women  will  ultimately  not  have  cancer.•  Screening  will  miss  some  important  cancers  we  wish  it  would  find.•  Screening  will  find  some  cancers  that  do  not  need  treatment  and  cause  some  women  to  get  unnecessary  treatment.•  There  is  a  small  long-term  risk  of  radiation-induced  breast  cancer.I  am  concerned  that  we  in  American  medicine  have  led  many  to  believe  breast  screening  is  better  than  it  is.  That  is  not  to  say  it  should  not  be  used  --  it  should  be  used  with  caution.  Women  should  be  informed  of  the  benefits  and  limitations  of  mammography  and  clinical  breast  examination,  and  we  need  to  work  hard  to  find  a  better  test.Opinion:  Mammographers,  Canada  cancer  study  is  legit</TEXT></DOC>

Casale  was  61.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Los  Angeles  (CNN)  --  Devo  guitarist  Bob  Casale  died  Monday,  his  brother  and  band  mate  announced  Tuesday.  Casale  was  61.He  was  known  by  fans  as  "Bob  2"  since  he  played  alongside  guitarist  Bob  Mothersbaugh,  the  brother  of  Devo  co-founder  Mark  Mothersbaugh."As  an  original  member  of  Devo,  Bob  Casale  was  there  in  the  trenches  with  me  from  the  beginning,"  his  brother  Gerald  Casale  said  in  a  Facebook  posting.  "He  was  my  level-headed  brother,  a  solid  performer  and  talented  audio  engineer,  always  giving  more  than  he  got."The  new-wave  band  began  after  Gerald  Casale  and  Mark  Mothersbaugh  met  as  art  students  at  Kent  State  University.  The  group  wrote  its  first  music  in  May  1970  --  the  same  month  National  Guard  troops  fired  on  antiwar  protesters  on  the  Kent  State  campus,  killing  four  students.Devo  actively  toured  in  recent  years,  including  a  televised  performance  playing  at  the  2010  Winter  Olympics  in  Vancouver,  Canada."He  was  excited  about  the  possibility  of  Mark  Mothersbaugh  allowing  Devo  to  play  shows  again,"  Gerald  Casale  wrote  in  his  brother's  death  announcement.  "His  sudden  death  from  conditions  that  led  to  heart  failure  came  as  a  total  shock  to  us  all."Mark  Mothersbaugh  issued  a  statement  Tuesday  saying  he  was  "shocked  and  saddened"  by  Casale's  death."He  not  only  was  integral  in  Devo's  sound,  he  worked  over  20  years  at  Mutato,  collaborating  with  me  on  60  or  70  films  and  television  shows,  not  to  mention  countless  commercials  and  many  video  games,"  said  Mothersbaugh.   "Bob  was  instrumental  in  creating  the  sound  of  projects  as  varied  as  Rugrats  and  Wes  Anderson's  films. He was  a  great  friend.  I  will  miss  him  greatly."Mutato  is  the  name  of  the  band's  headquarters,  a  landmark  on  Hollywood's  Sunset  Boulevard.The  band's  name  was  derived  from  the  word  "de-evolution"  --  the  idea  that  humans  are  regressing  into  a  destructive  herd  mentality,  Gerald  Casale  told  CNN  in  an  interview  in  February  2010."When  you  think  about  1980,  if  somebody  would  have  showed  you  in  a  crystal  ball  (for)  2010,  you  would  have  thought  it  was  a  bad  joke,"  Casale  said.  "De-evolution  happened  and  now  everybody  agrees.  They  don't  think  we're  crazy.  They  know  that  it  was  true."Devo  drummer  Alan  Myers,  who  was  with  the  group  from  1976  to  1986,  died  last  year.People  we've  lost  in  2014CNN's  Henry  Hanks  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

But  many  factors  that  cause  it  are  out  of  his  control.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Errol  Louis  is  the  host  of  "Inside  City  Hall,"  a  nightly  political  show  on  NY1,  a  New  York  all-news  channel.(CNN)  --  Less  than  a  day  after  officially  concluding  12  tumultuous  years  as  mayor,  Michael  Bloomberg  sat  stone-faced  in  the  front  row  at  the  inauguration  of  his  liberal  successor,  Mayor  Bill  de  Blasio,  as  one  speaker  after  another  made  blistering,  thinly  veiled  attacks  on  Bloomberg's  legacy.The  Rev.  Fred  Lucas,  one  of  the  clergymen  who  delivered  the  opening  invocation,  asked  God  to  turn  "the  plantation  called  New  York  City"  into  a  better  place.  Actor  Harry  Belafonte  used  his  turn  at  the  podium  to  call  for  an  end  to  what  he  called  the  city's  "deeply  Dickensian  justice  system."  And  the  newly  elected  public  advocate,  Letitia  James,  ticked  off  a  litany  of  criticisms  of  Bloomberg's  police,  education  and  economic  policies.The  attacks,  which  dominated  an  inauguration  ceremony  that  is  normally  a  celebration  of  municipal  unity,  jarred  many  observers.  "As  outside  observer,  hard  to  understand  the  bitter  partisanship  at  De  Blasio  ceremony,"  noted  an  Israeli  journalist  on  Twitter.  "There's  a  time  for  everything,  and  this  isn't  it."Things  got  so  heated  that,  an  hour  into  the  event,  former  President  Bill  Clinton,  who  administered  the  oath  of  office  to  de  Blasio,  tried  to  reset  the  tone  by  offering  the  first  praise  of  Bloomberg,  noting  that  the  departing  mayor  "leaves  the  city  stronger  and  healthier  than  he  found  it."  De  Blasio  himself  departed  from  his  prepared  speech  to  ask  the  crowd  to  applaud  Bloomberg.The  criticism  was  partly  a  matter  of  political  overreach:  Polls  suggest  that  a  majority  of  New  Yorkers,  while  ready  to  turn  the  page  on  the  Bloomberg  years,  also  think  the  city  is  on  the  right  track.  Forty-nine  percent  approve  of  what  Bloomberg  did  for  the  city,  including  innovative  programs  aimed  at  low-income  residents.But  over  the  years,  Bloomberg  --  a  Wall  Street  veteran  and  a  multibillionaire  with  a  chilly  managerial  style  --  became  an  irresistible  target  for  those  who  decry  the  gap  between  rich  and  poor.  At  a  time  when  homelessness  in  New  York  has  soared  to  a  record-high  50,000  people  (PDF)  sleeping  in  city  shelters  every  night,  Bloomberg's  habit  of  jetting  off  to  a  home  in  Bermuda  on  weekends  was  fodder  for  criticism  from  opponents.The  same  was  true  of  Bloomberg's  free-spending  ways:  One  conservative  estimate  places  Bloomberg's  spending  on  his  campaigns  and  other  political  efforts  at  an  eye-popping  $650  million  from  his  personal  fortune,  overwhelming  liberal  Democratic  challengers  in  2001,  2005  and  2009.It  was  easy  for  liberal  politicians  to  point  the  finger  at  Bloomberg  as  a  symbol  of  inequality,  but  as  de  Blasio  will  soon  discover,  the  issue  won't  vanish  with  the  Bloomberg  administration.  Slate  business  correspondent  Matthew  Yglesias  has  wisely  suggested  that  progressives  not  get  too  giddy  over  what  the  de  Blasio  equality  agenda  can  deliver  in  the  foreseeable  future."Everyone  should  take  a  deep  breath  or  two,"  he  wrote  in  August.  "Economic  inequality  is  a  serious  issue  and  municipal  governance  is  a  serious  matter,  but  the  fact  is  that  the  two  have  relatively  little  to  do  with  each  other."Poverty  has  bedeviled  New  York  and  other  cities  for  centuries,  and  mayors  have  scant  power  to  affect  broad  trends  like  the  decline  of  manufacturing,  the  loss  of  low-skilled  jobs  to  foreign  countries  and  the  destruction  of  jobs  by  automation  and  the  information  revolution.But  New  York's  newly-elected  mayor  won  last  November  on  a  campaign  promise  to  use  the  power  of  government  to  attack  yawning  gaps  of  wealth  and  income  between  rich  and  poor.  Even  before  taking  office  on  New  Year's  Day,  de  Blasio  began  ratcheting  up  the  rhetoric,  explicitly  positioning  his  new  administration  as  a  place  the  rest  of  the  nation  should  watch  for  clues  about  how  to  address  economic  inequality.On  Wednesday  he  told  the  inauguration  crowd,  "We  are  called  to  put  an  end  to  economic  and  social  inequalities  that  threaten  to  unravel  the  city  we  love."A  large  audience  will  indeed  be  watching  to  see  whether  de  Blasio  --  or  any  mayor  --  can  make  the  mighty  wheels  of  the  national  economy  spin  in  the  direction  of  uplifting  the  poor.  If  he  can  crack  the  code,  an  effective  attack  on  economic  inequality  will  be  making  news  long  after  the  ungracious  sendoff  of  Bloomberg  has  faded  from  memory.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Errol  Louis.</TEXT></DOC>

Chris  Christie  cruised  to  an  overwhelming  reelection  win,  the  main  political  question  he  faces  isn't  whether  he  can  make  a  transition  to  the  national  stage  and  run  for  president  --  it's  whether  he  can  continue  to  govern  the  state  at  all.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Errol  Louis  is  the  host  of  "Inside  City  Hall,"  a  nightly  political  show  on  NY1,  a  New  York  all-news  channel.(CNN)  --  Less  than  three  months  after  New  Jersey  Gov.  Chris  Christie  cruised  to  an  overwhelming  reelection  win,  the  main  political  question  he  faces  isn't  whether  he  can  make  a  transition  to  the  national  stage  and  run  for  president  --  it's  whether  he  can  continue  to  govern  the  state  at  all.Negative  press  about  the  so-called  Bridgegate  scandal  --  an  apparent  decision  by  top  Christie  aides  to  close  lanes  on  the  George  Washington  Bridge  and  snarl  traffic  for  days  on  end,  allegedly  out  of  petty  political  spite  toward  local  officials  --  has  taken  a  severe  toll  on  Christie's  national  prospects:  A  recent  poll  confirms  that  he  has  tumbled  from  first  to  third  place  as  a  potential  2016  presidential  candidate.But  that  could  prove  to  be  the  least  of  Christie's  headaches.  A  more  pressing  matter  is  raised  by  a  short,  devastating  letter  penned  by  Alan  Zegas,  the  lawyer  for  a  former  top  aide  to  Christie,  David  Wildstein,  and  published  on  the  New  York  Times  website.The  immediate  point  of  the  letter  was  to  press  the  Port  Authority,  the  agency  that  operates  the  George  Washington  Bridge,  to  pay  Wildstein's  legal  expenses.  But  it's  not  just  a  financial  dispute.If  Wildstein,  who  personally  oversaw  the  lane  closures,  was  following  orders  requested  or  approved  from  on  high,  he  can  demand  legal  protection  by  the  agency.  But  by  refusing  to  cover  his  costs,  the  Port  Authority  is  saying,  in  effect,  that  Wildstein  was  acting  on  his  own.The  letter  by  Wildstein's  attorney  bluntly  suggests  otherwise:  "It  has  also  come  to  light  that  a  person  within  the  Christie  administration  communicated  the  Christie  administration's  order  that  certain  lanes  on  the  George  Washington  Bridge  were  to  be  closed,  and  evidence  exists  as  well  tying  Mr.  Christie  to  having  knowledge  of  the  lane  closures,  during  the  period  when  the  lanes  were  closed,  contrary  to  what  the  Governor  stated  publicly  in  a  two-hour  press  conference."Ouch.The  Christie  administration  hastily  responded  with  a  statement  that  the  governor  "had  absolutely  no  prior  knowledge  of  the  lane  closures  before  they  happened  and  whatever  Mr.  Wildstein's  motivations  were  for  closing  them  to  begin  with."But  the  damage  was  done:  The  scandal  now  has  the  potential  to  be  carried  directly  into  the  inner  circle  of  the  Governor's  office,  and  undermine  his  credibility.Until  now,  Christie  has  employed  a  blunt  but  effective  two-step  strategy  for  containing  the  scandal.  Step  One:  Summarily  fire  and  publicly  condemn  deputies  who  were  linked  to  the  scandal.  Step  Two:  Plead  utter  ignorance  as  to  how  or  why  these  top  aides  would  engage  in  unethical  or  illegal  behavior.The  strategy  was  never  quite  plausible  --  Christie,  a  former  prosecutor,  has  a  reputation  as  a  hands-on  manager  whose  aides  don't  stray  far  without  permission  --  and  it's  a  risky  gambit:  By  publicly  denigrating  fired  members  of  his  inner  circle,  Christie  opens  himself  to  the  possibility  of  disgruntled  ex-employees  going  public  with  information  that  is  embarrassing,  or  even  incriminating.One  can  only  imagine  what  Wildstein  was  thinking  during  Christie's  two-hour  press  conference,  in  which  he  blasted  Wilstein  and  another  fired  ex-aide,  Bridget  Ann  Kelly,  for  "abject  stupidity.""What  did  I  do  wrong  to  have  these  folks  think  it  was  OK  to  lie  to  me?"  he  said  during  the  press  conference.Adding  insult  to  injury,  Christie  went  so  far  as  to  say  that  Wildstein,  often  described  in  the  press  as  a  high  school  friend,  wasn't  really  a  Christie  pal."David  and  I  were  not  friends  in  high  school.  We  were  not  even  acquaintances  in  high  school,"  Christie  said.  "We  didn't  travel  in  the  same  circles  in  high  school.  You  know,  I  was  the  class  president  and  athlete.  I  don't  know  what  David  was  doing  during  that  period  of  time."At  least  one  commentator,  Michael  Tomasky,  thinks  that  personal  snub  might  make  Wildstein  more  inclined  to  turn  on  Christie.  "What  if  Wildstein  is  sitting  on  some  goods?  Is  he  going  to  be  happy  being  dismissed  as  too  geeky  for  Christie  to  waste  his  time  on  back  in  high  school?"  Tomasky  asks,  concluding:  "The  nerd  is  striking  back."As  a  matter  of  political  technique,  Christie's  swift  firings  and  forceful  denials  seem  credible  in  the  short  term  --  but  they  also  echo  at  least  one  time  when  the  denounce-and-fire  tactic  backfired.  In  2010,  after  New  Jersey's  request  for  millions  in  federal  education  funds  was  rejected  --  in  part  because  the  final  request  lacked  key  budget  estimates  --  Christie  publicly  castigated  and  fired  his  education  commissioner,  Brett  Schundler,  allegedly  for  lying  to  him  about  what  went  wrong  with  the  application.But  Schundler  swiftly  struck  back,  producing  e-mails  and  other  documents  that  showed  he  had,  indeed,  told  Christie  up  front  about  the  application's  shortcomings."I  will  not  accept  being  defamed  by  the  Governor  for  something  he  knows  I  did  not  do,"  wrote  Schundler.  "The  Governor  called  me  a  liar  this  week.  That  was  the  last  straw."The  Schundler  episode  is  important.  Will  Christie's  strenuous  denials  of  knowledge  of  Bridgegate  --  and  his  suggestion  that  his  top  aides  lied  to  him  --  hold  up  under  scrutiny?Indeed,  the  state's  most  powerful  newspaper,  the  Star-Ledger,  is  already  warning  Christie  that  the  end  may  be  near.  Within  hours  of  the  publication  of  Wildstein  letter  suggesting  Christie  knew  about  Bridgegate,  the  paper  published  a  hard-hitting  editorial."If  this  charge  proves  true,  then  the  governor  must  resign  or  be  impeached.  Because  that  would  leave  him  so  drained  of  credibility  that  he  could  not  possibly  govern  effectively,"  the  editorial  says.  "He  would  owe  it  to  the  people  of  New  Jersey  to  stop  the  bleeding  and  quit."For  Christie,  it's  been  a  long,  bumpy  road.

It  happened  when  an  AI  document  called  for  legalizing  prostitution.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Robin  Morgan,  activist  and  author  of  22  books,  hosts  the  radio  show/podcast  "Women's  Media  Center  Live  with  Robin  Morgan":  WMCLive.com  and  iTunes.(CNN)  --  What  if  the  world's  most  distinguished  human  rights  organization  decided  to  condone  pimping?  Unthinkable,  right?  But  that's  what  happened  when  Amnesty  International  put  forth  a  document  calling  for  the  legalization  of  prostitution.For  50  years,  the  global  women's  movement  has  been  fighting  the  selling  and  buying  of  human  beings,  which  has  a  name:  slavery.  For  decades,  feminists  called  for  criminalizing  the  buyers  while  decriminalizing  the  women  they  buy;  offering  women  support  services  ranging  from  safe  harbor  through  drug  rehabilitation  to  education  and  skills  training;  and  enforcing  laws  that  criminalize  pimps,  traffickers  and  brothel  owners.The  response  was  that  it  would  never  work  (and  feminists  were  crazy,  sex-hating  Puritans).The  sex  industry  fought  back,  both  openly  --  It's  the  "oldest  profession,  always  been  with  us";  it  represents  "sexual  liberation"  --  and  covertly,  through  funding  happy-hooker-type  groups,  rebranding  prostitution  as  "sex  work,"  and  praising  it  as  a  career  choice  indistinguishable  from  any  other.  Have  you  ever  met  an  8-year-old  who  said,  "Ooh,  I  wanna  grow  up  to  be  a  hooker"?The  numbers  of  prostituted  women  who  suffer  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  are  in  the  same  range  as  combat  veterans  and  refugees  from  state  sponsored  torture.  They  are  also  disproportionately  survivors  of  child  sexual  and  physical  abuse,  rape  and  battery,  kidnapping,  assault  with  a  deadly  weapon,  and  addiction  to  drugs  and/or  alcohol.Vednita  Carter,  a  survivor  activist,  has  noted  that  every  prostituted  woman  has  been  forced,  whether  or  not  she  seems  to  "choose  willingly."  Racism,  violence  and  poverty  are  ever  present  forms  of  coercion  in  the  sex  industry;  consequently,  poor  women  and  women  of  color  have  a  disproportionately  large  presence.  And  we're  only  now  discovering  the  enormous  impact  of  prostitution  on  women  in  native  communities.As  the  survivors  succinctly  depict  it:  $  Does  Not  =  Consent.There  is,  as  Kathleen  Barry  pointed  out  in  her  classic,  "The  Prostitution  of  Sexuality,"  a  single  interrelated  mega-enterprise  of  sexual  exploitation.We  know  the  trajectory  of,  say,  a  young  runaway  from  an  abusive  home:  First,  the  offer  of  work  in  "films."  Then,  the  "temporary"  turning  of  a  trick  or  two,  which  becomes  a  permanent  deployment  in  prostitution.  Finally,  she  finds  herself  being  moved  around  as  a  trafficked  commodity.Despite  this  reality,  the  phrase  "sex  work"  became  fashionable  among  some  well-meaning  people  who  assumed  that  this  term  meant  respect  for  the  women  involved  --  when  actually  it  signifies  approval  for  the  context  in  which  such  women  were  trying  to  stay  barely  alive,  or  from  which  they  were  trying  to  escape.Nevertheless,  progress  seemed  possible.  Sweden,  Norway,  and  Iceland  passed  legislation  holding  customers  responsible  for  buying  human  beings  for  sex,  criminalizing  the  buyers  and  offering  the  women  support  programs.This  is  known  as  the  Nordic  Model.  The  French  parliament  voted  last  December  to  follow  Sweden's  model;  similar  laws  are  pending  in  the  parliaments  of  Belgium,  Ireland,  Scotland  and  Canada,  and  the  European  Parliament  favored  it  with  a  strongly  affirmative  vote  on  February  24,  2014.See,  the  model  works.  Since  Sweden  began  enforcement,  street  prostitution  has  been  reduced  almost  by  half  and  trafficking  has  declined.  This  unglues  the  arguments  of  those  who  treat  trafficking  as  a  separate  issue  from  "sex  work."  Is  it  less  enslaving  to  be  bought  in  your  own  country  rather  than  another?  Contrarily,  countries  with  legalized  prostitution  have  greater  inflows  of  human  trafficking,  according  to  a  study  published  in  ScienceDirect.Then,  just  when  it  seemed  sanity  was  winning,  the  respected  human  rights  organization  Amnesty  International  appears  to  have  come  out  on  the  side  of  the  sex  industry.An  Amnesty  International  document,  "Decriminalization  of  Sex  Work,"  argues  that  pimps  and  johns  should  be  "free  from  government  interference"  and  allowed  to  "exercise  their  autonomy."It  says  governments  have  an  obligation  to  establish  an  environment  where  pimps  can  operate  freely  to  engage  prostituted  people;  to  do  otherwise  "threatens  the  rights  to  health,  nondiscrimination,  equality,  privacy,  and  security  of  persons."  The  document  also  insults  the  disability  community  by  claiming  that  men  with  disabilities  require  access  to  prostituted  women  to  further  their  sense  of  "life  enjoyment  and  dignity."Amnesty  International  has  argued  that  the  document  is  a  draft  and  is  in  the  discussion  stage.  But  Amnesty  International  representatives  appeared  at  the  Northern  Ireland  Assembly  in  January,  lobbying  to  strike  down  proposed  legislation  that  would  criminalize  customers  for  buying  prostituted  women.What's  even  more  stunning  is  that  a  former  member  of  Amnesty,  is  proudly  claiming  credit  for  having  first  raised  the  issue  of  legalizing  pimps  and  brothel  owners  at  the  organization,  which  he  says  resulted  in  the  policy  recommendation.  A  campaigner  for  the  International  Union  of  Sex  Workers  who  and  calls  himself  a  "sex  worker",  he  and  his  partner  run  a  major  escort  service.  Amnesty,  however,  denies  his  involvement  in  the  draft  document,  saying  he  had  "zero  input."  Amnesty  came  to  this  on  its  own,  then?  Hard  to  know  which  is  worse.It  took  decades  for  the  global  women's  movement  to  convince  Amnesty  that  human  rights  were  not  reserved  for  male  people.  Now,  Amnesty  International  London  has  set  things  back  by  considering  a  shocking  violation  of  the  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights.But  this  time,  the  "crazy,  puritanical  feminists"  can't  be  dismissed;  we're  backed  by  national  governments  who've  proved  our  point—and  saved  women's  lives.  This  time  survivors  must  be  heard.On  March  8,  a  mass  protest  will  be  held  at  Amnesty  International's  London  headquarters,  and  a  worldwide  virtual  protest  is  building  online.  A  global  petition  to  Amnesty  and  a  Facebook  page  called  Virtual  Protest  of  Amnesty  International  has  full  information.  We  hope  Amnesty  will  regain  its  soul  --  and  realize  that  survivors'  rights  are  women's  rights  are  human  rights.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Robin  Morgan.</TEXT></DOC>

Look  for  Raison  to  address  other  questions  in  the  future.Q:  Can  using  marijuana  or  having  a  drink  or  two  be  helpful  for  people  with  anxiety?  What  should  they  watch  out  for?Dr.  Raison:  If  one  goes  on  any  search  engine  looking  for  study  results  related  to  marijuana  or  alcohol  and  depression  or  anxiety,  one  will  immediately  see  that  most  of  the  evidence  tells  a  cautionary  tale.Many  studies  suggest  that  regular  use  of  either  marijuana  or  alcohol  is  associated  with  an  increased  risk  for  a  variety  of  mental  health  problems,  anxiety  and  depression  among  them.  Increasing  data  suggests  that  regular  marijuana  use  in  adolescence  may  also  be  a  risk  factor  for  developing  very  serious  psychotic  disorders,  especially  schizophrenia.In  addition  to  promoting  other  disorders,  alcohol  is  especially  liable  to  abuse  and  dependence  and  has  ruined  innumerable  people's  lives  for  millennia.Far  fewer  studies  have  examined  whether  using  these  compounds  in  moderation  might  improve  depression  or  anxiety.But  as  Socrates  noted  almost  2,000  years  ago,  alcohol  is  both  a  blessing  and  a  curse  to  mankind.  Indeed,  now  we  know  that  the  regular  modest  use  of  alcohol  actually  promotes  a  number  of  health  factors.Similarly,  it  is  increasingly  clear  that  many  of  the  chemicals  within  marijuana  hold  great  promise  for  the  treatment  of  physical  pain.  The  endocannabinoid  system  in  the  brain  --  which  is  a  primary  target  for  marijuana  --  has  profound  effects  on  how  people  think  and  feel.My  son  is  mentally  ill,  so  listen  upFor  example,  increasing  evidence  suggests  that  the  "runners  high"  many  people  get  after  strenuous  exercise  is  produced  primarily  by  activation  of  the  brain's'  internal  endocannabinoid  system.  Other  chemicals  in  marijuana  impact  other  brain  pathways,  like  serotonin,  that  are  known  to  play  a  role  in  depression  and  anxiety.People  have  been  taking  a  drink  or  two  in  the  evening  since  time  immemorial.  And  many  people  will  attest  that  this  practice  helps  them  shed  the  cares  of  the  day.  Recently,  I've  met  with  several  very  experienced  psychiatrists  who  have  been  recommending  small  amounts  of  marijuana  use  for  for  very  depressed  patients  who  haven't  responded  to  antidepressants.  In  some  patients,  they  are  reporting  remarkable  improvements.But  the  problem  at  this  point  is  that  while  many  studies  have  shown  an  association  between  alcohol/marijuana  and  mental  illness,  I  don't  know  of  any  really  rigorous  studies  looking  at  the  therapeutic  potential  of  either  for  depression  and  anxiety.Answering  the  question  of  what  people  who  use  these  substances  should  watch  out  for  is  easier.  They  should  watch  out  for  the  possibility  that  they  become  more  anxious  or  depressed  after  drinking  or  using  marijuana.  And  they  should  keep  a  close  eye  on  their  use,  especially  use  of  alcohol,  which  can  be  highly  addictive.  Whatever  potential  benefit  alcohol  and  marijuana  may  offer  is  100%  lost  once  they  are  abused.Q:  What  are  the  best  anxiety  treatments  who  don't  want  (or  are  afraid)  to  take  medicines?  Is  there  anything  that  might  ease  their  concerns?  Is  there  a  point  where  medication  becomes  essential?Dr.  Raison:  By  far  the  best  studied  non-medicine  treatment  for  depression  or  anxiety  is  psychotherapy.  Literally  hundreds  of  studies  have  shown  that  on  average  psychotherapy  works  as  well  for  these  conditions  as  do  medications.Of  the  various  psychotherapies,  the  best  studied  is  cognitive  behavioral  therapy,  or  CBT.  But  studies  are  being  done  all  the  time,  and  other  forms  of  therapy  are  also  emerging  as  highly  effective.Over  and  above  the  type  of  therapy  employed,  a  key  factor  of  therapeutic  success  is  the  "fit"  between  the  client/patient  and  therapist.  In  practical  terms,  this  means  that  people  should  feel  comfortable  with  their  therapists.  If  one  feels  ignored,  looked  down  upon,  dismissed  or  attacked,  it  is  very  unlikely  the  therapy  will  be  successful.  Very  often  when  therapy  works  people  start  feeling  better  within  a  few  weeks,  so  this  is  also  something  to  look  for.No  other  non-medical  treatment  for  depression  or  anxiety  has  anywhere  near  the  amount  of  supporting  evidence  that  psychotherapy  does.  Having  said  this,  significant  evidence  now  points  to  the  usefulness  of  exercise  for  improving  mental  health.Especially  when  it  comes  to  depression,  exercise  has  been  repeatedly  shown  to  be  of  value.  Both  strength  training  and  aerobic  exercise  have  benefits  and  combining  them  is  the  best  of  all.However,  to  get  the  full  antidepressant  effect  of  exercise  requires  real  commitment.  To  work  optimally,  exercise  must  be  engaged  in  for  at  least  30  minutes  a  day  five  days  a  week.  And  the  intensity  level  should  be  such  that  one  has  some  difficulty  carrying  on  a  conversation  while  doing  it.Anxiety,  you're  not  the  boss  of  meHowever,  other  health  benefits  accrue  from  far  less  strenuous  exercise  and  in  general  many  people  feel  better  with  even  moderate  exercise.Several  supplements  have  shown  promise  in  depression.  Both  SAMe  and  L-methylfolate  have  shown  promise  as  additions  to  people  not  fully  responding  to  antidepressants.  Most  of  us  in  the  field  think  they  also  work  by  themselves,  although  more  data  are  needed.The  data  for  St.  John's  Wort  is  plus/minus.  Some  evidence  suggests  that  omega-3  fatty  acids  and  N-acetyl-cysteine  may  also  hold  promise  for  the  treatment  of  depressionIf  someone  has  a  pattern  of  becoming  depressed  every  winter,  bright  light  therapy  with  a  light  box  delivering  at  least  10,000  lux  of  light  has  been  shown  to  be  very  effective.  About  10%  of  the  population  suffers  from  some  degree  of  low  mood  and  energy  in  winter.  This  phenomenon  is  more  common  in  cold,  dark,  gray  places  than  in  warm,  sunny  Southern  ones.  The  power  of  a  light  box  to  lift  mood  and  give  energy  can  really  be  exceptional.  This  is  an  option  that  is  sadly  too  often  overlookied.Many  people  swear  by  a  variety  of  non-traditional  approaches.  The  bottom  line  is  that  if  someone  is  helped  by  these  modalities  and  not  harmed,  the  goal  has  been  achieved.Dr.  Charles  Raison  is  an  associate  professor  of  psychiatry  at  the  University  of  Arizona  in  Tucson.</TEXT></DOC>

That  being  said,  under  no  circumstances  would  I  elect  to  revisit  them.If  it  were  not  for  those  difficult  years,  I  would  not  appreciate  my  health  as  much  as  I  do  now,  I  would  not  have  written  five  books,  "The  Hidden  World"  would  not  be  published,  and  I  would  not  have  the  perspective  on  life  that  I  do  now.Autonomic  neuropathy  struck  me  in  February  2009.  It  caused  random  fainting  spells  multiple  times  a  day,  extreme  fatigue,  severe  confusion  and  dizziness,  blurred  vision  and  a  drop  in  my  energy  that  prevented  me  from  walking  unsupported  for  many  months  at  a  time.Those  symptoms  lasted  uninterrupted  --  sometimes  worse,  sometimes  better  --  for  three  years.  I  went  undiagnosed  for  a  year  and  a  half,  and  in  that  time  I  visited  more  than  30  doctors  and  had  countless  treatments,  setbacks,  tests  taken  and  vials  of  blood  drawn.In  June  2010,  my  illness  resulted  in  my  permanent  removal  from  Hotchkiss  (the  boarding  school  I  attended),  and  I  spent  two  subsequent  years  at  home.  During  those  years  I  found  an  agent,  edited  my  novel,  wrote  three  additional  novels  and  secured  a  publishing  contract  with  Koehler  Books.In  May  2012,  my  health  finally  started  to  improve.  There  had  been  brief  spells  before  where  my  health  would  improve  for  a  few  weeks  only  to  deteriorate  even  further,  so  I  found  it  difficult  to  believe  that  my  hardship  was  over.Hockey  player  breaks  back;  now  U.S.  figure  skating  champI  sat  helpless  for  three  years,  watching  my  friends  and  family  suffer  because  of  my  illness,  all  the  while  unable  to  do  anything  to  ease  their  suffering  and  my  own.But  2012  was  an  amazing  year  for  me.  It  was  the  year  I  finally  recovered,  the  year  I  returned  to  school  and  a  normal  life,  and  the  year  I  got  a  publishing  offer  for  my  first  novel,  "The  Hidden  World."My  writing  was  instrumental  to  my  recovery.  The  mental  stimulation  I  received  from  my  writing  saved  me  from  a  deep  depression  and  might  have  played  a  part  in  my  physical  recovery  as  well.I  was  stuck  at  home  for  two  years  --  two  years  where  I  had  nothing  to  do  but  write  and  gain  appreciation  for  the  smallest  things,  such  as  the  ability  to  walk  to  the  bathroom  instead  of  crawl.Members  of  my  family  played  a  vital  role  in  my  recovery.  They  were  struck  by  my  illness  as  hard  or  harder  than  I  was  for  they  had  to  watch  my  health  deteriorate  and  my  spirits  drain,  and  there  was  nothing  they  could  do  about  it.Knowing  how  my  family  suffered  made  the  illness  even  worse  for  me.  Severe  depression  plagued  me  for  those  years,  and  I  was  only  lifted  out  of  it  through  my  writing  and  support  from  my  family.I  am  now  fully  recovered  and  attending  the  University  of  Virginia.  I  am  working  on  my  sixth  novel,  working  to  get  my  third  and  fifth  published,  and  I  have  finally  returned  to  living  a  normal  life  --  something  I  longed  for  for  three  years.Wheelchair  pool  champ:  'Just  don't  quit'I  still  have  to  take  extra  precautions  with  my  health,  for  no  one  fully  understands  autonomic  neuropathy.  There  are  still  things  that  I  cannot  do,  which  frustrates  me  to  no  end,  but  I  remind  myself  that  I  can  do  far  more  than  I  could  years  ago.Having  overcome  what  I  have,  I  firmly  believe  that  life's  trials  are  there  for  a  reason  and  the  only  way  to  overcome  them  is  to  dedicate  yourself  to  something  about  which  you  truly  care.  Sometimes  the  only  thing  that  you  can  do  is  imagine  a  world  where  you  are  better.When  I  wrote,  I  escaped  to  a  world  that  was  entirely  my  own,  and  I  could  forget  for  a  few  minutes  the  stark  realities  of  the  one  I  was  currently  living  in.I  would  not  wish  those  three  years  on  anyone,  but  I  would  not  change  them  because  they  made  me  who  I  am  today,  and  for  that  I  am  eternally  grateful.  "The  Hidden  World"  is  the  culmination  of  the  last  five  years,  both  my  illness  and  recovery,  and  I  am  happy  to  present  it  to  the  world  as  the  silver  lining  to  my  years  of  sickness.</TEXT></DOC>

I'm  dead,"  Cassidy,  63,  said.  "You  know,  they  say  it's  a  slippery  slope.  ...  It's  not  a  slippery  slope.  It's  from  12:00  to  6:00  on  the  clock  and  the  whole  face  is  ice.  One  sip,  one  drink,  because  there  is  no  such  a  thing,  not  to  an  alcoholic.  You  have  one  and  you're  --  you're  done.  I'd  be  done."Cassidy  said  it  was  time  to  stop  being  in  denial  and  be  honest  with  himself."It's  very  painful,  especially  when  I  spent  most  of  my  life  being  what  I  would  consider  a  very  loving,  caring  charitable  man  and  someone  who  has  always  protected  my  own  image  until  the  time,  not  wanting  to  disappoint  the  millions  of  fans  that  I  have  around  the  world.  And,  and  it's  very  humbling  and  it's  also  humiliating."Cassidy  checked  into  rehab  in  South  Florida  after  being  arrested  on  a  DUI  charge  on  January  10  in  Los  Angeles  after  stopping  for  a  drink  on  his  way  to  the  airport.  He  pleaded  no  contest  and  received  a  sentence  of  five  years'  probation  and  90  days  in  rehab,  although  his  manager  said  he  will  be  credited  for  the  time  he  has  already  spent  in  residential  treatmentThat  incident  followed  DUI  arrests  in  August  2013  in  Schodack,  New  York,  (that  case  is  still  pending)  and  one  in  St.  Lucie  County,  Florida,  in  November  2010  for  which  he  received  a  sentence  of  a  year's  probation  and  had  his  license  suspended  for  six  months.  The  singer  also  received  community  service  and  a  fine  in  that  case.His  interview  with  Morgan  was  the  first  time  Cassidy  had  publicly  talked  about  his  struggle  to  stay  sober."I  am  most  definitely  an  alcoholic,"  Cassidy  said.  "And  the  interesting  thing  about  it  and  the  way  you  end  up  with  multiple  DUIs  --  I  never  got  arrested  for  anything  until  I  was  basically  60  years  old.  And  I  have  very,  very  strong  values  about  what  I  am  and  who  I  am."I've  done  an  enormous  amount  of  bringing  light  into  people's  lives,  and  I'm  very  proud  of  that  and  touching  and  inspiring  people."He  admitted  that  until  his  latest  arrest,  "I  had  been  lying  to  myself  and  consequently  lying  to  everyone  else  about  my  disease."Cassidy  came  to  fame  with  his  role  as  Keith  Partridge  in  the  hit  '70s  TV  show  "The  Partridge  Family,"  and  toured  the  world  singing  his  hit  songs.  At  the  time,  his  fan  club  was  bigger  than  Elvis  and  The  Beatles  and  he  continues  to  perform  around  the  country.The  drinking  began  in  2002,  he  said,  and  then  got  worse  over  time.  This  is  Cassidy's  third  stint  in  rehab."I  certainly  never  drank  or  took  any  drugs  or  narcotics,  contrary  to  whatever  has  been  printed,  when  I  was  doing  'The  Partridge  Family'  or  thereafter  for  that  matter,"  he  said.In  recent  months,  the  former  teen  idol  acknowledged  that  he  was  on  a  downward  spiral.In  addition  to  the  most  recent  arrest,  his  third  wife  filed  for  divorce.  Asked  how  she  would  react  to  how  the  drinking  affected  his  behavior,  he  told  Morgan,  "She'd  just  say  it  made  me  an  ass.  ...  you  know  it  made  me  a  fricking  d**k.  And  you  know,  I  wasn't  ...  authentic,  OK.  It's  because  I  have  an  allergy  to  it.  My  personality  changes  I'm  not  aware  of  it.  I  never  stop  talking,  you  know.  ...  it's  obnoxious.  It's  embarrassing."Despite  all  his  recent  setbacks,  Cassidy  said  he  had  recently  had  a  life-altering  "spiritual  experience.""I  dropped  to  my  knees  and  I  felt  something  go  through  me  that  was  like,  I  felt  this  experience  that  was  just,  thank  you  God.  I  felt  this  relief.  I  begged  it  and  I  was  crying  and  weeping  like  a  little  boy,  like  a,  like  a  sobbing  little  infant,  like  I'm  sure  I  did  many  times  as  a  kid.  And  I  felt  this  incredible  sense  of  relief  because  I  stopped  lying  to  myself,"  he  said.</TEXT></DOC>

His  remains  were  identified  through  fingerprints."He  would  sit  outside,  very  friendly,"  a  neighbor  told  CNN  affiliate  WDIV.  "Well-respected,  everyone  talked  to  him.  He  would  say  hi  to  everybody."Donna  Scrivo  was  being  held  with  bail  set  at  $100,000,  and  with  a  preliminary  hearing  set  for  February  14,  according  to  officials  at  the  news  conference.She  had  not  obtained  an  attorney  as  of  Monday  afternoon,  officials  said.CNN's  Joe  Sutton  and  Rick  Martin  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

She  also  created  many  of  Jagger's  looks  for  the  Rolling  Stones'  50th  anniversary  tour,  which  began  in  2012  and  is  currently  in  Australia.In  addition  to  her  haute  creations,  she  designed  a  collection  for  Banana  Republic  that  was  introduced  late  last  year."I  don't  really  jump  on  anything  unless  I  believe  it  will  deliver  the  quality  and  standards  I  stay  true  to.

Gen.  Valery  Yevnevich  will  return  to  Moscow  in  light  of  NATO's  actions,  official  news  agency  ITAR-Tass  said,  citing  Russian  Deputy  Defence  Minister  Anatoly  Antonov's  remarks  to  journalists."The  policy  of  (deliberately)  whipping  up  tensions  is  not  our  choice.  Nonetheless,  we  see  no  possibility  to  continue  military  cooperation  with  NATO  in  a  routine  regime,"  Antonov  is  quoted  as  saying.He  accused  NATO  Secretary  General  Anders  Fogh  Rasmussen  of  making  "confrontational  statements"  at  the  meeting  of  NATO  foreign  ministers  early  this  week  and  questioned  NATO  steps  to  bolster  its  presence  in  Eastern  Europe.Earlier,  Russian  Foreign  Minister  Sergey  Lavrov  also  said  Moscow  wanted  answers  from  NATO  regarding  activities  in  Eastern  Europe  after  the  Western  military  alliance  said  it  would  step  up  defenses  for  its  eastern  members.Russia's  move  to  annex  the  Crimea  region  from  Ukraine  last  month  has  sparked  the  worst  East-West  crisis  since  the  Cold  War  and  raised  fears  among  its  Eastern  European  neighbors.At  their  meeting,  NATO  foreign  ministers  decided  the  alliance  would  draw  up  plans  for  reinforcing  NATO's  defenses  following  Moscow's  annexation  of  Ukraine's  Crimea  region  --  which  the  West  deems  illegal.These  would  possibly  include  measures  such  as  sending  NATO  soldiers  and  equipment  to  allies  in  Eastern  Europe,  holding  more  exercises  and  ensuring  NATO's  rapid-reaction  force  could  deploy  more  quickly,  a  NATO  official  said.  It  could  also  include  a  possible  review  of  NATO's  military  plans."We  have  posed  these  questions  to  the  North  Atlantic  Alliance.  We  are  expecting  not  just  any  answer  but  an  answer  fully  respectful  of  the  rules  we  have  coordinated,"  Lavrov  told  a  joint  news  briefing  with  his  Kazakh  counterpart.Responding  to  criticism  from  Kiev  and  the  West  over  the  presence  of  Russian  troops  along  the  border  with  Ukraine,  Lavrov  said  Russia  had  the  right  to  move  forces  on  its  territory  and  said  they  would  return  to  their  permanent  bases  after  completing  military  exercises."Russian  troops  in  the  Rostov  region  will  return  to  their  bases  after  completing  military  exercises,"  he  said,  referring  to  an  area  near  the  Ukrainian  border.NATO's  military  chief  warned  Wednesday  that  Russian  troops  could  begin  moving  on  Ukraine  within  12  hours  of  being  given  an  order.  Gen.  Philip  Breedlove,  NATO's  supreme  allied  commander  Europe,  also  said  that  with  40,000  troops  massed  near  the  border,  Russia  has  all  the  components  necessary  to  move  on  Ukraine.Report:  Yanukovych  implicated  in  killingsIn  Ukraine,  a  newly  released  report  said  the  killings  of  protesters  in  the  Ukrainian  capital  during  anti-government  demonstrations  in  February  took  place  under  the  order  of  ousted  President  Viktor  Yanukovych.The  preliminary  report  by  the  Ukrainian  government  implicated  pro-Moscow  Yanukovych  in  the  covert  planning  of  a  series  of  sniper  attacks  in  Kiev,  backed  by  Russia,  during  the  rallies  that  eventually  led  him  to  flee  across  the  border.Presenting  the  findings  at  a  news  conference,  Interior  Minister  Arsen  Avakov  said  evidence  showed  Yanukovych  had  directly  ordered  snipers  to  open  fire  on  protesters.  Yanukovych,  now  in  Russia,  has  denied  personal  responsibility  for  the  bloodshed.Twelve  members  of  the  feared  Berkut  special  security  forces  have  been  detained  as  part  of  the  investigation,  Prosecutor  General  Oleh  Makhnytsky  announced.The  inquiry  looked  into  the  shootings  on  Instytutska  Street  in  Kiev,  where  dozens  were  killed  on  February  18-20.  Around  100  people  are  now  known  to  have  died  in  Ukraine  since  the  unrest  began  in  November  following  Yanukovych's  last-minute  U-turn  over  a  deal  with  the  European  Union  in  favor  of  closer  ties  with  Russia.The  new  government  in  Kiev  has  since  signed  the  political  part  of  the  association  agreement  with  the  EU.The  report  also  said  Russian  Federal  Security  Service  operatives  had  been  involved  in  planning  operations  against  the  protesters.  Ukrainian  Security  Service  chief  Valentyn  Nalyvaychenko  said  the  Russian  agency  had  sent  "tons"  of  explosives  and  weapons  by  plane  to  Ukraine.Moscow  has  claimed  far-right  protesters  were  behind  the  shootings  in  an  effort  to  stir  up  anger  against  Yanukovych.Gas  price  hikeMeanwhile,  the  head  of  Russia's  top  natural  gas  producer,  Gazprom,  said  it  would  further  increase  the  gas  price  for  Ukraine  to  $485  per  1,000  cubic  meters  as  of  April,  ITAR-Tass  quoted  him  as  saying.Gazprom  Chief  Executive  Alexei  Miller  said  the  price  would  increase  during  a  meeting  with  Russian  Prime  Minister  Dmitry  Medvedev,  who  urged  Ukraine  to  pay  off  its  gas  debts.The  increase  came  two  days  after  Gazprom  announced  a  44%  hike  in  the  gas  price  for  Ukraine,  starting  April  1,  to  $385.50  per  1,000  cubic  meters  due  to  the  unpaid  bills.Ukraine  also  owes  $2.2  billion  in  unpaid  natural  gas  bills,  Miller  said  during  his  meeting  with  Medvedev,  according  to  a  statement  issued  by  the  Prime  Minister's  office."Hopefully,  in  the  near  future,  Ukraine  will  start  repaying  its  debts  and  will  finance  its  ongoing  supplies;  however,  we  see  that  the  situation  is  not  improving,  and  is  only  getting  worse,"  Miller  is  quoted  as  saying.Europe  and  the  United  States  are  working  together  to  reduce  Ukraine's  reliance  on  Russian  energy  by  developing  alternative  sources  of  natural  gas,  U.S.  Secretary  of  State  John  Kerry  said  this  week.NASA  to  end  most  activities  with  RussiaCNN's  Marie-Louise  Gumuchian  and  Laura  Smith-Spark  wrote  and  reported  from  London  and  journalist  Victoria  Butenko  reported  from  Kiev.

And  none  of  us  first  saw  Bob  Newhart  wake  up  with  Suzanne  Pleshette  in  an  Instagram  photo.But  that  was  then  and  this,  in  all  its  Tivo,  Twitter  and  Hulu-centric  glory,  is  now.In  2014,  technology  has  handed  us  unprecedented  flexibility  in  how  we  keep  up  with  our  favorite  shows.  But  it's  also  making  it  harder  than  ever  to  avoid  walking  headlong  into  spoilers.One  social-media  click,  and  you  can  spoil  some  of  television's  biggest  moments  for  other  people  who  may  be  enjoying  the  same  shows  at  a  more  leisurely  pace.Despite  the  wealth  of  tech-driven  options  for  watching  and  sharing  TV,  we  still  can't  seem  to  agree  on  the  proper  etiquette  for  how  to  chat  online  about  it  without  ruining  it  for  somebody  else.Some  of  us  count  ourselves  among  the  No  Spoiler  Extremists:  "Enjoyed  the  show?  Well,  shut  up  about  it,  unless  you  know  you're  talking  with  (or  typing  to)  someone  else  who's  already  seen  it."(Full  disclosure:  That's  coming  from  someone  who,  as  an  excitable  lad,  responded  to  a  question  about  "Return  of  the  Jedi,"  with,  "It  was  great!  But  Yoda  dies.")At  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum  is  the  Not  My  Problem  Brigade:  "Don't  want  to  be  spoiled?  Then  watch  the  show  when  it  airs  or  stay  off  social  media  until  you  do.  Daryl's  hair  on  'The  Walking  Dead'  is  particularly  luscious  tonight  and  I  must  tell  the  world!"Then  there  are  all  the  other  folks  who  fall  somewhere  in  the  middle.  So,  let's  try  to  find  a  happy  medium,  shall  we?Here  are  some  tips  for  both  the  potential  spoiler  and  the  potential  spoilee  to  help  keep  all  of  us  TV  watchers  spoiler-free.TwitterIf  you're  a  spoiler:  Go  there.Unlike  other  social  platforms,  we've  all  pretty  much  agreed  that  Twitter  is  where  you  go  to  talk  about  TV  shows  while  they're  happening.Just  log  on  during  the  Super  Bowl,  the  Oscars,  a  presidential  debate  or  any  other  big  TV  event  and  you'll  see  why  CEO  Dick  Costolo  said  the  site  is  saving  live  television.Sure,  we've  got  all  that  tech  that  lets  us  watch  later.  But  part  of  the  fun  for  the  Web's  most  dedicated  couch  potatoes  has  become  watching  Twitter's  real-time  chatter  about  their  favorite  shows.If  you're  a  spoilee:  Don't  go  there.You've  been  warned.  Seriously.  The  place  is  a  140-character  wild,  wild  West.  If  you  follow  anyone  who  likes  the  same  shows  you  do  (and  why  would  you  not?),  don't  log  on  until  you're  caught  up.'Spoiler  alert'If  you're  a  spoiler:  Use  these.What  a  difference  two  little  words  can  make.  We  know  that  most  of  you  aren't  the  jackasses  who  ran  around  bookstore  parking  lots  yelling  "Snape  kills  Dumbledore!"  You  don't  want  to  ruin  the  surprise  for  folks  who  haven't  seen  it.  You  just  want  to  talk  to  folks  who  have.On  Facebook,  throwing  something  like  "SPOILER  ALERT"  or  "GAME  OF  THRONES  SPOILER"  at  the  beginning  of  your  post  gives  your  friends  at  least  a  fighting  chance  to  avert  their  eyes.If  you're  a  spoilee:  Scan  carefullyWe've  all  been  blindsided  by  spoilers,  and  sometimes  there's  not  much  you  can  do  about  it.  Witness  all  the  "Downton"  fans  who  were  hopping  mad  after  accidentally  learning  of  the  sudden  death  of  a  beloved  character  (two  characters,  actually)  in  season  3.But  if  you  know  you're  currently  missing  a  show  that  you  plan  to  catch  up  on,  especially  if  it's  a  season  finale  or  other  "very  special"  episode,  surf  with  one  eye  open.  Noticing  a  key  word  or  two  in  a  friend's  post  that  warns  of  unfamiliar  terrain  can  give  you  time  to  turn  around  and  read  elsewhere.Details,  detailsIf  you're  a  spoiler:  Save  details  for  the  comments  section.We're  mainly  talking  about  Facebook  here.  Nobody  blames  you  for  wanting  to  talk  about  the  "OMG  THAT  JUST  HAPPENED!"  moment.  So  how  about  something  like  this?:"SCANDAL  --  OMG  that  just  happened  !!!  (Spoilers  in  comments)."That  way,  your  friends  who  are  OMGing  along  with  you  can  head  to  the  comments  and  chatter  away.  (And,  yes,  we're  declaring  "OMG"  a  verb  for  now).If  you're  a  spoilee:  Uh,  don't  read  the  comments.Seriously.  If  you  can't  take  that  hint,  you've  kind  of  lost  our  sympathy  here.Take  it  elsewhereIf  you're  a  spoiler:  Create  your  own  space  to  shareMy  pals  Chris  and  Kathleen  are  funny.  And  they're  fans  of  "The  Walking  Dead."In  what  started  mostly  as  an  effort  to  crack  each  other  up  from  across  the  room,  they  began  posting  snarky  commentary,  random  observations  and  funny  pictures  to  Facebook  as  they  watched.  Until,  that  is,  they  received  the  obligatory  threats  of  physical  harm  from  friends  who  hadn't  yet  watched  the  latest  episode.And,  thus,  was  Chris  &  Kathleen's  Walking  Dead  Commentary  Page  born.You  don't  need  a  massive  following  to  create  your  own  page,  or  to  start  your  own  live  blog  dedicated  to  your  favorite  show.Just  go  ahead  and  build  that  digital  treehouse,  then  invite  a  few  friends  you  know  want  to  play  and  let  it  rip.  Your  slowpoke  friends  will  thank  you.  As  will,  you  know,  what's  her  name.  The  blonde  one.If  you're  a  spoilee:  Stay  awayIf  you've  signed  up  for  a  blog  like  this,  and  have  to  miss  an  episode,  don't  forget  to  stay  off  it  until  the  coast  is  clear.Do  you  have  tips  for  how  to  avoid  spoilers,  or  how  to  chat  about  your  favorite  shows  without  ruining  them  for  others?  Let  us  know  in  the  comments.</TEXT></DOC>

Todd  Baugh  told  CNN  affiliate  KTVQ  his  decision  is  unrelated  to  the  controversy  involving  Stacey  Dean  Rambold.  Yellowstone  County  District  Court  judge  came  under  fire  in  last  year  when  he  ordered  Rambold  to  serve  31  days  in  jail  and  more  than  14  years  on  probation  for  the  rape  of  the  student  who  later  committed  suicide.In  December,  Baugh  defended  his  decision,  calling  it  "the  right  kind  of  sentence.""If  the  Rambold  thing  was  the  only  factor,  I  wouldn't  retire  for  that,"  he  said  Monday.  "I'm  72-years-old,  I  guess  I  can  retire."Baugh  was  first  elected  in  1984  and  is  completing  his  fifth,  six-year  term  as  a  district  court  judge,  KTVQ  reported.Retirement  will  "allow  me  to  spend  a  little  more  time  with  my  grandchild  and  friends,  and  maybe  even  get  in  a  few  more  rounds  of  golf,"  he  said.  "God  willing,  I  won't  drive  (my  wife)  Linda  crazy."Judge  defends  former  teacher's  one-month  sentenceThe  controversyThere  is  a  pending  complaint  against  him  before  the  state  Judicial  Standards  CommissionIn  his  response  to  the  complaint,  Baugh  has  acknowledged  making  controversial  remarks  about  victim  Cherise  Morales  at  Rambold's  sentencing  in  August.  According  to  the  Montana  Attorney  General's  Office,  the  judge  said  she  looked  older  than  her  years  and  was  "probably  as  much  in  control  of  the  situation  as  was  the  defendant."Morales  committed  suicide  in  February  2010."I  am  sorry  I  made  those  remarks,"  the  judge  wrote  in  his  November  15  response.  "They  focused  on  the  victim  when  that  aspect  of  the  case  should  have  been  focused  on  the  defendant."Baugh  said  he  weighed  all  relevant  factors  in  passing  sentence."The  defendant's  last  legal  or  moral  transgression  was  the  crime  he  committed  and  admitted,"  he  wrote.  "In  the  ensuing  almost  six  years,  he  had  legally  and  morally  good  conduct,  he  was  reinstated  in  sex  offender  treatment  and  the  undisputed  evidence  supported  community  placement  and  treatment."The  length  of  the  sentence,  Baugh's  comments  and  the  age  disparity  between  defendant  and  victim  drew  criticism  and  a  firestorm  of  media  attention.The  Montana  Attorney  General's  Office  in  November  appealed  the  31-day  sentence,  saying  it  did  not  meet  the  state's  mandatory  minimum  sentence.Rambold  had  sexual  relations  with  Morales  in  fall  2007,  when  she  was  14  and  a  student  in  one  of  his  classes  at  Billings  Senior  High  in  Billings,  Montana.  She  confided  in  a  church  group  leader  and  Rambold  was  charged  in  October  2008  with  three  counts  of  sexual  intercourse  without  consent.Opinion:  In  Montana,  a  case  study  in  rape  cultureCNN's  Ralph  Ellis  and  Kyung  Lah  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

But  no  sign  of  drugs  were  detected  and  no  illegal  substances  were  found,  the  source  said.Bieber's  interview  was  described  by  another  law  enforcement  source  as  one  that  is  carried  out  for  anyone  entering  the  United  States,  and  that  it  can  take  10  minutes  or  10  hours.  The  interview  is  routinely  conducted  to  ensure  people  entering  the  country  are  in  compliance  with  U.S.  law,  the  source  said.Bieber  was  interviewed  for  several  hours  before  being  cleared  to  enter  the  United  States.The  plane  sat  on  the  airport  tarmac  for  at  least  four  hours,  and  CNN  saw  law  enforcement  officers  getting  off  the  plane.Customs  and  Border  Protection  officials  did  not  immediately  respond  to  a  CNN  request  for  comment.It's  the  latest  headache  for  the  embattled  singer,  who  has  made  a  number  of  headlines  in  recent  weeks.Bieber's  plane  was  en  route  from  Canada,  where  on  Wednesday  he  surrendered  to  Toronto  police,  who  booked  him  on  an  assault  charge.  He  was  accused  of  hitting  a  limousine  driver  a  month  ago.That  same  day,  Florida  authorities  released  police  documents  that  accused  Bieber  of  being  under  the  influence  of  alcohol,  pot  and  Xanax  when  police  stopped  him  for  allegedly  street  racing  in  Miami  Beach  last  week.Bieber  was  booked  on  charges  of  driving  under  the  influence,  resisting  arrest  and  driving  with  an  expired  license.  He  was  briefly  jailed,  and  his  attorney  has  entered  a  not  guilty  plea  on  his  behalf.The  two  arrests  come  on  the  heels  of  allegations  that  he  egged  a  neighbor's  house  in  Calabasas,  California,  causing  thousands  of  dollars  in  damage  in  the  process.When  authorities  searched  the  singer's  home  as  part  of  the  investigation  into  the  alleged  egg-throwing,  a  sheriff's  deputy  found  suspected  illegal  drugs  at  the  bedside  of  Bieber  house  guest  Lil  Za,  who  now  faces  a  felony  drug  charge.A  prosecutor  is  expected  to  decide  as  early  as  next  week  whether  Bieber  will  be  charged  with  felony  vandalism  in  connection  with  the  case.Since  being  discovered  in  2008  performing  cover  songs  in  clips  posted  on  YouTube,  Bieber  shot  into  the  superstar  stratosphere  with  a  legion  of  young  fans  known  as  Beliebers.But  his  onstage  persona,  once  so  appealing  to  parents  of  his  'tween  fans,  started  taking  hits.From  being  accused  of  public  urination  to  rumors  of  a  visit  to  a  Brazilian  brothel  and  run-ins  with  police,  including  a  search  of  his  Calabasas  home  by  authorities  in  connection  with  the  egging  case,  his  once  squeaky  clean  image  has  all  but  disappeared.In  its  place,  a  bad-boy  image  that  has  a  number  of  critics,  including  some  calling  for  the  Canadian-born  Bieber's  deportation.The  petition,  titled  "Deport  Justin  Bieber  and  revoke  his  green  card,"  had  garnered  more  than  100,000  signatures.Bieber  has  a  visa  allowing  him  to  legally  live  in  the  United  States  because  of  his  "extraordinary  ability"  in  the  arts.Bieber's  musical  mentor,  Usher  Raymond,  a  former  teen  star  himself,  told  MTV  in  December  2013  that  his  young  protege  was  experiencing  the  pains  of  growing  up  in  the  spotlight."With  success  comes  great  responsibility.  And  being  able  to  grow  up  in  it  and  unfortunately  be  analyzed  in  front  of  the  world  for  just  growing  up,  I  think  they  will  be  able  to  see  the  truth,"  Usher  said.  "And  they  can  make  an  assessment  based  off  of  what  his  reality  looks  like."On  Thursday,  Bieber  took  to  Twitter  to  thank  supporters  in  his  hometown  of  Stratford,  Canada,  where  he  took  refuge  before  flying  to  New  Jersery."Never  forget  where  you  come  from  or  those  who  supported  you  before  anyone  else.  still  the  small  town  kid.  thanks,"  he  tweeted.Could  Justin  Bieber  be  deported?Susan  Candiotti  reported  from  Teterboro,  New  Jersey;  and  Chelsea  J.

The  NVIDIA  marketing  team  is  behind  this  phenomenon,"  Huang  said  as  he  stood  in  front  of  a  picture  of  the  manicured  field.  "What  you're  looking  at  here  is  310  feet  in  diameter.  It  is  what  people  call  a  crop  circle."Huang  made  the  announcement  during  a  keynote  address  Sunday  night  at  the  Consumer  Electronics  Show  in  Las  Vegas."It's  like,  out  of  this  world,  it's  practically  built  by  aliens,"  Huang  said,  referring  to  the  new  Tegra  K1  graphics  chip.Elaborate  crop  circle  in  California  mowed  downBrett  Murray,  who  works  as  a  marketer  for  the  company,  told  CNN  in  a  telephone  interview  that  the  idea  emerged  during  a  brainstorming  session  in  early  December  about  how  to  introduce  the  new  product.They  came  up  with  the  tag  line,  "Impossibly  advanced,"  then  tried  to  figure  out  how  to  "get  some  noise"  around  it,  he  said.From  "impossibly  advanced"  to  "aliens"  was  not  a  big  leap.  "We  eventually  said,  'You  know,  what's  graceful  and  alien?  Crop  circles.'"They  then  set  to  work,  swearing  everyone  to  secrecy,  hiring  a  Hollywood  location  scout  to  find  "the  perfect  field  in  Northern  California,"  and  flying  in  a  British  group  who  have  made  crop  circles  before.Starting  buzz  for  the  creation,  the  company  called  anonymous  tip  lines  for  news  stations  in  the  Bay  Area,  telling  them:  "Something's  going  on  out  in  Chualar."A  crudely  made  video  also  popped  up  on  YouTube  purporting  to  show  two  men  --  in  reality,  Murray  and  another  NVIDIA  employee  --  getting  out  of  a  car  and  looking  at  strange  lights  coming  from  the  farmer's  field  and  then  stumbling  toward  them.By  the  morning  of  December  30,  the  news  trucks  were  rolling  in  and,  with  them,  throngs  of  curious  onlookers.  The  company  hired  security  to  keep  them  from  trampling  over  the  farmer's  fields.Murray  described  the  crop  circle  as  "a  puzzle  out  there  for  the  world  to  solve."The  puzzle  included  clues  to  who  was  behind  it  --  for  example,  the  number  192  is  posted  in  two  ways  in  the  design  --  as  numbers  on  a  clock  and  as  a  Braille  representation.That's  the  number  of  graphical  processing  unit  cores  in  the  new  chip.  At  least  one  person  appears  to  have  figured  it  all  out.  John  Van  Vliet  posted  this  at  12:16  a.m.  Wednesday,  January  1,  on  doubtfulnews.com:  "The  crop  art  really  dose  (sic)  look  like  a  graphics  GPU  chip  if  i  had  to  bet  ...  one  of  the  NEW  CPU/GPU  combos  from  AMD  or  Nvidia  or  intell."Murray  said  he  understood  why  the  story  attracted  so  much  attention.  "This  is  like  Santa  Claus,"  he  said.  "People  want  to  believe."</TEXT></DOC>

Hardy  says  it's  tempting  to  think  of  nuclear  family  as  an  ideal  and  universal  norm,  but  it's  not.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Janet  W.  Hardy,  a  writer,  editor  and  consultant,  has  published  11  books,  including  the  best-selling,  "The  Ethical  Slut:  A  Practical  Guide  to  Polyamory,  Open  Relationships  and  Other  Adventures."  She  has  taught  workshops  about  alternative  sexualities  and  relationships  all  over  the  world.(CNN)  --  I  grew  up  in  the  early  1960s  in  an  affluent  suburb  on  the  East  Coast.  Every  child  I  knew  went  home  to  a  family  that  looked  like  mine:  a  mom  at  home  waiting  for  us,  and  a  dad  who  showed  up  a  few  hours  later  in  time  for  dinner.How  tempting  it  is  to  remember  such  households  as  an  ideal  and  universal  norm.  But  they  were  rarely  ideal,  and  they  were  never  universal.Let's  not  discuss  the  stresses  that  affected  those  nuclear  families.  Let's  just  talk  about  the  innumerable  people  who,  by  virtue  of  race,  background,  health  or  circumstance,  could  not  --  or  did  not  want  to  --  live  in  such  families.Instead,  they  lived  in  single-parent  households,  in  households  with  two  men  or  two  women,  in  extended  families  of  grandparents  and  aunts  and  grown  siblings,  in  households  where  multiple  adults  pooled  money  and  skills  to  make  ends  meet,  and  in  many  other  configurations.Back  then,  it  never  occurred  to  the  people  I  knew  to  call  those  configurations  "families."  Today,  in  a  more  tolerant  era,  that  old  standard  of  the  nuclear  family  is  still  encoded  in  our  laws  and  our  tax  code,  as  well  as  in  the  antiquated  and  judgmental  phrase  "family  values."Among  my  own  circle  of  acquaintances,  I  hold  many  "alternative  families"  close  to  my  heart:--  A  man  and  two  women  who  have  been  raising  their  two  children  together  from  infancy  through  high  school.--  Three  men  who  have  shared  a  loving  household  for  nearly  20  years.--  A  "core  couple,"  married  for  many  decades,  who  have  consistently  surrounded  themselves  with  long-term,  live-in  lovers.--  Two  couples  who  share  a  duplex  and  a  busy  and  intermingled  sex  life.--  A  long-partnered  gay  man  and  lesbian  woman  who  together  brought  a  third,  lesbian  woman  into  their  household  because  the  female  half  of  the  pair  missed  that  part  of  her  life.Polyamory:  When  three  isn't  a  crowdThere  are  as  many  configurations  of  genders,  ages  and  numbers  as  you  can  imagine.  These  are  families  as  surely  as  any  family  you've  welcomed  into  your  neighborhood.  They  share  property,  raise  children,  tend  to  their  homes  and  communities.Last  month,  in  a  case  involving  the  plural  family  portrayed  on  the  reality  show  "Sister  Wives,"  a  Nevada  judge  overturned  a  ban  against  cohabitation,  enabling  consenting  adults  to  form  whatever  style  of  household  meets  their  desires  and  needs.  He  refused,  however,  to  overturn  the  part  of  the  law  that  banned  plural  marriages.Most  Americans,  when  they  think  of  plural  marriage,  associate  it  with  the  one-male,  multifemale  households  of  a  rebel  offshoot  of  Mormonism  and  of  some  contemporary  Muslim  cultures  --  popularly  known  as  "polygamy"  (many  spouses  of  both  sexes),  but  more  accurately  called  "polygyny"  (many  wives).  However,  these  polygynous  marriages  represent  only  a  fraction  of  the  ways  in  which  adults  form  families.Many  people  rightly  feel  some  concern  about  religious  polygyny's  history  of  abuse  and  nonconsent  and  might  feel  that  anti-plural  marriage  laws  are  necessary  to  prevent  such  exploitation.  However,  strong  laws  already  exist  against  forcing  anyone  into  sex  or  marriage  of  any  kind  --  vigorous  enforcement  would  surely  suffice  to  protect  the  unwilling  in  a  plural  marriage  recognized  under  the  law.More  problematic,  of  course,  are  issues  such  as  child  custody,  inheritance,  hospital  visitation,  etc.,  when  more  than  two  parties  are  involved.  It  is  clear  that  the  current  legal  structure  of  marriage  cannot  readily  accommodate  this  problem.  For  that  reason,  the  Nevada  judge's  ruling  was  probably  correct,  at  least  for  now.One  solution  for  the  future,  though,  might  be  to  designate  "marriage"  as  a  social  institution  with  no  legal  standing  and  to  create  "civil  union"  as  a  legally  recognized  subtype  of  business  partnership,  available  to  anyone  who  is  willing  to  make  the  appropriate  commitments.These  civil  unions  could  range  from  an  Ozzie  and  Harriet  nuclear  pairing  to  a  multipartner,  multigenerational  line  marriage  out  of  a  Robert  Heinlein  science  fiction  novel.  They  would  be  required  to  make  agreements  about  how  they  would  handle  the  basic  functions  of  family  --  caring  for  children  and  the  elderly,  sharing  property,  ensuring  succession,  and  so  on  --  and  to  sign  contracts,  just  as  business  partners  would.  If  they  also  felt  the  need  for  the  social  or  religious  status  of  marriage,  they  could  seek  out  an  institution  willing  to  support  them  in  that  goal.I  am  sure  that  many  marriage  equality  opponents  reading  this  are  shouting  "I  told  you  so!"  as  their  predictions  that  plural  marriage  would  follow  same-sex  marriage  come  nightmarishly  true.  Many  grew  up  as  I  did,  in  a  time  and  place  where  the  single-wage-earner  nuclear  family  was  the  unquestioned  norm  and  would  like  to  see  their  country  conform  to  that  unrealistic  standard  for  the  rest  of  history.But  even  then,  the  nuclear  family  was  an  uncomfortable  fit  for  many,  and  an  impossible  dream  for  others.  The  America  in  which  I  want  my  children  and  grandchildren  to  live  will  make  room  for  all  kinds  of  families,  and  it  will  offer  the  same  support  and  benefits  --  legally,  financially  and  socially  --  to  any  family  that  is  based  on  a  core  of  love,  consent  and  mutual  responsibility.That's  what  "family  values"  should  really  be  about.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinionJoin  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinionThe  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Janet  W.

It's  all  okay  with  him.Beaming  a  warm  smile  from  beneath  his  push-broom  mustache,  the  softly  spoken  74-year-old  doesn't  strike  you  as  a  pioneering  innovator  --  the  man  responsible  for  a  breakthrough  that's  now  driving  forward  the  world  of  manufacturing.But  Chuck  Hull  --  "in  this  kind  of  environment,  it's  usually  'Chuck',"  he  says,  as  he  sits  down  with  CNN  in  Frankfurt,  Germany  --  is  executive  vice  president  and  chief  technology  officer  of  3D  Systems,  a  company  built  on  his  creation:  the  3D  printer.In  1983,  Hull  was  working  for  a  small  business  that  made  tough  coatings  for  tables  using  ultraviolet  lamps.  When  he  suggested  a  new  way  to  use  the  UV  technology  --  to  quickly  turn  computer  designs  into  working  prototypes  --  Hull  was  given  a  little  lab  to  play  around  in  during  his  evenings  and  weekends.Hull  experimented  for  months,  on  his  own  with  a  plastic-y  gloop  --  then  one  night,  something  emerged...CNN:  When  you  began,  what  materials  exactly  were  you  using?Hull:  The  class  of  materials  is  called  "photopolymers"  and  these  are  typically  acrylic-based  materials  that  would  be  liquid  until  they're  hit  with  --  let's  say  --  an  ultraviolet  light.  Then,  they  instantly  turn  solid.  So,  you  have  a  vat  of  this  liquid  and  a  point  of  ultraviolet  light,  and  you  turn  it  into  a  solid  piece  of  plastic.And  that's  the  basic  method?That's  the  basic  methodology  --  that's  stereolithography.  That's  never  changed.Who  was  the  first  person  you  showed  it  to?Er,  my  wife.  I  got  a  good  part  and  called  her  up,  got  her  out  of  her  pajamas,  told  her  to  come  down  to  the  lab  and  see  this.What  did  she  say?"This  had  better  be  good!"  (Laughs.)Explore:  The  3D  printing  revolutionAnd  then,  when  did  you  see  3D  printing  take  off?Well,  it's  really  blossomed  just  in  the  last  few  years  --  in  the  sense  of  really  rapid  growth  and  recognition.  There's  a  lots  of  things  that  contributed  to  that,  I  think:  a  lot  of  the  medical  applications  catch  peoples'  imagination;  certainly  the  maker  movement,  with  low-cost  machines  getting  hobbyists  interested  in  inventing  and  building  using  3D  printing.How  did  the  process  develop  into  what  it  is  today?One  of  the  most  significant  [changes]  is  the  basic  accuracy  you  can  achieve:  because  [the  materials]  cure  from  a  liquid  to  a  solid,  they  tend  to  shrink  and  they  can  distort.  So  as  you  build  these  3D  parts  you  get  some  inaccuracies  and  warp-age.  But  that  chemistry  has  been  vastly  improved,  so  there's  almost  no  distortion  now.  Also  the  physical  properties:  initially  the  materials  were  really  brittle  --  they  would  break  easily.  Nowadays  you  get  really  good,  tough  plastic  materials.I  hear  the  word  "democratization"  used  about  3D  printing.  Is  that  important  to  you?The  whole  premise  of  this  technology  has  been  to  foster  creativity,  and  change  in  product  design  and  manufacturing,  and  so  forth.  At  the  individual  level,  I  think  there's  a  great  kind  of  pent  up  need:  we've  got  into  the  computer  age  and  everything  is  on  a  screen  or  remote,  we've  kind  of  missed  the  tangible  result.  This  is  a  means  to  convert  something  on  the  computer  to  reality  in  a  straightforward  way.Read:  3-D  printing  tries  to  find  a  homeCould  you  have  imagined  all  this?(Laughs.)  Not  at  the  consumer  level.  I  was  always  thinking  in  terms  of  design  engineers  --  in  terms  of  their  expensive  CAD  computers  and  so  forth.What  do  you  think  the  industry  is  worth  now?I  think,  well,  in  terms  of  the  total  goods  and  services,  it's  about  $3  billion  annually  and  it's  actually  growing  at  a  rapid  rate.Are  there  limits  to  what  3D  printing  can  do?There's  limits  to  everything.  So,  the  kind  of  traditional  limits  of  3D  printing  have  been:  material  properties,  speed,  making  millions  of  things.

And  people  think  fashion  models  are  all  beauty  and  no  brains.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  The  term  "software  engineer"  conjures  images  of  pasty-faced  young  men  with  poor  posture  and  limited  social  skills.  And  people  think  fashion  models  are  all  beauty  and  no  brains.At  least,  those  are  the  stereotypes.So  what  will  the  world  make  of  Lyndsey  Scott,  a  model  for  Prada  and  Victoria's  Secret,  who  spends  her  spare  time  building  mobile  apps?  The  29-year-old  has  appeared  in  major  magazines  like  Harper's  Bazaar,  W  and  British  Vogue,  but  seems  more  proud  of  getting  her  iPhone  and  iPad  apps  approved  by  Apple."With  modeling,  you  never  have  control  over  anything,"  Scott  told  CNN.  "So  being  able  to  have  complete  power  with  these  apps  I  develop  is  very  fulfilling."Scott  has  built  several  apps  for  iOS  platforms.  Two  are  currently  sold  in  the  Apple  store,  and  she's  preparing  to  release  a  social  networking  app  in  coming  weeks.Before  the  self-taught  programmer  began  modeling  for  high-end  designers  like  Louis  Vuitton,  Prada,  Gucci,  Fendi  and  Vera  Wang,  she  was  an  undiscovered  New  Jersey  teen  who  loved  playing  calculator  games.In  high  school,  she  taught  herself  the  software  documentation  and  quickly  learned  how  to  program  on  her  TI-89  calculator."I  didn't  realize  I  was  even  coding  at  that  point,"  Scott  said.  "I  first  got  into  it  just  to  make  fun  games  and  entertain  myself."Her  game-coding  skills  didn't  score  her  many  points  with  her  classmates,  however.  The  5-foot-9-inch  model  said  she  was  a  late  bloomer  and  that  growing  up  "is  still  hard  to  talk  about"  because  of  the  bullying  and  taunting  she  endured."It  got  so  bad  in  high  school  I  couldn't  even  look  people  in  the  face,"  Scott  said.  "I  would  hide  out  in  school  so  I  wouldn't  have  to  eat  lunch  in  the  cafeteria  or  see  people  in  between  classes."At  Amherst  College,  Scott  learned  coding  languages  Java,  C++  and  MIPS  while  majoring  in  theater  and  computer  science.  But  instead  of  pursuing  a  programming  career,  she  plunged  into  modeling.She  got  her  big  modeling  break  in  2009  when  she  became  the  first  African-American  to  land  an  exclusive  contract  with  Calvin  Klein  for  New  York  Fashion  Week."It  happened  at  a  time  when  there  was  no  interest  in  me  as  a  model,"  she  said.  "I  always  dreamed  of  it,  but  I  wasn't  expecting  it  at  all.  I  was  beyond  surprised."That  same  year  Scott  was  chosen  for  one  of  the  year's  most  coveted  fashion  shows:  Victoria's  Secret.  She  said  she  was  "shocked  and  honored"  to  join  a  lineup  of  supermodels  including  Heidi  Klum,  Miranda  Kerr  and  Alessandra  Ambrosio.Meanwhile,  she  continued  challenging  expectations  by  teaching  herself  how  to  program  Python  and  Objective-C."I  think  a  lot  of  models  thought  I  was  strange  having  a  computer  on  my  lap  in  the  middle  of  a  casting  line,"  Scott  said.  "I  never  really  talked  about  programming  in  the  modeling  business.  I  kept  the  worlds  very  divided."Scott's  first  iOS  app  was  a  charity-based  project  aimed  at  helping  young  scholars  in  Uganda.  The  app,  Educate!,  finds  sponsors  for  Ugandan  students  and  guides  them  toward  becoming  leaders  and  entrepreneurs."I  learned  about  Educate!  in  college.  It  was  an  organization  founded  by  two  Amherst  students.  When  I  found  out  that  Uganda  has  the  youngest  population  in  the  world  and  the  highest  youth  poverty  rate,  I  wanted  to  get  involved,"  she  said."It  was  rejected  (by  Apple)  a  few  times.  I  had  a  big  battle  with  Apple,  going  back  and  forth,  so  it  was  a  huge  relief  when  it  finally  passed."She  has  since  developed  several  more  applications,  including  iPort,  which  helps  models  and  other  creative  types  organize  their  professional  portfolios  on  an  iPad."I  noticed  so  many  models  were  using  iPads  to  show  casting  directors  their  work,  but  it  looked  messy  and  didn't  have  a  nice  interface,"  Scott  said.  "So  I  made  iPort  as  similar  functionally  as  an  actual  portfolio  but  much  more  convenient."Her  brother,  Matthew,  is  one  of  her  biggest  fans."Lyndsey  is  a  mix  of  Bill  Gates  and  Giselle  (Bundchen),"  said  Matthew  Scott.  "She  combines  her  passion  for  modeling  and  passion  of  coding  to  help  improve  our  world."Last  month,  Scott  visited  a  middle  school  in  New  York  City's  Harlem  neighborhood  to  speak  with  students  interested  in  computer  programming."We  have  this  idea  of  people  in  technology  being  and  looking  a  certain  way,"  she  said.  "That  stereotype  is  destructive,  and  I  think  that's  part  of  the  reason  why  female  and  minority  programmers  are  so  few."Scott  said  computer  coding  has  now  become  a  second  professional  life  for  her.  She  has  plans  for  many  more  apps,  and  wants  to  learn  coding  for  Android  as  well.The  young  dual-career  woman  would  never  have  called  herself  a  nerd  while  growing  up  because  she  saw  it  as  a  hurtful  word  at  the  time."But  now  that  I'm  older,  if  it  means  being  smart  and  having  interests  like  computer  science,  then  I  have  no  problem  being  a  nerd,"  she  said.</TEXT></DOC>

The  hospital  had  previously  said  it  needed  the  coroner's  consent  for  the  transfer  because  Jahi  was  legally  dead.Jahi  --  who  was  declared  brain-dead  December  12  after  post-surgery  complications  that  her  family  says  included  severe  bleeding  and  cardiac  arrest  --  was  moved  from  the  hospital  Sunday  accompanied  by  a  critical-care  team.  She  was  attached  to  a  ventilator,  but  with  no  feeding  tube  in  place.On  Monday,  Dolan  said  Jahi  was  being  given  antibiotics  to  fight  infections  and  nutritional  support."They're  giving  her  everything  that  a  person  who  would  have  a  chance  to  live  would  be  getting,"  he  said.He  declined  to  provide  details  about  the  type  of  facility,  citing  privacy  and  security  concerns."She's  where  she's  going  to  be  for  a  while,"  he  said.  "She  needs  to  be  medically  stabilized,  medically  treated."On  Sunday,  the  president  of  a  rehabilitation  center  in  New  York  told  CNN  that  the  facility  would  gladly  accept  Jahi.  But  Dolan  said  the  family  has  no  plans  to  give  more  details  about  her  location."We've  had  people  make  threats  from  around  the  country.  It's  sad  that  people  act  that  way,"  Dolan  said.  "So  for  Jahi's  safety  and  those  around  her,  we  will  not  be  saying  where  she  went  or  where  she  is."At  least  five  different  facilities  that  originally  offered  to  care  for  Jahi  fell  through,  he  said.  But  ultimately,  the  family  chose  from  a  number  of  offers."There  were  other  facilities  that  still  had  their  hand  extended,"  he  said.  "But  we  took  the  first  one  that  we  knew  would  pull  us  in."Let  parents  decide  if  teen  is  deadThe  surgeryJahi's  case  drew  national  attention  and  fueled  debate  as  a  fierce  court  battle  unfolded  between  devastated  family  members  fighting  to  keep  her  on  a  ventilator  and  doctors  arguing  she'd  already  died.Family  members  say  the  eighth-grader  was  alert  and  talking  after  doctors  removed  her  tonsils,  adenoids  and  extra  sinus  tissue  in  a  surgery  at  the  Oakland  hospital  on  December  9.Doctors  had  recommended  the  surgery  to  treat  pediatric  obstructive  sleep  apnea,  a  condition  which  made  her  stop  breathing  in  her  sleep  and  caused  other  medical  problems.Before  the  surgery,  Jahi  said  she  was  worried  that  she  would  never  wake  up,  according  to  her  uncle.  She  seemed  fine  after  the  surgery,  but  asked  for  a  Popsicle  because  her  throat  hurt.Not  long  afterward,  something  went  terribly  wrong.  In  an  intensive  care  unit,  the  girl  began  bleeding  profusely,  the  family  said.According  to  family  members,  Jahi  went  into  cardiac  arrest.  Days  later,  she  was  declared  brain-dead.Hospital  officials  have  said  privacy  laws  prevent  them  from  discussing  details  of  the  case.The  court  battle  and  the  medical  debateThe  family  and  the  hospital  disagreed  over  whether  to  disconnect  her  from  a  ventilator,  and  the  issue  wound  up  in  Alameda  Superior  Court.In  court  documents  and  public  comments,  the  hospital  maintained  that  there's  no  doubt  that  McMath  is  brain-dead,  describing  the  condition  as  irreversible."No  amount  of  prayer,  no  amount  of  hope,  no  amount  of  any  type  of  medical  procedure  will  bring  her  back,"  Children's  Hospital  Oakland  spokesman  Sam  Singer  said  last  month.  "The  medical  situation  here  in  this  case  is  that  Jahi  McMath  died  several  weeks  ago."A  judge  on  December  23  appointed  Dr.  Paul  Fisher,  chief  of  pediatric  neurology  at  Stanford  Children's  Hospital,  to  evaluate  Jahi.Fisher  concluded  the  next  day  that  she  met  the  criteria  for  brain  death.  According  to  a  court  filing,  Fisher  found  that  the  girl's  pupils  were  fully  dilated  and  unresponsive  to  light  and  that  she  did  not  respond  to  a  variety  of  intense  stimuli.His  report  also  says  Jahi  showed  no  sign  of  breathing  on  her  own  when  a  ventilator  was  removed:  "Patient  failed  apnea  test."  The  report  says  her  heart  was  beating  only  because  of  the  mechanical  ventilator.In  addition,  an  imaging  test  showed  no  blood  flow  to  Jahi's  brain,  while  another  showed  no  sign  of  electrical  activity.Fisher's  conclusion:  "Overall,  unfortunate  circumstances  in  13-year-old  with  known,  irreversible  brain  injury  and  now  complete  absence  of  cerebral  function  and  complete  absence  of  brainstem  function,  child  meets  all  criteria  for  brain  death,  by  professional  societies  and  state  of  California."After  seeing  Fisher's  report,  Alameda  Superior  Court  Judge  Evelio  Grillo  concluded  on  December  24  that  Jahi  was  brain  dead.  But  Grillo  twice  ruled  that  the  hospital  had  to  hold  off  on  disconnecting  Jahi  from  life  support,  ultimately  giving  the  family  and  the  facility  until  January  7  to  come  to  a  resolution.The  Alameda  County  coroner  issued  a  death  certificate  for  Jahi  on  Friday,  listing  December  12  as  the  date  of  death.  The  certificate  still  needed  to  be  accepted  by  the  health  department  to  become  official.Medical  ethicists,  meanwhile,  say  the  high-profile  case  fuels  a  misperception:  that  "brain  death"  is  somehow  not  as  final  as  cardiac  death,  even  though,  by  definition,  it  is.  The  case  is  "giving  the  impression  that  dead  people  can  come  back  to  life,"  Arthur  Caplan,  director  of  the  Division  of  Medical  Ethics  at  NYU  Langone  Medical  Center,  told  CNN  last  month.Family  members  say  they've  seen  reason  for  hopeJahi's  family  members  maintain  that  they're  hoping  for  a  miracle.Her  mother  told  CNN  last  month  that  she'd  seen  improvements,  including  indications  from  a  hospital  monitor  that  she  said  suggest  her  daughter  was  trying  to  breathe  on  her  own.The  girl's  uncle,  Omari  Sealey,  told  reporters  last  week  that  Jahi  moves  when  her  mother  speaks  and  touches  her.  Sealey  also  said  that  a  pediatrician  has  seen  Jahi  and  has  sworn  she  is  not  dead.Hawaii  girl,  3,  dies  after  dental  procedureWhen  asked  about  the  girl's  possible  movement,  Singer,  the  hospital  spokesman,  said  he  would  not  comment  directly  on  any  claims  the  family  makes,  citing  privacy  laws.  However,  Singer  said  it  is  "quite  common"  for  the  muscles  of  brain  dead  patients  to  move,  stressing  it's  "not  a  sign  of  life."So  far  the  family  has  raised  more  than  $50,000  on  GoFundMe.com  to  move  her.  According  to  the  site,  more  than  1,300  people  have  donated  money  in  10  days."We're  very  grateful,  very  proud,"  said  Sealey,  Jahi's  uncle.  "We  want  to  thank  everyone  that  supported  us,  everyone  that  stood  in  our  corner,  everyone  that  prayed  for  us,  everyone  that  helped  donate  to  make  this  possible.  Without  you  guys,  none  of  this  would  be  possible."He  didn't  rule  out  the  possibility  that  the  family  could  eventually  file  a  lawsuit  against  the  hospital.  But  he  dismissed  concerns  that  details  about  what  happened  during  and  after  Jahi's  surgery  could  be  lost  if  she  remains  on  a  ventilator."That's  pretty  much  saying  that  she's  evidence  and  she's  a  body,  and  we  don't  look  at  it  that  way,"  Sealey  said.  "We're  not  worried  about  accountability.  We're  worried  about  survival."In  releasing  Jahi,  the  hospital  said:  "Our  hearts  go  out  to  the  family  as  they  grieve  for  this  sad  situation  and  we  wish  them  closure  and  peace."When  routine  surgeries  go  wrongCNN's  Joe  Sutton,  Martin  Savidge,  Janet  DiGiacomo,  Greg  Botelho,  Elizabeth  Landau  and  Caleb  Hellerman  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Craig  remembers  writing  an  impassioned  opinion  article  in  support  of  same-sex  parents  while  in  high  school.  What  she  didn't  write  was  that  her  father's  business  partner  was  also  his  life  partner.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Sienna  Craig  is  an  associate  professor  of  anthropology  at  Dartmouth  College,  where  she  teaches  courses  on  health  and  illness,  global  health,  Asian  medical  systems,  Tibet  and  the  Himalaya.(CNN)  --  Gay  people  should  be  allowed  to  be  parents  --  Pro  or  Con.It  was  1989.  I  was  15,  a  junior  at  a  public  high  school  in  Southern  California  and  the  newly  appointed  editor  of  my  school  newspaper.  Our  advisor  challenged  the  staff  with  a  call  for  public  debates  of  controversial  issues  on  our  opinion  pages.I  argued  the  pro  position.  In  a  move  I  now  associate  with  the  path  I've  taken  as  an  anthropologist  --  a  trade  that  specializes  in  making  the  strange  familiar  and  the  familiar  strange  --  I  invoked  cross-cultural  models  of  child-rearing.  But  mostly,  my  argument  hinged  on  love.If  two  people  of  the  same  sex  loved  each  other,  were  secure  in  their  relationship  and  wanted  to  have  a  family,  what  made  them  any  less  "fit"  as  parents  than  a  heterosexual  couple?  Indeed,  one  might  even  say  that  given  the  societal  pressures  and  challenges  they  must  be  prepared  to  face,  a  same-sex  couple  might  even  be  better  role  models  than  two  people  who  had  had  an  easier  path  to  parenthood.Fast  forward  to  today:  If  public  opinion  polls  on  the  question  of  same-sex  marriage  are  any  indication  of  how  the  majority  of  Americans  have  come  to  see  the  issue,  we  have  a  great  deal  to  celebrate.  Even  so,  the  fact  that  eight  U.S.  states  have  very  similar  policies  to  Russia's  ban  on  gay  'propaganda'  reminds  us  that  we  still  have  a  long  way  to  go  before  the  truth  of  our  personhood  rather  than  our  sexual  orientation  becomes  the  basis  on  which  we  are  judged  --  as  partners,  as  parents,  as  human  beings.Arguing  against  gay  parenthood  was  a  fellow  overachiever,  a  young  man  from  a  conservative  and  deeply  Christian  Korean  family.  He  penned  passionately  for  his  position,  invoking  passages  from  the  Bible,  and  spoke  of  all  that  was  "normal"  and  "good"  about  heterosexual  monogamy.He  argued  for  setting  a  proper  example  for  children,  with  vague  references  to  the  moral  and  psychological  confusion  that  could  result  from  two  men  or  two  women  raising  a  family.  He  may  have  even  referenced  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (DSM-II),  which  listed  homosexuality  as  a  sociopathic  condition  until  1974,  the  year  after  each  of  us  had  been  born.I  was  proud  of  my  piece,  but  public  opinion  clearly  lay  on  the  side  of  my  opponent.  I  was  surprised  to  find  that  not  only  did  virtually  none  of  my  friends  commend  me  for  it,  but  some  of  my  fellow  students  decided  it  would  be  fun  to  call  me  a  "fag  hag"  and  a  "dyke"  for  weeks  after  its  publication.  This  hurt  my  feelings,  of  course.  But  what  they  did  not  know  --  and  what  I  had  not  dared  to  write  about  publicly  --  was  that  I  lived  with  my  father  and  his  partner,  a  man  he  has  now  been  with  for  more  than  a  quarter  century.Although  my  father  and  his  partner  were  life  partners,  they  were  also  business  partners,  a  fact  that  served  conveniently  as  a  cover  in  circumstances  in  which  they  did  not  feel  safe  coming  out.  Although  we  lived  together,  they  each  had  separate  bedrooms  and  shared  an  office  in  our  house,  which  allowed  me  to  deflect  questions  when  friends  from  school  came  over.At  the  time,  our  popular  culture  lexicon  had  not  yet  graphed  the  term  "partner"  into  the  space  once  reserved  for  "girlfriend"  or  "husband."  But  to  me  it  has  always  been  a  double  entendre.  I  was  then  and  remain  now  proud  of  their  partnership.  I  am  grateful  for  the  ways  that  being  raised,  in  part,  by  a  bisexual  father  and  a  gay  man  has  at  once  challenged  and  nurtured  me.  Our  family  is  steeped  in  love,  even  as  the  searing  psychological  inheritance  of  their  own  childhoods  and  young  adulthoods  also  colors  our  experiences  with  each  other.Was  I  a  coward  for  not  broadcasting  the  nature  of  my  family,  for  not  going  public  in  that  first  op-ed?  I  have  often  felt,  after  the  fact,  that  I  should  have  been  bolder.  But  remember,  it  was  1989.  The  Berlin  Wall  may  have  been  about  to  fall,  but  George  Michael  wasn't  even  out  yet.  The  AIDS  epidemic  was  ravaging  gay  communities  and  new  forms  of  homophobia  seemed  to  be  as  American  as,  well,  apple  pie.  The  first  test  tube  baby  had  just  turned  10.  In  vitro  fertilization  and  forms  of  surrogacy  remained  extremely  rare,  and  adoption  laws  discriminated  against  same-sex  couples.Today,  if  I  were  in  the  position  my  high  school  journalism  teacher  had  been,  the  prompt  "Gay  people  should  be  allowed  to  be  parents  --  pro  or  con"  would,  mercifully,  be  barely  worth  arguing  in  many  parts  of  the  country,  if  not  the  world.  Listening  to  my  daughter  ask  casually  if  I  could  call  Chloe's  moms  or  Grace's  dads  to  arrange  a  playdate  provides  a  kind  of  existential  relief  I  find  difficult  to  put  into  words.</TEXT></DOC>

It  actually  happened.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Seriously.  It  actually  happened.Sort  of.On  January  10,  in  my  weekly  Apparently  This  Matters  column,  I  wrote  about  an  online  fundraiser  called  the  Good  Day  Blimp  where,  essentially,  four  guys  were  trying  to  quickly  raise  $25,000  for  charity  to  more-or-less  guilt-trip  the  Goodyear  company  into  flying  their  blimp  high  in  the  air  while  spelling  out  in  lights  "ICE  CUBE'S  A  PIMP."If  Goodyear  would  do  this  on  January  20  --  a  very  specific  and  important  date  --  the  South  Central  Los  Angeles  nonprofit,  A  Place  Called  Home,  would  get  the  money.You  know,  for  kids!But  it  had  to  be  THAT  date  and  THOSE  words.It's  a  little  silly  and  a  lot  complicated,  and  you  can  read  the  whole  backstory  here,  but  just  know  that  it  all  stems  from  the  lyrics  of  one  of  Ice  Cube's  old-school,  1992  hit  rap  songs  "It  Was  a  Good  Day"  where,  in  recounting  a  day  so  good  he  "even  saw  the  lights  of  the  Goodyear  Blimp  and  it  read  ICE  CUBE'S  A  PIMP."For  my  column,  I  actually  spoke  to  Ice  Cube  while  he  happened  to  be  at  the  CNN  Center  in  Atlanta  promoting  his  new  movie  "Ride  Along,"  (sequel  to  come,  he  told  CNN  today)  and  that's  when  he  first  learned  of  the  movement.He  thought  it  was:  "Dope."Then,  a  few  days  later  he  acknowledged  the  movement  on  Twitter  before  appearing  on  Late  Night  with  Jimmy  Fallon  where  the  subject  once  again  came  up.So,  between  us  and  Jimmy  Fallon,  we  feel  a  little  responsible  for  this  thing  blowing  up.  What  was  once  a  quiet,  ridiculous  Internet  fundraiser  was  now  officially  a  thing.Goodyear  released  a  statement  via  Twitter,  saying  that  on  January  20  they  would  treat  kids  from  the  A  Place  Called  Home  charity  to  rides  on  the  blimp,  and  even  invited  Ice  Cube  to  join  them.However,  they  weren't  going  to  write  "ICE  CUBE'S  A  PIMP."  That  just  wasn't  going  to  happen.  But  they  basically  met  everyone  halfway  by  promising  to  write  out  "IT'S  A  GOOD  DAY."In  the  end,  Ice  Cube  flew  out  to  Los  Angeles  early  Monday  morning  from  the  East  Coast  to  meet  with  the  kids,  check  out  the  blimp,  and  help  the  Good  Day  Blimp  guys  present  a  large,  novelty-sized  $25,000  check  to  the  charity."I  never  thought  in  a  million  years  it  would  happen,"  Cube  said,  standing  outside  the  blimp.  "Rap  is  a  mixture  of  fantasy  and  reality,  and  it  seems  like  fantasy  has  met  reality  today."Sort  of.The  wording  wasn't  exact,  but  let's  face  it,  Goodyear  was  never  going  to  write  PIMP  on  their  famous  airship,  and  they  very  easily  could  have  ignored  the  whole  thing.  By  January  21  it  would  be  a  memory.But  it  happened.  And  credit  to  Ice  Cube  for  being  there  for  the  festivities.It  was  a  good  day.Follow  @JarrettBellini  on  Twitter.</TEXT></DOC>

Jeff  Flake,  R-Arizona,  told  me  as  he  left  the  final  vote  on  the  military  bill  Wednesday.  Flake  was  one  of  just  three  senators  who  voted  no,  despite  a  chorus  of  criticism  with  the  way  the  bill  was  funded.CNNMoney:  Senate  votes  to  restore  military  pensionsThe  measure  rolls  back  a  gradual  1%  cut  in  military  pensions.  (It  rolls  back  that  cut  for  anyone  who  joined  the  military  before  this  year.)  It  pays  for  that  by  tacking  on  one  more  year  of  across-the-board,  or  sequester,  cuts  to  Medicare  10  years  from  now.The  money  may  not  exist"Spend  now,  pay  later,  "  Flake  concluded.  "It  never  happens."Among  the  hefty  issues  with  the  bill  is  that  it  pays  to  end  a  problem  now  with  money  that  won't  arrive  for  a  decade.  In  some  ways,  it  is  like  buying  a  house  today  based  on  income  you  expect  to  get  10  years  from  now.Homeowners  couldn't  do  that,  but  lawmakers  can  because  they  operate  in  10-year  budget  windows.  That  allows  them  to  access  money  on  paper  now  that  won't  be  tangible  for  years  to  come.  But  that  practice  can  be  risky."We  don't  know  what  the  future  will  look  like,"  explained  Marc  Goldwein,  senior  policy  director  at  the  Committee  for  a  Responsible  Federal  Budget.  "We  don't  know  if  the  (budget  assumptions)  are  correct;  we  don't  know  who  will  be  in  Congress;  we  don't  know  who  will  be  president."Goldwein  and  the  committee  feel  so  strongly,  the  think  tank  included  the  idea  of  paying  for  short-term  costs  with  money  10  years  ahead  in  a  chartbook  it  released  last  week  of  eight  budget  gimmicks.Above  all,  we  don't  know  if  future  Congresses  will  rethink  the  sequester  cuts.  And  based  on  the  past  two  years  of  cuts,  parts  of  which  have  already  been  reversed,  it  would  be  stunning  if  lawmakers  ahead  left  the  sequester  intact  all  the  way  until  2024.Seeing  it  as  'fuzzy  math'  but  voting  yes  anywayThere  is  some  irony  when  you  look  at  fiscal  crusaders  and  this  bill.In  the  House,  199  Republicans  voted  against  the  debt  ceiling  suspension,  which  would  not  have  directly  changed  the  amount  of  government  spending,  only  whether  the  government  could  pay  for  that  spending.Senate  passes  debt-ceiling  bill  in  blow  to  tea  partyBut  of  those  199  anti-debt  purists,  only  16  voted  no  for  the  military  retirement  bill,  even  though  some  thought  it  could  actually  lead  to  increased  spending  because  of  its  risky  assumptions.That  military  retirement  bill,  however,  had  a  distinct  advantage:  It  was  short-term  benefit  for  American  troops  and  their  families,  a  group  with  undeniable  political  support.Some  stalwart  conservatives  faced  a  tough  decision.  The  night  before  the  House  vote  on  the  military  retirement  bill,  Arizona  conservative  Matt  Salmon  railed  against  the  idea  of  paying  for  it  with  Medicare  cuts  in  10  years."If  you  believe  we're  ever  going  to  really  do  that,"  Salmon  said  surrounded  by  a  crowd  of  lawmakers  and  reporters,  "I  think  it's  fuzzy  math  to  be  honest  with  you.  I  think  any  (savings)  that  you  push  over  two  years  out,  you  can't  really  guarantee  any  of  that.  It's  a  concept  only."He  didn't  trust  the  fund  to  be  there  in  10  years.  But  the  next  morning,  Salmon  voted  for  the  measure  anyway.  His  office  posted  a  prominent  release  trumpeting  his  debt  ceiling  vote,  but  mentioned  nothing  about  his  decision  on  the  military  COLA.  His  spokeswoman  did  not  respond  to  CNN's  requests  for  an  explanation  of  his  vote.This  will  hurt  the  militaryThe  Pentagon  faces  a  major  money  problem.  Health  and  retirement  costs  are  skyrocketing,  which  have  led  to  a  jump  in  personnel  costs  of  more  than  50%  between  2001  and  2012  alone,  according  to  the  Pentagon,  and  are  forecast  to  keep  skyrocketing  in  coming  decades.Those  increasing  costs  mean  less  money  for  things  like  equipment  and  training.So,  by  reversing  the  cost-of-living  adjustment  to  retirees,  some  believe  Congress  just  hurts  troop  readiness."Compensation  costs  are  hollowing  out  the  Pentagon's  budget,"  House  Budget  Chairman  Paul  Ryan  wrote  in  a  statement,  "They  are  taking  resources  away  from  training  and  modernization  —  and  putting  our  troops  at  risk.  This  bill  takes  away  over  $6  billion  from  military  readiness."Ryan  was  one  of  the  16  Republicans  to  vote  against  both  the  military  pay  "fix"  and  the  debt  ceiling  bill.His  budget  agreement  with  Sen.  Patty  Murray,  D-Washington,  in  December  created  the  military  pension  cut,  so  he  is  directly  tied  to  the  policy.  But  he  insisted  that  he  is  open  to  reforming  that  cut,  just  not  in  this  manner."Rather  than  making  the  tough  choices,  (this  bill)  sidesteps  them,"  he  wrote.Why  do  Republicans  opposes  unemployment  benefits?So  why  did  everyone  vote  for  it?"I  voted  yes,"  Republican  Ron  Johnson  of  Utah  said.  "I  didn't  think  the  military  COLA  in  isolation  should  have  been  included  in  the  budget  package  to  begin  with...  We  can't  single  out  the  finest  among  us  for  that  type  of  reform."When  asked  what  he  makes  of  other  Republicans  who  believe  the  money  to  pay  for  the  fix  is  based  on  "fuzzy  math,"  the  tea  party  conservative  nodded,  "I  understand  the  viewpoint,  no  doubt  about  it.""Obviously  i  would  have  preferred  my  pay-for,"  said  Sen.  Kelly  Ayotte,  R-New  Hampshire,  who  proposed  saving  money  by  blocking  illegal  immigrants  from  obtaining  a  child  tax  credit.  That  didn't  win  out,  and  she  voted  yes  for  the  bill  with  2024  Medicare  cuts  instead."I'm  just  glad  that  we're  moving  forward  to  at  least  grandfather  those  who  have  sacrificed  so  much  for  the  country,"  she  said  minutes  after  the  vote.It  was  a  question  of  priority,  sure.  Congress  decided  that  fixing  the  military  retirement  pay  was  the  priority.But  that  is  not  the  only  question.  Just  as  prominent  a  question  as  the  country  faces  a  soaring  debt  forecast  is  how  to  pay  for  it.Congress  cannot  make  any  remotely  tough  choices"We're  going  to  have  to  make  serious  and  substantial  cuts  across  government,  this  is  pretty  small,"  Flake  told  me  as  he  rode  the  elevator  down  from  the  Senate  vote.  "If  we  can't  do  this,  then  we  stand  no  chance  of  addressing  our  debt  and  deficit  in  a  meaningful  way."The  U.S.  deficit  at  the  moment  could  easily  inspire  false  hope  and  make  someone  like  Flake  sound  like  a  death-rattler.  The  deficit  is  plummeting  --  still  a  healthy  $500  billion,  but  down  by  half  from  its  $1-trilion-plus  heights.But  under  current  policy,  that  positive  trend  won't  last  to  see  the  next  president.  The  nonpartisan  Congressional  Budget  Office  forecasts  that  federal  deficits  will  start  climbing  again  in  2016  and  will  be  back  at  the  $1  trillion  level  in  eight  years.What's  worse,  the  deficit  continues  to  grow  as  a  share  of  GDP,  sucking  more  and  more  potential  life  out  of  the  economy.But  rather  than  face  the  tough  financial  issues  involved  (entitlement  costs,  including  health  care  and  retirement,  especially),  Congress  decided  to  reverse  one  of  the  few  hard  decisions  it's  made  lately  and  pay  for  the  military  retirement  reversal  with  debatable  funding."What  they  did  here  was  they  reversed  the  hardest  and  the  most  structurally  significant  choice  in  the  Murray-Ryan  budget  agreement,"  Goldwein  said.  "That  was  the  only  real  entitlement  reform  in  the  Murray-Ryan  bill,  and  it  was  relatively  modest.  They  took  that  tough  choice  and  replaced  it  with  a  completely  not  tough  choice."Goldwein  says  the  committee  has  moved  from  pushing  for  deficit  reforms  worth  trillions  of  dollars  to  hoping  that  lawmakers  just  pay  for  the  bills  they  pass  with  honest  money  (no  gimmicks).Which  is  why  passage  of  the  military  COLA  bill,  no  matter  how  well-intentioned  for  military  retirees,  is  a  blaring  siren  of  greater  problems.A  Congress  well-schooled  in  the  deficit  chose  an  easy,  risky  way  out  of  what  was,  relative  to  the  coming  fiscal  issues,  a  modest  problem.  What  military  families  may  gain  for  the  next  few  years  they  could  easily  lose  in  either  readiness  or  in  much  larger  taxpayer  problems  ahead."We're  in  a  bad  place  right  now,  I  think,"  Goldwein  said.</TEXT></DOC>

Chris  Christie's  speech  Tuesday  sought  to  appeal  to  various  constituencies  crucial  to  the  early  GOP  frontrunner's  presidential  hopes  in  2016,  if  he  decides  to  run.  Christie  emphasized  themes  of  unity  and  moving  beyond  partisan  politics  to  try  to  reassure  crucial  independent  voters.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Washington  (CNN)  --  Chris  Christie  used  about  2,000  words  to  deliver  different  messages  to  different  audiences  Tuesday  in  his  second  inaugural  address,  this  one  under  the  specter  of  scandal.The  embattled  New  Jersey  governor  made  no  mention  of  the  multiple  investigations  into  alleged  political  retribution  exacted  by  his  administration.Instead,  he  spoke  as  a  re-elected  governor  to  his  state  and  the  early  frontrunner  for  the  Republican  presidential  nomination  in  2016,  if  he  decides  to  run,  to  a  cheering  crowd  in  the  Trenton  War  Memorial.Most  importantly,  Christie  emphasized  themes  of  unity  and  moving  beyond  partisan  politics  to  try  to  reassure  crucial  Independent  voters  shaken  by  the  controversy  over  traffic  gridlock  as  alleged  political  payback.Here  is  what  he  said,  and  what  he  really  was  saying:"A  tough  New  Jersey.  A  resilient  New  Jersey.  A  proud  New  Jersey."Christie  was  talking  about  himself  as  much  as  his  state  when,  early  in  the  speech,  he  spoke  of  the  bond  established  with  the  people  of  New  Jersey  during  his  first  term."We  have  endured  the  worst  economic  recession  of  our  lifetimes  and  we  have  begun  to  triumph  over  it,"  he  said,  establishing  the  "all-in-this-together"  theme  of  the  speech  that  sought  to  also  boost  state  pride."We  have  survived  the  worst  natural  disaster  in  our  state's  history  and  we  have  worked  together  to  restore,  renew  and  rebuild  the  state  that  we  love,"  he  added,  noting  that  "each  one  of  these  challenges  has  been  met  by  a  new,  unified  force  in  public  life  -  a  New  Jersey  setting  the  tone  for  an  entire  nation."Then  came  the  triple  kicker,  received  with  lengthy  applause:  "A  tough  New  Jersey.  A  resilient  New  Jersey.  A  proud  New  Jersey.""A  New  Jersey  that  has  put  aside  political  partisanship  on  the  important  issues  ...  "With  polls  showing  public  disgust  with  the  partisan  politics  of  Washington,  Christie  portrayed  himself  as  a  leader  who  can  overcome  ideological  divisions.His  goal  was  to  contrast  his  record  in  a  politically  divided  state  with  Democratic  President  Barack  Obama's  inability  to  divine  much  partisan  progress  from  a  similarly  divided  Congress.New  Jersey  Democrats  note  their  control  of  the  state  legislature  means  every  law  passed  and  signed  by  Christie  must  be  bipartisan,  by  definition.To  the  governor,  the  victor  gets  the  spoils  and  he  hailed  "a  New  Jersey  that  has  put  aside  political  partisanship  on  the  important  issues  to  our  people  to  take  advantage  of  the  opportunities  each  of  these  challenges  has  presented  us  with  every  day."Later  in  the  speech,  Christie  expanded  on  that  theme,saying  "we  cannot  fall  victim  to  the  attitude  of  Washington,  D.C.""The  attitude  that  says  I  am  always  right  and  you  are  always  wrong,"  he  said.  "The  attitude  that  puts  everyone  into  a  box  that  they  are  not  permitted  to  leave.  The  attitude  that  puts  political  wins  ahead  of  policy  agreements.  The  belief  that  compromise  is  a  dirty  word."Hot  piece  of  land  in  Hoboken  at  center  of  Christie-Zimmer  dispute"Each  vote  cast  is  an  act  of  faith  and  trust."In  a  key  message  of  the  speech,  Christie  presented  himself  as  a  leader  able  to  win  support  across  the  political  spectrum,  which  will  be  the  most  necessary  attribute  for  a  Republican  presidential  candidate.Obama  won  re-election  in  2012  by  thumping  GOP  challenger  Mitt  Romney  in  key  demographics  such  as  women,  young  voters,  Hispanic  Americans  and  African  Americans.It  appears  that  Christie  hopes  to  generate  broad-based  support  and  fundraising  by  claiming  the  title  as  most  electable  Republican  from  the  start."You  see,  elections  are  about  more  than  TV  ads  and  debates  and  rallies.  Each  vote  cast  is  an  act  of  faith  and  trust,"  he  said  to  set  up  the  bond  between  candidate  and  citizen.Referring  to  his  November  re-election,  Christie  said  "it  wasn't  just  some  of  our  people  who  affirmed  this  course.""It  was  not  a  vocal  plurality  like  four  years  ago,"  he  continued  to  growing  applause  and  cheers.  "No,  this  time,  it  was  the  largest  and  loudest  voice  of  affirmation  that  the  people  of  our  state  have  given  to  any  direction  in  three  decades."One  by  one,  he  listed  the  elements  of  his  broad-based  support  --  an  enviable  collection  for  any  candidate  of  any  party."Suburbanites  and  city  dwellers.  African  Americans  and  Latinos.  Women  and  men.  Doctors  and  teachers.  Factory  workers  and  tradesmen.  Republicans  and  Democrats  and  independents,"  Christie  said.Later  in  the  speech,  he  made  sure  to  mention  how  the  state  passed  an  immigration  law  on  his  watch  that  gave  some  children  of  immigrants  living  illegally  in  New  Jersey  a  break  on  their  tuition.  The  issue  is  paramount  to  Hispanic  Americans  and  the  subject  of  major  political  division  in  Washington.To  CNN  Chief  Political  Analyst  Gloria  Borger,  Christie  was  declaring  to  GOP  backers  and  independents  looking  to  get  behind  a  winner  that  he  can  attract  a  "very  broad"  coalition  like  the  one  that  gave  him  his  second  term.Don't  trash  Jersey  until  you've  traveled  it"Now  we  have  no  moral  option  but  to  heed  the  voice  of  the  voters  ...  "With  this  line,  Christie  sought  to  seal  the  bond  with  New  Jerseyans  and  also  convince  people  nationwide  that  he  could  be  trusted  with  their  votes  come  2016,  if  he  runs.A  new  national  poll  released  Tuesday  showed  Christie  losing  ground  to  the  early  Democratic  presidential  frontrunner  in  2016,  Hillary  Clinton.The  biggest  shift  in  the  Quinnipiac  University  survey  was  among  Independent  voters,  who  were  split  between  Christie  and  Clinton  in  December  but  now  go  for  Clinton  by  a  15-percentage  point  margin.It  also  indicated  that  Christie's  standing  among  voters  has  dropped  since  the  controversies  facing  his  administration  became  more  prominent  in  the  past  two  weeks."He's  paying  a  political  price  with  those  Independents,"  Borger  said,  adding  that  on  the  issue  of  voter  trust,  "he's  got  a  lot  of  work  to  do  there."It's  not  impossible,  she  noted,  saying  Independent  voters  "can  always  shift  back,  but  he  has  to  win  them  back."Tuesday's  speech  tried  to  do  exactly  that."Now  we  have  no  moral  option  but  to  heed  the  voice  of  the  voters  and  that  is  exactly  what  I  intend  to  do,"  Christie  said  to  applause."Today,  I  thank  all  those  who  have  once  again  placed  their  faith  and  trust  in  me  and  I  make  this  promise:  I  will  not  let  up,  I  will  insist  we  work  together  and  I  will  make  this  government  truly  work  for  those  who  pay  for  it,"  he  continued  to  another  ovation."I  do  not  believe  that  New  Jerseyans  want  a  bigger,  more  expensive  government  ...  "While  Christie's  poll  numbers  among  Republicans  remain  strong,  he  remains  vulnerable  to  conservative  criticism  that  he  is  too  moderate  for  the  hardliners  on  the  GOP  right.Some  will  never  forgive  him  for  buddying  up  with  Obama  when  they  toured  the  Superstorm  Sandy  devastation  a  few  days  before  the  2012  election,  a  break  in  final  campaign  coverage  considered  beneficial  to  the  President's  victory.His  speech  offered  some  red  meat  to  conservatives  by  stressing  his  opposition  to  tax  hikes  sought  by  Democrats  who  control  the  state  legislature."I  do  not  believe  that  New  Jerseyans  want  a  bigger,  more  expensive  government  that  penalizes  success  and  then  gives  the  pittance  left  to  a  few  in  the  name  of  income  equity,"  Christie  said,  delivering  a  conservative  mantra.  "What  New  Jerseyans  want  is  an  unfettered  opportunity  to  succeed  in  the  way  that  they  define  success.  They  want  an  equal  chance  at  the  starting  line;  not  a  government  guaranteed  result."His  applause  followed  by  calling  for  policies  "that  believe  in  the  effort,  the  talent  and  the  optimism  of  New  Jerseyans,  not  in  the  power  of  almighty  government  to  fix  any  problem,  real  or  imagined.""So,  let's  be  different  than  our  neighbors,"  Christie  said  to  cheers.  "Let's  put  more  money  in  the  pockets  of  our  middle  class  by  not  taking  it  out  of  their  pockets  in  the  first  place."Opinion:  How  Christie  could  rebound  -  and  come  out  stronger"The  ways  we  divide  each  other  ...  is  neither  permanent  nor  necessary."While  he  needs  at  least  some  conservative  support  to  survive  the  GOP  primaries  for  2016,  Christie  knows  that  any  chance  in  a  general  election  requires  the  support  of  independent  voters  and  perhaps  even  some  disenchanted  Democrats.So  he  tried  to  tread  a  somewhat  tricky  middle  ground  by  proposing  both  conservative  and  moderate  policies  and  ideas."This  election  has  taught  us  that  the  ways  we  divide  each  other  --  by  race,  by  class,  by  ethnicity,  by  wealth,  and  yes  by  political  party  --  is  neither  permanent  nor  necessary,"  Christie  said.  "You  see,  our  dreams  are  the  same:  a  good  job,  a  great  education  for  our  children,  safe  streets  in  our  neighborhood  and  core  values  which  give  lives  real  meaning.  Those  dreams  are  not  unique  to  any  one  group  in  our  state."He  then  sounded  like  a  conservative-tinged  populist  by  encouraging  personal  responsibility  to  help  each  other."We  have  to  be  willing  to  play  outside  the  red  and  blue  boxes  that  the  media  pundits  put  us  in,"  he  said  to  applause.  "We  have  to  be  willing  to  reach  out  to  others  who  look  or  speak  differently  than  us;  we  have  to  be  willing  to  personally  reach  out  a  helping  hand  to  a  neighbor  or  a  friend  suffering  from  drug  addiction,  depression  or  the  dignity  stripping  loss  of  a  job."Continuing  the  theme,  Christie  outlined  policy  directions  on  education  and  drug  enforcement  that  straddled  the  ideological  spectrum."We  will  make  it  our  priority  to  have  every  child  in  New  Jersey  have  a  chance  to  get  a  good  education,"  he  said,  again  prompting  applause  and  cheers  by  adding  that  "no  matter  what  adult  we  have  to  offend,  no  matter  where  you  came  from,  no  matter  what  sacred  cow  we  must  slay,  no  matter  how  much  we  have  to  change  the  conventional  thinking,  we  will  no  longer  stand  for  the  achievement  gap  which  exists  between  our  best  and  least  educated  children."Then  he  became  more  liberal,  saying  "we  will  end  the  failed  war  on  drugs  that  believes  that  incarceration  is  the  cure  of  every  ill  caused  by  drug  abuse.""We  will  make  drug  treatment  available  to  as  many  of  our  non-violent  offenders  as  we  can,"  Christie  said,  "and  we  will  partner  with  our  citizens  to  create  a  society  that  understands  this  simple  truth:  every  life  has  value  and  no  life  is  disposable."Is  this  what  'Jersey-style'  means?CNN's  Paul  Steinhauser,  Virginia  Nicolaidis,  Jake  Tapper  and  Steve  Brusk  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

But  now  the  brash  Californian  is  at  risk  of  getting  a  new  title.A  felon.Moore,  the  founder  of  a  now  defunct  "revenge  porn"  website  was  indicted  and  is  accused  of  hacking  into  people's  e-mail  accounts  to  steal  nude  photos  to  post  online,  federal  authorities  said.Moore,  27,  who  the  FBI  says  operated  isanyoneup.com,  was  arrested  in  Woodland,  California,  Thursday.  Also  arrested  was  Charles  Evens,  a  25-year-old  man  in  Southern  California  believed  to  be  connected  to  the  scheme.'You  took  the  picture'In  2012,  way  before  this  arrest,  Moore  talked  to  HLN's  Dr.  Drew  about  the  website."The  site  was  just  born,  actually,"  Moore  said.  "It  was  just  a  couple  of  friends  and,  you  know,  we  had  our  hearts  broken  by  a  couple  of  girls,  and  we  thought  we  would  make  a  site.  And  it  became  Is  Anyone  Up.  That`s  how  it  started.  Of  course.  But  when  I  did  start  the  site,  I  was  hurt,  and  so  was  my  friends."But  later  in  the  show  Moore  was  confronted  by  a  woman  who  called  in  and  said  she  regretted  taking  topless  photos  for  a  boyfriend  and  was  devastated  when  the  pictures  appeared  online."I  don't  know  how  you  can  point  your  finger  at  me,"  Moore  responded."  You  took  the  picture.  I  mean,  I`ve  been  justifying  this  in  my  head  for  over  a  year  and  a  half  of  the  site.  But  at  the  end  of  the  day,  it  started  with  you.  You  took  these  pictures."Site  got  out  of  handThe  FBI  says  Moore  and  Evens  conspired  to  peddle  "hundreds"  of  nude  pictures,  without  getting  permission  in  2011  and  2012.  But,  according  to  an  indictment  Moore  allegedly  pushed  Evens  to  hack  into  computers  to  get  more  sexually  explicit  photos.Moore  then  would  pay  Evens  for  the  photos  and  then  post  them  on  the  site,  according  to  the  FBI.Both  suspects  are  named  in  a  15-count  indictment  with  charges  that  include  aggravated  identity  theft  and  conspiracy.  If  convicted,  they  face  up  to  five  years  in  federal  prison  for  each  conspiracy  and  hacking-related  charge.Moore  actually  shutdown  the  website  in  2012  and  sold  it  to  an  anti-bullying  group."Taking  down  the  site  has  been  something  I`ve  wanted  to  do  for  months,"  Moore  said.  "It  was  just  something  I  created  that  got  out  of  hand.  It  was  supposed  to  be  for  friends."CNN's  Mayra  Cuevas  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

She  previously  hosted  CNN's  "Parenting  Today."(CNN)  --  A  young  woman  loses  both  her  baby  and  her  mother  in  a  massive  Washington  state  landslide.  Halfway  around  the  world,  an  elderly  woman  cries  alone  on  the  floor  of  a  Beijing  hotel,  not  knowing  the  fate  of  a  loved  one  aboard  missing  Malaysia  Airlines  Flight  370.These  extraordinary,  tragic  events  present  profound,  not-well-understood  challenges  for  those  who  are  survivors  of  sudden  loss."They're  not  just  dealing  with  loss.  They're  also  dealing  with  personal  traumatization,"  said  Therese  Rando,  a  clinical  psychologist  at  the  Institute  for  the  Study  and  Treatment  of  Loss  in  Warwick,  Rhode  Island."It  affects  the  ability  to  get  on  with  grief  and  mourning,  to  bend  your  mind  around  what  has  transpired.  There  is  no  warning,  no  time  to  prepare  and  gradually  start  to  take  on  the  notion."Increasingly,  counselors  caution  that  grief  --  particularly  in  the  case  of  sudden  loss  --  is  far  from  a  standard  process.Family  of  newlyweds  aboard  missing  plane  'still  waiting'In  fact,  the  widely  publicized  "five  stages  of  grief,"  introduced  by  psychiatrist  Elisabeth  Kubler-Ross  in  1969,  is  not  a  complete  list  of  emotions.  There  may  be  feelings  other  than  denial,  anger,  bargaining,  depression  and  acceptance  --  and  they  may  occur  in  any  order."A  person  is  not  just  heartbroken  when  they  lose  someone  suddenly,"  Rando  said.  "They're  heartbroken  and  they're  traumatized,  then  they're  put  in  a  situation  where  the  conflicting  needs  of  dealing  with  the  heartbreak  and  trauma  simultaneously  can  impede  their  forward  process  for  a  while."Out  of  the  blueComprehending  recovery  for  sudden  loss  survivors  is  difficult  for  anyone  who  has  never  been  there.Counselors  are  careful  not  to  diminish  any  loss,  but  they  make  clear  that  there  are  experiential  distinctions  --  for  example,  when  someone  dies  after  an  extended  illness  or  old  age  --  as  opposed  to  when  death  occurs  as  the  result  of  an  acute  medical  condition,  accident,  disaster,  suicide,  homicide,  terrorism  or  war.A  longtime  friend  recently  shared  how  different  it  was  to  experience  the  recent  death  of  her  85-year-old  mother  after  years  of  poor  health  and  the  loss  of  her  father  decades  ago  from  a  sudden  heart  attack.Flight  attendant's  husband  has  no  answers  for  children"With  my  mom,  we  spent  time  together  and  said  our  goodbyes.  She  lived  a  full  life,"  she  related.  "My  dad  didn't  get  that  chance.  I  was  just  a  teenager.  For  years,  I  was  shaken  and  traumatized."Rando,  who  was  orphaned  as  a  teen  when  both  her  parents  died  within  a  year,  has  channeled  the  trauma  she  experienced  into  her  life's  work  and  has  written  several  books  on  specific  areas  of  grief."Loss  is  not  loss  is  not  loss,"  she  said.  "In  the  end,  many  people  can  see  their  loved  one  at  peace,  relieved  from  suffering.  We  reconcile  it  by  saying,  'it  was  time;  the  suffering  is  over.'"All  of  that  is  robbed  from  someone  who  had  no  expectation  of  what  was  coming.  There  is  no  opportunity  to  take  care  of  unfinished  emotional  business,  to  make  sure  to  say  'I  love  you.'  "When  there  are  no  wordsOn  the  ground  in  China,  therapist  Paul  Yin  responded  to  the  woman  sitting  on  the  hotel  floor,  crying."I  simply  sat  down  next  to  her.  A  minute  later,  she  gave  me  her  hands.  Another  minute  later,  I  started  to  cry  with  her.  That  act  provided  an  ounce  of  comfort,"  Yin  told  the  Employee  Assistance  Professionals  Association  (PDF).  "A  few  days  later,  she  recognized  me  and  walked  over  to  hug  me.  This  isn't  exactly  typical  behavior  from  an  elderly  Chinese  woman  from  the  countryside,  so  this  act  told  me  that  the  support  I  gave  her  was  valuable."Yin  opened  up  a  safe  space  simply  by  being  there  and  coming  back.  Atlanta  family  psychiatrist  John  Lochridge  believes  that  was  the  perfect  way  to  handle  the  situation."You  have  to  be  very  gentle  and  patient.  Be  present  without  judgment.  In  this  case,  it  may  be  too  soon  to  talk  because  the  person  doesn't  want  or  need  to  relive  the  trauma,"  he  said.It's  human  nature  to  operate  under  basic  assumptions,  such  as:  people  are  good,  children  grow  up  to  replace  their  parents  and  the  world  is  an  orderly  place.Then,  a  Malaysia  Airlines  jumbo  jet  carrying  239  passengers  disappears  into  the  night  without  explanation.  And  in  the  soft  morning  light,  a  huge  hillside  in  Washington  state  collapses,  devouring  dozens  of  homes  and  a  still  undetermined  number  of  people  who  lived  there.Landslide:  Families  remember  loved  ones  as  death  toll  growsWhen  terrible  things  happen,  those  expectations  are  shattered.  The  trauma  is  magnified  even  more  when  there  is  no  confirmation  of  death  or  no  physical  remains  recovered."There's  a  great  reluctance  to  relinquish  all  hope  if  there's  no  proof,  until  (survivors)  have  the  evidence,"  Rando  said.  "It's  wrong  in  their  minds,  with  official  statements  saying  this  and  then  that,  how  can  they  have  any  confidence?  It's  not  denial;  it's  disbelief.  A  few  weeks  into  this  --  let  them  have  their  hope."How  to  go  on  after  sudden  lossEarly  on,  survivors  of  sudden  loss  are  at  high  risk  for  suicide  and  other  self-destructive  behaviors.  Responses  can  range  from  total  numbness  to  hyper-agitation."This  doesn't  mean  they  have  to  stay  like  this  forever  and  they  are  never  going  to  make  progress.  But  they  are  given  challenges,  right  from  the  get-go,  that  people  who've  seen  the  death  coming  don't  go  through,"  Rando  said.Her  own  recovery  has  instilled  qualities  Rando  believes  are  common,  positive  outcomes  among  sudden  death  survivors."Tomorrow  is  promised  to  no  one.  I  am  more  conscious  of  living  in  the  moment.  I  have  to  make  sure  I  don't  have  unfinished  business  or  unresolved  disagreements,"  she  said.  "Because  all  we  have  is  the  here  and  now."CNN's  Gary  Tuchman  asked  Natasha  Huestis,  the  young  mother  in  Washington  state,  what  she  would  do  next  in  the  wake  of  the  landslide.She  said  she  would  go  to  the  aid  of  responders  who  helped  recover  the  bodies  of  her  first  and  only  child,  a  4-month-old  girl,  and  her  mother,  "Go  and  help  them.  Go  and  help  the  people  who  helped  me.""She  realizes  the  preciousness  of  life,"  Lochridge  said.  "With  evidence,  painful  and  shocking  as  it  may  be,  it's  important  that  she  grasps  the  finality  and  is  able  to  keep  going."'These  are  our  people:'  Residents  unite  to  help  Washington  victims</TEXT></DOC>

Not  long  after  the  pontiff  released  his  47,000-word  apostolic  exhortation,  Evangelii  Gaudium,  Obama  lifted  language  directly  from  the  document  in  a  partisan  speech  of  his  own.But  the  attempt  to  tether  himself  to  Pope  Francis  is  an  awkward  and  ultimately  doomed  one.5  things  you  didn't  know  about  Popes  and  PresidentsFor  one,  the  president  is  currently  facing  the  largest  religious  liberty  class  action  lawsuit  in  American  history.  Of  the  300  and  counting  plaintiffs  suing  the  Obama  administration  on  religious  freedom  grounds,  perhaps  most  famous  are  the  Little  Sisters  of  the  Poor,  an  order  of  nuns  founded  to  care  for  the  impoverished  and  dying  elderly.Another  well-known  plaintiff  is  Notre  Dame,  the  university  where  the  president  loudly  promised  to  keep  conscience  rights  intact  with  the  health  care  overhaul.  It  was  the  religious  liberty  version  of  the  "if  you  like  your  plan,  you  can  keep  it"  speech.In  2011,  the  president  stripped  the  U.S.  Conference  of  Catholics  Bishops  of  its  longstanding  funding  for  human-trafficking  work  because  of  the  Bishops'  conscientious  objections  to  referring  victims  to  abortions.In  2012,  he  had  his  lawyers  work  to  strike  down  the  ministerial  exception  in  federal  workplace  discrimination  law,  which  assures  houses  of  worship  the  right  to  employ  religious  leaders  according  to  doctrine.Throughout  his  presidency,  he  has  come  under  repeated  criticism  for  his  numerous  aggressions  on  people  of  faith,  be  they  rhetorical  or  legal.Not  only  is  the  president  under  fire  for  religious  freedom  violations  on  his  own  soil,  he  has  held  power  during  a  period  of  significant  unraveling  of  religious  freedom  internationally.Egypt  is  in  a  state  of  crisis,  with  Coptic  Christians  experiencing  the  worst  persecution  they  have  known  in  centuries.  Countless  other  religious  minorities  have  fallen  into  peril:  Catholics  in  Vietnam  and  Nigeria,  vangelical  Christians  in  Indonesia,  Buddhists  and  Muslims  in  China,  and  Baha'is  in  a  number  of  Middle  East  nations,  to  name  just  a  few.Anti-Semitism  is  on  the  rise  globally,  most  especially  in  parts  of  Europe  and  certain  Latin  American  nations  like  Venezuela.He  left  vacant,  for  years,  the  position  of  U.S.  Ambassador-at-Large  for  International  Religious  Liberty.He  stood  by  silently  as  the  United  States  Commission  on  International  Religious  Freedom  (USCIRF)  was  nearly  defunded.  He  then  appointed  Sen.  John  Kerry  --  who  nearly  let  it  perish  in  the  Senate  Foreign  Relations  Committee,  even  after  19  of  his  colleagues  sent  him  a  letter  pleading  with  him  to  give  the  bill  "prompt  consideration"  and  to  reauthorize  USCIRF  "without  further  delay"  --  as  his  secretary  of  state.Under  Obama's  watch,  the  State  Department  has  stepped  in  to  defend  believers  on  death  row  for  their  faith  --  heroes  like  Pastor  Saeed  Abedini  in  Iran  --  only  when  the  noise  from  nongovernmental  organizations  grew  deafening.With  regards  to  diplomacy  with  the  Vatican,  the  president  has  already  shown  his  goodwill  by  relocating  the  Vatican  Embassy,  to  the  outrage  of  some  American  Catholic  groups,  who  considered  it  a  major  downgrade.And  then  there  is  his  position  on  abortion.  While  Pope  Francis  has  called  on  Catholics  to  approach  the  church's  unchanging  teachings  on  issues  like  abortion  with  greater  mercy  and  sensitivity  towards  pregnant  women  in  crisis,  he  has  strongly  affirmed  the  position  that  every  human  life  is  worthy  of  legal  protection,  from  conception  until  natural  death.The  president  has  the  most  extreme  views  on  abortion  of  any  American  president,  even  opposing  life-saving  support  for  babies  born  of  botched  abortions  when  he  was  a  state  senator  in  Illinois.The  most  recent  keynote  speaker  of  Planned  Parenthood's  annual  gala  can't  have  much  common  ground  with  the  head  of  the  world's  largest  institution  that  opposes  abortion.Pope  Francis  is  not  just  the  head  of  the  largest  religious  institution  in  the  world;  he  is  also  the  head  of  a  sovereign  nation-state.  It  is  fitting  and  appropriate  that  he  would  sit  down  with  the  leader  of  the  free  world.It's  equally  fitting  and  appropriate,  however,  that  President  Obama  show  a  little  sobriety  and  public  honesty  about  his  relationship  with  a  church  that  is  collectively  suing  him  at  home.  Whether  we  can  expect  this  from  the  recipient  of  the  2013  Politifact  "Lie  of  the  Year"  award,  however,  is  a  different  story.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Ashley  E.

Steve  Scalise,  who  heads  a  group  of  more  than  170  conservatives  called  the  Republican  Study  Committee,  also  said  he's  worried  top  GOP  leaders  don't  have  a  more  proactive  agenda  ahead  of  the  midterm  elections."There's  some  people  that  think  that  they  might  want  to  play  prevent  defense  this  year  and  sit  back,"  Scalise  said.In  rare  bipartisan  action,  Congress  approves  $1.1  trillion  budgetSince  Republicans  took  control  of  the  House  in  2011,  those  on  the  right  have  wielded  their  growing  numbers  and  influence  to  stymie  Boehner's  plans  on  major  policy  debates.As  Republicans  head  to  the  eastern  shore  of  Maryland  for  a  closed-door  retreat  later  this  month  to  chart  strategy,  Wyoming  GOP  Rep.  Cynthia  Lummis  said.  "This  is  no  time  to  duck  in  a  foxhole.  This  is  the  time  for  Republicans  to  lead."Boehner  has  said  he  believes  the  2014  election  will  hinge  on  jobs  and  the  problems  with  Obamacare.  House  Republican  leaders  are  again  expected  to  push  similar  versions  of  the  jobs  bill  they  pushed  in  2013  to  keep  the  focus  on  the  economy,  along  with  some  more  bills  tweaking  Obamacare,  according  to  GOP  aides.But  Minnesota  Rep.  Michele  Bachmann,  a  tea  party  favorite  who  is  retiring  this  fall,  said,  "That's  not  enough,"  and  House  Republicans  need  to  give  more  concrete  answers  for  what  they'll  do  for  working-class  Americans."You  can  chew  gum  and  walk  at  the  same  time,"  Bachmann  said.Obama  makes  case  for  not  adding  sanctions  on  IranAsked  about  conservatives'  demands  for  votes  on  a  host  of  issues,  Boehner  agreed  in  principle,  saying  at  his  weekly  session  with  reporters,  "It's  important  for  us  as  a  --  as  a  party,  especially  in  an  election  year,  to  tell  people  what  you're  for."Perhaps  in  response  to  growing  calls  from  his  own  members,  the  speaker  committed  that  House  Republicans  would  come  forward  this  year  with  their  own  proposal  to  replace  Obamacare.  But  he  didn't  guarantee  a  vote  on  it  before  the  election.The  refrain  "repeal  and  replace"  was  a  central  GOP  message  right  after  the  President  signed  the  health  care  law  in  2010.  Although  there  have  been  more  than  40  votes  to  roll  back  the  entire  law  or  parts  of  it,  there  has  been  no  vote  on  a  plan  to  take  its  place.But  what  do  conservatives  want?Even  those  Republicans  demanding  a  "bold  vision"  from  their  leaders  aren't  articulating  what  that  means.  Several  House  conservatives  admit  there  are  splits  about  what  should  be  included  on  the  2014  to-do  list,  and  that  divide  could  take  a  while  to  sort  out."This  is  clearly  going  to  be  an  internal  struggle  of  the  Republican  party:  Are  we  going  to  just  be  the  party  that  says  'hey  the  other  side  is  worse'  or  are  we  going  to  show  why  our  side  is  actually  better  for  the  American  people  or  the  public?"  Labrador  asked.He  and  other  conservatives  are  worried  that  the  national  party  has  become  too  closely  aligned  with  big  business,  and  instead  should  be  targeting  its  agenda  and  message  at  small  businesses  and  individuals.In  addition  to  the  party  laying  out  its  own  health  care  plan,  Ohio  Republican  Rep.  Jim  Jordan  outlined  several  areas  he  said  voters  want  to  see  Congress  tackle  this  year.  He  held  up  tax  reform  that  helps  promote  new  jobs  as  a  must-do  priority,  something  Republicans  put  on  their  agenda  for  every  new  congressional  session.New  spot  in  ad  wars  over  ObamacarePerhaps  as  a  response  to  the  Democrats'  laser  focus  this  year  on  income  inequality  issues,  Jordan  said  the  GOP  should  focus  on  policies  aimed  at  lower-income  Americans,  suggesting  welfare  reform  should  be  revisited.  He  also  said  Americans  want  Congress  to  deal  with  the  worries  people  have  about  privacy  protections."These  are  four  things  that  help  every  single  family  in  this  country,"  Jordan  said,  and  insisted  leaders  should  schedule  votes  on  bills  covering  all  those  conservative  priorities.One  issue  that  is  guaranteed  to  set  up  a  clash  between  conservatives  and  Boehner  is  immigration  reform.  The  speaker  is  expected  to  release  a  set  of  principles  on  immigration  reform  later  this  month.  He  has  said  repeatedly  it's  important  for  Congress  to  fix  the  broken  system,  including  addressing  what  to  do  about  the  11  million  undocumented  workers  in  the  United  States.Boehner  and  other  top  House  GOP  leaders  are  adamant  they  won't  take  up  anything  resembling  the  comprehensive  legislation  the  Senate  passed  last  year.  But  even  moving  the  piecemeal  bills  Boehner  has  said  he  supports  will  be  politically  messy,  because  a  majority  of  his  own  members  are  reluctant  to  sign  off  on  any  measure  that  grants  eventual  citizenship.GOP  Rep.  Steve  King  of  Iowa,  a  longtime  opponent  of  any  measure  granting  legal  status  to  undocumented  workers  in  the  United  States,  doesn't  think  an  immigration  debate  does  anything  but  help  Democrats.  "Every  day  that  we  discuss  immigration,  that  helps  Barack  Obama  change  the  topic  from  Obamacare."The  first  fight  is  the  debt  ceiling.Election  year  makes  Washington  even  more  confusingA  big  test  for  Boehner's  ability  to  assuage  conservatives  comes  soon:  House  Republicans  need  to  decide  how  they  will  approach  the  debate  over  the  debt  limit.  Treasury  Secretary  Jack  Lew  said  the  nation's  borrowing  authority  will  run  out  at  the  end  of  February.Last  fall's  government  shutdown  was  a  public  display  of  the  fight  between  conservatives  who  demanded  any  spending  bill  defund  Obamacare  and  establishment  Republicans  who  worried  it  was  a  no-win  situation.  But  that  episode  did  have  a  silver  lining  for  Boehner,  who  warned  the  standoff  over  Obamacare  would  backfire.  It  served  as  a  teachable  moment  for  conservatives  about  the  limits  of  what  they  can  demand  in  a  divided  government.Scalise  said  he  wants  to  address  the  long-term  debt  as  part  of  the  debt  debate,  but  he's  not  sure  yet  what  Republicans  should  negotiate  in  return  for  supporting  another  increase  in  the  debt  ceiling.  But  he  didn't  seem  to  think  that  debate  was  the  best  place  to  take  another  stand  on  Obamacare."It  has  to  be  something  achievable  and  we  ought  to  start  with  that.  It  ought  to  be  something  we  can  rally  the  country  around  and  ultimately  sign  into  law  that  addresses  the  problem,"  Scalise  said.How  Boehner  handles  the  delicate  relationship  with  conservatives  will  be  key  to  the  prospects  for  his  2014  legislative  agenda.  But  the  speaker  is  also  the  top  GOP  leader  in  Washington  of  a  party  still  struggling  to  regroup  after  losses  at  the  national  level  in  2012,  so  the  direction  he  takes  will  also  have  an  impact  on  the  political  message  in  this  fall's  midterm  elections.</TEXT></DOC>

Jackson  has  played  a  mob  hit  man  and  a  Jedi  master,  among  other  roles.His  newest  role:  Fighting  childhood  cancer.Jackson  is  featured  in  a  new  public  awareness  campaign,  launched  by  the  St.  Baldrick's  Foundation  and  Stand  Up  to  Cancer,  aimed  at  increasing  awareness  about  childhood  cancers.The  campaign  is  designed  to  promote  the  "critical  importance  for  infants  and  children,  and  in  particular  teens  and  young  adults  with  childhood  cancers,  to  be  treated  by  pediatric  oncologists,"  according  to  a  statement  from  the  organizations.  "Survival  for  teens  and  young  adults  is  far  greater  when  treated  on  pediatric  cancer  protocols."Each  year,  more  than  175,000  children  worldwide  are  diagnosed  with  cancer,  and  it's  the  No.  1  disease  killer  of  children.  The  campaign  also  highlights  the  need  to  support  pediatric  cancer  research,  the  organizations  said."When  I  was  a  child  in  the  1950s,  most  kids  who  got  diagnosed  with  cancer  had  little  chance  of  survival.  Now,  there  is  hope,"  said  Jackson  in  a  statement.

The  Super  Bowl  on  February  2  will  feature  a  mini-"Full  House"  reunion.The  three  actors,  who  starred  on  the  popular  ABC  sitcom  from  1987  to  1995,  will  appear  in  an  ad  spot  for  Dannon  Oikos  yogurt.A  teaser  for  the  commercial  has  already  been  released  and  hints  the  ad  will  poke  fun  at  the  three  men  still  living  together  after  all  these  years.On  the  series,  Saget  played  a  single  dad  of  three  girls  who  relied  on  his  friends  and  housemates,  played  by  Coulier  ("Uncle  Joey")  and  Stamos  ("Uncle  Jesse")  to  help  him  out  with  parenting.In  a  behind-the-scenes  video,  Stamos  (who's  already  a  spokesman  for  the  Dannon  brand)  says  he  thinks  the  ad  won't  leave  "Full  House"  fans  disappointed."I'm  very  grateful  to  my  two  brothers  for  doing  this  commercial  with  us  for  Dannon,"  Stamos  says,  "and  I  think  it's  going  to  be  really  funny.

Eric  Freed's  body.Eureka  Police  Chief  Andy  Mills  said  later  that  officers  and  a  doctor,  who  also  was  a  parishioner,  soon  determined  that  Freed  was  dead,  having  suffered  "blunt  force  trauma"  in  what  he  described  as  a  "violent  struggle."Court  and  other  records  obtained  Friday  by  CNN  did  not  hint  at  any  violent  crimes  in  Bullock's  history.But  they  do  shed  light  on  some  of  his  life,  including  speeding  tickets,  the  fact  he  has  at  least  three  daughters,  bankruptcy  filings  and  the  aforementioned  cocaine  arrest.He  pleaded  guilty  to  a  controlled  substance  charge  on  the  latter  matter,  leading  to  the  probation.  CNN's  efforts  on  Friday  to  reach  the  lawyer  who  represented  Bullock  in  this  case  were  unsuccessful.Bullock's  was  a  relatively  low-level  probation:  It  did  not  mean  he  should  remain  detained  were  he  ever  arrested  on  any  charge,  Lt.  Steve  Knight  of  the  Humboldt  County  Sheriff's  Office  said.Humboldt  County's  chief  probation  officer,  William  Damiano,  said  Bullock's  case  never  fell  under  his  department,  and  as  such  Bullock  didn't  have  to  do  things  like  check  in  regularly  with  a  probation  officer.The  California  Superior  Court  document  outlining  Bullock's  probation  specifies  that  he  would  be  in  violation  if  he  was  found  to  have  "any  nonprescribed  controlled  substance."But  the  guidelines  specifically  do  not  include  things  like  prohibiting  the  violation  of  any  "criminal  statutes;"  possession,  custody  or  control  of  any  alcohol;  or  "aggressive  or  assaultive  behavior  toward  any  person."These  facts  are  relevant,  given  Bullock's  interaction  with  authorities  in  the  hours  before  Freed's  death.According  to  Eureka  police,  the  43-year-old  was  "acting  strangely"  when  he  was  picked  up  by  county  sheriff's  deputies  in  Garberville.They  took  him  to  a  jail  where  "he  was  rejected  due  to  his  erratic  behavior,"  then  moved  him  to  a  nearby  hospital  "where  he  became  more  agitated  and  had  to  be  physically  restrained  by  deputies,"  police  added.  Knight,  from  the  sheriff's  office,  said  Bullock  was  sent  to  a  hospital  because  of  a  high  heart  rate.He  was  eventually  booked  into  a  jail  shortly  after  4:30  p.m.  that  day,  staying  there  for  more  than  eight  hours  before  his  release  at  12:43  a.m.  on  January  1.Less  than  two  hours  later,  police  got  a  call  about  a  suspicious  person  at  St.  Bernard  Church.  Officers  found  Bullock,  but  because  he  wasn't  "intoxicated  and  did  not  qualify  for  an  emergency  psychological  hold,"  they  didn't  detain  him.Instead,  they  referred  him  to  a  shelter,  Mills  said.Chief:  Police  want  to  know  why  slaying  happenedAt  some  point  later,  a  guard  at  St.  Bernard  found  a  person  matching  Bullock's  description  on  the  premises  and  told  him  to  leave,  police  said.Then  came  the  devastating  discovery  of  Freed's  body.  The  slain  priest's  2010  Nissan  hybrid  was  gone.Bullock  apparently  drove  45  minutes  from  the  parish  to  a  family  member's  house  in  that  car,  police  said.  One  of  Bullock's  relatives  eventually  tipped  off  police  to  his  whereabouts,  leading  to  his  arrest  midday  Thursday,  according  to  the  Eureka  police  chief."There's  no  question  in  our  mind  he's  responsible  for  this  heinous  act,"  Mills  said,  citing  evidence  recovered  at  the  crime  scene  and  interviews  with  witnesses  that  allegedly  link  Bullock  to  the  priest's  death.The  chief  added:  "To  me,  'why'  is  the  biggest  thing  that  we  would  like  to  establish  --  to  bring  a  sense  of  ease  and  comfort  to  the  community,"  Mills  said.That  community  --  including  members  of  St.  Bernard  Parish,  students  and  staff  at  Humboldt  State  University  where  Freed  taught,  and  residents  throughout  greater  Eureka  --  was  still  hurting  Friday,  as  it  tried  to  make  sense  of  the  violent  death  of  the  popular  priest."Eric  knew  as  well  as  anybody  just  how  senseless  violence  could  be,"  said  William  Herbrechtsmeier,  a  professor  at  Humboldt  State.  "When  a  fine  person  like  him  is  brought  down  --  that's  just  tragic."Since  2007,  Freed  had  taught  about  the  New  Testament  at  that  public  university,  where  he  also  had  a  leadership  role  in  the  Newman  Center  for  Catholic  students.He  developed  a  reputation  there  for  his  warmth  as  much  as  his  scholarly  expertise,  which  made  him  popular  on  campus."Kind  is  the  word  that  comes  to  mind,  sensitive."  said  professor  Stephen  Cunha,  the  chairman  of  Humboldt  State  University's  religious  studies  department.

Dave  Thompson.  He  was  cooperative  with  the  dozen  deputies,  but  he  did  not  answer  questions  about  the  alleged  vandalism,  Thompson  said.Justin  Bieber's  bad  year:  A  guideBieber  hasn't  spoken  to  investigators  about  last  week's  incident,  and  his  representative  had  declined  comment  to  CNN.One  of  Bieber's  house  guests  was  arrested  when  deputies  allegedly  found  cocaine  during  their  search,  Thompson  said.The  drug  suspect  was  not  immediately  identified  because  "I  was  told  he  gave  us  a  bad  name,"  sheriff's  spokesman  Steve  Whitmore  told  CNN  on  Tuesday  afternoon.  Detectives  were  running  the  man's  fingerprints  before  publicly  naming  him,  an  official  said."The  purpose  of  the  search  warrant  is  to  seek  video  surveillance  or  other  possible  evidence  in  the  vandalism  that  occurred  on  January  9,  2014,"  the  sheriff's  statement  said..The  vandalism  damage  to  the  house  of  Bieber's  neighbor  was  about  $20,000,  Thompson  said.  The  cost  of  repairing  the  damage  to  the  house  is  a  key  factor  in  determining  the  severity  of  the  charge.  Any  damage  of  more  than  $950  would  qualify  the  charge  as  a  felony."A  neighbor  accused  him  of  throwing  eggs  at  the  house,  and  we  are  investigating,"  Los  Angeles  County  Sheriff's  Sgt.  Don  Prince  told  CNN  on  Monday.If  investigators  find  enough  evidence  that  Bieber,  19,  threw  the  eggs  that  splattered  against  his  next-door  neighbor's  home,  they  could  refer  the  matter  to  the  district  attorney's  office  for  possible  prosecution,  Prince  said.Bieber's  Brazil  adventures:  Truth  or  idol  gossip?Bieber  lives  in  the  Oaks,  an  exclusive  gated  community,  in  Calabasas.

It  was  the  dawn  of  the  soft-drink  machine,  the  first  tube  of  the  Lincoln  Tunnel  ...  and  the  shopping  cart.  Inventor  Sylvan  Goldman's  prototype  for  the  shopping  cart  was  nothing  more  than  two  wire  baskets  attached  to  a  folding  chair,  but  it  was  the  start  of  what  would  become  a  supermarket  staple.When  it  first  came  on  the  scene,  customers  were  reluctant  to  use  the  cart.  But  by  the  1960s,  they  were  so  ubiquitous  that  a  new  problem  had  arisen:The  rogue  shopping  cart.Chicago  supermarket  owner  Anthony  Dinolfo  was  so  enraged  by  the  volume  of  stolen  shopping  carts  popping  up  in  places  decidedly  not  supermarkets  (in  auto  repair  shops,  people's  basements  and  at  the  bottom  of  rivers)  that  he  went  on  a  crusade  to  return  them  to  their  rightful  owners.  In  1969,  he  deemed  February  Return  Shopping  Carts  to  the  Supermarket  Month.Dinolfo  died  in  2009,  but  his  crusade  reappears  each  February  on  various  websites  and  Internet  forums,  and  was  even  acknowledged  by  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau.  When  we  brought  this  to  the  attention  of  the  CNN  iReport  community,  our  contributors  mentioned  that  until  now,  they  had  never  noticed  how  prevalent  wayward  shopping  carts  were.While  it  may  be  easy  to  write  off  Dinolfo's  crusade  as  just  the  hysterical  rant  of  a  disgruntled  business  owner,  retailers  report  cart  theft  to  be  a  costly  problem.  Shopping  carts  cost  anywhere  from  $75  to  $150  each,  according  to  Brett  Osterfeld  of  Gatekeeper  systems.Retailers  find  customers'  ambivalence  toward  the  issue  frustrating,  but  most  people  can't  help  but  think  that  there  are  greater  causes  to  raise  awareness  about."Am  I  supposed  to  really  feel  sorry  for  the  grocers?"  asked  Jeremy  Nix  from  Denver.The  great  cart  robberyRon  Fong,  president  and  CEO  of  the  California  Grocers  Association,  found  that  stores  that  report  the  greatest  losses  are  located  in  neighborhoods  and  cities  where  few  people  own  a  car,  but  still  need  an  efficient  way  to  carry  their  groceries  home.Once  the  shoppers  are  finished,  the  carts  rarely  return  to  the  store.  Fong  said  that  he's  seen  many  innovative  uses  for  shopping  carts,  such  as  portable  barbecue  grills,  lounge  chairs  and  even  shelters.  He  noted  that  many  homeless  people  use  them  to  transport  their  belongings.In  November,  Hawaii  state  lawmaker  Tom  Brower  attempted  to  clean  up  the  state's  homeless  problem  by  taking  a  sledgehammer  to  abandoned  shopping  carts.  Hawaii  has  the  country's  highest  rate  of  homeless  per  capita;  Brewer  said  his  solution  was  meant  to  encourage  them  to  seek  out  shelters."I  get  a  lot  of  complaints  about  stolen  and  abandoned  shopping  carts  in  Waikiki,  and  I  was  thinking  as  a  public  servant,  'What  can  I  do  that  would  be  practical  and  I  can  literally  do  overnight?'  "  Brower  told  CNN  affiliate  KITV.  "I'm  not  doing  anything  different  than  doing  a  community  cleanup,  or  what  the  city's  administration  has  tried  to  do  with  the  issue  of  people  illegally  camping  on  the  streets."Supermarkets  and  community  members  aren't  the  only  ones  upset  about  the  stray  carts.  The  city  of  Santa  Ana,  California,  reported  an  annual  cost  of  $50,000  to  retrieve  abandoned  shopping  carts  from  local  streams  and  rivers.  Across  the  country,  John  Long,  president  of  the  Maryland  nonprofit  Clean  Bread  and  Cheese  Creek,  said  that  volunteers  have  removed  more  than  200  shopping  carts  from  the  creek  that  drains  into  the  Chesapeake  Bay  since  2009."They  create  an  environmental  hazard  by  trapping  wildlife  and  causing  artificial  dams  along  the  stream,  which  lead  to  flooding  and  erosion,"  Long  said.Stores  are  working  to  contain  the  problem  through  the  use  of  cart  containment  systems  --  the  wheels  lock  when  they  reach  the  boundary  of  the  store's  parking  lot  --  and  by  hiring  companies  to  locate  and  return  the  carts  for  a  fee.And  yet,  it's  not  hard  to  find  plenty  of  shopping  carts  in  the  wild  ...Scroll  through  the  gallery  to  see  some  of  the  spots  where  carts  have  turned  up.</TEXT></DOC>

Let's  spread  love  and  compassion  to  Beliebers  today.  That  is  what  we  are  all  about."Ellen  DeGeneres,  who  once  had  Bieber  on  her  show  to  surprise  him  with  a  car  as  a  birthday  gift,  sounded  genuine  when  she  tweeted  she  hopes  the  star  will  be  able  to  mature  without  injury.Nickelodeon  star  Grande,  who  spent  some  time  on  tour  with  Bieber  and  shares  a  manager  with  the  pop  star,  Scooter  Braun,  didn't  directly  address  Bieber  by  name,  but  the  timing  of  her  reaction  on  Twitter  spoke  volumes.Meanwhile,  other  stars  such  as  Seth  Rogen  and  Jason  Biggs  had  decidedly  less  kind  reactions  to  the  news  that  Bieber  had  been  pulled  over  while  drag  racing  in  Miami  Beach,  Florida,  and  then  arrested  on  charges  of  drunken  driving,  resisting  arrest  and  driving  without  a  valid  license."All  jokes  aside,  Justin  Bieber  is  a  piece  of  s***,"  Rogen  tweeted.  Biggs  joked,  "50  in  a  30.  Jesus,  Bieber  even  drag  races  like  a  p****.""Supernatural"  actor  Jared  Padalecki  said,  "Just  saw  the  mugshot  of  @justinbieber.  I  gotta  admit,  she's  kinda  hot  without  all  of  her  usual  makeup  on."Over  on  late  night,  Bieber  was  the  top  joke  on  both  "Jimmy  Kimmel  Live"  and  "Late  Night  With  Jimmy  Fallon."Kimmel  poked  fun  at  Bieber's  transformation  from  teeny-bopper  to  apparent  troublemaker.He  also  joked  about  the  outcry  from  distraught  Beliebers  who  were  depressed  that  criminals  in  Florida  got  to  meet  their  idol  before  they  did.On  "Late  Night,"  Fallon  skewered  Bieber's  mug  shot,  saying  that  he  mistook  it  for  a  commercial  for  Proactiv,  an  acne  treatment  product.But  according  to  Bieber's  manager,  Braun,  and  his  friend  Lil  Za,  the  singer's  arrest  is  no  laughing  matter."He's  fine,"  Lil  Za  posted  Thursday  afternoon.  "Nobody's  happy.  nobody  thinks  it's  a  joke.""Been  a  long  day.  Bottom  line  is  we  are  defined  by  how  we  handle  adversity.  Be  there  when  it  counts.  Love  fully  in  good  times  and  bad,"  Braun  added.  "(Bieber)  love  you  and  i  will  act  in  the  manner  of  someone  who  truly  cares.  that  is  all  I  have  to  say.  thanks  for  all  those  concerned."If  all  else  fails  and  the  arrest  brings  Bieber's  career  to  a  halt,  at  least  he  has  Vanilla  Ice  in  his  corner.

Dexter  and  Martin  Luther  King  III  have  sued  to  force  their  sister  to  turn  over  those  items,  and  a  judge  has  ordered  the  items  stored  in  a  safe  deposit  box  that  only  the  court  can  open  until  the  case  is  resolved.In  a  statement  issued  Thursday  afternoon,  Bernice  King  acknowledged  that  she  had  once  considered  selling  other  heirlooms,  including  the  Spingarn  Medal  the  NAACP  awarded  her  father  in  1957.  But  she  said  she  had  never  believed  it  was  acceptable  to  sell  the  Nobel  Prize  medal  or  King's  traveling  Bible,  which  was  used  by  President  Barack  Obama  when  he  was  sworn  in  for  his  second  term."At  the  time  I  agreed  in  2007  to  the  potential  transfer  of  certain  memorabilia  to  the  National  Center  for  Human  and  Civil  Rights,  it  was  totally  consistent  with  furthering  the  King  legacy  because  of  the  nature  of  their  mission,"  she  said.  "They  are  a  civil  rights  center.  But  let  it  be  noted  that  I  have  and  always  will  object  to  the  sale  of  the  Nobel  Peace  Prize  and  Bible  as  I  believe  the  sale  of  those  items  is  sacrilegious  and  a  breach  of  my  obligation  as  a  steward  and  trustee  of  my  father's  legacy."King  was  assassinated  in  1968,  and  his  widow,  Coretta  Scott  King,  died  in  2006.In  court  papers,  the  King  brothers  submitted  an  e-mail  inventory  Bernice  King  wrote  in  2007  that  divided  items  from  the  estate  of  the  civil  rights  leader  into  four  categories:  those  she  would  be  willing  to  sell,  including  the  Spingarn  Medal;  items  she  would  not  be  willing  to  sell,  but  might  consider  lending,  such  as  the  Nobel  Peace  Prize  and  Bible;  items  that  had  questions  associated  with  them;  and  items  she  would  have  to  examine  before  deciding.But  in  Thursday's  statement,  Bernice  King  said  that  now,  "I  would  not  support  the  sale  of  most  of  the  memorabilia  listed  in  the  2007  e-mail."The  CEO  of  the  National  Center  for  Civil  and  Human  Rights,  Doug  Shipman,  told  CNN  on  Thursday  that  he  had  no  comment  on  the  legal  proceedings  and  that  his  center  had  not  bought  any  items  from  the  King  estate.  But  he  said  the  center  plans  to  display  King  papers  sold  several  years  ago  by  the  estate  and  now  owned  by  Morehouse  College.Bernice  King,  who  was  5  when  her  father  was  assassinated,  is  acting  as  the  "gatekeeper"  to  her  father's  property,  said  attorney  William  Hill,  who  represents  the  King  estate.  He  said  she  has  no  individual  claim  to  the  property  that  belongs  to  the  estate  controlled  by  her  brothers.Wednesday,  Fulton  County  Superior  Judge  Robert  McBurney  ordered  the  disputed  items  placed  "in  a  safe  deposit  box  in  an  unknown  location."  But  he  warned  Bernice  King  it  was  likely  that  her  brothers  would  be  able  to  show  "the  Bible  and  peace  prize  are  possessions  of  the  estate."According  to  the  King  brothers'  complaint,  King's  heirs  agreed  in  1995  to  give  up  their  inheritance  to  the  Estate  of  Martin  Luther  King  Jr.  Inc.,  but  Bernice  King  has  "secreted  and  sequestered"  the  items  in  question.Bernice  King  has  said  her  brothers  told  her  on  January  22  that  they  wanted  the  items  so  they  could  sell  them.  Her  attorney,  Eric  Barnum,  called  the  attempt  to  sell  the  items  a  "money  grab,"  saying  there's  a  history  of  the  King  sons  taking  money  made  from  selling  possessions  to  line  their  own  pockets.The  judge  compared  Bernice  King's  stance  against  the  sale  of  her  father's  possessions  to  Coca-Cola  not  wanting  to  sell  its  secret  soft  drink  recipe.  He  later  noted  he  was  not  trivializing  the  value  of  King's  possessions  with  the  comparison.This  is  not  the  first  time  the  family  has  been  at  odds  over  King's  legacy.  Over  the  years,  the  siblings  have  sued  and  countersued  one  another.Bernice  King  and  Martin  Luther  King  III  sued  Dexter  King  in  2008,  accusing  him  of  converting  "substantial  funds  from  the  estate's  financial  account  at  Bank  of  America"  for  his  own  use.  They  agreed  to  a  settlement,  thereby  avoiding  a  trial.</TEXT></DOC>

tower  with  a  crack  in  it  given  by  Russia  to  the  United  States  to  commemorate  9/11  and  the  1993  World  Trade  Center  bombing.READ:  London's  oddest  museum  exhibitsOfficials

 African-Americans  is  marked  across  the  world,  but  the  sculpture  marking  his  Memorial  Bridge  in  Toledo,  Ohio,  really  stands  out.For  some  reason,  it  depicts  the  assassinated  religious  leader  and  activist  as  a  kind  of  sinister,  four-faced  entity  protruding  from  a  globe.Looking  every  gleaming  inch  the  sort  of  commemoration  any  enemy  of  Superman  or  Batman  would  be  proud  of,  the  tripod  mounted  monument  could  only  be  more  glaringly  unsuccessful  if  it  revolved  and  played  fairground  music.Martin  Luther  King  Memorial  Bridge,  Cherry  Street,  Toledo,  OhioMonument  to  the  Party's  Foundation  (Pyongyang,  North  Korea)Grace,  ambiguity,  transcendence  --  all  qualities  sadly  lacking  from  this  North  Korean  monument  to  the  foundation  of  the  communist  state's  Workers'  Party.Rather,  with  its  huge,  encircled  mallet,  scythe  and  nibbed  pen  rendered  Lego-like  in  concrete  bricks,  it  resembles  a  crude  advertisement  for  a  general  goods  store  stuck  by  some  lonely  Midwestern  highway.MORE:  In  pictures  --  world's  most  dramatic  runwaysInstead  of  its  intended  symbolism  of  workers,  farmers  and  intellectuals  acting  in  unison,  some  have  suggested  the  North  Korean  sculpture  looks  like  it  could  represent  a  blown-up  state  communist

beleaguered  Catholic  Church  would  have  a  tick  list  that  includes,  "Make  sure  it  doesn't  look  like  Mussolini  trying  to  kidnap  a  minor."Unfortunately,  decision-makers  in  Rome,  or  at  least  the  statue's  builders,  missed  that  memo  and  managed  to  commission  a  2011-built  memorial  to  Pope  John  Paul  II  that  one  critic  called  "a  sin."A  recent  reworking  has  tweaked  the  design  and  minimized  the  widely  remarked  upon  resemblance  to  the  Italian  fascist  dictator,  but  that  gather-ye-all  cape  remains  a  little  creepy.Pope  John  Paul

came  to  power.Now  18  meters  higher,  but  no  longer  rotating,  this  marker  of  the  boundary  between  flaming  kitsch  and  sheer  ugliness  remains  outlandish  enough  to  astonish  any

(Chanel's  Métiers  d'Art  collection  for  2013/2014  even  took  place  at  Fair  Park  in  Dallas).On  a  similar  wavelength,  Aimette  expects  a  rise  in  heritage  fabrics  like  plaid,  houndstooth  and  gingham,  but  re-colored  in  bright  hues.  This  gives  way  to  the  bigger  androgynous  trend  of  decorated  menswear-inspired  shoes,  oversized  sweaters  and  tailored  sportswear.Meanwhile,  the  spring  crop  top  trend  is  traveling  south:  we'll  see  more  cropped  pants  come  fall."Crop  tops  are  moving  towards  more  boxy  tops,"  says  Aimette,  citing  higher  waisted  pants  paired  with  short  but  not  midriff-baring  blouses."The  seasons  are  becoming  less  about  weather-related  clothing  and  more  about  key  items  a  woman  needs  for  her  lifestyle,"  said  Joyann  King,  Harper's  BAZAAR  Digital  Director.King  says  this  includes  "a  wardrobe  of  coats  to  lust  after."The  sportswear  trend  will  continue  but  not  dominate  the  ensemble;  instead,  athletic  styling  will  be  used  to  accent  distinctively  feminine  pieces.

But  scientists  announced  Monday  a  breakthrough  in  understanding  how  our  world  as  we  know  it  came  to  be.If  the  discovery  holds  up  to  scrutiny,  it's  evidence  of  how  the  universe  rapidly  expanded  less  than  a  trillionth  of  a  second  after  the  Big  Bang."It  teaches  us  something  crucial  about  how  our  universe  began,"  said  Sean  Carroll,  a  physicist  at  California  Institute  of  Technology,  who  was  not  involved  in  the  study.  "It's  an  amazing  achievement  that  we  humans,  doing  science  systematically  for  just  a  few  hundred  years,  can  extend  our  understanding  that  far."What's  more,  researchers  discovered  direct  evidence  for  the  first  time  of  what  Albert  Einstein  predicted  in  his  general  theory  of  relativity:  Gravitational  waves.These  are  essentially  ripples  in  space-time,  which  have  been  thought  of  as  the  "first  tremors  of  the  Big  Bang,"  according  to  the  Harvard-Smithsonian  Center  for  Astrophysics.A  telescope  at  the  South  Pole  called  BICEP2  --  Background  Imaging  of  Cosmic  Extragalactic  Polarization  2  --  was  critical  to  the  discovery.  The  telescope  allowed  scientists  to  analyze  the  polarization  of  light  left  over  from  the  early  universe,  leading  to  Monday's  landmark  announcement.How  inflation  worksScientists  use  the  word  "inflation"  to  describe  how  the  universe  rapidly  expanded  after  the  Big  Bang  in  a  ripping-apart  of  space.  The  BICEP2  results  are  the  "smoking  gun  for  inflation,"  Marc  Kamionkowski,  professor  of  physics  and  astronomy,  said  at  a  news  conference.  Kamionkowski  also  was  not  involved  in  the  project."Inflation  is  the  theory  about  the  'bang'  of  Big  Bang,"  said  Chao-Lin  Kuo,  an  assistant  professor  of  physics  at  Stanford  and  SLAC  National  Accelerator  Laboratory,  and  a  co-leader  of  the  BICEP2  collaboration,  in  a  Stanford  video.  "It  explains  why  we  have  all  this  stuff  in  the  universe."Imagine  that  you  are  making  a  raisin  bun,  said  Stanford  physicist  Kent  Irwin,  who  worked  on  sensors  and  readout  systems  used  in  the  experiment.  As  the  dough  bakes  and  expands,  the  distance  from  any  given  raisin  to  another  increases."Certainly  everything  in  the  universe  that  we  see  now,  at  one  time  before  inflation,  was  smaller  than  an  electron,"  Irwin  said.  "And  then  it  expanded  during  inflation  at  faster  than  the  speed  of  light."You  may  have  learned  in  physics  class  that  light  sets  the  universe's  speed  limit,  but  space-time  is  an  exception;  it  can  stretch  faster  than  the  speed  of  light,  Irwin  said.Stanford  University  professor  Andrei  Linde,  who  helped  develop  the  current  inflation  theory,  said  the  new  results  are  something  he  had  hoped  to  see  for  30  years."If  this  is  true,  this  is  a  moment  of  understanding  of  nature  of  such  a  magnitude  that  it  just  overwhelms  and  let's  just  hope  that  it's  not  a  trick,"  Linde  said  in  a  university  video  interview.Another  cool  tidbit:  Inflation  can  be  used  in  theories  that  suggest  the  existence  of  multiple  universes,  Irwin  said,  although  these  results  do  not  directly  address  such  theories.What  are  gravitational  waves?Scientists  believe  that  in  the  fabric  of  space-time,  there  are  tiny  ripples  called  quantum  fluctuations.  If  you  could  look  at  space-time  on  the  smallest  scale  possible,  you  would,  in  theory,  see  them,  even  today.  Unfortunately,  no  microscope  is  capable  of  seeing  something  that  small.Such  fluctuations  also  existed  at  the  beginning  of  the  universe.  Inflation  blew  them  up  much  larger,  launching  gravitational  waves  that  we  now  see  imprinted  on  the  cosmic  microwave  background.  "These  gravitational  waves  are  an  aftershock  of  the  Big  Bang,"  he  said.  The  BICEP2  study  is  the  first  to  image  them  directly."We  have  for  the  first  time  a  detection  for  the  mythical  gravity  wave  signal  that  people  have  been  searching  for  so  hard,  for  so  long,"  said  Clem  Pryke,  associate  professor  at  the  University  of  Minnesota,  at  a  press  conference  Monday.Other  experiments  such  as  LIGO  --  Caltech's  Laser  Interferometer  Gravitational  Wave  Observatory  --  are  also  looking  for  proof  of  gravitational  waves,  but  in  the  context  of  energetic  cosmic  phenomena  such  as  coalescing  black  holes.The  gravitational  waves  suggested  by  the  BICEP2  results  would  have  expanded  across  the  entire  universe  at  that  time,  Irwin  said.  The  length  of  one  of  these  waves  --  the  distance  between  peaks  and  troughs  --  would  have  been  billions  of  light  years  across.Light  from  the  early  universe,  called  cosmic  microwave  background  radiation,  reveals  these  telltale  signs  of  our  universe's  history.  Last  year,  scientists  from  the  European  Space  Agency's  Planck  space  telescope  released  a  detailed  map  of  temperature  variations  in  this  light,  which  came  from  from  about  380,000  years  after  the  Big  Bang.Better  'baby  picture'  of  universe  emergesInstead  of  temperature,  BICEP2  scientists  were  looking  specifically  at  the  polarization  of  the  cosmic  microwave  background  --  that  is,  the  direction  the  electric  field  is  pointing  across  the  sky.Researchers  were  looking  for  a  specific  type  of  polarization  called  "B-modes,"  which  signify  a  curling  pattern  in  the  polarized  orientations  of  light  from  the  ancient  universe,  said  Jamie  Bock,  co-leader  of  the  BICEP2  collaboration  and  professor  of  physics  at  California  Institute  of  Technology.In  theory,  this  swirling  polarization  pattern  could  only  be  created  from  gravitational  waves.  And  that  is  what  BICEP2  found."It's  a  very  clean  signature  of  those  gravity  waves,"  Irwin  said.Is  it  for  real?Because  of  how  potentially  important  these  results  are,  they  must  be  viewed  with  skepticism,  said  David  Spergel,  professor  of  astrophysics  at  Princeton  University.  The  measurement  is  a  very  difficult  one  to  make  and  could  easily  be  contaminated.  There  are,  as  it  stands,  some  "oddities"  in  the  results  that  could  be  concerning,  he  said."I  am  looking  forward  to  seeing  these  results  confirmed  or  refuted  by  other  experiments  in  the  next  year  or  two,"  Spergel  said.The  Planck  space  telescope  collaboration  is  expected  to  release  results  on  polarization  of  the  cosmic  microwave  background  as  well,  Irwin  said.  Other  experiments  are  working  toward  similar  goals,  which  could  support  or  go  against  BICEP2.Regardless,  Monday's  announcement  is  making  big  waves  in  the  scientific  community.Follow  Elizabeth  Landau  on  Twitter  at  @lizlandau</TEXT></DOC>

I  got  them  dressed  today.  We  fought  over  wearing  hats  because  it  was  cold  outside.  I  packed  their  snacks.  I  dropped  them  off  and  kissed  their  chubby  cheeks.  I  am  the  PTA  treasurer  for  my  daughter's  school.  I  am  a  volunteer  in  the  community.I  am  a  wife  to  a  partner  I  have  been  with  nearly  14  years.  I  live  in  a  suburb.  I  have  all  the  trappings  of  a  comfortable  life.  I  am  content  in  my  daily  life.What  sets  me  apart  from  the  typical  soccer  mom  is  that  I  am  an  outspoken  recovering  heroin  addict.  Many  people  might  be  familiar  with  my  story  from  the  movie  "Black  Tar  Heroin:  The  Dark  End  of  the  Street."I  agreed  to  be  featured  in  the  film  because  I  thought  it  would  live  on  after  I  died  from  an  overdose  as  a  testimonial  to  the  dangers  of  drug  addiction.Yet  I  survived  eight  years  of  heroin  addiction.  I  was  one  of  the  lucky  few  from  that  time  period  when  treatment  options  and  evidence-based  treatment  solutions  were  limited.I  started  my  journey  as  a  heroin  addict  while  a  college  student  in  Cincinnati.  I  had  been  given  Vicodin  after  removal  of  my  wisdom  teeth.I  fell  in  love  with  that  feeling  opiates  provided  me.  My  burdens  seemed  to  slip  away  under  the  influence.  I  longed  for  that  feeling.After  experimenting  with  many  drugs,  I  found  opiates  provided  me  with  the  ability  to  forget  my  problems.  No  longer  was  I  obsessed  with  feeling  different.  I  was  happy  with  being  numb.My  addiction  quickly  spiraled  until  I  ended  up  being  a  homeless  junkie  in  the  streets  of  San  Francisco's  Tenderloin  district.At  first  I  was  doing  the  drugs,  but  in  short  order  the  drugs  began  to  control  every  aspect  of  my  life.  I  was  living  on  the  streets  and  in  and  out  of  rat-infested  hotels.  In  a  few  short  years,  I  was  completely  unrecognizable  as  my  former  self.My  last  day  using  was  February  26,  1998.  I  was  injecting  heroin  into  the  soles  of  my  feet  because  I  no  longer  had  any  usable  veins.  I  could  barely  walk,  I  was  emaciated,  and  I  was  relieved  when  I  was  arrested  that  night.  I  spent  my  first  months  off  drugs  in  the  San  Francisco  County  Jail.This  was  not  my  first  time  detoxing  from  heroin.  Fortunately,  it  would  be  my  last  time.  I  was  able  to  get  into  a  treatment  program  followed  by  a  sober-living  house,  where  I  lived  for  four  years.In  the  years  I  have  been  off  heroin,  I  have  struggled  with  depression,  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  and  anxiety.  Many  addicts  find  that  once  the  drugs  are  removed,  the  underlying  cause  to  the  use  can  be  nearly  as  painful  as  the  use  itself.When  the  drugs  are  removed,  there  can  be  an  overwhelming  sense  of  sadness.  Getting  clean  can  be  seen  as  the  ultimate  solution.  When  the  veil  of  chemicals  lifts,  the  person  may  not  like  what  is  revealed  to  him  or  her.I  dealt  with  these  feelings  without  using  heroin.  However,  the  thought  crossed  my  mind  many  times  that  relief  can  easily  be  found  at  the  bottom  of  a  spoon.  That  is  part  of  my  affliction.Everyone  has  a  different  treatment  story.  The  reality  for  me  was  and  is  that  stopping  use  of  the  substance  is  relatively  easy  compared  with  staying  off  drugs.The  lifetime  commitment  to  abstinence  from  drugs  is  what  kills  many  people.  When  they  have  cravings  to  use,  the  stigma  attached  to  heroin  use  forces  them  to  deal  or  not  deal  with  their  affliction  in  private.This  decision  is  frequently  fatal,  as  in  the  case  of  Philip  Seymour  Hoffman.  If  we  were  courageous  enough  to  try  to  conquer  our  insatiable  desire  for  heroin,  we  feel  weak  telling  another  person  that  we  feel  like  using  is  once  again  a  viable  option.I  know  these  feelings.  Fifteen  years  later,  I  still  deal  with  the  stigma  of  being  a  heroin  addict.  The  track  marks  and  scars  are  visible,  but  the  pain  of  longing  lies  deep  under  the  surface.  Many  heroin  addicts  are  embarrassed  to  admit  they  ever  had  a  problem  with  this  powerful  substance.If  you  are  open  about  it,  it  triggers  speculation  and  scrutiny  as  to  your  personal  well-being.  Addiction  is  a  medical  condition,  yet  there  is  little  sympathy  because  society  views  it  to  be  self-inflicted.I  have  chosen  a  different  path  for  myself.  I  chose  to  be  completely  open  about  my  experience  in  hope  that  others  can  learn  that  recovery  is  possible.What  will  I  tell  my  children?  They  are  too  young  to  understand  drugs,  but  they  know  I  used  to  be  homeless.  I  want  them  to  understand  how  fortunate  they  are  in  hopes  they  will  not  go  down  the  same  path.What  do  I  say  when  people  see  the  movie  and  contact  me  through  social  media  looking  for  answers  to  their  own  addiction?  There  are  many  roads  to  recovery.  The  path  that  I  followed  worked  for  me,  but  I  cannot  dictate  what  may  work  for  another  user  struggling  to  get  off  drugs.  I  can  only  share  my  experience.I  have  spent  my  second  chance  at  life  teaching  both  harm  reduction  and  overdose  prevention  because  all  of  us  have  a  life  worth  saving.  I  feel  blessed  I  am  able  to  bring  a  voice  and  a  face  to  the  issue.</TEXT></DOC>

Rosie  Perez  wasn't  raised  by  her  parentsHer  parents,  Lydia  Perez  and  Ismael  Serrano,  were  both  married  to  others  when  they  met.  Her  father  later  told  Rosie  he  couldn't  help  himself:  He  was  drawn  to  her  mother."It  wasn't  clear  if  (Lydia)  knew  that  Ismael  was  married  or  not.  He  never  really  kept  it  a  secret,  but  then  again,  he  wasn't  the  first  to  volunteer  that  information  either,"  Perez  wrote.Perez  was  raised  primarily  in  a  Catholic  children's  home  in  New  York,  with  regular  visits  to  her  mother  and  aunt.  Her  father  tried  to  get  custody  of  Perez  while  she  was  in  the  home,  but  was  not  successful.Her  paternal  aunt,  Ana  Dominga  Otero  Serrano-Roque,  loved  Perez  unconditionally."I  didn't  include  this  in  the  book  but  once,  when  work  was  slow  and  money  was  tight,  my  aunt  cut  up  some  Slim  Jim's  --  she  worked  at  the  factory  in  Brooklyn  --  and  put  it  in  the  rice  as  meat  for  dinner.  We  looked  at  each  other  and  I  could  tell  she  was  embarrassed  but  just  then  she  said,  'He,  he,  he'  and  we  started  laughing  so  hard,"  Perez  told  CNN."That  same  day,  one  of  the  neighbors  came  over  to  eat,  as  they  often  did,  and  she  cut  that  portion  in  half  and  gave  it  to  them.  As  you  kid,  you  watch  it,  nothing  has  to  be  said.  Her  actions  spoke  volumes,"  Perez  added.When  she  was  older,  Perez  was  invited  to  visit  her  mother  in  Brooklyn,  but  says  she  was  always  treated  like  "the  other."  Perez's  hair,  weight  and  resemblance  to  her  father  made  her  a  target  for  teasing.2.  Perez  earned  an  Oscar  and  Golden  Globe  nomination  for  her  role  in  "Fearless"The  Brooklyn-native  is  perhaps  best  known  for  her  role  in  Spike  Lee's  "Do  The  Right  Thing"  or  starring  alongside  Woody  Harrelson  and  Wesley  Snipes  in  "White  Men  Can't  Jump."  But  few  are  aware  of  her  two  nominations  for  best  supporting  actress  as  plane  crash  survivor  Carla  Rodrigo  in  "Fearless.""I  knew  deep  inside  that  I  could  play  this  part  with  ease.  I  understood  loss,  depression,  betrayal  and  how  to  pull  yourself  back  together,"  Perez  wrote  of  her  character,  who  struggles  with  survivor's  guilt  but  finds  solace  with  another  survivor  Max,  played  by  Jeff  Bridges.After  landing  the  part,  she  tried  to  quit,  scared  to  explore  the  character's  vulnerability.But  when  director  Peter  Weir  tapped  into  her  issues  with  success,  she  realized  she  felt  guilty  about  making  it  out  of  the  ward  of  the  state  system.  She  ended  up  living  with  her  aunt  instead  of  her  mother  and  reconnected  with  her  father.  Weir  insisted  on  not  hiring  anyone  else  and  reassured  her  it  was  going  to  be  great.3.  Perez  is  a  three-time  Emmy-nominated  choreographerPerez  became  a  choreographer  almost  overnight  after  being  offered  a  gig  by  A&R  executive  Louil  Silas  Jr.  to  teach  his  then-new  artist,  Bobby  Brown,  hip-hop  moves  for  music  videos  "Don't  Be  Cruel"  and  "My  Prerogative."  That  led  to  working  with  Diana  Ross,  Heavy  D  &  The  Boyz  and  LL  Cool  J.Those  skills  caught  the  eye  of  Keenen  Ivory  Wayans,  who  helped  her  land  a  gig  as  the  choreographer  for  the  Fly  Girls  on  "In  Living  Color."  That's  where  she  was  nominated  for  her  first  Emmy  for  choreography.  She  later  earned  two  more  Emmy  nominations.4.  Perez  was  discovered  by  "Soul  Train"  and  Spike  Lee  while  dancing  in  clubsShe  got  her  start  dancing  after  being  spotted  dancing  at  clubs  in  Los  Angeles  and  was  asked  to  go  on  "Soul  Train."  But  the  show's  creator  and  host  Don  Cornelius  was  critical  of  her  moves  and  her  looks."Don  Cornelius  gave  me  an  incredulous  look  regarding  my  accent.  I  lessened  it;  he  gave  a  nod  of  approval,"  Perez  wrote  in  her  memoir.  "Instantly,  I  felt  ashamed.  I  had  made  my  first  conscious  effort  not  to  sound  ethnic."Cornelius  also  wanted  her  to  dance  more  like  a  "sexy  vixen,"  drop  her  hip-hop  moves  and  dress  in  "tight-ass  minis  and  high  heels."But  one  day,  their  disagreement  got  physical  and  Perez  stormed  out  of  "Soul  Train,"  but  not  before  she  threw  a  chicken  wing  at  his  head.  Years  later,  the  two  made  amends.It  was  not  the  first  time  she  would  be  discovered  out  of  confrontation.Before  leaving  Los  Angeles,  she  went  out  dancing  at  the  same  club  Spike  Lee  was  having  a  "butt  contest  to  see  which  black  chick  had  the  biggest  ass"  to  promote  his  movie  "School  Daze."Disgusted  by  the  contest,  Perez  decided  to  make  a  mockery  of  it."I  jumped  on  the  stage...  and  bent  over  shaking  my  ass...  bouncers  came  over  with  this  little  skinny  guy  and  told  me  to  get  down.  My  bravado  vanished,"  Perez  wrote.That  skinny  guy  turned  out  to  be  Spike  Lee.  The  director  was  amused  with  Perez,  introduced  himself,  and  days  later,  he  asked  her  to  audition  for  "Do  the  Right  Thing."5.  Her  father  had  a  panic  attack  in  the  movie  theater  when  he  saw  her  nude  scene  in  "Do  the  Right  Thing"When  Perez's  first  movie  came  out,  her  father  invited  everyone  from  Aguadilla,  Puerto  Rico  --  including  the  family  pastor  --  to  watch.  She  didn't  prepare  her  dad  for  her  nude  scene.  It  shocked  him  so  much  that  he  was  rushed  to  the  hospital  with  what  he  thought  was  a  heart  attack."When  the  ice  cube  scene  came  on,  my  father  gasped,  jumped  up,  grabbed  his  heart  and  fell  out  cold  --  no  lie!  He  was  taken  away  in  an  ambulance.  I  felt  horrible.  I  flew  down  immediately,"  she  wrote.But  that  didn't  stop  her  father  from  milking  it  as  he  asked  Perez  to  "do  it  with  class"  next  time  and  let  him  know  if  she  was  doing  an  "artistic  film."6.  She  almost  didn't  get  the  part  in  "White  Men  Can't  Jump,"  because  the  studio  had  an  issue  with  her  ethnicity"I  went  through  several  more  callbacks.  The  studio,  as  I  was  told,  had  a  problem  that  I  was  Puerto  Rican;  they  were  worried  about  the  interracial  aspect,"  Perez  wrote.But  Wesley  Snipes  and  Woody  Harrelson  fought  to  get  her  the  part.  She  wrote  that  she  was  "grateful  that  they  put  themselves  out  there  like  that,"  because  "that's  the  only  way  things  change  --  when  everyone  joins  the  fight  and  you're  not  the  only  one  rushing  up  the  hill."As  Snipes  predicted,  the  movie  was  a  huge  hit,  which  opened  doors  for  Perez.  Roles  offered  to  her  thereafter  were  less  stereotypical.7.  Perez  refused  to  take  on  stereotypical  Latina  rolesPeople  told  Perez  to  be  quiet  and  stop  pointing  fingers  at  people  that  were  going  to  give  her  a  job  because  she  would  risk  hurting  her  career.  But  she  refused."Hollywood's  racist.  I  knew  something  else  would  come  along  that  I  was  OK  with.  Sometimes  you  pay  a  price  by  not  working  as  much,  but  I  felt  good  about  myself  in  the  morning,"  Perez  told  CNN.Perez  measured  her  success  in  terms  of  stability,  happiness  and  having  a  real  life  --  even  if  that  didn't  mean  gobs  of  money  and  fame.8.  Perez  was  mentally,  physically  and  sexually  abused  for  much  of  her  childhood  and  diagnosed  with  PTSDPerez,  along  with  other  children  at  the  group  home  where  she  was  raised,  were  often  subjected  to  the  nuns'  cruelty.  She  was  also  severely  abused  by  her  mother,  who  was  mentally  ill,  she  wrote.In  her  memoir,  Perez  also  writes  for  the  first  time  that  her  half-brother  sexually  assaulted  her  twice  during  her  childhood  while  she  visited  her  mother's  house.  When  she  told  her  mother,  Perez  writes  that  she  was  smacked  and  punished  for  lying.Nobody  was  prosecuted  in  the  case,  Perez  said  in  an  interview.  She  said  she  hopes  her  siblings  are  getting  help  to  break  the  cycle  of  abuse,  she  said,  because  they  were  all  victims.Indeed,  it  wasn't  until  she  was  an  adult  that  she  went  to  therapy."If  someone  was  to  punch  you  in  the  face  for  18  years  of  your  life,  wouldn't  you  go  to  the  hospital  to  get  it  treated?  It's  the  same  thing  when  it  comes  to  mental  and  physical  abuse  as  well,"  Rosie  said  to  CNN.While  not  unique  to  Latinos,  Rosie  also  said  there's  certainly  a  stigma  in  Latino  culture  about  mental  health."I've  heard  racist  remarks  that  refer  to  getting  psychotherapy  help  as  'being  white,'"  Perez  said.  "We  (Latinos)  are  selling  ourselves  short.  Like  my  therapist  said,  'If  you're  diabetic,  you  take  insulin.'  Therapy  is  not  a  'white  thing.'  It's  a  clinical  thing."9.  She  was  raised  Catholic,  but  she  doesn't  know  if  she  believes  in  GodOne  nun,  referred  to  as  Grace  in  the  memoir  --  her  name  was  changed  to  protect  her  privacy  --  was  the  only  person  Perez  trusted  other  than  her  aunt.  The  nun  said  something  to  her  that  became  a  turning  point  in  Perez's  life."I  don't  know  if  I  believe  in  God  but  I  believe  in  something,  and  she  was  a  definite  gift  from  that  something.  I  needed  someone  to  grab  my  hand,  look  me  dead  in  the  eye  and  say,  'This  is  what  you  have  to  do  to  survive  this  and  you  can  do  it.'  She  meant  everything  to  me  and  still  does.  I  still  think  about  her  till  this  very  day,"  Perez  said.</TEXT></DOC>

Buckle  up!</TITLE><TIME>Wed,  19  Feb  2014  16:20:41  EST</TIME><ABSTRACT>Isn't  it  about  time  you  fastened  your  seat  belt?</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Isn't  it  about  time  you  fastened  your  seat  belt?Recent  United  Airlines  and  Cathay  Pacific  flights  have  been  hit  by  unexpected  turbulence  that  resulted  in  crew  and  passenger  injuries.Although  flight  attendants  have  to  stand  up  to  do  much  of  their  jobs  during  flight,  we  passengers  have  no  such  excuse.Take  the  "fasten  seat  belt"  signs  seriously.  Buckle  up  when  you're  seated,  and  read  these  five  things  we  learned  about  turbulence.What  is  turbulence?"Clear  air  turbulence  is  air  movement  created  by  atmospheric  pressure,  jet  streams,  air  around  mountains,  cold  or  warm  weather  fronts  or  thunderstorms,"  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  says  on  its  website.Sometimes  it's  unexpected  and  can  happen  during  clear  skies.  Other  times,  pilots  are  alerted  to  reports  of  turbulence  ahead  by  the  FAA,  their  airline  meteorology  teams  and  pilots  flying  ahead  of  them.You're  not  likely  to  get  hurtDespite  the  recent  headlines,  the  actual  rate  of  injury  due  to  turbulence  is  quite  low.  U.S.  mainline  and  regional  carriers  flew  an  estimated  731  million  paying  passengers  on  domestic  flights  in  2011.  During  that  same  year,  there  were  33  turbulence-related  injuries  --  five  passengers  and  28  crew  --  in  U.S.  airspace.Turbulence  doesn't  scare  pilotsHe's  been  flying  commercial  aircraft  for  20  years,  and  AskthePilot.com's  Patrick  Smith  says  he  experiences  garden-variety  turbulence  every  time  he  flies.  But  it's  usually  pretty  slight.  He  can't  ever  recall  experiencing  truly  severe  turbulence  in  flight.  And  he  knows  that  aircraft  are  built  with  rough  air  in  mind."Pilots  usually  look  at  it  as  a  comfort  and  convenience  issue  rather  than  a  safety  issue,  annoying  but  not  dangerous,"  Smith  said.  "It's  rarely  ever  dangerous,  but  it  could  be  dangerous  to  your  well-being  if  you're  not  buckled  when  you  should  be.  People  who  are  injured  are  almost  always  flight  attendants  and  people  who  are  not  buckled  up."Don't  fight  the  bumpsDuring  episodes  of  turbulence,  your  pilots  might  be  looking  for  smoother  air  to  give  you  a  more  comfortable  flight.  But  in  the  moment,  they  aren't  fighting  the  turbulence  to  keep  their  aircraft  flying  smoothly,  Smith  said.Some  autopilot  systems  have  a  turbulence  mode,  which  stops  the  aircraft  from  trying  to  correct  the  bumpy  ride.  "You'll  see  the  wings  bend  and  move,  and  it's  perfectly  natural,"  he  said.It  feels  worse  than  it  isMoments  of  turbulence  can  feel  scary  and  quite  dramatic,  and  passengers  will  swear  their  plane  has  dropped  thousands  of  feet.  Smith  calls  it  the  "passenger  embellishment  factor."  And  it's  almost  always  not  true."Even  in  strong  turbulence,  often  the  aircraft  never  moves  more  than  20  to  50  feet  up  or  down,"  Smith  said.</TEXT></DOC>

But  the  film  was  missing  one  thing,  tweeted  Farrow."Missed  the  Woody  Allen  tribute,"  he  wrote,  "did  they  put  the  part  where  a  woman  publicly  confirmed  he  molested  her  at  age  7  before  or  after  Annie  Hall?"Ronan  Farrow  disses  Woody  Allen's  Golden  Globes  tribute(Allen  wasn't  at  the  Globes;  he's  known  for  avoiding  awards  shows,  for  many  years  skipping  the  Oscars  to  keep  a  regular  musical  gig  at  a  New  York  jazz  club.)The  tweet  once  again  exposes  one  of  the  darkest  episodes  of  Allen's  life  --  one  that  had  seemingly  vanished  from  the  headlines  in  recent  years,  as  the  filmmaker's  career  has  been  revitalized  by  a  series  of  well-reviewed,  award-winning  films,  including  "Match  Point"  and  "Midnight  in  Paris."In  1992,  in  the  wake  of  an  affair  between  Allen  and  Soon-Yi  Previn  --  Farrow's  adopted  daughter  with  composer  Andre  Previn  --  the  filmmaker  was  accused  by  Farrow  of  molesting  their  young  daughter  Dylan.  A  court  found  the  accusations  inconclusive,  but  the  scandal  permanently  damaged  Allen's  image  --  that  of  a  neurotic,  but  amusing  schlub  with  a  talent  for  slapstick  and  witty  one-liners.Legacy  of  a  scandalIndeed,  until  the  scandal  hit,  Allen  was  generally  received  warmly  by  the  general  public,  even  if  his  New  York-centric,  sometimes  thorny  comedies  appealed  only  to  a  fairly  narrow  audience.  (As  a  seemingly  autobiographical  line  in  1980's  "Stardust  Memories"  pointed  out,  the  public  tended  to  like  his  "earlier,  funnier  movies.")He  was  easily  caricatured  --  not  least  by  himself,  since  he  always  maintained  his  screen  persona  was  just  that,  a  persona  --  and  was  even  the  subject  of  a  comic  strip  for  several  years.Allen  responded  to  the  scandal  by  denying  the  Dylan  accusations  and  saying  that  his  relationship  with  Mia  Farrow,  which  had  been  painted  in  storybook  colors  by  the  press,  was  not  actually  all  that  strong.  As  usual,  he  immersed  himself  in  his  work,  maintaining  his  movie-per-year  schedule  and  generally  avoiding  the  limelight.  Some  of  his  mid-'90s  movies,  notably  "Deconstructing  Harry"  and  "Celebrity,"  were  unpleasantly  acidic  views  of  public  life.He  did  marry  Soon-Yi  Previn  in  1997,  and  after  the  marriage  came  a  slightly  more  public  Woody  Allen.  The  couple  was  the  focus  of  a  1997  Barbara  Kopple  documentary,  "Wild  Man  Blues,"  which  portrayed  a  generally  happy  pair.  Allen  was  also  the  subject  of  a  2011  Robert  Weide  film,  "Woody  Allen:  A  Documentary,"  which  briskly  addressed  Farrow's  allegations  from  Allen's  point  of  view.However,  the  scandal  has  always  been  near  the  surface,  and  this  is  the  second  time  in  recent  months  that  it's  made  a  forthright  appearance.  In  a  November  Vanity  Fair  article,  Allen  was  condemned  by  Mia  Farrow's  children,  especially  Dylan,  who  has  since  changed  her  name."I'm  scared  of  him,  his  image,"  Dylan  told  writer  Maureen  Orth.  Another  child,  Fletcher  Previn,  told  Orth  he  had  removed  Allen's  image  from  both  family  photos  and  videos.Ronan  Farrow's  pointAnd  Sunday's  tweet  isn't  the  first  time  Ronan  Farrow  has  aimed  a  poison  pixel  at  Allen."Happy  father's  day  --  or  as  they  call  it  in  my  family,  happy  brother-in-law's  day,"  he  tweeted  last  June,  referring  to  the  Soon-Yi  affair.But  publicist  Howard  Bragman,  vice-chair  of  Reputation.com,  doesn't  think  Allen  will  be  hurt."I  don't  think  we  can  expect  a  lot  of  traction  on  this  thing,"  he  said.  "If  this  was  a  guy  who  was  spending  a  lot  of  time  getting  press  for  himself,  it  might  bite  him  in  the  ass.  But  he's  not  investing  his  time  in  (publicity)  --  he's  a  filmmaker."Ronan  Farrow  also  comes  out  ahead.  He  recently  signed  a  deal  with  MSNBC  for  a  talk  show,  so  the  publicity  will  keep  his  name  in  the  headlines,  said  Bragman."He's  clearly  his  mother's  son  --  she's  made  her  point  of  view  known  on  this  --  and  he's  also  got  a  new  forum  in  terms  of  a  TV  show,  so  this  does  him  good  in  terms  of  attention,"  he  said.Allen  generally  doesn't  comment  to  the  press,  but  in  a  1992  "60  Minutes"  interview,  he  said  that  allegations  he  abused  Dylan  were  "insane."Woody  Allen's  lawyer  Elkan  Abramowitz  said  in  the  November  Vanity  Fair  article  that  Allen  still  denies  the  allegations.An  e-mail  to  Woody  Allen's  representative  requesting  comment  on  recent  events  wasn't  immediately  returned  on  Monday.A  forgiving  townHollywood  is  a  forgiving  town  --  even  for  a  defiantly  un-Hollywood  type  like  Woody  Allen.Roman  Polanski,  who  fled  to  Europe  in  1977  after  pleading  guilty  to  unlawful  sex  with  a  minor,  won  a  best  director  Oscar  for  2002's  "The  Pianist."  In  1951,  producer  Walter  Wanger  shot  and  wounded  his  wife's  agent,  believing  an  affair  was  going  on;  he  served  four  months  and  went  back  to  producing,  including  "Invasion  of  the  Body  Snatchers."Countless  other  stars  have  engaged  in  sordid  behavior  and  paid  no  price  worse  than  public  disapproval.  For  their  supporters,  it's  the  art,  not  the  artist."It's  a  complicated  question,  made  even  more  so  by  the  idiosyncratic  relationship  between  each  artist's  body  of  work  and  personality,"  wrote  Amanda  Marcotte  in  Slate.Allen  has  maintained  the  art  wins  out."All  the  success  over  it  or  the  rejection,  none  of  that  really  matters  because  in  the  end,  the  thing  will  survive  or  not  survive  on  its  merits,"  said  Keaton  in  her  speech,  quoting  Allen.Still,  for  Allen,  known  for  his  jokes  and  aphorisms  --  "I  don't  want  to  achieve  immortality  through  my  work.  I  want  to  achieve  it  through  not  dying,"  goes  one  of  the  best  known  --  it's  perhaps  ironic  that  one  particular  quotation  attached  to  the  scandal  may  end  up  the  squirmy  centerpiece  of  his  biography.Interviewed  by  Time  magazine  in  1992  about  the  Soon-Yi  affair,  he  leaned  (perhaps  unawares)  on  an  Emily  Dickinson  line.  "The  heart,"  he  said,  "wants  what  it  wants."But  even  more  striking,  given  the  filmmaker's  lack  of  concern  for  public  opinion,  is  the  original  line,  which  is  taken  from  an  1862  Dickinson  letter."The  heart  wants  what  it  wants,"  Dickinson  wrote.

Forty-five  of  those  are  linked  to  the  university  outbreak,  said  Jose  Rodriguez,  spokesman  for  the  health  department."The  university  cases  have  occurred  in  men  and  women  between  the  ages  of  18  and  48,  while  the  community  cases  have  occurred  in  residents  of  Columbus  and  Franklin  County  between  the  ages  of  4  and  50,"  the  department  said  in  a  statement.The  first  OSU  cases  were  reported  on  February  11,  Rodriguez  said  Monday.CNN  Health  Library:  Learn  more  about  mumpsThe  department  is  working  with  other  universities  to  make  sure  they  are  ready  to  vaccinate  members  of  the  university  community  and  promote  infection  control  measures.  The  most  important  of  those  are:  wash  your  hands,  cover  your  cough  and  stay  home  if  you're  sick,  he  said.Mumps  is  "a  highly  infectious  disease"  that  spreads  the  same  way  as  a  cold  or  flu  does  --  through  respiratory  droplets  when  someone  coughs  or  sneezes.Five  days  of  isolation  is  required,  "and  that  can  be  complicated  in  a  university  setting,"  he  said.Even  more  frightening  --  one-third  of  cases  have  no  symptoms,  he  said.  The  63  cases  are  those  who  became  ill;  others  may  be  spreading  the  disease  unknowingly.OSU  students  went  on  spring  break  "right  as  this  was  exploding,"  Rodriguez  said,  and  local  health  officials  contacted  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  in  Atlanta  to  warn  other  departments  to  be  on  the  lookout."The  numbers  doubled  when  the  kids  came  back,"  he  said.Cases  of  mumps  were  also  reported  at  Fordham  University  in  New  York  last  month.Some  97%  of  those  in  the  Ohio  outbreak  have  been  vaccinated,  he  said.  The  vaccine  is  80%  to  90%  effective,  meaning  10%  to  20%  of  people  who  have  been  vaccinated  might  become  ill  anyway.Mumps  typically  begins  with  a  fever,  headache,  muscle  aches,  fatigue  and  loss  of  appetite,  which  is  followed  by  the  swelling  of  salivary  glands,  according  to  the  CDC.There  is  no  specific  treatment  for  mumps,  and  patients  usually  recover  after  a  week  or  two,  but  occasionally  the  disease  can  cause  serious  complications  such  as  encephalitis,  meningitis,  deafness  or  inflammation  of  the  breasts  or  ovaries  in  girls  who  have  reached  puberty,  the  CDC  said.Children  should  receive  their  first  vaccine  for  measles,  mumps  and  rubella  at  12  to  15  months,  and  the  second  dose  at  4  to  6  years,  according  to  the  CDC.Columbus  Public  Health  is  urging  those  at  high  risk  --  including  those  who  have  not  been  vaccinated  or  those  who  only  received  one  dose  --  to  get  vaccinated.2013:  East  Coast  mumps  outbreak  linked  to  nightclub</TEXT></DOC>

Metals,  such  as  steel  and  aluminum,  contract  at  different  rates.  Lubricants  may  lose  their  viscosity,  creating  friction  and  wear  issues  for  moving  parts.  Meanwhile  plastic  and  rubber  parts  could  become  brittle.The  cold-weather  tests  in  Canada  came  only  days  after  the  MSN3  test  plane  completed  high-altitude  test  in  Bolivia.  Next  stop  is  Qatar  for  hot-weather  testing.How  airports  beat  bad  weatherFor  years  Iqaluit,  located  on  Baffin  Island,  has  marketed  itself  as  "a  premier  cold-weather  test  site."Airbus  have  tested  there  since  the  1990s,  while  the  airport  has  also  hosted  other  civilian  and  military  aircraft  makers  such  as  Boeing,  Dassault  and  Eurocopter  to  perform  similar  trials.But  cold  weather  test  sites  also  appear  in  unlikely  places.In  April  2010  Boeing  chose  McKinley  Climatic  Laboratory  in  Florida  as  the  location  for  extreme-weather  testing  on  its  787  Dreamliner.In  a  test  chamber  the  aircraft  was  given  a  "cold  soak"  and  exposed  to  temperatures  as  low  as  -45  degrees  Fahrenheit  (-42.7  degrees  Celsius)  for  hours.Later,  it  had  to  endure  temperatures  as  high  as  115  degrees  Fahrenheit  (46  degrees  Celsius),  also  for  hours.See:  Can  airships  open  up  Arctic  region?"These  tests  help  us  establish  that  our  customers  will  get  airplanes  that  work  for  them  in  all  of  the  climates  in  which  they  operate  around  the  globe  (and  in  all  seasons),"  said  Randy  Tinseth,  vice  president  of  marketing  at  Boeing  Commercial  Airplanes,  in  a  press  statement.But  extreme-weather  trials  are  also  affected  by  unpredictability  of  Mother  Nature.Initially  scheduled  for  five  days,  Airbus'  tests  in  Iqaluit  were  cut  short,  not  because  of  an  impending  winter  blizzard  but  because  of  a  balmy  temperature  of  -18  degrees  Celsius  --  too  warm  for  the  cold  weather  testing.See:  Testing  planes  to  withstand  wild  weather</TEXT></DOC>

But  only  reluctantly  was  he  a  civil  rights  leader.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Clayborne  Carson,  Ph.D.,  is  the  Director  of  the  Martin  Luther  King  Jr.,  Research  and  Education  Institute.  The  Stanford  University  professor  is  editor  of  Martin  Luther  King's  Papers,  and  author  of  several  books  about  King  and  civil  rights  activism.(CNN)  --  On  the  holiday  that  celebrates  the  Rev.  Martin  Luther  King  Jr.,  many  will  remember  his  sacrifices  for  the  civil  rights  movement,  and  serve  others  in  his  memory.Because  of  the  accolades  he  received  after  his  martyrdom,  King  is  often  viewed  as  a  charismatic  leader  who  was  responsible  for  the  success  of  the  campaign  for  civil  rights  reform.But  many  forget  his  international  outlook,  including  protest  of  the  war  in  Vietnam.  And  history  reveals  that  before  he  was  a  civil  rights  leader  he  was,  first,  a  preacher,  committed  to  social  and  economic  justice.He  was  only  reluctantly  a  civil  rights  leader.The  greatest  MLK  speeches  you  never  heardRosa  Parks  transformed  King  into  that  leader.  Chosen  to  lead  the  Montgomery  bus  boycott  movement,  he  quickly  gained  prominence  as  the  nation's  best-known  civil  rights  spokesperson  and  advocate  of  Gandhian  nonviolent  resistance  to  the  Southern  Jim  Crow  system.But  during  the  six  years  after  the  boycott's  successful  conclusion,  he  never  planned  and  carried  out  a  campaign  of  civil  disobedience.In  1963,  King  finally  had  an  opportunity  to  play  a  leading  role  in  sustained  protests  in  Birmingham.  But  even  in  this  campaign  to  pressure  local  leaders  on  the  city's  segregation,  he  came  perilously  close  to  failure.By  early  April  1963,  his  support  among  local  black  leaders  had  declined,  and  despite  initial  enthusiasm  of  the  first  mass  protests,  it  became  clear  that  he  would  not  be  able  to  recruit  many  more  protesters  willing  to  engage  in  civil  disobedience  through  clashes  with  the  forces  of  Police  Chief  Bull  Conner.As  Easter  neared,  King  realized  that  bail  funds  were  depleted,  and  few  adult  activists  were  prepared  to  spend  long  periods  in  jail.  Even  Ralph  Abernathy  and  some  of  his  other  colleagues  were  unwilling  to  risk  arrest  if  this  meant  being  unavailable  to  deliver  Easter  Sunday  sermons  in  their  churches.When  he  made  a  critical,  solitary  decision  --  his  "faith  act"  --  to  submit  to  arrest  on  Good  Friday,  King  was  not  certain  that  this  decision  would  result  in  a  successful  outcome  in  Birmingham.Many  of  his  advisers,  including  his  father,  had  tried  to  dissuade  him  from  going  to  jail."I  don't  know  what  will  happen  or  what  the  outcome  will  be,"  he  had  admitted  to  the  close  associates  who  gathered  in  Birmingham's  Gaston  Motel.  After  he  was  arrested  and  placed  in  solitary  confinement,  he  remembered  enduring  "the  longest,  most  frustrating  and  bewildering  hours  I  have  lived."King  regained  his  confidence  only  after  he  learned  from  his  lawyer,  Clarence  Jones,  that  entertainer  Harry  Belafonte  had  raised  $50,000  and  promised  to  raise  more  to  provide  bail  for  those  willing  to  go  to  jail.When  a  group  of  local  white  clergymen  denounced  the  Birmingham  protests  as  "unwise  and  untimely,"  King  responded  with  the  letter  from  his  jail  cell  that  would  become  the  most  influential  defense  of  civil  disobedience  since  Thoreau's  essay  on  the  subject  more  than  a  century  earlier.But  King's  letter  also  expressed  a  philosophical  commitment  to  nonviolent  direct  action  that  he  had  never  previously  translated  into  a  nonviolent  direction  action  campaign.King  was  not  able  to  revive  the  Birmingham  campaign  until  he  allowed  himself  to  be  bailed  out  of  jail  and  gave  in  to  the  urging  of  James  Bevel,  Dorothy  Cotton,  and  other  activists  that  he  allow  eager  teenagers  to  participate  in  marches  into  Birmingham's  downtown  area,  and  thereby  reinvigorate  the  flagging  protest  movement  in  Birmingham.When  Conner  responded  with  fire  hoses  and  police  dogs,  the  clashes  in  downtown  Birmingham  attracted  the  world's  attention.  In  Birmingham,  as  had  been  the  case  in  other  communities,  the  courageous  actions  of  young  people  demonstrated  the  effectiveness  of  King's  ideas  more  than  the  actions  of  King  himself.Due  to  the  timely  intervention  of  thousands  of  young  people,  King  was  able  to  secure  a  settlement  with  Birmingham's  white  business  leaders.He  could  then  claim  victory  rather  than  suffer  an  ignominious  defeat.King's  success  in  Birmingham  marked  a  major  turning  point  in  his  life.  If  he  had  failed,  it  is  unlikely  that  he  would  have  been  invited  to  deliver  the  concluding  speech  at  the  March  on  Washington  for  Jobs  and  Freedom.It  his  even  more  unlikely  that  he  would  he  have  been  given  more  time  than  the  other  speakers  that  day  to  share  his  dream  that  would  enter  the  nation's  collective  consciousness.King's  most  important  contribution  to  the  modern  African-American  freedom  struggle  was  as  an  eloquent  proponent  of  civil  disobedience,  and  as  a  visionary  who  understood  the  broader  global  and  historical  significance  of  the  African-American  civil  rights  movement.  His  oratory  inspired  participants  in  mass  movements  that  were  usually  initiated  and  sustained  by  others.The  Southern  freedom  struggle  certainly  would  have  eventually  achieved  major  civil  rights  reforms  even  after  a  setback  in  Birmingham,  but  it  is  very  doubtful  whether  we  would  be  talking  about  King  today  if  he  had  failed  in  Birmingham  in  1963.A  special  class  with  MLKThe  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Clayborne  Carson.</TEXT></DOC>

Connect  with  Cynthia  on  Facebook,  Twitter  and  Pinterest.(Health.com)  --  The  first  time  I  heard  the  word  "clean"  in  relation  to  food  was  way  back  in  the  mid-1990s.  I  attended  a  conference  about  supermarket  trends,  and  learned  that  grocery  chains  were  starting  to  "clean  up"  store  brand  ingredient  lists  by  removing  unrecognizable  terms.Back  then,  this  move  was  considered  controversial,  because  it  involved  doing  away  with  added  nutrients,  listed  by  their  technical,  non-household  names  (like  pantothenic  acid,  a  B  vitamin),  as  well  as  eliminating  preservatives,  which  meant  short  shelf  lives  (e.g.,  would  consumers  really  want  bread  that  gets  hard  or  moldy  within  a  few  days?).But,  the  writing  was  on  the  wall.  Consumers  were  starting  to  pay  attention  to  how  foods  were  made,  and  what  they  were  made  of,  health  food  stores  were  attracting  more  and  more  customers,  and  Wild  Oats  Markets  (a  chain  of  natural  food  stores  and  farmer's  markets,  later  acquired  by  Whole  Foods)  experienced  a  remarkable  4-year  growth  of  544%  between  1989  and  1993,  making  it  one  of  the  fastest  growing  small  companies  in  America.Health.com:  16  most  misleading  food  labelsToday,  two  decades  down  the  road,  clean  eating,  or  eating  clean,  is  a  major  movement,  spurred  by  people  from  all  walks  of  life  who  want  to  feel  good  about  what  they're  putting  in  their  bodies.When  I  asked  via  Twitter,  "What  does  clean  eating  mean  to  you?"  I  received  a  variety  of  replies,  from  simply  "eating  fresh  fruits  and  veggies,"  to  "not  eating  anything  artificial."Over  the  years,  I've  honed  my  personal  definition  of  what  it  means  to  eat  clean,  and  while  I'm  sure  it  will  continue  to  evolve,  here's  my  current  take  on  what  this  philosophy  (which  I'm  a  huge  fan  of)  is  all  about:Eat  whole  foodsThis  one  is  pretty  straightforward  --  instead  of  a  banana  nut  muffin,  eat  a  banana  and  some  nuts!  The  primary  principle  of  eating  clean  is  to  replace  processed  foods  with  fresh  and  natural  foods.  To  me,  this  means  foods  that  haven't  had  anything  added  to  them,  and  haven't  had  anything  valuable  taken  away.So,  even  if  you're  not  growing  quinoa  in  your  back  yard,  you  can  buy  this  whole  grain  in  the  bulk  section  of  your  market,  or  in  a  box,  where  the  only  ingredient  is  quinoa,  and  only  quinoa.  That's  a  far  cry  from  a  refined  grain,  that's  been  stripped  of  its  fiber-rich  bran  (outer  skin)  and  nutritious  germ  (the  inner  part  that  sprouts  into  a  new  plant),  bleached,  and  doctored  up  with  preservatives.Health.com:  9  foods  that  boost  metabolism  naturallyLet  ingredients  guide  youI  don't  think  it's  realistic  to  never  eat  anything  that  comes  out  of  a  jar,  box,  or  bag,  but  when  you  do,  the  very  first  thing  a  clean  eater  looks  at  is  the  ingredient  list.  Reading  it  is  the  only  way  to  really  know  what's  in  your  food,  and  choose  foods  that  are  as  close  to  their  natural  state  as  possible.For  example,  I  was  once  at  the  market  with  a  client  who  was  on  a  mission  to  clean  up  her  diet.  She  said,  "I  bet  crackers  are  out  of  the  question,  right?"  My  response  was,  "Let's  look  at  the  ingredients!"I  picked  up  one  of  my  favorite  brands,  which  are  made  with:  organic  short  grain  brown  rice,  organic  whole  quinoa,  organic  pumpkin  seeds,  organic  sunflower  seeds,  organic  brown  flax  seeds,  organic  brown  sesame  seeds,  organic  poppyseeds,  filtered  water,  sea  salt,  organic  sea  weed,  organic  black  pepper,  organic  herbs  --  all  "real"  and  recognizable  ingredients;  a  list  that  practically  reads  like  a  recipe  I  could  recreate  in  my  own  kitchen.We  then  checked  out  her  usual  brand,  made  with  (among  other  things):  sodium  acid  pyrophosphate,  monocalcium  phosphate,  and  TBHQ  (short  for  tertiary  butylhydroquinone).  Dumfounded,  she  said,  "I  saw  reduced  fat  on  the  box  and  assumed  it  was  OK,  I  never  even  thought  about  reading  the  ingredients."Bingo!  Clean  eating  is  about  focusing  on  quality  first,  and  not  letting  terms  like  zero  trans  fat,  low  sodium,  or  sugar  free  fool  you  into  thinking  that  a  processed  food  is  healthy.Health.com:  How  to  read  a  food  labelThink  big  pictureIn  addition  to  reading  ingredient  lists,  so  you  can  ditch  products  made  with  artificial  additives  including  flavors,  sweeteners,  colors,  and  preservatives,  clean  eating  is  about  steering  clear  of  foods  made  from  genetically  modified  organisms,  and  those  treated  with  hormones  and  antibiotics,  and  going  organic  when  possible,  to  reduce  foods  grown  with  man-made  pesticides  and  fertilizers.In  my  opinion,  clean  eating  considers  how  these  issues  affect  you,  as  well  as  how  they  influence  the  planet,  and  their  bearing  on  a  sustainable  food  supply.  In  other  words,  in  addition  to  choosing  not  to  pollute  your  body  with  substances  that  serve  no  biological  purpose,  clean  eating  is  also  about  connecting  the  dots  regarding  how  food  production  impacts  issues  like  the  rise  in  antibiotic-resistant  bacteria,  algae  blooms  and  "dead  zones"  in  our  oceans,  and  the  effects  of  substances  like  BPA  on  our  metabolisms.This  is  why  clean  eating  is  a  movement,  not  a  trend.Do-it-yourselfOne  aspect  of  clean  eating  I  really  love  is  replacing  packaged  foods  with  homemade  versions,  from  salad  dressing  to  energy  bars  and  everything  in  between.  I  call  it  "retrotarian"  eating,  because  it  harkens  back  to  a  time  before  things  like  frozen  chicken  nuggets  existed,  and  many  of  the  do-it-yourself  substitutes  are  very  simple.For  example,  when  I  make  a  stir  fry,  instead  of  buying  a  pre-made  sauce,  laden  with  sodium,  sugar  and  preservatives,  I  whisk  together  a  little  brown  rice  vinegar,  fresh  squeezed  citrus  juice,  minced  garlic,  and  fresh  grated  ginger.These  days,  you  can  find  a  clean  recipe  for  just  about  anything,  including  five-ingredient  ice  cream,  and  "old  school"  food  trends,  like  homemade  baby  food  and  pickling  veggies  in  Mason  jars,  are  making  major  comebacks.Health.com:  12  things  you  need  to  know  before  going  veganListen  to  your  bodyTo  me,  part  of  eating  clean  is  thinking  of  food  as  preventative  medicine.  After  all,  the  phrase  "you  are  what  you  eat"  is  literally  true,  so  being  thoughtful  about  your  food  just  makes  sense.Nutrients  create  the  foundation  for  the  structure  and  function  of  every  cell  in  your  body,  and  because  your  body  is  in  a  continuous  state  of  maintenance  and  repair,  the  health  and  functioning  of  your  cells  is  directly  determined  by  what  you've  been  eating.Whole,  natural  foods  provide  the  building  blocks  that  go  to  work  to  uphold  your  muscles,  bones,  organs,  immune  system,  and  hormones.  So  cleaning  up  your  diet  is  a  lot  like  starting  to  build  and  support  your  body  with  the  highest  quality  raw  materials.For  these  reasons,  I've  seen  a  commitment  to  clean  eating  truly  transform  my  clients'  lives,  from  clearer,  glowing  skin  and  shinier  hair  to  more  energy,  better  mood  and  sleep  quality,  clearer  thinking,  less  aches  and  pains,  and  even  a  greater  sex  drive.And  if  they  slip  back  into  old  patterns,  they  really  feel  the  effects.  After  going  on  a  trip,  relying  on  processed  "road  food"  for  a  long  weekend,  and  feeling  like  a  zombie,  one  client  couldn't  wait  to  get  back  to  eating  clean.  And  when  she  did,  her  bloating,  fatigue,  and  apathy  disappeared.  Pretty  powerful!  So  if  you're  just  getting  started,  begin  by  pulling  out  the  foods  in  your  fridge,  freezer,  and  cupboards,  reading  the  ingredients,  and  cleaning  house,  no  pun  intended.This  article  originally  appeared  on  Health.com.Copyright  Health  Magazine  2011</TEXT></DOC>

But  whatever  happiness  is,  we  know  that  we  want  it,  and  that  is  just  somehow  good.We  also  know  that  we  don't  always  have  control  over  our  happiness.

On  top  of  that,  between  unexpected  tragedies  and  daily  habitual  stress,  environmental  factors  can  bring  down  mood  and  dry  up  our  thirst  for  living.Being  able  to  manage  the  emotional  ups  and  downs  is  important  for  both  body  and  mind,  said  Laura  Kubzansky,  professor  of  social  and  behavioral  sciences  at  Harvard  School  of  Public  Health."For  physical  health,  it's  not  so  much  happiness  per  se,  but  this  ability  to  regulate  and  have  a  sense  of  purpose  and  meaning,"  Kubzansky  said.Why  be  happy?Many  scientific  studies,  including  some  by  Kubzansky,  have  found  a  connection  between  psychological  and  physical  well-being.A  2012  review  of  more  than  200  studies  found  a  connection  between  positive  psychological  attributes,  such  as  happiness,  optimism  and  life  satisfaction,  and  a  lowered  risk  of  cardiovascular  disease.  Kubzansky  and  other  Harvard  School  of  Public  Health  researchers  published  these  findings  in  the  journal  Psychological  Bulletin.It's  not  as  simple  as  "you  must  be  happy  to  prevent  heart  attacks,"  of  course.  If  you  have  a  good  sense  of  well-being,  it's  easier  to  maintain  good  habits:  Exercising,  eating  a  balanced  diet  and  getting  enough  sleep,  researchers  said.  People  who  have  an  optimistic  mindset  may  be  more  likely  to  engage  in  healthy  behaviors  because  they  perceive  them  as  helpful  in  achieving  their  goals,  Kubzansky  said.Lower  blood  pressure,  normal  body  weight  and  healthier  blood  fat  profiles  were  also  associated  with  a  better  sense  of  well-being  in  this  study.Your  happiness  type  mattersFor  now  these  studies  can  only  show  associations;  they  do  not  provide  hard  evidence  of  cause  and  effect.  But  some  researchers  speculate  that  positive  mental  states  do  have  a  direct  effect  on  the  body,  perhaps  by  reducing  damaging  physical  processes.  For  instance,  another  of  Kubzansky's  studies  found  that  optimism  is  associated  with  lower  levels  of  inflammation.If  what  you  mean  by  happiness  is  specifically  "enjoyment  of  life,"  there's  newer  evidence  to  support  that,  too.  A  recent  study  in  the  Canadian  Medical  Association  Journal  found  that  people  ages  60  and  older  who  said  they  enjoyed  life  less  were  more  likely  to  develop  disability  over  an  eight-year  period.  Mobility  was  also  related  to  enjoyment  of  life.  This  study  does  not  prove  that  physical  problems  are  caused  by  less  enjoyment  of  life,  but  suggests  a  relationship.Where  happiness  comes  from:  genes  +  environmentThere  is  substantial  evidence  that  genetics  play  a  big  role  in  happiness,  according  to  Nancy  Segal,  psychologist  at  California  State  University,  Fullerton,  and  author  of  "Born  Together  --  Reared  Apart."Research  has  shown  that  identical  twins  tend  to  have  a  similar  level  of  happiness,  more  so  than  fraternal  twins.  And  in  identical  twins,  one  twin's  happiness  is  a  better  predictor  of  the  other  twin's  current  or  future  happiness  than  educational  achievement  or  income,  Segal  said."If  you  have  happy  parents  and  happy  children,  I  think  that  people  usually  assume  it's  because  the  children  are  modeling  the  parents,"  she  said.  "But  that's  not  really  so.  You  need  to  make  the  point  that  parents  pass  on  both  genes  and  environments."What's  more,  there  seems  to  be  a  certain  level  of  happiness  that  individuals  have  generally,  to  which  they  usually  gravitate,  Segal  said.  That  level  depends  on  the  person,  and  the  situations  he  or  she  is  in.Even  if  genetics  has  a  big  influence,  though,  that  doesn't  mean  anyone  is  biologically  stuck  being  unhappy,  she  said.  It  might  take  more  work  if  your  baseline  mood  is  low,  but  certain  therapies  have  proven  useful  for  elevating  psychological  well-being.The  environment  is  still  quite  important  for  psychological  well-being,  too,  Kubzansky  said."To  say  to  someone,  'Don't  worry,  be  happy,'  is  kind  of  not  looking  at  the  whole  picture  of,  what  are  the  environmental  constraints  on  things  they  can  do?"  Kubzansky  said.Loneliness:  5  things  you  may  not  knowMoney  and  timeYou  might  be  thinking:  "Maybe  I  would  be  happier  if  I  had  more  money."  There's  that  old  cliché  "money  doesn't  buy  happiness"  --  but  is  it  true?  A  2010  study  in  Proceedings  of  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  found  that  emotional  well-being  rises  with  income  up  to  a  point,  which  seems  to  be  a  household  income  of  $75,000.  Day-to-day  happiness  did  not  increase  with  higher  incomes.But  when  participants  were  asked  about  overall  satisfaction  with  their  lives,  that  did  continue  to  rise  in  conjunction  with  income,  even  after  $75,000,  Princeton  University  researchers  Daniel  Kahneman  and  Angus  Deaton  found.  Their  results  show  a  sharp  distinction  between  how  people  see  themselves  in  terms  of  happiness  "today"  vs.  life  satisfaction."More  money  does  not  necessarily  buy  more  happiness,  but  less  money  is  associated  with  emotional  pain,"  Kahneman  and  Deaton  wrote.  "Perhaps  $75,000  is  a  threshold  beyond  which  further  increases  in  income  no  longer  improve  individuals'  ability  to  do  what  matters  most  to  their  emotional  well-being,  such  as  spending  time  with  people  they  like,  avoiding  pain  and  disease,  and  enjoying  leisure."More  on  money  (not)  buying  happinessWould  you  be  happier  if  you  bought  the  car  you  always  wanted?  Several  studies  suggest  experiences  make  us  happier  than  possessions.  That's  partly  because  once  you  have  purchased  something,  such  as  a  new  car,  you  get  used  to  seeing  it  every  day  and  the  initial  joy  fades,  experts  say.  But  you  can  continue  to  derive  happiness  from  memories  of  experiences  over  time.Experiences  form  "powerful  and  important  memories  that  I  wouldn't  trade  for  anything  in  the  world,"  Thomas  Gilovich,  professor  of  psychology  at  Cornell  University,  told  CNN  in  2009.But  if  you're  in  the  market  for  a  birthday  present  for  your  sweetheart,  a  material  object  can  still  be  meaningful,  becoming  a  keepsake  with  sentimental  value  that  increases  over  time,  Gilovich  said.Study:  Experiences  make  us  happier  than  possessionsOr  maybe  you'll  be  happier  once  you've  lived  longer.  Research  has  also  found  that  some  sense  of  happiness  may  come  with  age.Older  adults  may  be  able  to  better  regulate  their  emotions  than  younger  people,  expose  themselves  to  less  stress  and  experience  less  negative  emotion,  Susan  Turk  Charles,  a  psychologist  at  the  University  of  California,  Irvine,  told  CNN  in  2009.  More  science  needs  to  be  done  on  whether  the  diminished  negative  response  is  also  associated  with  a  feeling  of  happiness.More  happiness  may  come  with  age,  studies  sayHappiness:  Living  in  the  momentBut  what  about  right  now  --  what  can  we  do  to  make  ourselves  feel  more  positive?If  you're  seeking  to  increase  your  own  sense  of  happiness,  try  mindfulness  techniques.  Mindfulness  means  being  present  and  in  the  moment,  and  observing  in  a  nonjudgmental  way,  Susan  Albers,  psychologist  at  the  Cleveland  Clinic,  told  CNN  in  2010.Can  mindfulness  help  manage  pain  and  mental  illness?Mindfulness  comes  from  Buddhism  and  is  key  to  meditation  in  that  tradition.  Therapies  for  a  wide  variety  of  conditions,  including  eating  disorders,  depression  and  PTSD,  incorporate  mindfulness.  Focusing  on  the  here  and  now  is  a  counterbalance  to  findings  that  mind-wandering  is  associated  with  unhappiness.Activities  such  as  keeping  a  gratitude  diary  and  helping  other  people  are  also  associated  with  feelings  of  well-being,  Kubzansky  said.A  variety  of  smartphone  apps  are  also  available  that  claim  to  help  you  monitor  and  enhance  your  moods.  But  don't  feel  you  have  to  face  emotional  challenges  alone;  a  professional  therapist  can  help  you  get  to  where  you  want  to  be.If  a  sense  of  well-being  makes  a  healthier  person,  then  policy-makers  should  also  promote  large-scale  initiatives  to  encourage  that,  Kubzansky  said.  Creating  parks  to  encourage  exercise  and  insituting  flexible  work-family  initiatives  are  just  some  of  the  ways  that  communities  can  become  healthier  as  a  whole.So  remember:  A  glass  half  full  might  be  healthier  than  a  glass  half  empty.Follow  Elizabeth  Landau  on  Twitter  at  @lizlandauWhat  do  you  do  to  help  yourself  feel  happy?

But  Kelsey,  born  with  her  sisters  on  February  8,  was  a  complete  surprise.The  identical  quadruplets  were  born  via  cesarean  section  in  the  Winfred  L.  Wiser  Hospital  for  Women  and  Infants  at  the  University  of  Mississippi  Medical  Center  in  Jackson,  Mississippi."They  had  gotten  the  three  out  and  they  said,  'More  feet,'"  the  mother  told  CNN  affiliate  WAPT.  "I  said,  'No!'  It  was  an  instant  shock."The  odds  of  spontaneous  quadruplets  --  conceived  without  fertility  assistance  --  are  1  in  729,000,  according  to  Dr.  James  Bofill,  Kimberly  Fugate's  physician  and  a  professor  of  maternal  fetal  medicine  at  the  University  of  Mississippi.The  odds  in  this  case  were  even  slimmer  as  the  Fugate  girls  are  identical,  meaning  they  split  from  a  single  egg."Those  odds  are  incalculable,"  Bofill  said  in  a  hospital  press  release.The  last  known  set  of  identical  quadruplets  was  born  in  Germany  in  January  2012.  Experts  estimate  there  are  50  to  60  sets  worldwide.You  may  know  the  Mathias  quads  --  Grace,  Emily,  Mary  Claire  and  Anna  --  who  are  in  the  eighth  grade  and  appeared  on  the  Discovery  Health  Channel's  "Super  Quads."  And  perhaps  you  remember  a  Lifetime  reality  show  called  "Four  of  a  Kind,"  which  featured  identical  quadruplets  Megan,  Kendra,  Sarah  and  Calli  Durst,  of  Buffalo,  Minnesota.The  Fugates  were  originally  surprised  to  learn  they  were  pregnant  at  all,  according  to  WAPT.  Then  in  November,  the  42-year-old  mom  was  told  she  was  having  triplets.  The  fourth  baby  managed  to  keep  her  existence  a  secret  until  Fugate  went  into  labor  at  28  weeks.Kenleigh  Rosa  was  born  at  7:55,  weighing  2  pounds,  1  ounce.Kristen  Sue  was  born  at  7:57  weighing  2  pounds,  4  ounces.Kayleigh  Pearl  was  born  at  7:58  weighing  2  pounds,  8  ounces.And  Kelsey  Roxanne  was  born  a  minute  later  weighing  2  pounds,  6  ounces.Bofill  told  The  Clarion  Ledger  the  hidden  quad  was  a  first  in  his  27-year  career."I  was  very  embarrassed,  obviously,"  Bofill  said.  "The  news  was  sent  to  me  by  one  of  my  fellows.  I  thought  she  was  kidding."The  quadruplets  join  older  sister  Katelyn,  who  is  10  years  old.  It's  unclear  when  they'll  be  able  to  go  home."Typically,  when  babies  are  born  prematurely,  doctors  tell  the  families  to  expect  them  to  stay  in  the  (neonatal  intensive  care  unit)  until  their  original  due  date,  which  in  this  case  would  be  May  2,"  said  hospital  spokeswoman  Jennifer  Hospodor.  "It  is  possible  that  some  or  all  of  the  girls  would  be  stronger  enough  to  go  home  before  that,  or  have  to  stay  longer.  It  depends  on  how  they  develop  over  the  next  12  weeks."</TEXT></DOC>

Jones  is  a  professor  of  history,  law  and  Afro-American  and  African  studies  at  the  University  of  Michigan.  She  wrote  a  previous  piece  that  explored  her  journey  identifying  as  both  biracial  and  black.  Join  her  for  a  live  Google  Plus  Hangout  at  6  p.m.  ET  Monday  about  the  evolving  identity  of  African-Americans.(CNN)  --  When  the  census  listed  Negro  as  a  race  option  in  2010,  a  controversy  erupted.My  students  at  the  University  of  Michigan  were  eager  to  denounce  the  term's  use:  "Negro?  It  has  to  go!"To  their  ears,  "Negro"  was  derogatory,  too  close  in  tone  to  the  other,  more  infamous  n-word.  I  played  devil's  advocate,  to  test  their  thinking:  "But  some  black  elders  still  self-identify  as  Negroes."  "It's  preferable  to  its  predecessor,  colored.""Don't  some  of  you  belong  to  the  National  Council  of  Negro  Women  chapter?"I  could  not  shake  their  thought.I  was  confronting  a  generational  divide.  For  my  grandmother,  "Negro"  was  a  term  of  respect.  To  my  students,  it  was  an  epithet.'Negro'  on  form  draws  ire  of  prospective  juror  in  New  YorkIt's  no  surprise  that  we  feel  unsettled  when  a  new  language  of  identity  takes  over  the  old.  The  language  of  race  --  constructed  variously  in  science,  law,  politics  and  culture  --  has  always  been  a  moving  target,  and  we  aren't  the  first  generation  to  confront  it.My  CNN  essay  "Biracial  and  also  black"  generated  a  debate  about  the  words  we  use  to  describe  African-Americans.  I  called  myself  mixed-race,  a  phrase  that  includes  identities  rooted  in  multiple  races.Another  term,  biracial,  some  readers  pointed  out,  assumes  one  identity  borne  out  of  two.  It  is,  perhaps,  too  narrow  for  a  discussion  about  identity  in  the  21st  century.Some  readers  also  rejected  the  phrase  "African-American,"  deeming  it  awkward  and  inaccurate.  Renee  wrote:  "We  are  not  from  Africa,  I  was  born  here  in  the  U.S.  I  don't  know  anyone  there,  can't  even  say  my  ancestors  are  from  there."Those  who  defended  the  use  of  African-American  noted  it  was  rooted  in  history,  culture  and  personal  choice.  Others  offered  up  alternatives,  like  "person  of  color,"  "black,"  "halfrican-American"  and  "mutt."Some  just  preferred  using  a  simple  description:  "human."Words  seem  to  fail  us,  even  as  they  are  all  we  have.The  debate  from  my  essay  illustrates  how  difficult  it  can  be  when  we  rely  on  linguistic  conventions  to  express  the  complexity  of  human  identities.Even  so,  there  are  words  that  have  fallen  out  of  favor.  No  reader  seriously  proposed  that  I  use  a  term  like  mulatto  or  quadroon  instead  of  mixed-race.In  the  19th  and  early  20th  centuries,  these  terms  were  widely  used.  Many  of  my  paternal  forebears  were  marked  with  an  "M"  or  "Mu"  for  mulatto  in  census  records.Did  they  identify  with  this  label?  I  cannot  say  for  sure.  But  I  do  know  that  it  was  imposed  upon  them.Until  1960,  census  enumerators  chose  the  race.  Someone  had  sized  up  my  ancestors  and  decided  they  were  mixed.Among  black  Americans,  ideas  about  the  language  of  self-identification  have  changed  over  time.In  the  early  19th  century,  black  leaders  also  debated  what  names  to  give  their  religious  and  political  organizations.In  the  end  they  split.  Churches  adopted  the  term  "African,"  as  in  the  African  Methodist  Episcopal  Church.  Political  organizations  opted  for  "Colored,"  as  in  the  Colored  National  Convention  of  1848.  And  while  we  often  refer  to  it  as  the  NAACP,  the  nation's  oldest  civil  rights  organization  has  kept  the  word  "colored"  in  its  name  long  after  it  has  left  common  parlance.By  the  early  20th  century,  the  term  "Negro"  gained  traction.The  National  Negro  Business  League  was  founded  in  1900,  and  in  1914,  Marcus  Garvey  founded  the  United  Negro  Improvement  Association.In  1971,  the  Congressional  Black  Caucus  was  formed.  Its  name  suggested  how  the  civil  rights  and  black  power  movements  left  behind  terms  like  African,  colored  and  Negro.Sometimes,  shifts  in  language  happen  before  our  eyes.  I  can  recall  when  The  Journal  of  Negro  History  became  The  Journal  of  African  American  History.I  finally  told  my  students  a  story,  hoping  they  might  see  the  generational  dynamics  that  drive  the  language  of  race.One  afternoon,  my  paternal  grandmother,  Susie  Jones,  escorted  nursery  school  children  to  a  hospital  clinic  in  her  hometown  of  Greensboro,  North  Carolina.When  she  approached  the  registration  clerk  she  was  asked  her  name.  Her  response:  "My  name  is  Mrs.  Jones.""We  do  not  call  Negroes  by  titles,"  the  clerk  shot  back.  My  grandmother  explained  that  she  would  be  uncomfortable  were  the  clerk  to  use  her  first  name.  "I  will  call  you  what  you  wish.  I  can't  let  you  be  more  polite  than  I,"  the  clerk  conceded.My  grandmother  was  a  black  woman,  the  clerk  was  white,  and  it  was  the  early  1950s.The  clerk  used  the  term  "Negro,"  and  to  this  my  grandmother  did  not  object.  For  her,  Negro  was  the  preferred  term.  The  alternative  --  "colored"  --  was  demeaning.But  who  was  entitled  to  the  honorific  "Mrs."?Both  my  grandmother  and  the  clerk  knew  that  to  address  a  black  woman  by  her  first  name  was  part  of  a  racial  etiquette  reserved  for  white  women  with  the  status  that  "Mrs."  conveyed.My  students  could  see  how,  like  them,  my  grandmother  had  insisted  upon  her  own  self-definition  even  when  others  tried  to  apply  different  labels.The  lesson  they  took  away  was  how,  when  we  listen  to  others,  we  may  learn  how  they  prefer  to  be  addressed,  spoken  of  and  categorized.And  that  understanding  is  one  step  toward  human  dignity.How  do  you  self-identify?  Has  that  changed  over  your  life?  Share  your  experiences  in  the  comments,  on  Twitter  @CNNLiving  or  on  CNN  Living"s  Facebook  page.</TEXT></DOC>

"But  this  will  not  be  an  obstacle  to  the  building  of  a  democratic  country."But  he  announced  a  partial  mobilization  of  his  country's  armed  forces  and  said  Ukrainians  "have  to  unite  in  one  big  family,  which  is  ready  to  protect  its  home."  And  Prime  Minister  Arseniy  Yatsenyuk  told  CNN  that  there  was  "a  strong  possibility"  of  a  Russian  invasion  of  Ukraine."I  still  believe  that  there  is  only  one  solution  of  this  crisis,  a  peaceful  one,"  Yatsenyuk  said.  "But  we  offer  peace,  and  Russia  offers  war."The  Russian-backed  breakaway  government  in  Crimea  applied  to  join  with  Moscow  on  Monday  after  a  weekend  referendum  that  Ukraine,  the  United  States  and  the  European  Union  called  illegal.  U.S.  and  EU  officials  announced  sanctions  on  more  than  two  dozen  Russian  officials  and  their  allies  in  the  region,  which  Russian-backed  forces  seized  three  weeks  ago.In  Moscow,  Russian  President  Vladimir  Putin  signed  a  decree  that  recognizes  the  independence  and  sovereignty  of  the  Republic  of  Crimea,  says  a  statement  on  Russia's  Kremlin  website.  The  Russian  parliament  is  expected  to  vote  on  whether  to  annex  the  breakaway  territory  in  the  coming  days.Turchynov  said  Ukraine  was  willing  to  hold  talks  with  Russia,  "but  we  will  never  accept  the  annexing  of  our  territory."The  EU  sanctions  include  the  top  pro-Russian  Crimean  secessionist  leaders,  10  leading  Russian  lawmakers  who  have  endorsed  the  annexation  of  Crimea  and  three  top  Russian  military  commanders.  The  U.S.  sanctions  list  also  includes  two  top  advisers  to  Russian  President  Vladimir  Putin  and  ex-Ukrainian  President  Yanukovych,  whose  February  ouster  in  the  face  of  widespread  anti-government  protests  sparked  the  current  crisis.In  Washington,  President  Barack  Obama  warned  Moscow:  "Further  provocations  will  achieve  nothing  except  to  further  isolate  Russia  and  diminish  its  place  in  the  world.""The  international  community  will  continue  to  stand  together  to  oppose  any  violations  of  Ukrainian  sovereignty  and  territorial  integrity,  and  continued  Russia  military  intervention  in  Ukraine  will  only  deepen  Russia's  diplomatic  isolation  and  exact  a  greater  toll  on  the  Russia  economy,"  he  said.Russian  official:  Proud  to  be  sanctionedWashington  said  its  sanctions  targeted  Russian  officials  and  lawmakers,  as  well  as  Crimea-based  separatist  leaders,  with  financial  sanctions  for  undermining  "democratic  processes  and  institutions  in  Ukraine."  Obama's  order  freezes  any  assets  in  the  United  States  and  bans  travel  for  the  11  people  named.  Among  those  sanctioned  were  ousted  Ukrainian  President  Viktor  Yanukovych  and  aides  to  Putin.But  one  of  the  Putin  aides  named  in  the  U.S.  sanctions  called  it  "a  great  honor"  to  be  singled  out  for  American  punishment."I  consider  the  decision  of  the  Washington  Administration  as  a  recognition  of  my  service  to  Russia,"  Vladislav  Surkov  told  Russian  news  outlet  MK.Diplomatically,  Sunday's  referendum  has  put  the  United  States  and  Russia  on  the  kind  of  collision  course  not  seen  since  the  Cold  War.  Economically,  it's  unclear  how  much  such  a  coupling  will  cost  Russia.  And  politically,  it's  divided  Crimeans,  some  of  whom  think  it  will  bring  better  pay  and  some  who  see  this  as  a  Kremlin  land  grab.In  Brussels,  Belgium,  European  Union  international  policy  chief  Catherine  Ashton  announced  sanctions  against  21  people  "responsible  for  actions  which  undermine  or  threaten  the  territorial  integrity,  sovereignty  and  independence  of  Ukraine."  She  called  the  weekend  vote  "illegal"  and  "a  clear  breach  of  the  Ukrainian  Constitution,"  and  she  urged  Russia  not  to  follow  up  by  annexing  the  territory."We  want  to  underline  very  clearly  that  there  is  still  time  to  avoid  a  negative  spiral  and  to  reverse  current  developments,"  she  said.The  union's  28  foreign  ministers  agreed  on  sanctions  earlier  Monday,  Lithuanian  Foreign  Affairs  Minister  Linas  Linkevicius  wrote  in  a  message  on  Twitter.  More  measures  would  follow  in  a  few  days,  when  EU  leaders  meet  for  a  summit  in  Brussels,  he  said.Crimea  is  home  to  2  million  people,  most  of  them  ethnic  Russian.  Moscow  strongly  backed  Sunday's  referendum,  which  the  region's  leaders  declared  won  with  an  overwhelming  96.7%  vote  in  favor  of  leaving  Ukraine.Russian  lawmakers  have  said  they  will  welcome  Crimea  with  open  arms.  But  members  of  the  ethnic  Ukrainian  and  Muslim  Tatar  minorities  had  said  they  would  boycott  the  vote.Uncertainties  stemming  from  a  possible  break  from  Ukraine  have  fueled  rumors  about  a  looming  legal  vacuum  in  the  crisis-hit  region,  causing  panic  and  confusion.  And  in  the  meantime,  Yatsenyuk  said  Moscow  appeared  ready  to  attempt  a  similar  play  in  other  Russian-speaking  areas  of  Ukraine,  starting  with  demonstrations  by  what  he  called  "political  tourists"  with  foreign  passports."Look  the  last  rallies  that  happened  in  Donetsk  and  in  Kharkiv  and  in  Lugansk,"  he  said.  "They  gathered  from  500  people  up  to  4,000  people.  But  they  expected  to  have  50,000  people.  So  we  talked  to  the  people.  We  tried  to  address  this  issue  in  the  right  manner,  trying  to  convince  Ukrainians  that  the  biggest  asset  we  have  is  our  country."What  comes  next•  On  Monday,  Russia  proposed  creating  an  international  support  group  to  mediate  in  the  Ukraine  crisis.  Its  Foreign  Ministry  said  in  a  statement  that  this  group  would  urge  Ukraine  to  implement  portions  of  a  February  21  peace  deal  and  formulate  a  new  constitution  that  would  include  Russian  as  an  official  language  alongside  Ukrainian,  as  well  as  set  out  broad  powers  for  the  country's  regions.•  Putin  will  address  a  joint  session  of  Russia's  parliament  on  Crimea  on  Tuesday.•  Russian  lawmakers  say  they  will  discuss  the  future  of  Crimea  on  Friday.  "All  the  necessary  legislative  decisions  on  the  results  of  the  referendum  will  be  taken  as  soon  as  possible,"  said  Sergey  Neverov,  the  deputy  speaker  of  the  lower  house  of  parliament,  the  Duma.  "The  referendum  shows  that  the  people  of  Crimea  see  their  future  as  a  part  of  Russia."•  Crimean  lawmakers  have  approved  legislation  to  make  the  Russian  ruble  the  official  currency  in  Crimea  alongside  the  Ukrainian  hryvnia,  according  to  a  statement  posted  on  the  Crimean  Parliament's  website.  The  hryvnia  remains  an  official  currency  until  January  1,  2016.  The  statement  did  not  provide  a  date  for  when  the  ruble  would  be  circulated  in  the  region.•  The  lawmakers  also  adopted  a  resolution  stating  that  on  March  30,  Crimea  will  move  to  Moscow  Standard  Time.•  A  secession  would  mean  transferring  banks,  public  utilities  and  public  transport  from  Ukraine  to  Russia  in  what  would  undoubtedly  be  a  costly  operation.  Crimea  is  entirely  integrated  into  Ukraine's  mainland  economy  and  infrastructure:  Ninety  percent  of  its  water,  80%  of  its  electricity  and  roughly  65%  of  its  gas  comes  from  the  rest  of  country.  It  also  depends  heavily  on  the  Ukrainian  mainland  to  balance  its  books.  About  70%  of  Crimea's  $1.2  billion  budget  comes  directly  from  Kiev.•  A  special  tax  system  may  be  introduced  for  Crimea,  Russia's  state-run  ITAR-Tass  news  agency  reported  Monday,  citing  Russian  Finance  Minister  Sergei  Shatalov.A  bad  day  for  relationsMany  Crimeans  hope  the  union  with  Russia  will  bring  better  pay  and  make  them  citizens  of  a  country  capable  of  asserting  itself  on  the  world  stage.  Others  saw  the  referendum  as  a  land  grab  by  the  Kremlin  from  Ukraine,  whose  new  rulers  want  to  move  the  country  toward  the  European  Union  and  away  from  Moscow's  sway.Tension  is  also  running  high  in  parts  of  the  Russian-speaking  industrialized  east  of  Ukraine  near  the  border  with  Russia,  with  clashes  between  rival  demonstrators.Thousands  of  pro-Russian  demonstrators  rallied  beneath  a  towering  statue  of  Soviet  revolutionary  Vladimir  Lenin  in  Donetsk's  main  square,  with  chants  of  "Donetsk  is  a  Russian  city"  ringing  out  as  the  protesters  gathered  in  a  show  of  support  for  the  Crimean  referendum  and  to  demand  their  own.Christopher  Hill,  a  former  U.S.  ambassador  to  South  Korea,  Iraq  and  Poland,  described  Sunday  as  a  bad  day  for  East-West  relations."Putin  has  left  our  president  with  no  choice.  He  needs  to  impose  sanctions.  I  know  Putin  will  come  back  and  impose  his  own,"  he  said.  "I  think  the  end  of  this  is  going  to  be  to  cast  Russia  out  into  the  cold.  And  the  problem  is,  I  don't  think  Putin  really  cares.  I  think  this  is  where  he  wants  to  take  Russia."READ:  Opinion:  Obama  can't  have  it  both  waysREAD:  Opinion:  Can  West  make  Putin  blink?READ:  Opinion:  Europe  must  check  the  Putin  doctrineMAP:  Why  the  EU  and  U.S.  are  out  of  step  on  Russia  sanctionsREAD:  Crimea:  Echoes  of  history  on  road  to  YaltaCNN's  Kellie  Morgan  in  Donetsk,  Isa  Soares,  Susannah  Palk,  Stephanie  Halasz  and  Yon  Pomrenze  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Robert  F.  Kennedy,  has  been  acquitted  of  charges  that  she  was  driving  while  her  abilities  were  impaired.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>White  Plains,  New  York  (CNN)  --  Kerry  Kennedy,  daughter  of  the  late  Sen.  Robert  F.  Kennedy,  was  acquitted  in  New  York  on  Friday  of  charges  of  driving  under  the  influence  of  a  drug.A  jury  deliberated  for  an  hour  and  10  minutes  following  a  four-day  trial  that  featured  Kennedy's  turn  on  the  witness  stand.After  jurors  left  the  courtroom,  Kennedy  friends  and  family  members,  including  her  85-year-old  mother,  Ethel  Kennedy,  applauded.  Kennedy  hugged  lawyers,  William  Aronwald  and  Gerald  Lefcourt,  and,  in  an  unusual  move,  shook  the  hands  of  the  prosecutors.As  people  filed  out  of  courtroom,  Kennedy  told  reporters  she  was  not  angry  with  the  prosecutors  who  brought  the  case.The  54-year-old  former  wife  of  New  York  Gov.  Andrew  Cuomo  faced  a  charge  of  driving  while  impaired  after  swerving  off  the  road  in  her  Lexus  SUV  and  careening  into  a  tractor-trailer  on  a  New  York  interstate  in  morning  rush-hour  traffic  in  July  2012.Outside  court,  Kennedy  said  she  was  "unbelievably  grateful."Lefcourt  suggested  that  the  prosecution  pursued  the  case  because  of  her  name."You've  got  to  wonder  why  an  ill-advised  prosecution  like  this  was  brought,"  the  attorney  said.  "Is  it  because  of  who  the  defendant  is?  They  concede  that  it  was  an  accident  and  nevertheless  they  brought  this  case.  I  find  this  very  depressing."In  a  statement  Friday,  the  Westchester  County  District  Attorney's  office  said:  "We  prosecute  2,500  impaired  driving  cases  annually  in  Westchester  County.  This  case  was  treated  no  differently  from  any  of  the  others.  The  jury  heard  all  the  evidence  in  this  case  and  we  respect  their  verdict."Kennedy  testified  this  week  that  she  grabbed  the  wrong  prescription  bottle  from  her  kitchen  counter  that  morning  and  swallowed  10  milligrams  of  zolpidem,  a  sleep  aid  also  known  by  the  brand  name  Ambien.  Neither  she  nor  prosecutors  disputed  the  fact  that  she  drove  erratically  after  taking  the  medication  and  sideswiped  a  tractor-trailer  in  Westchester  County  before  she  was  found,  slumped  over  her  steering  wheel,  her  car  stalled."I  now  know  thanks  to  the  tox  lab  that  I  must  have  taken  the  sleeping  medication  by  mistake,"  said  Kennedy,  looking  at  the  jury  as  she  testified.Kennedy  said  she  made  cappuccino,  had  some  carrots,  prepared  bags  for  the  gym  and  office  and  had  no  problem  leaving  her  apartment  and  getting  to  her  vehicle  the  morning  of  the  accident.Her  memory  from  that  morning  ends  just  before  she  entered  the  highway,  Kennedy  said.  The  next  thing  she  recalls  is  a  knock  on  the  window  of  her  SUV,  and  a  man  she  thought  was  a  police  officer  asking  if  she  was  OK."I  was  confused  by  that  because  I  thought  I  was  fine,"  she  said  on  the  stand.During  a  contentious  cross  examination,  Kennedy  insisted  that  she  would  not  have  stayed  behind  the  wheel  if  she'd  felt  the  effects  of  the  medication."If  I'd  realized  I  was  impaired,  I  would  have  pulled  over,"  she  told  prosecutor  Doreen  Lloyd,  and  also  said  she  doesn't  know  what  the  side  effects  of  zolpidem  might  feel  like."You've  taken  this  pill  for  10  years  and  you  can't  tell  me  whether  or  not  it  makes  you  feel  tired  after  you  take  it?"  Lloyd  asked."I  guess  I  don't  really  think  about  how  I'm  feeling  when  I  take  it,"  Kennedy  replied.  "I  take  it,  and  then  I'm  asleep."In  closing  arguments,  the  prosecution  accused  Kennedy  of  lying  to  police  and  the  public  to  protect  her  legacy."She  had  a  lot  on  her  mind  that  morning.  And  she  took  the  wrong  pill  by  mistake,"  prosecutor  Doreen  Lloyd  told  jurors.  "However,  it  also  makes  no  sense  whatsoever  that  at  no  point  did  she  realize  or  feel  tired  or  dizzy  or  drowsy.  That  makes  no  sense,"  she  said.  "She  is  responsible  for  the  chain  of  events  that  happened  after  that."Lloyd  told  jurors  that  Kennedy  had  a  responsibility  to  pull  off  the  road  safely  when  she  felt  the  effect  of  the  drug.  Her  inconsistent  statements  about  the  incident,  including  the  claim  that  her  doctors  said  she'd  had  a  seizure,  were  meant  as  a  smokescreen,  Lloyd  said.  "She  knew.  She  knew  right  away  that  she  had  taken  the  wrong  pill.  She  felt  it.  And  I  submit  she  was  looking  for  an  excuse,  to  avoid  responsibility  ...  to  control  her  public  image."Lefcourt  told  jurors  there's  no  disputing  that  Kennedy  ingested  zolpidem  and  was  "out  of  it"  the  morning  of  the  crash."The  dispute  is  this:  Whether  the  prosecution  has  proved  to  you  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  Ms.  Kennedy  operated  her  vehicle  while  she  was  aware  that  she  had  ingested  zolpidem  and,  after  becoming  aware,  she  continued  intentionally  to  drive.  That's  what  this  case  is  all  about."The  jury  of  two  women  and  four  men  began  its  deliberations  Thursday  afternoon.  They  stopped  for  the  day  without  reaching  a  verdict  before  resuming  deliberations  Friday  morning.Kennedy  faced  up  to  a  year  in  jail  if  convicted.CNN's  Adrienne  Zulueta  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Follow  her  on  Twitter  or  Facebook.(CNN)  --  An  argument  between  two  mothers  at  my  children's  elementary  school  turned  ugly  recently  when  one  of  the  moms  was  told  to  "go  back  to  where  you  came  from.""What  are  you  talking  about?"  replied  the  horrified  woman,  who  was  born  in  the  United  States  and  had  an  Indian  heritage.  "I  am  just  as  American  as  you!"The  aggressor  doubled  down  with  an  even  more  racist  retort.I  heard  about  the  incident  shortly  after  it  happened  from  several  other  parents  who  had  witnessed  the  exchange,  all  of  them  deeply  troubled  by  the  woman's  prejudice."Did  you  say  anything?"  I  asked.No,  they  each  said.  None  of  them  had  felt  comfortable  intervening.This  is  not  particularly  surprising.  When  people  in  "the  majority"  use  their  social  privilege  to  denounce  bias,  it  can  have  a  powerful  impact  on  the  psychological  well-being  of  minorities.  Yet  research  shows  that  majority  group  members  rarely  confront  explicit  or  blatant  prejudice  in  person,  even  when  they  want  to.Those  perfectly  articulated  and  wickedly  poignant  verbal  smack-downs  of  prejudiced  offenders  may  happen  in  films  and  literature  but  occur  far  less  frequently  in  real  life.Social  psychologist  Aneeta  Rattan  cites  three  principal  reasons  for  this  reticence.Under  fraught  circumstances,  majority  group  members  who  are  not  usually  targeted  by  prejudice  may  not  even  be  sure  whether  something  biased  has  happened.  So  first,  they  have  to  make  that  determination,  says  Rattan.Second,  she  observes,  there  is  a  "standing"  issue.  That  is,  even  if  they  are  certain  that  someone  was  targeted  by  prejudice,  onlookers  have  to  determine  whether  they  have  the  right  to  speak  up.And  finally,  people  may  have  concerns  over  what  to  say.  They  may  fear  for  their  own  safety  or  have  a  general  aversion  to  discussing  group  memberships  and  a  belief  that  the  best  way  to  avoid  mistakes  is  to  assume  a  color-blind  stance.Rattan  believes  that  social  media  is  a  new  frontier  for  communicating  support  for  groups  being  targeted  by  prejudice.The  notion  of  taking  to  social  media  to  oppose  prejudice  may  be  head-scratchingly  counterintuitive  for  those  of  us  who  have  watched  waves  of  hateful  online  rants  leveled  at  something  as  innocuous  as  a  Cheerios  ad  featuring  an  adorable  tot  with  a  black  father  and  a  white  mother,  or  the  racist  and  sexist  vitriol  directed  at  the  Asian-American  chancellor  of  the  University  of  Illinois  who  failed  to  shut  down  the  school  for  a  snow  day.And  what  about  the  flap  over  Coca-Cola  featuring  multiple  American  cultures  and  languages  in  its  "America  the  Beautiful"  Super  Bowl  ad?  I'm  not  a  soda  fan,  but  #BoycottCoke?  #Getagrip.  #Seriously.Indeed,  admits  Rattan,  "people  talk  about  all  the  ways  that  the  Internet's  anonymity  can  lead  to  more  prejudice  being  expressed  online."  But  a  series  of  studies  Rattan  undertook  with  her  colleague,  the  late  Nalini  Ambady  of  Stanford  University,  showed  that  social  media  also  have  the  potential  to  serve  as  the  exact  opposite.Take,  for  instance,  the  "It  Gets  Better"  campaign,  a  powerful  grass-roots  online  campaign  focused  on  providing  support  to  young  people  targeted  by  prejudice  because  they  are  gay  or  suspected  of  being  gay.The  online  effort,  observes  Rattan,  "was  like  finding  a  diamond  in  the  rough.  It  doesn't  just  showcase  that  there  are  people  who  want  to  reach  out  and  express  support,  but  it  also  shows  that  there  is  a  context  in  which  people  are  more  open  to  reaching  out  in  ways  we  don't  see  in  interpersonal  relationships."Twitter  faces  pressure  to  limit  hate  speechAnalyzing  the  50  most-viewed  YouTube  video  messages  from  the  campaign,  which  collectively  had  been  viewed  more  than  15.5  million  times,  Rattan  and  Ambady  sought  to  understand  the  content,  complexity  and  impact  of  the  supportive  messages.Messages  from  these  videos  were  coded  to  indicate  whether  they  were  communicating  support  ("I  want  you  to  know  it  gets  better"),  social  connection  ("You  will  find  and  make  new  friends  who  will  understand  you")  or  social  change  ("The  attitudes  of  society  will  change").The  researchers  found  that  while  all  the  messages  communicated  support  and  most  communicated  a  social  connection,  fewer  than  a  quarter  of  the  messages  advocated  for  social  change.What  is  fundamentally  different  about  messages  of  social  change  is  what  they  may  say  about  the  person's  willingness  to  sacrifice  something  in  order  to  change  a  situation,  observes  Ruha  Benjamin,  professor  of  sociology  at  Boston  University."It  says  the  situation  needs  to  change  for  all  of  us.  It's  about  solidarity.  It  speaks  to  the  impact  of  inequality  on  all  of  us."Rattan  and  Ambady  also  sought  to  understand  how  the  online  support  messages  were  perceived  by  both  those  targeted  by  prejudice  and  majority  group  members.The  self-identified  LGBTQ  study  participants  reported  that  the  support  messages  with  the  most  impact  were  the  least  frequent:  those  that  conveyed  ideas  about  social  change,  that  things  can,  should  and  will  get  better.  Interestingly,  the  heterosexual  participants  did  not  observe  a  difference  between  social  connection  and  social  change  messages.Why?The  difference  in  perspective  occurs  between  those  who  are  targeted  by  prejudice  and  those  who  are  not,  observes  Rattan.But  prejudice  comes  at  a  high  cost  to  everyone.  Belonging  is  a  psychological  lever  with  broad  consequences  for  your  mental  and  physical  health.It  is  well-established  that  those  targeted  by  prejudice  have  higher  rates  of  chronic  stress,  anxiety,  depression,  substance  abuse  and  suicide.Excluding  people  can  serve  up  a  lifetime  of  negative  impact,  including  a  diminished  sense  of  well-being  and  self-control  --  even  lower  IQ  test  performance.  Research  by  Stanford  psychologist  Greg  Walton  shows  that  a  sense  of  not  belonging  renders  a  person  both  less  motivated  and  less  likely  to  persist  in  the  face  of  obstacles.And  lest  you  think  that  prejudice  adversely  impacts  only  minority  groups,  studies  have  shown  a  link  between  prejudice  and  depression.  Racially  prejudiced  people  can  experience  stress  during  even  the  most  routine  and  benign  social  interactions  with  people  of  color.  Chronic  stress,  in  turn,  is  toxic,  associated  with  a  higher  risk  for  a  host  of  ills,  including  a  diminished  immune  response,  heart  disease,  rheumatoid  arthritis  and  diabetes.But  can  the  simple  act  of  posting  a  support  message  online,  even  one  that  goes  the  extra  distance  to  advocate  social  change,  have  any  substantial  or  lasting  impact  on  the  tidal  wave  of  damage  --  health  and  otherwise  --  wrought  by  prejudice?Benjamin  is  not  so  sure."Virtual  solidarity  is  great,"  she  observes,  "but  if  you  find  yourself  rallying  more  on  Facebook  than  you  are  in  your  own  community,  then  you  need  to  think  about  that,  both  in  terms  of  effectiveness  and  in  terms  of  displacement."At  some  point,  she  says,  "You  must  have  some  skin  in  the  game."  Skin,  as  in  solidarity  and  sacrifice  --  the  promise  of  social  change.I  think  about  that  Indian-American  mom  from  school.  Had  I  been  there  when  the  fight  occurred,  would  I  have  put  some  skin  in  the  game?  And  how  could  an  online  message  of  support,  even  one  advocating  social  change,  have  made  any  difference  to  that  particular  woman?When  pressed  about  the  implications  of  her  research  for  other  minorities,  Rattan  is  qualified,  noting  the  need  for  further  research.  But  she  tells  me  about  a  Tumblr  that  popped  up  following  the  verdict  in  the  George  Zimmerman  trial,  called  "We  are  not  Trayvon  Martin."  In  it,  all  sorts  of  people  from  different  backgrounds  posted  short  messages  exposing  their  "privilege,"  about  how  and  why  in  their  lives  they  did  not  have  to  address  the  issues  that  led  to  young  Martin's  death.It  was  an  expression  with  far-reaching  implications  for  both  those  targeted  by  prejudice  and  those  willing  to  offer  up  their  privilege  to  express  solidarity  in  the  face  of  a  perceived  injustice."It  was,"  observes  Rattan,  "a  profound  example  of  intergroup  support."The  opinions  expressed  in  this  article  are  solely  those  of  Amanda  Enayati.</TEXT></DOC>

She  quickly  closes  the  door,  calls  911  for  assistance  and  activates  her  home  security  system,"  the  lawsuit  states.The  woman  told  police  Ferrell  was  "yelling  for  her  to  turn  her  alarm  off,"  but  never  reported  that  Ferrell  harmed  her,  made  threatening  statements,  brandished  a  weapon  or  stole  or  vandalized  her  property,  the  lawsuit  further  alleges.Police  were  dispatched,  and  Ferrell  walked  down  the  street  to  seek  assistance  elsewhere,  according  to  the  lawsuit.Kerrick  and  two  other  officers  arrived  on  the  scene  about  11  minutes  after  the  911  call,  but  Kerrick  didn't  speak  with  the  woman,  the  lawsuit  says.  He  instead  tracked  down  Ferrell,  who  "never  engages  in  any  conduct  which  can  be  objectively  reasonably  interpreted  as  aggravated  active  aggression,"  according  to  the  lawsuit."Defendant  Kerrick,  in  direct  violation  of  written  CMPD  regulations,  fires  12  high-velocity  bullets  at  Jonathan,  striking  him  10  times  in  the  chest  and  arms,"  the  lawsuit  continues.Kerrick  is  accused  in  the  lawsuit  of  failing  to  recognize  Ferrell  was  injured  and  unarmed,  failing  to  identify  himself  and  failing  to  adequately  assess  the  situation  before  firing  his  weapon.The  lawsuit  further  alleges  that  Kerrick  used  "stealth  and  surprise"  in  approaching  Ferrell  and  "negligently  failed  to  realize  that,  because  of  the  dim  lighting  in  the  area,  Jonathan  would  be  startled,  frightened  and  unable  to  see  his  approach  and  commands.""Afterwards,  as  he  lay  dying  on  the  ground  in  a  pool  of  his  own  blood,  on  information  and  belief,  Jonathan  struggled  to  breathe  and,  in  effect,  drowned  in  his  own  blood.  In  short,  upon  information  and  belief,  Jonathan  experienced  excruciating  and  horrible  physical  pain  and  mental  suffering  as  he  died  from  gunshot  wounds  inflicted  upon  him  by  Defendant  Kerrick,"  the  lawsuit  states.The  25-page  lawsuit,  which  devotes  about  two  pages  to  citing  allegations  of  misconduct  and  excessive  force  by  Charlotte  police  since  1997,  seeks  monetary  relief  of  more  than  $10,000,  though  the  exact  amount  isn't  specified.Back  in  October,  family  attorney  Chris  Chestnut  accused  Kerrick  of  "cold-blooded  murder,"  saying  the  incident  was  caught  on  a  dashboard  camera  of  a  police  cruiser  at  the  scene.  Ferrell  was  involved  in  a  serious  wreck  a  block  away  and  was  only  seeking  help,  according  to  Chestnut.Kerrick  has  been  charged  with  felony  voluntary  manslaughter,  meaning  he  is  accused  of  either  using  excessive  force  in  self-defense  or  shooting  Ferrell  without  the  intent  to  kill  him.  He  is  free  on  $50,000  bond."We  are  confident  that  at  the  resolution  of  this  case,  it  will  be  found  that  Officer  Kerrick's  actions  were  justified  on  the  night  in  question,"  his  attorney,  Michael  Greene,  said  in  September.The  Charlotte-Mecklenburg  Police  Department  has  called  the  shooting  unlawful."The  evidence  revealed  that  Mr.  Ferrell  did  advance  on  Officer  Kerrick  and  the  investigation  showed  that  the  subsequent  shooting  of  Mr.  Ferrell  was  excessive,"  police  said  in  a  statement  on  September  14,  the  day  of  the  shooting.  "Our  investigation  has  shown  that  Officer  Kerrick  did  not  have  a  lawful  right  to  discharge  his  weapon  during  this  encounter."The  statement  further  said,  "It  has  devastated  a  family  as  well  as  caused  a  great  deal  of  sadness  and  anxiety  in  our  organization."Police  used  the  words  "charged,"  "ran"  and  "advanced"  in  describing  Ferrell's  interaction  with  police.  But  Chestnut  said  the  young  man  merely  walked  "briskly"  toward  them  and  surmised  that  Ferrell  was  relieved  police  had  arrived  to  help  him  after  he  wrecked  his  car.An  officer  tried  to  subdue  Ferrell  with  a  stun  gun  but  was  "unsuccessful,"  police  have  said.  Kerrick  opened  fire  after  that.At  the  time  of  his  death,  the  former  gymnast,  FAMU  chemistry  major  and  safety  for  the  football  team  was  working  at  both  Dillard's  department  store  and  Best  Buy,  to  save  money  to  complete  his  education  as  an  automotive  engineer,  the  lawsuit  says.His  fiancee,  Cache  Heidel,  told  CNN  in  October  that  Ferrell  had  been  out  with  friends  the  night  he  was  shot.He  had  just  given  a  coworker  a  ride  home,  about  17  miles  east  of  central  Charlotte,  and  on  his  way  back  to  his  own  home,  Ferrell  drove  off  the  road,  down  an  embankment  and  into  a  group  of  trees,  the  lawsuit  says.Ferrell  couldn't  find  his  phone,  and  his  car  doors  were  jammed  shut,  so  Ferrell  kicked  out  the  back  window  of  the  car  and  walked  a  half  mile  to  a  home  where  he  knocked  on  the  door  for  help,  according  to  the  lawsuit.Family  members  have  said  Ferrell  was  a  happy,  outgoing  guy.  Heidel  described  him  as  someone  who  was  always  joking  and  finding  ways  to  make  people  smile.  His  demeanor  was  so  gentle  and  caring,  she  said,  that  she  nicknamed  him  "Sweets.""He's  always  a  joy  to  be  around.  He  cared  so  much  for  other  people,  more  so  than  himself,"  she  said  in  her  October  interview.She  said  she  hopes  Kerrick  is  convicted  and  that  her  fiance's  death  will  spur  dialogue  across  the  nation."That  is  a  hope  I  have,  that  his  death  will  resound  for  a  country  that  prides  itself  on  being  diverse  and  inclusive  and  accepting  everyone  for  who  they  are,"  she  said.</TEXT></DOC>

Some  Republicans  have  eagerly  identified  individuals  who  are  not  happy  with  the  ACA.Sanjay  Gupta:  Better  health  not  about  Obamacare,  it's  about  youAs  2014—a  midterm  election  year—dawns,  it  is  time  to  ask:  What  does  the  GOP  offer  other  than  negativism?  What  is  the  GOP  alternative  to  the  ACA,  who  would  it  help  and  who  would  it  hurt?Until  now,  the  Republican  war  cry  has  been  repeal,  for  which  they  have  voted  repeatedly.  But  ACA  repeal  is  neither  realistic,  responsible,  nor  perhaps,  even  possible.  The  10  titles  of  the  ACA  contain  hundreds  of  provisions  that  reform  Medicare  payment,  combat  fraud  and  abuse,  and  improve  health  care  quality.  Many  are  already  in  place.  Total  repeal  of  the  ACA  would  rip  many  threads  already  woven  into  the  fabric  of  our  health  care  system.Opinion:  When  will  we  get  the  verdict  on  Obamacare?A  targeted  repeal  of  the  less  popular  provisions  of  the  ACA,  the  individual  and  employer  mandates  and  some  ACA  taxes  and  fees,  might  be  more  feasible.  But  revoking  the  mandates  would  disrupt  insurance  markets  and  repealing  the  taxes  will  increase  the  deficit.Does  the  GOP  have  anything  constructive  to  offer?  The  answer,  sadly,  is  not  really.House  Republicans  have  put  forward  two  proposals  --  the  American  Health  Care  Reform  Act,  sponsored  by  a  majority  of  House  Republicans,  and  Rep.  Tom  Price's  Empowering  Patients  First  Act.  Both  are  lengthy  bills  that  largely  recycle  longstanding  Republican  panaceas.The  American  Health  Care  Reform  Act  would  replace  the  ACA's  income-based  tax  credits  with  flat  dollar  tax  deductions.  Tax  deductions  are  valuable  to  high-income  Americans  with  high  tax  rates,  but  offer  little  or  nothing  to  the  low-income  Americans  helped  by  the  ACA.The  Empowering  Patients  First  Act  offers  flat  dollar  tax  credits  that  do  not  vary  by  age,  geography,  or  health  status—all  of  which  could  influence  health  insurance  premiums.  These  tax  credits  might  almost  fully  cover  the  health  insurance  premium  of  a  young  healthy  male,  but  would  be  essentially  useless  to  an  older,  low-income  family,  which  would  be  left  thousands  of  dollars  short  of  the  cost  of  basic  coverage.The  American  Health  Care  Reform  Act  touts  health  savings  accounts  as  the  solution  to  every  problem,  but  tax-subsidized  health  savings  accounts  are  also  primarily  of  value  to  higher-income  Americans  and  useless  to  Americans  whose  income  is  too  low  to  be  taxed  and  who  lack  discretionary  income  to  invest  in  health  savings  accounts.As  the  media  spotlight  high  cost  sharing  under  ACA  plans  in  the  coming  months,  it  should  ask  how  much  higher  cost  sharing  would  be  under  the  GOP  plans.  Conservatives,  such  as  John  Goodman,  champion  very  high  deductible  policies,  and  Republican  proposals,  unlike  the  ACA,  do  not  limit  cost  sharing.By  repealing  the  ACA,  Republicans  would  reinstate  pre-existing  condition  exclusions  for  many  of  the  uninsured.  The  primary  relief  they  offer  to  the  uninsured  with  health  problems  are  state  high-risk  pools.  High-risk  pools,  however,  are  very  expensive,  and  without  massive  federal  support  would  be  unaffordable  to  many  Americans.Exclusion  of  Americans  from  insurance  coverage  would  also  likely  increase  under  Republican  proposals  to  permit  interstate  health  insurance  sales,  which  could  drive  a  race  to  the  bottom  in  state  insurance  regulation.  Association  health  plans  have  a  history  of  undermining  state  reforms  aimed  at  covering  individuals  and  groups  with  pre-existing  conditions.Opinion:  Why  I  signed  up  for  ObamacareOne  cannot  imagine  a  GOP  health  care  proposal  that  did  not  promise  to  place  more  barriers  in  the  way  of  Americans  injured  by  medical  negligence  who  seek  compensation.  Although  our  medical  litigation  system  could  certainly  use  reform,  proposals  for  change  would  reduce  health  care  costs  by  only  a  small  amount:  half  a  percent,  according  to  the  Congressional  Budget  Office,  including  defensive  medicine.  Republican  malpractice  "reform"  proposals  may  be  politically  popular,  but  do  not  address  our  health  care  system's  real  problems.The  GOP  does  not  promise  that  if  you  like  your  insurance  plan  you  can  keep  it,  and  with  good  reason.  The  vast  majority  of  privately  insured  Americans  are  covered  through  their  work.  The  American  Health  Care  Reform  Act  would  abolish  current  deductions  and  exclusions  for  employer-sponsored  health  insurance.  This  would  not  only  be  one  of  the  largest  middle  class  tax  increases  in  American  history,  but  could  result  in  millions  of  Americans  losing  employer-sponsored  insurance.Whatever  disruptions  the  ACA  may  cause  in  coming  months,  it  moves  us  toward  more  comprehensive  and  affordable  coverage  for  low-  and  middle-income  and  sicker  Americans.The  alternatives  proposed  by  House  Republicans  would  be  very  disruptive,  and  unsurprisingly,  benefit  the  healthy  and  wealthy.  Americans  must  ask  themselves:  Who  offers  the  most  needed  reforms  for  our  health  care  system?Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinionJoin  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinionThe  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Timothy  Jost.</TEXT></DOC>

French.Proclaiming  "London  dethrones  Paris,"  the  conservative  daily  Le  Figaro  had  compared  London's  projected  16  million  visitors  with  a  2012  figure  of  15.9  million  visitors  to  Paris.Things  have  only  got  nastier  since.Seizing  on  the  comparison,  Paris's  right  wing  mayoral  candidate,  Nathalie  Kosciusko-Morizet,  claimed  the  numbers  showed  Paris's  Socialist  administration  as  failing  the  city.That's  just  Paris  bashing,  one  of  those  Socialists,  Paris's  deputy  mayor  Anne  Hidalgo,  retorted.Other  figures,  her  office  said,  revealed  Paris  still  to  be  beating  the  sprawling,  unsophisticated  pretender  over  La  Manche  when  it  comes  to  pulling  in  tourists.Indeed,  London  is  in  some  ways  just  a  "suburb"  of  the  far  more  attractive  French  capital,  she  told  reporters.Paris  'still  No.  1'"Like  it  or  not,  while  London  may  have  attracted  more  visitors  around  the  Olympic  Games,  Paris  remains  the  number  one  world  tourist  destination,  even  if  we  only  include  foreign  visitors  and  not  national  ones,"  Hidalgo  said.London  was  "boastful"  about  its  strengths,  even  deceptive,  whereas  the  French  were  "rational"  in  their  self  assessments."London  aggressively  sells  itself  ...  in  a  way  that  goes  beyond  the  truth.  We  are  more  rational  in  our  communication  when  speaking  about  Paris's  strengths,"  Hidalgo  said.In  2012,  29  million  domestic  and  foreign  tourists  visited  the  wider  city  of  Paris,  Hidalgo's  office  said.MORE:  Bored  with  Europe?  Try  the  'new  Europe'By  contrast,  Greater  London  --  10  times  larger  --  pulled  in  only  27.6  million  tourists  of  all  nationalities.While  clearly  superior  intellectually  to  Londoners,  Parisians  could,  Hidalgo  conceded,  appear  "arrogant.""We  could  be  a  bit  more  amiable,"  she  said."I  often  tell  people  they  must  smile  more.  It  costs  nothing."MORE:  Paris  issues  tourist  'charm  manual'Gordon  Ramsay  weighs  inParisian  spluttering  be  damned,  London  and  Partners  has  used  its  figures  to  promote  a  new  video  campaign,  The  London  Story,  in  which  well  known  Londoners  reveal  what  they  most  love  about  the  city.Celebrity  chef  Gordon  Ramsay  says:  "You  can't  beat  a  good  London  curry.

The  subsequent  response  to  her  smart,  classy  takedown  has  been  just  as  positive  as  those  initial  dress-related  tweets  were  negative,  and  has  likely  introduced  a  slew  of  newbies  to  her  wit.(For  her  fans,  Sidibe's  response  is  pretty  typical  --  they're  used  to  her  hilarity  by  now.  "I  seriously  just  busted  my  a**  while  boarding  this  plane  but  no  one  saw  me!!!  I  feel  like  I've  been  given  a  second  chance  at  life,"  she  tweeted  on  January  4.  "My  underwear  hurts.....  Need  more  booze.  Send  help!"  she  joked  on  the  night  of  the  Globes.)This  isn't  the  first  time  that  Sidibe  has  had  to  weather  very  public  comments  about  her  body.After  she  was  nominated  for  an  Oscar  in  2010  with  Lee  Daniels'  "Precious,"  the  conversation  quickly  turned  to  whether  a  woman  of  her  ethnicity  and  shape  could  even  find  additional  work  in  Hollywood.Sidibe's  nonverbal  response?  Keeping  the  roles  rolling  in.</TEXT></DOC>

The  same  holds  true  for  60654,  where  NBA  star  Dwayne  Wade  has  owned  a  townhouse.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  If  you  live  in  60611,  the  swank  Chicago  neighborhood  of  Streeterville  where  Oprah  Winfrey  and  actor  Vince  Vaughn  have  owned  condos,  you'd  expect  your  neighborhood  to  be  safe.  The  same  holds  true  for  60654,  where  NBA  star  Dwayne  Wade  has  owned  a  townhouse.Together,  these  coveted  zip  codes  had  one  murder  in  2013,  and  it  didn't  even  involve  a  resident.  A  Wisconsin  couple  died  in  an  apparent  murder-suicide  at  a  downtown  hotel.But  a  few  miles  to  the  west  or  south,  it's  a  different  story.Neighborhoods  like  Austin  and  Englewood  --  poorer,  less  educated,  predominantly  African-American  and  infested  with  gangs  --  have  murder  rates  10  times  higher  than  other  Chicago  areas.Despite  recent  headlines  calling  Chicago  the  "murder  capital  of  the  U.S.,"  homicides  are  rare  in  most  of  the  city's  neighborhoods.  Instead,  it's  a  small  handful  of  areas  that  are  to  blame,  and  they've  struggled  for  decades.It's  what  one  sociologist  calls  the  "crime  gap"  --  and  like  the  income  gap  and  other  markers  of  disparity  in  urban  America,  he  worries  it's  only  getting  wider.Making  matters  worse,  homicides  in  these  neighborhoods  are  affecting  children's  test  scores,  some  studies  show  --  at  the  same  time  the  school  system  is  struggling  to  fund  enough  counselors,  social  workers  and  psychologists  who  could  help  students  cope  with  the  violence.Still,  police,  school  leaders  and  others  are  trying  new  approaches  that  seem  to  be  making  inroads  --  including  one  pilot  program  that  has  officers  visiting  paroled  gang  members  at  their  homes."The  whole  'murder  city'  or  the  characterization  that  Chicago  is  such  a  dangerous  city  is  just  not  accurate,"  said  Yale  sociologist  Andrew  Papachristos.  He  grew  up  in  Chicago,  and  he's  been  fighting  this  false  impression  for  years.  When  he  travels  overseas,  people  ask  him  where  he  grew  up.  When  he  tells  them,  they  very  often  say  "Al  Capone"  and  imitate  the  violent  mobster  shooting  a  Tommy  gun."Thank  God  for  Michael  Jordan,"  Papachristos  said.  "At  least  now  people  know  someone  else  from  my  city."The  "murder  capital"  headline  came  last  fall  after  the  FBI  released  its  2012  crime  statistics  and  Chicago  had  more  homicides  than  any  other  U.S.  city  with  503  --  even  more  than  New  York,  which  has  three  times  the  population.But  taking  population  into  account,  Chicago  had  a  murder  rate  of  18.7  for  every  100,000  people,  lower  than  Detroit,  New  Orleans,  St.  Louis,  Baltimore,  Newark,  Oakland,  Cleveland  --  even  Flint,  Michigan,  and  Birmingham,  Alabama.'No  flash  in  the  pan'And  2012  was  an  especially  bloody  year  for  Chicago.  The  previous  year  saw  435  murders,  and  2013  saw  415.  President  Obama  called  attention  to  the  city's  violence  in  his  2013  State  of  the  Union  address,  when  he  paid  tribute  to  Hadiya  Pendleton  --  a  Chicago  honor  student  gunned  down  only  days  after  performing  at  his  second  inauguration  in  Washington.Chicago's  violent  reputation  is  "way  overblown,"  said  the  city's  police  superintendent,  Garry  McCarthy.Last  year,  the  number  of  homicides  in  Chicago  fell  18%  to  a  level  not  seen  since  1965.  McCarthy,  who  was  brought  in  by  Chicago  Mayor  Rahm  Emanuel,  credits  in  part  a  new  policing  strategy  that  puts  more  officers  on  regular  beats."For  six  consecutive  quarters  now  we've  seen  a  murder  rate  reduction,"  McCarthy  told  CNN.  "We  still  have  a  long  way  to  go,  sure,  but  six  consecutive  quarters  show  this  is  no  flash  in  the  pan."Violent  crime  has  been  down  across  the  country,  in  some  cases  reaching  its  lowest  point  in  decades  --  a  phenomenon  so  remarkable  some  sociologists  call  it  "the  Great  American  Crime  Decline."Violence  has  declined  in  Chicago  too,  "impressively  so,"  said  Papachristos.  But  according  to  his  analysis  of  48  years  of  crime  data,  the  violence  has  "stubbornly"  hung  around  certain  neighborhoods  for  decades,  where  crime  rates  are  "unexpectedly  high.""I  think  of  it  as  'the  crime  gap,'  "  said  Papachristos,  who  worries  such  inequalities  are  getting  bigger  in  the  U.S.  When  it  comes  to  violent  crime  in  Chicago,  he  said,  there  "seems  to  be  a  kind  of  durable  inequality.""Crime  remains  persistent  in  particular  communities,  especially  in  socially  and  economically  disadvantaged  parts  or  the  city,"  Papachristos  said.  And  the  consequences  of  this  constant  violence  lingers.The  highest  rates  of  homicides  and  violence  are  concentrated  in  the  city's  South  and  West  sides.  Englewood,  Austin,  North  Lawndale,  Woodlawn,  Pilsen/Little  Village,  and  West  and  East  Garfield  Park  are  among  the  troubled  areas.Just  how  different  are  the  rates  of  homicide  and  violence?  Papachristos'  analysis  found  the  homicide  rate  between  2000-10  was  3.1  per  100,000  residents  in  Chicago's  Northwest  side  and  5  per  100,000  in  Irving  Park.  But  for  residents  of  Englewood,  it  was  58  per  100,000,  and  64  per  100,000  in  West  Garfield  Park.And  that  disparity  has  been  around  since  1965,  the  first  year  police  records  were  reliably  collected,  Papachristos  said.A  large  part  of  the  problem  stems  from  Chicago's  gang  warfare.  Superintendent  McCarthy  said  his  city  has  "one  of  the  worst  gang  violence  problems  in  the  country."  Papachristos'  analysis  of  homicides  noted  that  most  involve  gang  members.Unlike  in  Capone's  day,  gangs  don't  all  work  under  a  top-down  model  where  a  single  leader  has  control  over  who's  killed.  Gangs  now  operate  more  like  a  franchise,  Papachristos  said.  The  model  changed  after  the  feds  arrested  a  number  of  gang  kingpins  in  the  1990s.  As  a  result,  there  is  more  inner  gang  fighting  in  addition  to  fights  between  rival  gangs.The  nature  of  the  continuing  violence  meant  police  had  to  figure  out  a  new  strategy.  When  McCarthy  took  over  the  department  in  2011,  he  felt  it  lacked  a  "comprehensive  gang  violence  reduction  strategy."McCarthy  said  he  restructured  the  department  to  rely  on  "performance-based  policing  rather  than  on  politics."  He  felt  with  "the  right  resources  in  the  right  hands"  and  by  holding  officers  accountable  for  crime  on  the  patch  they  patrol,  things  would  change  --  and  they  have."The  mayor  gave  me  an  obvious  charge,"  McCarthy  said.  "But  there  is  no  secret  to  this  and  there  is  no  one  silver  bullet  to  fix  it.  It's  a  lot  of  hard  work."Now,  instead  of  big  bureaucratic  citywide  task  forces  tackling  gang  problems,  he  in  part  put  more  officers  on  beats  --  "it's  the  same  officers  in  the  same  cars  in  the  same  neighborhoods"  --  so  police  can  develop  a  real  relationship  with  the  people  they  are  trying  to  protect.  A  recent  Chicago  Tribune  analysis  of  city  data  found  that  despite  the  renewed  hiring  push  for  beat  cops,  the  department  has  had  a  hard  time  keeping  up  with  retirements.The  new  policing  though  is  also  about  a  philosophy  change."Our  enforcement  now  is  not  just  locking  everyone  up,"  McCarthy  said,  "it  is  about  getting  the  right  intelligence  from  a  beat  officer  and  figuring  out  how  we  prevent  the  next  shooting."Police  are  also  encouraging  community  members  to  speak  out  and  are  working  with  schools  to  monitor  feuds  and  stop  fights  before  they  get  out  of  control.  The  police  even  work  directly  with  key  gang  leaders.One  gang  member  at  a  timeOne  new  initiative  makes  a  heart-to-heart  with  police  a  mandatory  part  of  parole  for  gang  members.  An  officer  will  go  to  the  gang  member's  home  and  talk  to  him,  preferably  with  family  watching.  The  officer  starts  with  a  warning,  McCarthy  said:  "If  you  continue  doing  what  you  are  doing,  we  will  not  just  take  you  out,  we  will  take  out  your  entire  group."The  officer  will  remind  the  gang  member  about  the  enhanced  penalties  for  crimes  committed  by  people  with  gang  affiliations.  In  one  case,  McCarthy  said,  his  district  commander  had  this  chat  with  a  gang  member  while  the  parolee  held  his  18-month-old  son  on  his  lap.  As  the  gang  member  looked  at  his  son,  it  seemed  to  the  commander  that  his  message  was  getting  through.Next,  a  community  member  calls  on  the  gang  member.  Often  the  civilian  will  be  the  parent  of  a  murdered  child  who  lives  in  the  gang  member's  neighborhood.  They  talk  about  the  consequences  of  violence.Police  then  offer  social  services  like  job  contacts,  health  programs,  housing  and  drug  treatment."We  make  it  completely  personal  to  that  one  individual,  and  by  bringing  it  to  their  residence,  the  goal  is  to  get  the  people  who  are  in  their  lives  and  can  influence  their  actions  to  encourage  them  to  change,"  McCarthy  said.  "We  get  our  hooks  into  them  early  and  remind  them,  'If  you  continue  doing  what  you  are  doing,  you  will  end  up  dead.'  "This  started  as  a  pilot  program  about  six  months  ago  in  the  Austin  neighborhood.  So  far,  police  have  conducted  about  60  interventions.  Some  gang  members  slam  the  door  on  the  officers,  but  others  listen.  About  17  so  far  have  accepted  social  services.  The  results  are  still  preliminary,  but  as  far  as  police  know,  no  gang  member  contacted  through  the  program  has  been  involved  in  a  felony  since.  And  overall,  violent  crime  is  down  in  traditionally  troubled  neighborhoods.  Youth  violence  in  2013  was  down  some  40%.The  program  is  not  without  its  critics,  some  of  whom  refer  to  the  program  as  "hug-a-thug."  But  McCarthy  said  the  program  has  been  successful  enough  that  police  are  even  wading  into  ongoing  gang  conflicts.  After  a  14-year-old  was  killed  in  an  apparent  gang-related  shooting,  officers  went  to  the  homes  of  gang  leaders  in  the  Woodlawn  neighborhood  and  warned  them  against  continuing  the  fight.  In  each  meeting,  an  officer  was  joined  by  a  community  resources  person  who  offered  social  services.The  cash-strapped  school  district  is  also  getting  involved.  The  nation's  third-largest  school  district  had  a  bad  reputation  for  its  high  expulsion  rate,  which  disproportionately  involved  students  in  the  communities  represented  in  the  toughest  neighborhoods.  A  federal  civil  rights  report  showed  that  for  the  2009-10  school  year,  African-Americans  made  up  45%  of  district  enrollment,  but  accounted  for  76%  of  all  students  suspended.  The  U.S.  Department  of  Education  encouraged  an  alternative  to  zero  tolerance.Since  2012  district  leaders  have  pushed  to  abandon  zero-tolerance  programs,  which  had  resulted  in  the  high  rate  of  suspensions.  The  2013-14  school  year  saw  a  36%  drop  in  suspensions  districtwide.  The  district  now  has  a  different  code  of  conduct  that  uses  a  three-part  approach  to  try  to  keep  kids  in  school.  It  involves  prevention,  intervention  and  removing  the  student  from  the  problem."We  start  by  making  sure  there  is  a  positive  climate  and  a  culture  of  trust  at  the  school  with  everyone  from  the  principals  to  the  janitors  to  the  teachers  and  security  guards,"  said  Aarti  Dhupelia,  the  Chicago  Public  Schools  chief  officer  of  college  and  career  success.The  district  instituted  peer  juries,  peer  mediation,  talking  circles  and  other  restorative  justice  programs  in  neighborhoods  with  higher  violent  crime  rates.  The  idea  behind  restorative  justice  is  that  when  people  violate  a  rule,  they  violate  the  relationship  they  have  with  other  people  in  their  community.  Under  this  model,  justice  is  then  best  served  when  the  two  sides  of  a  conflict  come  together  and  talk  about  what  has  happened,  assess  who  has  been  hurt,  and  figure  out  how  the  relationship  can  be  repaired."Keeping  kids  connected  to  schools  in  their  community  lowers  the  risk  they  may  present  to  the  community,"  said  Dhupelia.Working  with  local  nonprofits,  schools  in  these  tougher  neighborhoods  also  have  started  programs  to  teach  social  and  emotional  skills  such  as  collaboration,  self-control  and  self-management.There  are,  however,  limitations.  The  district  has  an  extremely  tight  budget.  Its  staff  of  counselors,  social  workers  and  psychologists  is  short  thousands  of  people,  according  to  an  analysis  by  the  Chicago  Teachers  Union.  For  instance,  at  the  end  of  the  2011  school  year,  the  district  had  just  370  social  workers.  Using  the  ratio  of  one  social  worker  with  a  master's  degree  for  every  400  students  --  the  guidelines  recommended  by  the  School  Social  Work  Association  of  America  --  the  district  would  need  a  thousand  more  social  workers  to  help  these  schools,  plus  an  additional  250  for  schools  on  probation,  according  to  the  CTU.The  district's  counselors  have  a  case  load  that  is  five  times  recommended  standards,  and  the  district  would  need  to  double  the  number  of  psychologists  it  has,  the  CTU  analysis  found.Asked  if  the  school  district  felt  more  counselors,  social  workers  and  psychologists  were  needed,  Chicago  Public  Schools  spokeman  Joel  Hood  noted  that  the  district  had  implemented  a  "student-based  budgeting  model"  this  school  year  that  gives  principals  more  discretion  to  hire  counselors  if  needed."Principals  have  unprecedented  control  over  how  to  spend  education  dollars,  allowing  them  to  create  their  own  budgets  and  staffing  plans  in  a  way  they  believe  will  best  meet  the  academic  and  social-emotional  needs  of  their  students,"  Hood  said.He  said  the  district  "believes  the  social-emotional  development  of  students  is  directly  linked  to  their  academic  achievement.  Creating  a  positive  learning  climate  for  students  is  the  work  of  the  whole  school,  and  the  district  invests  in  professional  development  to  help  school  leaders,  teachers  and  staff  give  students  the  support  system  they  need  to  succeed  in  the  classroom  and  in  life."The  1,500-foot  effectThe  impact  of  violence  in  the  schools  may  be  especially  hard  on  young  children  who  live  within  1,500  feet  of  a  homicide,  one  study  has  found.Papachristos  and  NYU  sociologist  Patrick  Sharkey  tested  kids  in  Head  Start  programs  in  Chicago's  tough  neighborhoods  and  found  that  verbal  and  impulse  control  scores  were  lower  for  children  if  a  homicide  had  occurred  within  a  1,500-foot  radius  during  the  past  week.Tests  of  older  students  showed  similar  results.Sharkey  thought  the  results  for  the  younger  kids  were  particularly  telling  since  they  "are  not  directly  involved  in  the  feuds  and  the  battles  that  take  place  in  Chicago  neighborhoods,  and  yet  they  were  affected,"  Sharkey  said.  "This  evidence  suggests  violence  is  felt  by  the  child's  parents,  and  the  child  can  sense  the  changes  in  the  behavior  of  their  parents  and  their  siblings."The  children  also  may  be  reacting  to  their  surroundings:  The  heavy  police  presence,  the  constant  sirens  at  night  and  the  regular  sound  of  gunshots  create  a  high-stress  environment."We  don't  quite  know  what  is  driving  this  effect,"  said  Sharkey,  "but  this  means  for  children  in  these  violent  neighborhoods  where  they  sometimes  have  one  homicide  a  month  at  least,  kids  are  starting  school  with  a  heavy  burden  and  an  inability  to  focus  in  school,  and  that  has  the  potential  to  have  long-term  consequences."The  estimate  of  children  in  Chicago  with  PTSD  is  "absurd,  it  is  remarkably  high,"  he  said.  "We  need  policies  and  programs  that  reduce  the  consequences  for  the  kids  who  have  done  nothing  wrong  ...  and  reduce  the  burden  that  they  feel."Chicago's  social  services  also  have  gotten  involved  in  efforts  aimed  at  reducing  violence,  said  Evelyn  Diaz,  the  commissioner  of  family  and  support  services.Her  department  offers  three  major  programs.  B.A.M.,  which  stands  for  Becoming  a  Man,  is  a  dropout  and  violence  prevention  program  for  at-risk  male  students  in  grades  7-12.  It  offers  programs  on  impulse  control  and  emotional  self-regulation  during  and  after  school  aimed  at  reducing  violent  and  anti-social  behavior.  A  University  of  Chicago  study  found  the  program  reduced  violent  crime  arrests  for  participants  by  44%  and  reduced  weapons  crime  and  vandalism  by  36%  compared  to  other  at-risk  young  men.MATCH  Education  is  a  tutoring  program  that  helps  these  same  kids  with  math.  Results  of  a  pilot  program  at  one  school  found  that  misconduct,  course  failures  and  absenteeism  went  down  significantly.Diaz's  office  also  oversees  a  summer  jobs  program  in  which  students  have  access  to  adult  mentors  24/7.  A  study  found  that  young  people  who  participated  in  that  program  were  half  as  likely  to  be  arrested  for  violent  crime.  This  summer  it  will  employ  around  20,000  kids,  most  from  neighborhoods  with  high  crime  and  high  unemployment.The  city  has  tripled  its  funding  for  these  three  programs  since  they  started  last  year,  she  said.  The  business  community  has  also  donated  millions  more  toward  these  efforts.  Diaz  said  she  believes  the  city's  holistic  approach  to  ending  violence  will  work."We  are  going  for  impressive  gains  with  these  programs  because  there  are  very  high  stakes  involved;  it's  kids'  lives  we  are  talking  about,"  Diaz  said.  "We  all  feel  that  in  a  personal  way,  and  we  will  stop  at  nothing  to  change  that."</TEXT></DOC>

Her  term  ends  in  January.Feisty  on  immigrationA  feisty  Republican  who  rose  up  through  local  politics  to  the  state's  highest  office,  Brewer  generated  national  headlines  in  recent  years  for  her  public  opposition  to  President  Barack  Obama  on  border  security  and  immigration  reform."First  entering  public  service  as  a  mother  concerned  about  the  workings  of  her  local  school  board,  Governor  Brewer  has  served  with  distinction  at  every  level  of  state  and  local  government  over  the  last  three  decades,"  veteran  Republican  Sen.  John  McCain  said  Wednesday,  calling  her  "a  great  champion  for  our  state."As  secretary  of  state,  Brewer  automatically  ascended  to  the  gubernatorial  gig  in  2009  when  Gov.  Janet  Napolitano  left  the  job  to  head  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  under  Obama.  Brewer  then  easily  won  election  to  a  full  term  in  2010.Arizona  Gov.

The  strict  immigration  measure,  also  known  as  the  "show  me  your  papers"  act,  allowed  law  enforcement  to  ask  people  for  legal  documents."Show  me  your  papers"  lawCritics  complained  the  measure  would  lead  to  racial  profiling,  and  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  eventually  struck  down  some  provisions  of  it  but  left  intact  the  controversial  section  allowing  police  to  check  immigration  status  while  enforcing  other  laws.The  issue  gained  Brewer  the  reputation  of  conservative  firebrand,  and  she  enhanced  it  in  2012  when  she  famously  wagged  her  finger  at  Obama  during  a  face-to-face  encounter  on  an  airport  runway  when  he  visited  Arizona.In  her  bid  for  reelection  that  year,  she  won  the  endorsement  of  the  National  Rifle  Association  even  though  her  primary  opponent  sat  on  the  organization's  board  of  directors.The  NRA  gave  Brewer  an  A+  rating  and  under  her  leadership,  Arizona  became  one  of  three  states  to  allow  people  to  carry  concealed  weapons  without  a  permit.  In  addition,  people  can  take  concealed  weapons  into  restaurants  or  bars  with  a  permit  if  no  alcohol  is  consumed.Inside  Politics:  Is  Brewer  part  of  a  GOP  evolution?However,  her  conservative  credentials  took  a  hit  in  2013  when  she  decided  Arizona  would  participate  in  the  expansion  of  Medicaid  under  the  Affordable  Care  Act.A  moderate  sideSome  other  conservative  governors  chose  for  their  states  to  opt  out  instead  of  accepting  federal  money  to  pay  for  the  expansion,  but  Brewer  called  it  a  "moral"  obligation  to  provide  health  care  for  the  poor  and  uninsured.In  February,  Brewer  vetoed  a  controversial  state  bill  that  would  have  allowed  business  owners  asserting  their  religious  beliefs  to  deny  service  to  gay  and  lesbian  customers.If  she  had  accepted  the  measure,  Arizona  could  have  faced  litigation  and  a  boycott,  potentially  harming  Arizona's  economy  and  tourism  industry  as  well  as  the  2015  Super  Bowl  to  be  played  there.Protesters  celebrate  Ariz.  governor's  vetoBrewer  cited  the  business  community's  opposition  to  the  bill  in  announcing  her  veto.Arizona  law  dictates  that  a  governor  can't  run  for  more  than  two  consecutive  terms,  and  her  time  in  office  before  she  was  elected  in  2010  would  count  as  a  full  four-year  term.Differing  opinions  exist  on  whether  Brewer  could  be  eligible,  but  she  made  clear  Wednesday  she  would  step  down,  vowing  to  "work  until  my  final  hours  completing  the  people's  business.""Both  my  pen  and  my  veto  stamp  have  plenty  of  ink,"  she  said.CNN's  Leigh  Ann  Caldwell,  Dana  Bash,  Miguel  Marquez  and  Quand  Thomas  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Called  WarkaWater  towers,  each  pillar  is  comprised  of  two  sections:  a  semi-rigid  exoskeleton  built  by  tying  stalks  of  juncus  or  bamboo  together  and  an  internal  plastic  mesh,  reminiscent  of  the  bags  oranges  come  in.The  nylon  and  polypropylene  fibers  act  as  a  scaffold  for  condensation,  and  as  the  droplets  of  dew  form,  they  follow  the  mesh  into  a  basin  at  the  base  of  the  structure.Vittori  decided  to  devote  his  attention  to  this  problem  after  visiting  northeastern  Ethiopia  and  seeing  the  plight  of  remote  villagers  first  hand.  "There,  people  live  in  a  beautiful  natural  environment  but  often  without  running  water,  electricity,  a  toilet  or  a  shower,"  he  says.To  survive,  women  and  their  children  walk  for  miles  to  worm-filled  ponds  contaminated  with  human  waste,  collect  water  in  trashed  plastic  containers  or  dried  gourds,  and  carry  the  heavy  containers  on  treacherous  roads  back  to  their  homes.  This  process  takes  hours  and  endangers  the  children  by  exposing  them  to  dangerous  illnesses  and  taking  them  away  from  school,  ensuring  that  a  cycle  of  poverty  repeats.Exposure  to  this  horrific  scene  motivated  Vittori  to  take  action."WarkaWater  is  designed  to  provide  clean  water  as  well  as  ensure  long-term  environmental,  financial  and  social  sustainability,"  he  says.  "Once  locals  have  the  necessary  know  how,  they  will  be  able  to  teach  other  villages  and  communities  to  build  the  WarkaWater  towers."Each  tower  costs  approximately  $550  and  can  be  built  in  under  a  week  with  a  four-person  team  and  locally  available  materials.A  more  obvious  solution  to  a  water  shortage  would  be  digging  a  well,  but  drilling  1,500  feet  into  Ethiopia's  rocky  plateaus  is  expensive.  Even  when  a  well  is  dug,  maintaining  pumps  and  ensuring  a  reliable  electrical  connection  makes  the  proposition  unlikely.Instead  of  looking  to  Western  technology  for  a  solution,  Vittori  was  inspired  by  the  Warka  tree,  a  giant,  gravity-defying  domed  tree  native  to  Ethiopia  that  sprouts  figs  and  is  used  as  a  community  gathering  space."To  make  people  independent,  especially  in  such  a  rural  context  it's  synonymous  of  a  sustainable  project  and  guaranties  the  longevity,"  says  Vittori.  "Using  natural  fibers  helps  the  tower  to  be  integrated  with  the  landscape  both  visually  with  the  natural  context  as  well  as  with  local  traditional  techniques."The  design  has  been  two  years  in  the  making  and  though  the  final  product  is  handcrafted,  Vittori  has  used  the  same  parametric  modeling  skills  honed  working  on  aircraft  interiors  and  solar-powered  cars  to  create  a  solution  that  is  safe  and  stunning.The  88-pound  sculpture  is  26-feet  wide  at  its  broadest  point  but  swoops  dramatically  to  just  a  few  feet  across  at  its  smallest  point.  Vittori  and  his  team  have  tested  the  design  in  multiple  locations  and  worked  in  improvements  that  increase  the  frame's  stability  while  simultaneously  making  it  easy  for  villagers  to  clean  the  internal  mesh.Vittori  hopes  to  have  two  WarkaTowers  erected  in  Ethiopia  by  2015  and  is  looking  for  financial  rainmakers  who'd  like  to  seed  these  tree-inspired  structures  across  the  country.Read  more  from  WIRED:A  Startlingly  Simple  Theory  About  the  Missing  Malaysia  Airlines  JetHow  to  Use  Your  Google  Maps  —  OfflineThe  Quality  of  13  Famous  TV  Shows,  Charted  Over  TimeUnsettling  Images  of  Patients  in  Hiding  After  Plastic  Surgery  (NSFW)How  to  Create  the  Perfect  Online  Dating  Profile,  in  25  InfographicsSubscribe  to  WIRED  magazine  for  less  than  $1  an  issue  and  get  a  FREE  GIFT!

Jones  has  a  white  mother  and  black  father,  but  always  saw  herself  as  African-American  --  until  her  students  made  her  rethink  her  identity.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Martha  S.  Jones  is  a  professor  of  history,  law  and  Afro-American  and  African  studies  at  the  University  of  Michigan.  She  is  writing  a  family  memoir  on  mixed-race  identity.  This  is  the  second  piece  in  a  Black  History  Month  series  that  explores  evolving  African-American  identity.  The  first  looked  at  the  'white'  student  who  integrated  the  University  of  Mississippi.(CNN)  --  My  winter  2010  seminar  began  the  way  I  start  every  class.  I  made  introductory  remarks  about  themes  and  requirements  for  my  course  on  the  history  of  race,  law  and  marriage  in  the  United  States."Now,"  I  prompted,  "let's  go  around.  Tell  us  about  yourself  and  why  you  chose  this  course."This  introduction  was  routine.  But  what  I  heard  was  anything  but  the  norm:  "My  mother  is  black  and  my  father  is  white."  "I'm  in  an  interracial  relationship."Ordinarily,  I  am  silent,  listening  and  taking  notes.  But  by  the  time  I  heard  a  third  student  say  "I  am  mixed-race,  from  a  mixed  race  family,"  I  had  set  down  my  notebook  and  was  perched  at  the  edge  of  my  seat."Me,  too,"  I  heard  myself  say.  And  with  that,  I  knew  that  the  class  would  be  anything  but  routine.  Until  that  moment,  I  had  always  told  a  neater  story  about  my  identity.  I  was,  simply  put,  black.  And  about  my  mother  being  white?  That  had  been  irrelevant  for  me  and  my  "one  drop  rule"  generation.My  students  had  another  perspective.Everything  about  my  family  was  mixed  up.  My  mother  was  from  the  North,  of  the  working  class,  and  a  German  Catholic  who  only  glimpsed  Protestant  kids  across  the  lines  of  East  Buffalo's  fractured  terrain.  My  father  was  from  North  Carolina,  a  child  of  the  black  middle  class  and  a  Methodist  with  a  bishop  for  an  uncle  who  refused  to  preside  over  their  interfaith  nuptials.They  later  joked  that  this  difference  --  Protestant  versus  Catholic  --  was  the  ruin  of  their  marriage.  But  it  wasn't.  He  was  black  and  she  was  white,  and  their  1957  union  was  prohibited  by  law  in  North  Carolina,  where  my  father  was  raised.When  they  moved  our  small  family  from  Harlem  to  a  predominantly  white  suburb,  there  they  met  Jim  Crow:  red-lining,  restrictive  covenants  and  recalcitrant  neighbors.  Once  the  bomb  threats  passed,  we  spent  years  in  awkward  isolation.My  parents  were  social  pariahs  while  we,  their  three  children,  were  regrettable  unfortunates.  I  don't  recall  the  moment  in  1967  when  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  struck  down  anti-miscegenation  laws  in  Loving  v.  Virginia.  My  parents  were  in  the  midst  of  a  trial  separation,  making  celebrating  our  family  difficult  to  do.But  even  in  sunnier  moments,  my  family  rarely  acknowledged  the  social  fact  of  our  biracial  identity.  It  was  the  era  of  the  one  drop  rule,  a  view  of  race  that  deemed  a  person  with  any  African  ancestry,  however  remote,  to  be  black.We  were  Negroes  --  later  black,  then  African-American  --  and  nothing  about  our  mother's  whiteness  or  our  own  ambiguous  bodies  altered  that."What  are  you?"  schoolmates  queried.  I  can't  say  that  we  were  asked  this  more  often  than  other  children,  but  I  know  that  no  response  elicited  more  vitriol  than  the  clarification  that  we  were  black.  The  moniker  "Casper"  (as  in  ghost  or  spook)  stuck,  some  backyards  were  off  limits  and  occasionally  fists  flew.Still,  we  held  fast  to  our  one-drop  identities.America  largely  believed  itself  organized  around  a  racial  binary.  It  was  good  to  know  where  you  stood,  even  if  it  was  an  awkward  fit.Much  of  my  adult  life  was  guided  by  the  view  that,  however  others  might  misapprehend  me,  I  was  black.  And  in  my  circles  were  friends  and  colleagues  with  whom  I  shared  the  one-drop  identity.Yes,  we  had  a  parent  who  was  not  African-American.  But  that  was  a  quiet  fact,  one  that  our  bodies  might  admit  but  our  voices  rarely  uttered.Why  was  that?  Perhaps  foregrounding  a  nonblack  parent  might  lead  to  the  charge  that  we  were  distancing  ourselves  from  the  stigma  of  blackness.  Perhaps  we'd  be  perceived  as  trying  to  pass  for  something  that  we  were  not.  Perhaps  we'd  be  viewed  with  suspicion,  our  loyalties  questioned  in  a  world  that  so  often  pitted  black  against  white.Mostly  I  think  we  were  black  because  it  fit,  because  it  felt  right,  and  because  racial  identity  as  a  social  construction  is  rooted  in  more  than  the  fact  of  one's  paternity.And  under  the  regime  of  the  one-drop  rule,  I  never  knew  there  was  an  alternative.Until  I  had  that  "me,  too"  moment  in  the  classroom.There,  I  was  confronted  with  student  stories  that  sounded  not  very  different  from  my  own.  The  mixed  race  origins  of  their  families  had  also  required  a  sorting  out  of  identity.  They  talked  about  the  dynamics  of  family  estrangement  but  also  of  love  that  defied  ideas  about  a  color  line.  They  wrestled  with  social  scenes:  friendship,  dating,  and  dormitory  life  where  race  still  seemed  to  matter.  They  fretted  about  checking  boxes  for  college  admissions.But  something  was  different.As  I  listened  to  their  stories,  it  became  clear  that  my  students  were  not  adherents  to  the  one-drop  rule  that  had  given  my  generation  its  place  in  the  national  matrix  of  race.Yes,  they  were  African-American.  This  was  reflected  in  their  choices  of  sororities,  churches  and  political  organizations.  At  the  same  time,  they  were  mixed-race  people.  Their  personal  narratives  were  about  lives  spent  moving  back  and  forth  and  in  between.And  they  militantly  refused  to  check  just  one  box.Our  numbers  are  growing.  During  the  2010  census,  more  than  9  million  Americans  reported  that  they  were  more  than  one  race,  an  increase  of  32%  from  2000.It  is  the  possibility  that  we  can  be  black  and  be  something  else  that  my  students  urged  me  to  confront.If  I  abandoned  the  one  drop  rule,  who  might  I  be?  Both,  neither,  something  else?Today  I  agree  with  my  students:  All  of  the  above.How  do  you  self-identify?  Has  that  changed  over  your  life?

There  is  no  treatment  available  in  the  United  States  for  boosting  the  female  sex  drive,  but  women  like  Gattuso  hoped  that  would  change  with  this  experimental  medication,  called  flibanserin."It  was  amazing,  absolutely  amazing,  and  it  just  makes  you  feel  whole,"  Gattuso  said,  recalling  her  feeling  of  taking  this  drug.  "It  makes  you  feel  like  a  complete  woman  again."Outside  such  experimental  settings,  there  are  no  medications  available  in  the  United  States  for  female  hypoactive  sexual  desire  disorder.  That's  the  technical  term  for  when  women  have  a  distressing  lack  or  absence  of  sexual  desire  or  fantasy.  Up  to  one-third  of  adult  women  may  experience  it,  according  to  a  2002  study.Flibanserin  seemed  like  a  potential  answer  for  many.  But  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  has  rejected  applications  to  green-light  the  drug.Sprout  Pharmaceuticals,  which  is  pursuing  approval  of  the  drug,  has  appealed  the  FDA's  most  recent  decision,  and  was  scheduled  to  have  a  meeting  with  FDA  officials  on  Friday,  said  the  company's  president  and  chief  operating  officer,  Cindy  Whitehead.Given  that  the  drug  has  been  through  numerous,  rigorous  clinical  trials,  and  so  much  has  been  invested  in  it,  the  FDA's  refusal  to  approve  it  is  a  turning  point  in  the  field  of  sexual  medicine,  says  Dr.  Irwin  Goldstein,  director  of  sexual  medicine  at  Alvarado  Hospital  in  San  Diego,  California,  who  collaborated  on  clinical  trials  for  flibanserin.If  there  is  no  positive  action  on  the  drug,  it  could  spell  doom  for  pharmacological  efforts  to  manage  female  sexual  desire,  he  said.  "It  will  go  back  to  dark  ages  of  saying,  'This  is  all  a  relationship  problem,'  even  though  we  know  it's  not,"  he  said.The  FDA  declined  to  answer  specific  questions  regarding  the  matter.FDA  spokeswoman  Andrea  Fischer  said  in  a  statement:  "The  FDA  is  only  able  to  provide  information  on  approved  drug  product  applications.  Any  information  on  an  application  that  has  yet  to  receive  an  approval  or  was  denied  approval  belongs  to  the  manufacturer/sponsor  developing  the  drug."Sprouting  a  drugFlibanserin  was  initially  developed  by  pharmaceutical  giant  Boehringer  Ingelheim,  but  the  company  ditched  it  in  2010  after  the  FDA  declined  to  approve  their  new  drug  application,  asking  for  more  research,  Goldstein  said.A  smaller  operation,  Sprout  Pharmaceuticals,  took  over  work  on  the  drug  in  2011,  and  resubmitted  an  application  with  14  new  clinical  studies,  encompassing  data  on  more  than  3,000  new  patients,  according  to  the  company.In  total,  more  than  11,000  people  have  participated  in  clinical  trials  for  flibanserin,  Whitehead  said.  Still,  the  most  recent  attempt  to  get  flibanserin  off  the  ground  failed;  the  FDA  did  not  approve  the  company's  revised  drug  application  in  October.The  FDA  characterized  the  drug  as  having  a  "modest"  effect  in  its  response  letter,  Whitehead  said.  But  clinical  trial  results  show  statistically  significant  improvement  in  the  women  who  took  the  drug,  compared  to  those  who  took  a  placebo,  she  said."In  terms  of  what  we  see,  I  would  say  'modest'  is  meaningful,"  Whitehead  said.Sex  is  doctor's  life's  workA  2013  study  in  the  Journal  of  Sexual  Medicine  showed  that  women  taking  the  drug  reported  an  average  increase  of  2.5  satisfying  sexual  events  in  four  weeks,  compared  to  an  increase  of  1.5  among  women  using  a  placebo.Flibanserin  is  not  a  hormonal  treatment  and  does  not  appear  to  affect  fertility  or  interact  with  birth  control  medications,  Whitehead  said.The  drug  works  by  increasing  brain  blood  flow  in  particular  ways,  Goldstein  said.  It  increases  levels  of  the  neurotransmitters  dopamine  and  noradrenaline,  and  lowers  levels  of  serotonin.Side  effects  of  flibanserin  include  dizziness,  nausea,  fatigue  and  sleepiness.  Unlike  some  treatments  for  men,  flibanserin  needs  to  be  taken  once  a  day,  every  day.Other  optionsThere  are  other  experimental  treatments  for  low  female  sex  drive  in  the  works.Drugs  called  Lybrido  and  Lybridos,  developed  by  a  company  called  Emotional  Brain,  have  undergone  several  randomized  studies  with  results  that  are  "very  promising  and  will  be  published  soon,"  according  to  the  company's  website.  A  drug  called  Bremelanotide  is  being  investigated  by  Palatin  Technologies  for  both  men  and  women.  None  of  these  drugs  has  completed  phase  3  trials,  which  are  necessary  before  approval.Whitehead  counts  24  FDA-approved  treatments  available  in  the  United  States  for  male  sexual  dysfunction,  including  popular  drugs  such  as  Viagra  (sildenafil  citrate).  For  women,  it's  zero."A  lot  of  times,  the  medical  community  has  really  put  men's  needs  first  and  hasn't  really  addressed  women's  sexual  needs,"  said  Jennifer  Foust,  a  sex  therapist  in  Aventura,  Florida,  who  is  not  affiliated  with  flibanserin.Because  doctors  have  no  solutions,  women  have  tried  less-proven  treatments  for  their  low  sexual  desire,  such  as  diets  and  herbs.  None  of  Foust's  clients  has  had  success  with  them.  She  said  some  women  who  aren't  functioning  well  sexually  would  be  "open  to  anything.""I've  had  women  complain,  'Why  isn't  there  a  female  Viagra?'  "  Foust  said.Sex  drive:  It's  complicatedSex  drive  is  more  complicated  for  women  than  for  men,  Foust  said.  There  are  a  lot  of  factors  that  could  explain  a  woman's  low  desire  --  and  not  all  of  them  are  medical,  she  said.  Lifestyle  and  relationship  issues  may  come  into  play.Having  a  first  child  can  be  a  problematic  factor  for  some  women;  the  adjustment  and  figuring  out  how  to  restructure  their  sex  life  can  throw  off  desire.  Foust  has  spoken  to  some  new  mothers  who  feel  they  are  constantly  being  asked  for  something  from  their  body,  as  if  they  are  "touched  out,"  but  find  their  lack  of  desire  troubling.Some  couples  maintain  satisfying  sex  lives  over  many  years  --  but  some,  over  time,  go  on  autopilot  and  have  less  and  less  sex."You  have  to  continue  to  feed  your  sexual  relationship,  and  feed  your  relationship  in  general,"  Foust  said.  "A  lot  of  it  depends  on  how  much  importance  and  energy  you  put  toward  your  sex  life."Sometimes  stress  is  the  issue,  too,  she  said.Foust  offers  cognitive-behavioral,  focused  exercises  to  help  women  who  are  distressed  about  their  low  sexual  desire.Low  sexual  desire  in  women  isn't  necessarily  a  problem  in  menopause  or  later.

The  argument  from  the  right:  turning  out  conservatives  is  the  key  to  2014  midterm  success,  and  big  immigration  changes  would  anger  the  base.And  now  the  President's  counter  move:  dropping  from  his  new  budget  an  idea  he  said  was  essential  just  a  year  ago  --  a  more  modest  calculation  of  inflation  adjustments  for  Social  Security.  Then,  it  was  a  critical  piece  of  entitlement  reform  and  deficit  reduction.  Now,  the  calculation  is  simple:  liberals  hate  the  idea,  and  pushing  it  in  2014  would  anger  a  base  the  Democrats  need  in  November.When  Boehner  retreated  on  immigration,  it  was  the  White  House  and  its  allies  who  said  he  was  being  shortsighted  and  putting  politics  ahead  of  the  national  interest.Inside  Politics:  Boehner  says  'never  mind'  on  immigrationNow,  the  flipside,  from  Boehner's  office:  "The  President  has  no  interest  in  doing  anything,  even  modest,  to  address  our  looming  debt  crisis.  ...  With  three  years  left  in  office,  it  seems  the  President  is  already  throwing  in  the  towel."A  bit  of  hyperbole  in  that  last  part  --  and  the  speaker  has  his  own  immigration  flip-flop  as  a  lesson  in  context:  the  President  on  Social  Security,  just  like  the  speaker  on  immigration,  is  only  throwing  in  the  towel  for  this  year,  hoping  it  puts  him  in  a  stronger  position  politically  next  year.A  lot  can  happen  between  February  and  November,  but  the  best  bet  at  this  early  juncture  is  that  Republicans  keep  their  House  majority.  The  battle  for  control  of  the  Senate  is  the  big  2014  struggle,  and  the  President  has  made  clear  protecting  the  fragile  Democratic  majority  there  is  his  top  priority.Organizations  focused  on  deficit  reduction  and  structural  budget  reforms  applauded  Obama  when  he  embraced  the  Social  Security  shift  last  year  --  it  is  estimated  to  save  $233  billion  over  a  decade.  Those  same  centrist  organizations  were  quick  to  criticize  his  decision  to  abandon  the  Social  Security  change  this  year  as  a  clear  political  shift  left."The  withdrawal  by  the  President  on  this  specific  issue,  and  his  general  pivot  away  from  focusing  on  the  nation's  medium  and  long-term  fiscal  challenges,  reflects  a  dangerous  trend,"  the  Campaign  to  Fix  the  Debt  said  in  a  statement  after  the  White  House  outlined  the  budget  proposal.CNNMoney:  Obama  drops  controversial  Social  Security  proposalThe  so-called  "chained  CPI"  shift  for  Social  Security  will  likely  return  as  a  debating  point  next  year  anyway,  but  Obama  could  face  even  more  choices  anathema  to  liberals  if  the  GOP  manages  to  take  control  of  the  Senate.What's  the  big  deal  about  'chained  CPI'?Mindful  of  the  stakes,  it's  clear  leadership  in  both  parties  is  moving  away  from  any  environment  of  major  policy  compromise  and  toward  full  scale-election  positioning.To  that  end,  Obama  on  Tuesday  attends  a  2014  Organizing  for  Action  summit.  The  organization  is  the  grassroots  offshoot  of  the  2008  and  2012  Obama  presidential  campaign.  The  summit  goal:  try  to  defy  the  midterm  historical  odds  and  protect  Democratic  seats.</TEXT></DOC>

He  was  68.The  cause  of  death  was  complications  from  open-heart  surgery,  said  his  manager,  Toni  Benson.  Avery  had  surgery  on  November  11  and  died  Tuesday  evening  at  a  hospital  in  Glendale,  California,  according  to  Benson."Fresh  Prince"  co-star  Alfonso  Ribeiro  tweeted  news  of  Avery's  passing."I'm  deeply  saddened  to  say  that  James  Avery  has  passed  away,"  Riberio  wrote.  "He  was  a  second  father  to  me.  I  will  miss  him  greatly.Jada  Pinkett  Smith,  wife  of  "Fresh  Price"  star  Will  Smith,  posted  the  couple's  condolences  Wednesday  on  her  verified  Facebook  page."Our  condolences  to  aunt  Florence  (his  mother),  Miss  Barbara  (his  wife)  and  all  those  who  loved  him,"  Pinkett  Smith  wrote.A  classically  trained  actor  and  poet,  Avery  grew  up  in  Atlantic  City,  New  Jersey,  where  he  was  raised  by  a  single  mother.  He  served  in  the  Navy  during  the  Vietnam  War  and  first  appeared  onscreen  as  a  dancer  in  an  uncredited  role  in  the  1980  film  "The  Blues  Brothers."According  to  IMDb,  after  he  served  in  the  military,  Avery  moved  to  San  Diego,  California,  where  he  began  writing  TV  scripts  and  poetry  for  PBS.  Before  joining  the  military,  he  once  said,  he  had  dreams  of  being  like  Richard  Wright  and  living  in  Paris.  But  life  took  a  different  turn."I  knew  I  loved  the  arts,"  Avery  said  in  an  interview  for  the  show  "Unscripted."  "I  knew  I  wanted  to  be  a  writer,  but  the  theater  was  something  I  had  been  involved  in  before."Avery  appeared  in  multiple  TV  shows  and  movies,  including  "CSI,"  "That  '70s  Show,"  "The  Closer"  and  several  appearances  as  a  judge  on  "L.A.  Law."Indeed,  with  his  deep,  mellifluous  voice,  he  frequently  played  judges,  professors  and  doctors  --  Uncle  Phil  began  as  a  lawyer  and  eventually  became  a  judge  --  and  was  much  in  demand  as  a  voice  actor.  His  voice  roles  included  Shredder  in  the  "Teenage  Mutant  Ninja  Turtles"  series  and  James  "Rhodey"  Rhodes  in  the  1990s  animated  series  version  of  "Iron  Man."He  most  recently  appeared  in  Zach  Braff's  new  film,  "Wish  I  Was  Here,"  which  will  premiere  at  the  Sundance  Film  Festival  later  this  month.But  his  most  famous  role  was  as  Philip  Banks,  the  stern  but  loving  uncle  to  Will  Smith's  character  on  "The  Fresh  Prince  of  Bel-Air,"  which  aired  from  1990  to  1996.The  show,  co-executive  produced  by  Quincy  Jones  and  created  by  Andy  Borowitz  and  Susan  Borowitz,  cast  Smith  --  then  best  known  as  a  rapper  --  as  a  Philadelphia  teenager  who  is  sent  to  live  with  his  wealthy  Los  Angeles  relatives.  As  Banks,  a  former  civil  rights  activist  and  Harvard  Law-trained  attorney,  Avery  provided  a  role  model  for  Smith's  sometimes  wild  character.Avery,  too,  leveled  with  youthful  audiences,  noting  in  "Unscripted"  that  he  left  home  at  18  because  "I  had  too  good  a  time."In  a  2007  interview  with  the  New  York  Film  Academy,  he  was  forthright  about  his  abilities."You  can  either  be  a  movie  star  or  an  actor.  I'm  an  actor,"  Avery  said.  "(But)  I've  done  pretty  good."He  is  survived  by  his  wife  of  26  years,  Barbara  Avery,  his  mother,  Florence  Avery  of  Atlantic  City,  and  a  stepson,  Kevin  Waters.People  we  lost  in  2013CNN's  Todd  Leopold  contributed  to  this  story.</TEXT></DOC>

I  can  really  take  care  of  myself  and  my  husband  and  we  can  enjoy  being  50-plus.

"I  think  because  we  now  know  octogenarians  and  we  know  people  well  on  the  cusp  of  100  that  50  seems  kind  of  like  your  second  act.  It  does  not  seem  like  a  two-thirds  point."For  her  50th,  Sattler  wrote  a  list  of  50  fabulous  things  she  would  do  in  her  50th  year,  which  included  eating  spicy  Indian  food  for  the  first  time,  wearing  the  "crazy  beaded  necklace  and  earrings"  she  bought  on  Venice  Beach  and  buying  new  dishes  "just  because."Also  on  that  list,  she  said,  was  making  an  impact.READ:  The  do's  and  don'ts  of  dating  after  50After  battling  thyroid  cancer  when  she  was  51,  the  psychologist  decided  to  do  something  new.

Symptoms  may  occur  from  any  contact  with  the  peanut  protein,  which  is  why  cross-contamination  of  foods  can  be  very  dangerous.The  new  results  in  the  Lancet  are  a  "very  positive  finding"  because  peanut-allergic  people  who  become  able  to  tolerate  peanuts  don't  have  to  worry  about  any  accidental  exposure  or  trace  amounts  of  contamination,  said  Dr.  Anna  Nowak-Wegrzyn,  associate  professor  of  pediatrics  at  Mount  Sinai  Hospital  in  New  York,  who  was  not  involved  in  the  study.Still,  this  is  not  a  cure,  she  noted.  The  current  thinking  is  that  people  who  undergo  oral  immunotherapy  need  to  continue  eating  peanuts  every  day  in  order  to  maintain  tolerance.Further  research  is  needed  to  confirm  the  new  results  in  more  patients,  and  to  see  just  how  long  the  peanut  allergy  protection  lasts,  said  Nowak-Wegrzyn.How  it  worksResearchers  at  Duke  University  Medical  Center  and  Arkansas  Children's  Hospital  found  in  2009  that  giving  small  doses  of  peanut  protein  over  time  could  allow  allergic  children  to  tolerate  eating  peanuts.A  2011  study  from  Duke  University  Medical  Center  found  that  11  children  who  had  peanut  allergy  could  tolerate  the  equivalent  of  six  to  seven  peanuts  after  a  year  of  treatment.Ninety-nine  children  ages  7  to  16  took  part  in  the  recent  Lancet  study.Participants  were  divided  as  follows:  49  were  randomly  assigned  to  the  peanut  immunotherapy  treatment  and  50  were  placed  in  the  control  group,  which  received  no  treatment.Learn  more  about  the  studyIn  the  first  phase  of  the  trial,  lasting  26  weeks,  researchers  found  that  84%  of  participants  receiving  the  oral  immunotherapy  could  tolerate  a  daily  dose  equivalent  to  about  five  peanuts.  Rick  Martin  is  a  husband  and  father  to  two  young  girls.  Researchers  determined  that  24  out  of  39  participants  who  got  the  treatment  --  but  none  of  the  control  group  --  had  become  desensitized.  They  measured  "desensitization"  as  having  no  reaction  during  a  peanut  "challenge"  of  eating  the  equivalent  of  about  10  peanuts.In  the  second  phase,  control  group  participants  received  the  immunotherapy  intervention,  too,  and  45  of  them  completed  the  treatment.  The  result  here  was  that  54%  of  participants  were  able  to  eat  the  equivalent  of  10  peanuts  and  91%  tolerated  a  daily  intake  equivalent  to  about  five  peanuts.Most  participants  had  only  mild  side  effects.  Some  experienced  gastrointestinal  symptoms  --  31  with  nausea,  31  with  vomiting  and  one  with  diarrhea.It  appears  that  the  treatment's  protection  lasts  if  children  eat  peanuts  daily  for  up  to  two  years,  Clark  said.  After  that,  researchers  are  increasing  the  time  between  peanut  consumptions  every  week.  Initial  studies  show  that  this  regimen  is  well  tolerated  for  another  two  to  three  years,  he  said."We  expect  children  to  have  to  take  peanut  for  many  years,"  Clark  said.Despite  shots,  peanut  allergy  kills  teenGenetic  changeBut  what  if  you  forget  to  eat  your  peanuts?To  maintain  desensitization  after  experiments  that  involve  oral  immunotherapy,  patients  are  usually  asked  to  continue  eating  peanuts  on  a  daily  basis  for  the  rest  of  their  lives.  But  researchers  at  Stanford  University  School  of  Medicine  and  Lucile  Packard  Children's  Hospital  Stanford  wanted  to  see  if  there  was  a  way  to  figure  out  whether  some  patients  could  manage  without  doing  that.Their  report,  published  Friday  in  the  Journal  of  Allergy  and  Clinical  Immunology,  found  that  the  DNA  in  patients'  immune  cells  gets  altered  with  immunotherapy.  This  genetic  change  could  be  used  in  the  future  to  create  a  blood  test  to  assess  whether  peanut  allergy  immunotherapy  has  worked  in  a  given  person,  researchers  said.Dr.  Kari  Nadeau  and  colleagues  looked  at  20  children  and  adults  who  were  allergic  to  peanuts  and  underwent  immunotherapy  for  two  years.  They  were  able  to  eat  a  serving  of  four  grams  of  peanuts  every  day  without  major  allergic  symptoms.Researchers  instructed  participants  to  stop  eating  peanuts  for  three  months,  after  which  they  ate  a  small  amount  of  peanut  powder.  Seven  of  the  patients  did  not  show  allergic  reaction,  while  13  did.Blood  samples  from  all  participants  were  analyzed,  and  compared  with  samples  from  peanut-allergic  patients  who  had  never  had  oral  immunotherapy.Researchers  found  differences  in  the  DNA  of  regulatory  T  cells  among  the  groups  of  people  analyzed.Study  authors  said  this  could  be  the  basis  of  a  blood  test  that  evaluates  just  how  desensitized  patients  who  have  received  immunotherapy  treatment  have  become  to  peanuts.Monitoring  DNA  in  allergic  patients  with  this  kind  of  blood  test  is  not  expensive  and  requires  only  common  lab  equipment.  But  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  would  have  to  approve  the  test  for  this  purpose  outside  of  an  experimental  setting.If  you  suspect  that  you  or  your  children  have  food  allergies,  talk  to  an  allergist.Follow  Elizabeth  Landau  on  Twitter  at  @lizlandau</TEXT></DOC>

He  is  the  author  of  "Jimmy  Carter"  and  "Governing  America."(CNN)  --  Washington  needs  to  be  reformed.  With  polls  consistently  showing  that  Americans  distrust  their  government  and  an  abundance  of  evidence  that  our  political  system  is  not  working  well  (some  polls  have  shown  that  legislators  are  less  trusted  than  car  salesmen),  the  urgency  of  improving  the  rules  and  procedures  through  which  our  politicians  govern  is  essential.It  is  a  good  time  to  look  back  at  the  Watergate  Babies,  most  of  whom  have  left  town.  Over  the  past  month,  two  of  the  giants  from  this  class,  California  Reps.  George  Miller  and  Henry  Waxman  have  announced  that  they  will  retire.  Almost  the  entire  class  is  gone,  other  than  Sen.  Patrick  Leahy  of  Vermont  and  Minnesota  Democrat  Rick  Nolan.The  class  of  Democrats  elected  in  1974  in  the  aftermath  of  President  Richard  Nixon's  resignation  amidst  the  Watergate  scandal  believed  that  to  achieve  better  policies,  legislators  needed  to  clean  up  the  political  process.Nixon  had  been  brought  down  from  power  as  a  result  of  evidence  that  he  had  covered  up  the  investigation  into  whether  White  House  officials  had  been  involved  in  a  burglary  at  the  Democratic  campaign  headquarters  in  the  Watergate  complex.The  new  Democrats  were  younger  than  their  predecessors,  many  had  been  elected  in  Republican  districts  where  voters  were  furious  with  Nixon  and  many  wanted  to  move  beyond  the  traditional  policy  orthodoxies  that  had  defined  Democrats  since  the  New  Deal.Unlike  so  many  politicians  who  keep  their  eyes  focused  almost  exclusively  on  what  bills  they  want  to  pass  and  accept  the  political  system  for  what  it  is,  the  75  Watergate  Babies  insisted  government  reform  needed  to  be  at  the  top  of  the  agenda.  They  didn't  just  complain  about  government,  they  took  steps  to  make  it  work  better.  This  was  the  only  way  to  correct  what  had  gone  wrong  in  the  early  1970s.  "There  is  a  mood  of  reform  in  the  air  on  Capitol  Hill,"  noted  Common  Cause  when  the  freshmen  arrived.When  the  freshman  class  arrived  to  Washington,  they  refused  to  go  along  with  the  status  quo.  One  of  their  biggest  steps  was  to  demand  that  several  senior  committee  chairmen,  who  were  used  to  having  everyone  defer  to  them,  answer  questions  about  whether  they  would  be  responsive  to  the  interests  of  the  Democratic  Caucus.When  a  few  of  them  refused,  the  freshmen  led  the  caucus  in  stripping  them  of  their  power.  Edward  Hebert,  the  crusty  old  chairman  of  the  House  Armed  Services  Committee,  insulted  the  freshmen  by  calling  them  "boys  and  girls"  in  front  of  reporters.  In  doing  so,  he  sealed  his  fate.  One  legislator  said  that  the  chairman  had  "underestimated  the  intelligence  of  the  people  he  was  talking  to.  We  may  be  new  kids  on  the  block,  but  we're  not  stupid."The  Washington  Post  concluded,  "a  revolution  has  occurred.  The  seniority  system  as  the  rigid,  inviolable  operating  framework  of  the  House  has  been  destroyed."The  Watergate  Babies  also  led  the  way  in  instituting  changes  in  rules  and  regulations.  Working  in  an  alliance  with  liberal  Democrats  who  had  been  in  office  since  the  late  1950s,  their  sunshine  laws  opened  up  much  more  of  the  legislative  process  to  public  and  media  scrutiny.They  instituted  ethics  reforms  that  created  new  standards  of  accountability  for  politicians  in  the  executive  and  legislative  branches.They  ensured  that  the  new  campaign  finance  laws  required  disclosure  of  information  about  who  gave  money  to  whom,  and  that  the  Federal  Election  Commission  was  capable  of  monitoring  the  laws.  They  reformed  the  filibuster  rules  to  lower  the  number  of  senators  required  to  end  a  filibuster,  from  two-thirds  to  three-fifths  of  the  Senate,  while  providing  party  leaders  more  tools  so  that  they  could  keep  members  in  line  (back  then  reformers  wanted  more  partisanship,  not  less).Over  time,  the  Watergate  Babies  lost  much  of  their  zeal  for  government  reform.  This  class  of  Democrats  eventually  focused  their  attention  on  policy  issues,  becoming  less  interested  in  cleaning  up  the  political  process.Waxman  was  a  pioneer  on  issues  such  as  the  environment  and  health  care,  while  Miller  was  a  legislative  giant  who  fought  for  programs  like  the  minimum  wage  while  others  like  Colorado's  Gary  Hart  emphasized  public  investment  in  high  tech  industries  and  new  approaches  to  defense.  Some  of  the  reforms  also  didn't  work  out  as  they  intended.But  the  original  focus  of  the  Watergate  Babies  is  an  important  legacy  and  one  that  we  should  not  forget.  Their  central  argument  that  major  policy  innovations  are  impossible  unless  we  make  the  political  system  better  is  one  that  would  be  worth  remembering.Although  President  Barack  Obama  made  political  reform  part  of  his  2008  campaign  promises,  the  issues  faded  quickly  from  his  agenda.  Nor  have  the  tea  party  Republicans,  who  love  to  rail  against  the  way  that  Washington  works,  really  devoted  much  time  to  questions  such  as  campaign  finance.  Rather,  their  emphasis  has  been  about  cutting  the  government  down  in  size.Today,  reform  is  urgent.  We  badly  need  campaign  finance  rules  that  impose  limits  on  what  independent  organizations  can  spend  and  lobbying  reforms  that  seriously  close  the  revolving  door  between  Capitol  Hill  and  the  K  Street  lobbying  complex.Without  procedural  reforms  to  weaken  the  power  of  party  leaders,  heightened  partisanship  in  the  House  and  Senate  won't  subside.  Without  rules  to  change  the  budgeting  process,  the  ability  of  our  Congress  to  make  decisions  about  spending  and  taxation  in  a  more  rational  process  --  one  that  does  not  constantly  risk  default  --  will  be  extraordinarily  difficult  as  well.Without  reforms  that  make  sure  continued  bastions  of  secrecy,  such  as  conference  committees,  open  up  their  doors,  there  will  be  ongoing  frustration  with  a  lack  of  accountability  in  politics.As  Waxman  and  Miller  step  down,  it  is  time  to  celebrate  what  they  represented  in  their  heyday  during  the  1970s.  Politicians  need  to  devote  some  of  their  capital  to  strengthening  the  processes  of  decision-making  and  governing.  That's  vital  to  restoring  trust  in  government.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Julian  Zelizer.</TEXT></DOC>

That's  the  conclusion  of  a  new  study  in  the  journal  Science.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Most  people  are  carrying  around  historical  records  in  their  DNA,  with  clues  to  how  people  from  genetically  distinct  groups  intermingled  over  the  last  4,000  years.  That's  the  conclusion  of  a  new  study  in  the  journal  Science.Researchers  set  out  to  pinpoint  which  groups  intermixed,  and  when,  over  thousands  of  years,  using  modern  DNA.  They  thought  this  information  could  complement  other  historical  records."The  results  suggest  DNA  is  indeed  a  powerful  means  of  reconstructing  history,  which  then  might  be  used  to  identify  the  genetic  legacies  of  historically  well-attested  events  ...  and  highlight  surprising  events  with  a  less  clear  historical  context,"  authors  Garrett  Hellenthal  and  Simon  Myers  wrote  in  an  e-mail.The  scientists  have  created  an  interactive  map  showcasing  their  findings.  You  can  explore  the  map  in  detail  on  the  researchers'  website,  admixturemap.paintmychromosomes.com.The  technical  term  for  people  from  genetically  different  groups  having  babies  together  is  "genetic  admixture."  This  has  happened  throughout  history  when  people  migrated  into  a  new  geographic  region  where  others  were  already  living.Researchers  say  there  have  been  many  such  admixture  events  among  people  from  populations  that  were  separated  by  thousands  of  miles.  Sometimes  populations  adjacent  to  each  other  have  distinct  ancestry  and  history.Did  you  know  that  your  DNA  contains  genetic  segments  you've  inherited  from  groups  that  intermingled  in  the  past?  Researchers  can  look  at  these  signatures  for  clues  about  major  historical  mixings  of  populations.DNA  from  a  person  today  can  also  give  scientists  an  idea  of  how  long  ago  two  groups  genetically  mixed.The  more  time  that  has  passed  since  the  admixture  event,  the  shorter  the  inherited  DNA  segments  from  the  original  groups  are  likely  to  be.  That's  because  there  would  have  been  more  generations  in  between,  and  there  would  have  been  reshuffling  of  genetic  material  in  each  generation.There  are  limitations  to  the  method,  however.  When  genetic  mixing  involves  more  than  three  groups,  the  researchers  can't  identify  those  specific  events.  The  researchers  were  also  limited  in  how  well  they  could  estimate  when  the  same,  or  very  similar,  groups  interbred  on  multiple  occasions  in  one  descendant  group's  history.Oldest  human  DNA  found  in  SpainThe  researchers  looked  at  a  genetic  data  set  of  1,490  people  who  come  from  95  genetically  distinct  groups  worldwide.  Their  software,  Globetrotter,  was  able  to  describe  genetic  mixing  events  dating  back  about  4,500  years.The  expansion  of  the  Mongol  empire,  which  took  place  from  1206  to  1368,  appears  to  have  been  highly  influential  on  many  populations  in  Europe  and  Asia.  Previous  studies  have  also  supported  that  idea.  Genghis  Khan  and  his  armies  began  this  monumental  historical  event  that  influenced  seven  populations  included  in  this  study.The  Arab  expansion  and  slave  trade,  which  began  around  the  seventh  century,  also  had  a  large  genetic  impact  on  many  groups,  including  people  from  around  the  Mediterranean,  the  Arabian  Sea  and  the  Persian  Gulf.  The  study's  findings  are  consistent  with  that  historical  timeframe,  but  suggest  that  sub-Saharan  Africans  and  Moroccans  mixed  earlier.A  group  called  the  Kalash,  from  Pakistan,  appears  to  come  from  an  admixture  event  that  happened  sometime  before  206  B.C.,  when  people  from  a  more  European  group  hooked  up  with  a  more  Central/South  Asian  group.Researchers  say  the  Kalash  are  geographically  isolated,  originating  in  the  Hindu  Kush  mountains,  which  is  why  they  don't  show  genetic  signatures  of  a  more  recent  admixture  event.  Local  tradition  says  the  Kalash  are  descended  from  the  army  of  Alexander  the  Great;  the  new  study  does  not  rule  that  out,  since  the  time  period  of  the  mixing  event  could  have  been  about  right."We  have  tried  to  let  the  genetic  information  'speak'  in  this  study,  but  future  interpretation  of  signals  --  especially  in  follow-up  studies  of  specific  regions  --  would  benefit  from  expertise  from  ...  historians,  linguists  and  others,"  Hellenthal  and  Myers  said.Some  groups  showed  genetic  signals  that  the  researchers  were  unable  to  precisely  interpret.  For  instance,  genetic  material  from  French  people  suggests  an  intermixing  between  northern  and  southern  Europeans  and  northern  Africans,  between  785  and  1,385  years  ago,  but  the  event  itself  is  still  unclear.The  researchers  were  not  able  to  pick  up  signals  of  some  well-established  historical  intermixings,  such  as  migrations  into  the  United  Kingdom  from  northern  European  groups,  because  of  the  small  sample  sizes.It  is  possible  that  a  mutation  could  arise  in  two  populations  independently,  but  that  is  thought  to  be  rare."If  two  individuals  share  a  mutation,  it  is  statistically  much  more  likely  that  the  mutation  occurred  in  a  common  ancestor  of  both  individuals,  rather  than  arising  independently  in  the  ancestors  of  each  of  them,"  Hellenthal  and  Myers  said.The  researchers  are  involved  in  a  project  called  People  of  the  British  Isles,  which  is  looking  specifically  at  the  genetic  origins  of  people  from  the  United  Kingdom.  Other  projects  are  looking  in  more  depth  at  areas  such  as  the  Caribbean,  Ethiopia  and  the  Americas.The  researchers  say  in  the  study  that  as  whole-genome  sequencing  improves  and  analyses  are  able  to  incorporate  more  people  as  well  as  ancient  DNA,  we  may  reach  a  "better  understanding  of  ancient  events  where  little  or  no  historical  record  exists,  to  identify  many  additional  events  ...  and  to  provide  more  precise  event  characterization  than  is  currently  possible."There  may  also  be  implications  for  public  health,  as  researchers  get  better  at  identifying  disease  risks  that  are  higher  in  specific  populations.Baby's  DNA  deconstructed  before  birth</TEXT></DOC>

That  means  Saturn's  sixth-largest  moon  could  have  been  --  or  could  now  be  --  hospitable  to  life.This  discovery  puts  Enceladus  in  an  exclusive  club  of  extraterrestrial  worlds  in  the  solar  system  that  appear  to  have  a  subsurface  water  ocean.  The  others  are  Titan,  another  moon  of  Saturn,  and  Europa,  a  moon  of  Jupiter.  Callisto  and  Ganymede,  also  moons  of  Jupiter,  may  also  have  oceans  under  ice."As  far  as  whether  one  should  go  first  to  Europa  or  Enceladus,  I  look  at  this  as  a  kind  of  a  cornucopia  of  habitable  environments  in  the  outer  solar  system,"  study  co-author  Jonathan  Lunine  of  Cornell  University  said  in  a  press  conference  Wednesday.What  we  think  is  thereThe  north  pole  of  Enceladus  has  a  thickness  of  ice  around  30  miles,  with  solid  rock  beneath  it.  But  at  the  south  pole,  there  may  be  only  18  to  24  miles  of  ice  covering  a  subsurface  ocean  that  itself  is  5  to  10  miles  deep.This  ocean  appears  to  be  a  "lens-shaped  reservoir"  that's  deepest  at  the  south  pole  and  thinner  further  afield.  The  ocean  appears  to  sit  on  top  of  a  rocky  core  and  "may  extend  halfway  or  more  towards  the  equator  in  every  direction,"  said  study  co-author  David  Stevenson,  professor  of  planetary  science  at  California  Institute  of  Technology,  in  a  press  conference.Also  noteworthy  is  that  the  north  pole  is  heavily  cratered,  while  the  ice  on  the  south  pole  is  smoother,  meaning  it  has  been  resurfaced  and  softened.Measurements  from  the  new  study  and  previous  Cassini  data  suggest  the  moon's  south  pole  has  an  ice  layer  on  top  of  water  on  top  of  silicate  rock.  If  that's  true,  water  circulating  through  the  rock  would  pick  up  elements  such  as  phosphorous,  sulfur,  potassium  and  sodium  into  the  liquid.  These  elements  are  essential  for  making  molecules  that  life  needs,  Lunine  said.With  respect  to  the  ocean  being  on  top  of  rock,  the  gravity  data  from  Enceladus  "makes  the  base  of  the  ocean  very  much  like  the  base  of  our  own  ocean  on  the  Earth,"  Lunine  said  at  the  press  conference.Enceladus  is  a  small  moon,  with  a  diameter  of  only  about  310  miles.  In  2005,  Cassini  found  that  fractures  called  "tiger  stripes"  in  the  south  polar  region  emit  water  vapor  jets  rich  in  salt,  lead  author  Luciano  Iess  of  Sapienza  Università  di  Roma  in  Rome,  Italy,  said  in  a  press  conference  Wednesday.Cassini  has  also  detected  organic  molecules,  which  can  come  from  biological  or  nonbiological  sources,  near  the  tiger  stripes  and  in  dust  grains  in  the  region.A  moon  of  Saturn  may  have  'tropical'  lakesHow  do  we  know?No  one  has  actually  gone  to  Enceladus  and  seen  this  ocean  under  the  thick  ice  layer.  But  scientists  have  strong  evidence  that  it  is  there,  based  on  gravity  measurements  made  with  Cassini.When  the  spacecraft  flies  by  Enceladus,  the  gravity  of  the  moon  changes  the  probe's  speed.  Scientists  can  measure  those  changes  back  on  Earth  by  detecting  fluctuations  in  the  frequency  of  the  signal  that  Cassini  sends  back.  If  the  spacecraft's  speed  doesn't  change,  the  frequency  would  remain  the  same.But  depending  on  where  Cassini  flies,  the  frequency  of  the  signal  changes  in  particular  ways.  This  allows  scientists  to  learn  more  about  the  moon's  subsurface  features.Scientists  had  already  known  about  the  presence  of  a  depression  or  "dimple"  at  the  south  pole  of  Enceladus,  "as  if  there  is  some  amount  of,  effectively,  missing  material,"  Lunine  said.  But  in  this  new  study,  the  change  in  gravity  associated  with  the  depression  was  not  as  dramatic  as  expected."There  must  be  some  higher  density  layer  that's  underneath  the  ice,  and  that  has  to  be  a  liquid  water  ocean,  because  there's  really  nothing  else  plausible  that  can  explain  that  offset  to  what  we  would  expect  for  the  gravity  signature  of  this  depression,"  he  said.It  is  possible  that  this  ocean  has  been  sending  out  the  plumes  that  Cassini  first  observed  in  2005,  but  this  has  not  been  verified.How  can  we  look  for  signs  of  life  there?Sending  a  probe  to  Enceladus  with  a  drill  wouldn't  be  entirely  practical  because  the  liquid  water  is  so  far  under  the  ice  that  it  would  be  hard  to  access,  Lunine  said.Instead,  a  spacecraft  with  instruments  more  sophisticated  than  Cassini  could  fly  through  the  plumes  of  material  being  ejected  from  fractures  in  the  ice.  Cassini  has  already  detected  the  water  vapor  and  organic  molecules  in  these  plumes,  using  a  device  called  a  mass  spectrometer.But  a  more  advanced,  more  sensitive  version  of  the  same  instrument  could  better  test  for  the  "menu  of  molecules"  associated  with  an  advanced  biological  system,  Lunine  said.Detecting  these  molecules  could  be  "the  smoking  gun  for  whether  in  fact  there  is  life  down  there  or  not,"  he  said.READ:  Jupiter's  moon  Europa  puffs  water  vapor  --  could  there  be  life  there?</TEXT></DOC>

Tell  us  how  you  did  it,  and  you  could  be  featured  in  our  weekly  weight-loss  story  on  CNN.com.(CNN)  --  Every  detail  was  planned  out  that  afternoon.Lee  Jordan  was  meeting  a  friend  at  a  Starbucks  in  Herndon,  Virginia.  He  had  scouted  out  the  area,  including  the  parking  situation,  since  he  could  walk  only  a  very  short  distance.He  also  wanted  to  make  sure  he  didn't  have  to  stand  in  line  and  could  sit  without  fear  of  breaking  the  furniture.Jordan  weighed  450  pounds.This  was  no  ordinary  chat  over  coffee.  Jordan  was  meeting  Beth,  his  high  school  and  college  sweetheart,  more  than  20  years  since  they  had  last  seen  each  other.He  had  only  told  Beth  that  he  was  out  of  shape  --  that  he  had  gained  some  weight  and  lost  some  hair.He  anticipated  the  same  looks  he  usually  received  from  others  who  met  him."Pity.  Shock.  Horror,"  he  said.What  happened  next  was  life-changing."Beth  looked  at  me,  and  all  she  saw  was  Lee  Jordan,"  he  remembers.  "That's  it.  There  was  nothing  but  love  and  acceptance  in  her  eyes."I  cannot  express  how  powerful  that  was.  That  was  the  turning  point  to  give  me  the  willingness  to  turn  things  around."Young  loveIn  1979,  15-year-old  Jordan  met  16-year-old  Beth  Schwein  through  a  church  youth  group  in  the  Washington  area.  The  two  started  dating  soon  after.After  graduation,  Schwein  went  to  Radford  University  in  Virginia;  Jordan  followed  her  a  year  later."In  our  minds,  we  (just  had  to)  finish  college,  and  then  we  could  get  married,"  he  said.While  Schwein  was  on  a  straight-and-narrow  path,  Jordan  focused  more  on  partying  and  less  on  academics.Eventually,  Schwein  got  fed  up  and  broke  up  with  Jordan.  She  graduated.  Broken-hearted,  Jordan  dropped  out  of  school,  moved  home  and  went  to  work.Schwein  requested  that  the  two  not  speak  because  it  was  too  painful.  He  obliged.Up  and  downJordan  immersed  himself  in  his  job  as  an  assistant  manager  at  a  clothing  store.Professional  success,  though,  came  at  a  high  price.  Not  only  was  he  not  exercising,  he  was  binge  eating  at  night.  Whether  he  was  on  the  road  or  home  alone,  he  estimates,  he  was  eating  8,000  to  12,000  calories  a  day."I  never  ate  less  than  two  large  pizzas,  followed  by  the  super-size  large  family  bag  of  Doritos,  two  large  tubs  of  dip,  two  large  boxes  of  cookies  and  a  half-gallon  of  ice  cream,"  he  said.The  pounds  continued  to  pile  on  as  he  dealt  with  the  stress  of  work."I  buried  my  emotions  in  food."Over  the  next  decade,  Jordan  tried  to  battle  the  extra  weight.  On  one  occasion,  he  dropped  100  pounds  in  just  four  months."I  would  get  on  the  treadmill  or  Stairmaster  every  single  day  for  one  hour,"  he  said.  "Then  I  would  eat  practically  nothing:  anywhere  between  600  to  900  calories  a  day,  which  is  insane."But  he  soon  learned  this  was  not  a  lifestyle  he  could  sustain.  He  gained  all  the  weight  back.Nine  years  later,  Jordan  went  to  a  weight  loss  camp.  For  a  year,  he  prepared  healthy  meals  and  worked  out.  He  was  able  to  again  drop  100  pounds.He  instantly  started  gaining  it  back  once  he  returned  to  work.He  even  tried  a  lower-stress  job.  Yet  his  obesity  problem  persisted.The  boxJordan  never  married  and  barely  dated.  Even  though  he  had  no  communication  with  Schwein,  no  mutual  friends  and  no  plans  of  ever  seeing  her  again,  he  dwelled  on  her,  often  sifting  through  a  box  of  cards  and  letters  she  had  written  years  prior."People  would  say,  'You're  crazy,'  and  I  would  say,  'I  can't  help  it.  I  only  love  Beth,'  "  he  recalled.Meanwhile,  Schwein  did  what  she  thought  she  was  supposed  to  do:  build  a  career,  get  married  and  have  a  family.But  in  2004,  an  aunt's  dying  wish  prompted  her  to  send  a  letter  to  Jordan  out  of  the  blue."(My  aunt)  knew  how  my  life  was  going,  and  it  wasn't  the  perfect  life,"  she  said.  "I  wasn't  completely  happy."In  the  letter,  she  talked  about  how  their  love  had  been  true  and  apologized  for  any  hurt  feelings.  She  caught  him  up  on  her  life.Several  years  earlier,  she  had  suffered  a  broken  back  as  a  result  of  a  Rollerblading  accident.  She  didn't  opt  for  the  surgery  the  orthopedic  surgeon  had  recommended.  Rather,  she  taught  herself  to  walk  again,  strengthening  her  body  by  working  with  a  trainer  certified  by  the  American  Council  on  Exercise.Feeling  better  than  ever  before,  she  then  decided  to  get  certified  as  a  trainer  herself."If  I  could  do  this,  then  I  could  help  somebody  else,"  she  remembered  thinking.  "It  wasn't  about  doing  anything  extraordinary.  It  was  about  doing  little  things  every  single  day."Warning  for  JordanShortly  before  the  two  met  again  in  2008,  Jordan  was  diagnosed  with  obesity-induced  breathing  problems,  diabetes  and  high  cholesterol.  He  was  put  on  an  oxygen  machine.  Doctors  warned  him  that  if  he  didn't  lose  weight,  he  would  be  dead  in  two  years."Even  that  couldn't  (motivate  me),"  he  said.But  after  he  saw  Schwein,  her  love  and  acceptance  encouraged  him  to  make  a  complete  lifestyle  change.  His  first  step  was  having  an  adjustable  gastric  band  inserted  around  his  stomach  to  control  his  food  intake.He  also  began  a  walking  program,  starting  out  for  just  30  seconds  at  a  time.  Then  he  hired  an  ACE  trainer.  Schwein,  who  lived  more  than  two  hours  away,  encouraged  him  via  letters."(Beth)  told  me,  if  you  show  up,  you  win,"  he  said.As  Jordan  became  healthier,  the  couple  began  to  explore  their  relationship  beyond  the  occasional  letter."All  the  years  were  washed  away,"  he  said.  "I  was  alive  again."Immeasurable  joyAfter  Schwein's  divorce,  the  two  got  engaged  in  2012  and  were  married  shortly  thereafter.The  site  of  the  proposal?  The  same  spot  in  Starbucks  where  they  had  met  for  coffee  four  years  earlier.At  his  heaviest,  Jordan  weighed  454  pounds  and  had  a  waist  size  of  72  inches.  He  now  weighs  178  pounds  and  has  a  waist  size  of  34."Love,  acceptance  and  encouragement  (were)  the  difference-makers  for  me,"  he  said.Today,  both  are  ACE-certified  personal  trainers.  Jordan  is  also  a  health  coach.  They  are  committed  to  helping  others  live  healthier  lives.The  couple  often  does  5Ks,  10Ks  and  half-marathons  together.  They  also  both  participate  in  triathlons.They  work  together  at  Beth's  Boot  Camp  in  Jacksonville  Beach,  Florida,  a  program  specifically  designed  for  women.  They  also  see  individual  clients  through  their  company,  Fullest  Living.The  couple  likes  to  say  "Go  small  or  go  home"  rather  than  "Go  big  or  go  home.""If  you  do  a  little  at  a  time,  you  can  gain  so  much,"  Jordan  said.</TEXT></DOC>

Family  members  today  say  he's  innocent,  and  while  they  can't  bring  him  back,  they  want  his  name  cleared.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Almost  70  years  ago,  South  Carolina  electrocuted  14-year-old  George  Stinney,  the  youngest  person  to  be  executed  by  an  American  state  since  the  1800s.  Family  members  today  say  he's  innocent,  and  while  they  can't  bring  him  back,  they  want  his  name  cleared.A  black  teen  in  the  Jim  Crow  South,  Stinney  was  accused  of  murdering  two  white  girls,  ages  7  and  11,  as  they  hunted  for  wildflowers  in  Alcolu,  about  50  miles  southeast  of  Columbia.Stinney,  according  to  police,  confessed  to  the  crime.  No  witness  or  evidence  that  might  vindicate  him  was  presented  during  a  trial  that  was  over  in  fewer  than  three  hours.  An  all-white  jury  convicted  him  in  a  flash,  10  minutes,  and  he  was  sentenced  to  "be  electrocuted,  until  your  body  be  dead  in  accordance  with  law.  And  may  God  have  mercy  on  your  soul,"  court  documents  say.Fewer  than  three  months  after  the  girls'  deaths,  Stinney  was  escorted  to  an  electric  chair  at  a  Columbia  penitentiary,  built  for  much  larger  defendants.  The  chair's  straps  were  loose  on  Stinney's  5-foot-1-inch,  95-pound  frame,  and  books  were  placed  on  the  seat  so  he  would  fit  in  the  chair.When  the  switch  was  flipped,  Stinney's  body  convulsed,  dislodging  the  oversized  mask  and  exposing  his  face  to  about  40  witnesses,  including  the  slain  girls'  fathers,  according  to  James  Gamble,  son  of  the  Clarendon  County  sheriff  at  the  time.  Gamble  recalled  the  execution  for  The  Herald  in  Rock  Hill  a  decade  ago.Now,  attorneys  for  Stinney's  family  are  demanding  a  new  trial,  saying  the  boy's  confession  was  coerced  and  that  Stinney  had  an  alibi,  his  sister,  Amie  Ruffner,  who  claims  she  was  with  Stinney  when  the  murders  occurred."We  think  we  have  the  opportunity  here  to  make  a  difference  and  correct  a  wrong  that's  been  there  for  70  years,"  defense  attorney  Matt  Burgess  said.Lawyers  on  both  sides  argued  Tuesday  at  a  hearing  to  determine  whether  there  will  be  a  new  trial.The  defense  put  up  witnesses  related  to  Stinney  and  a  forensic  pathologist.  Evidence  in  the  case  now  seems  to  suggest  Stinney  was  innocent  and  points  to  various  violations  of  due  process,  Burgess  said."South  Carolina  still  recognizes  George  Stinney  as  a  murderer.  We  felt  that  something  needed  to  be  done  about  that,"  he  said.Third  Circuit  Solicitor  Chip  Finney  feels  differently."The  fact  of  the  matter  is,  it  happened,  and  it  occurred  because  of  a  legal  system  of  justice  that  was  in  place  and  that,  we  --  for  all  we  know,  based  on  the  record  --  that  it  worked  properly,"  he  said,  according  to  CNN  affiliate  WIS.It's  not  clear  how  long  the  hearing  at  the  Sumter  County  Judicial  Center  will  last.  It  will  resume  Wednesday.'They  used  my  brother  as  a  scapegoat'Defense  attorneys  also  said  Stinney's  former  cellmate,  Wilford  Hunter,  issued  a  statement  saying  Stinney  denied  committing  the  crime,  WIS  reported."I  didn't,  didn't  do  it,'  "  Hunter  recalled  Stinney  telling  him.  "He  said,  'Why  would  they  kill  me  for  something  I  didn't  do?'  "Ruffner,  Stinney's  sister,  told  CNN  affiliate  WLTX  that  she  and  Stinney  saw  Betty  June  Binnicker,  11,  and  Mary  Emma  Thames,  7,  the  day  they  died.  Stinney  and  Ruffner  were  tending  to  their  family's  cow  near  some  railroad  tracks  close  to  their  home."They  said,  'Could  you  tell  us  where  we  could  find  some  maypops?'  "  Ruffner  recalled.  "We  said,  'No,'  and  they  went  on  about  their  business."The  girls  were  found  the  next  day  in  a  water-logged  ditch  with  injuries  to  their  head.  Mary  had  a  2-inch  laceration  above  her  right  eyebrow  and  a  vertical  laceration  over  her  left,  according  to  a  1944  medical  examiners'  report."Both  of  these  are  jagged  and  deep  and  there  is  a  hole  going  straight  through  the  cranial  cavity  from  the  one  on  the  forehead.  The  frontal  bone  just  above  the  right  orbit  is  also  definitely  broken,"  the  report  says,  adding  there  were  also  two  bruised,  lacerated  areas  on  top  of  the  head  that  appear  to  have  been  caused  by  a  hammer."There  is  a  punched  out  fracture  of  the  skull  beneath  each  of  them,"  it  says.With  Betty,  "There  were  evidences  of  at  least  seven  blows  on  the  head,"  which,  like  Mary's  injuries,  appear  to  be  the  product  of  a  "blunt  instrument  with  a  small  round  head  about  the  size  of  a  hammer.  Some  of  these  have  only  cracked  the  skull  while  two  have  punched  definite  holes  in  the  skull.  The  back  of  the  skull  is  nothing  but  a  mass  of  crushed  bones,"  the  report  says.While  the  medical  examiner  noted  no  signs  of  sexual  assault  to  Mary's  body,  there  was  some  swelling  on  Betty's  genitalia  and  a  "slight  bruise."  Both  girls'  hymens  were  intact,  according  to  the  report.Police  would  later  say  that  Stinney  confessed  he  wanted  to  have  sex  with  Betty.A  handwritten  statement  from  a  law  enforcement  officer  named  H.S.  Newman  said  that  after  finding  the  girls,  "I  arrested  a  boy  by  the  name  of  George  Stinney.  He  then  made  a  confession  and  told  me  where  to  find  a  piece  of  iron  about  15  inches  long  were  (sic).  He  said  he  put  it  in  a  ditch  about  six  feet  from  the  bicycle."A  few  days  later,  Ruffner  told  WLTX,  police  took  Stinney  and  another  of  her  brothers  away  in  handcuffs  while  their  parents  were  not  at  home.  One  brother  was  released,  she  said,  while  Stinney  faced  police  questioning  without  his  parents  or  a  lawyer.What  followed,  according  to  Stinney's  supporters,  was  a  farce  of  a  trial  in  which  Stinney's  defense  cross-examined  no  witnesses  and  presented  no  evidence  or  testimony  in  his  favor."(The  police)  were  looking  for  someone  to  blame  it  on,  so  they  used  my  brother  as  a  scapegoat,"  Ruffner  said.'There  wasn't  ever  any  doubt'But  not  everyone  believes  Stinney's  innocence  is  clear  cut.  The  sheriff's  son,  Gamble,  for  one,  told  The  Herald  in  his  2003  interview  that  he  was  in  the  back  seat  with  Stinney  as  Gamble's  father  drove  him  to  the  prison  in  Columbia."There  wasn't  ever  any  doubt  about  him  being  guilty,"  he  told  the  paper.  "He  was  real  talkative  about  it.  He  said,  'I'm  real  sorry.  I  didn't  want  to  kill  them  girls.'  "Betty  Binnicker's  nieces  also  have  their  doubts,  they  told  WIS."I  was  always  told  George  Stinney  killed  her,"  Carolyn  Geddings  told  the  station.Added  Frankie  Bailey  Dyches,  "I  believe  he  got  what  he  deserved,  was  put  to  death.  He  was  old  enough  to  know  better."Bailey  Dyches  added  that  she  feels  "justice  was  served,  according  to  the  laws  in  1944  when  this  happened."Neither  relative  believes  the  push  for  a  new  trial  is  warranted."I  don't  think  somebody  that  was  found  guilty  of  a  murder  like  he  committed  should  be  exonerated  for  any  reason,"  Geddings  told  WIS.

Follow  her  on  Twitter  or  Facebook.(CNN)  --  New  research  shows  that  some  students  are  doing  more  than  three  hours  of  homework  a  night  --  and  that  all  that  school  work  may  be  literally  making  them  sick.It  may  be  tempting  to  dismiss  this  latest  research,  conducted  in  upper-middle-class  areas,  as  yet  another  manifestation  of  the  eccentricities  of  the  affluent.  This  is,  after  all,  the  same  demographic  that  recently  brought  us  eye-roll-inducing  news  stories  about  $250-an-hour  tutors  who  drill  preschoolers  on  their  ABCs  and  1-2-3s.Could  it  be  that  a  few  short  years  later  those  same  tots  have  graduated  to  marathon  homework  sessions?"The  three  hours  of  homework  a  night  was  an  average,  by  the  way,"  says  Denise  Pope,  senior  lecturer  at  the  Stanford  Graduate  School  of  Education  and  co-author  of  the  study  published  in  the  Journal  of  Experimental  Education."We  had  kids  in  the  study  who  were  doing  way  more,"  as  many  as  five  hours  in  some  cases.  Even  in  schools  that  have  a  policy  limiting  homework,  advanced  placement  and  honors  classes  are  often  exempt.The  study  surveyed  more  than  4,300  students  from  10  high-performing  public  and  private  high  schools  in  upper-middle-class  California  communities.  The  researchers  sought  to  examine  the  relationship  between  homework  load  and  student  well-being  and  engagement,  as  well  as  to  understand  how  homework  can  act  as  a  stressor  in  students'  lives.Is  it  good  to  let  kids  screw  up?Their  findings  were  troubling:  Research  showed  that  excessive  homework  is  associated  with  high  stress  levels,  physical  health  problems  and  lack  of  balance  in  children's  lives;  56%  of  the  students  in  the  study  cited  homework  as  a  primary  stressor  in  their  lives."We  found  a  clear  connection  between  the  students'  stress  and  physical  impacts  --  migraines,  ulcers  and  other  stomach  problems,  sleep  deprivation  and  exhaustion,  and  weight  loss,"  Pope  observed.Pope's  findings  are  particularly  interesting  when  compared  to  recent  National  Assessment  of  Educational  Progress  data  about  homework  trends  for  the  larger  population.As  it  turns  out,  most  students'  homework  load  has  remained  remarkably  stable  since  1984,  according  to  the  Brookings  Institute's  2014  Brown  Center  Report  on  American  Education.So  what's  going  on  with  the  kids  from  affluent  families?Pope  and  her  colleagues  focused  on  upper-middle-class,  privileged  schools  because  it  is  in  these  communities  that  the  accepted  value  of  homework  is  deeply  and  unquestioningly  entrenched.  Here  many  students  describe  schoolwork  and  the  pressures  of  high  academic  performance  as  a  dominating  force  in  their  day.Pope  found  in  her  work  with  Challenge  Success,  a  Stanford  collaboration  formed  in  response  to  increasing  emotional  and  mental  health  issues  in  American  students,  that  homework  kept  coming  up  as  a  tension  point.There  were  parents  who  wanted  more  homework  and  others  who  wanted  less.  There  were  parents  who,  if  the  teacher  was  not  giving  homework  at  the  younger  grades,  would  buy  their  own  workbooks  and  hand  them  to  their  children.  Pope  even  heard  from  parents  lamenting  that  they  had  not  seen  their  children  over  an  entire  holiday  weekend  because  they  were  attempting  to  complete  homework  assignments."We  realized  that  we  need  intervention  around  homework,"  she  said,  and  not  just  with  high  school  students.  While  the  present  study  was  conducted  with  high  schoolers,  "we  have  the  same  data  from  the  younger  years."The  researchers  acknowledged  the  limitation  of  their  reliance  on  students'  self-reporting,  but  felt  that  it  was  important  to  explore  the  students'  firsthand  descriptions  of  their  experiences  with  excessive  homework.And  while  some  of  the  grousing  about  having  too  much  homework  and  feeling  stressed  out  may  seem  like  typical  adolescent  complaints,  this  latest  study  joins  a  growing  body  of  research  that  paints  a  disturbing  tableau  about  the  unrelenting  pressure  on  privileged  children.That  children  growing  up  in  poverty  are  at-risk  for  a  number  of  ailments  is  both  intuitive  and  well-supported  by  research.  More  difficult  to  believe  is  the  growing  consensus  that  children  on  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum,  children  raised  in  affluence,  may  also  be  at  risk.Suniya  S.  Luthar,  professor  of  psychology  at  Arizona  State  University,  dismissed  the  hesitation."When  you  say  that  poverty  is  a  risk  factor,  that  doesn't  mean  that  all  poor  kids  are  troubled,"  she  said.  "It's  exactly  the  same  for  upper-middle-class  children  of  upwardly  mobile  families.  All  we  are  saying  is  that  a  larger  proportion  of  these  children  are  at  risk,  as  compared  to  the  average  American  community."Zakaria:  U.S.  must  spend  more  on  education  for  poorer  childrenLuthar's  rigorous  (and  fascinating)  research  first  sounded  the  alarm  on  how  youth  from  upper-middle-class  communities  are  at  risk  for  a  number  of  serious  disturbances,  including  drug  and  alcohol  abuse,  depression  and  anxiety.The  reason:  an  enormous  amount  of  pressure,  including  "family  dynamics,  peer  norms,  pressures  at  schools,  and  policies  in  higher  education,"  writes  Luthar  in  a  rigorous  analysis,  "I  Can,  Therefore  I  Must:  Fragility  in  the  Upper  Middle  Classes."These  findings  have  implications  that  go  far  beyond  homework,  stress  levels  or  even  health.  They  are  also  part  of  a  larger  cultural  conversation  about  the  profound  downsides  of  our  all-work,  no-play,  winner-takes-all  society.In  the  meantime  it  is  important  to  keep  in  mind  that  the  single  most  robust  protective  factor  for  chronic  and  potentially  toxic  childhood  stress  is  social  and  family  support;  that  is,  a  responsive  relationship  with  an  adult  caregiver."Parents'  first  responsibility  is  to  the  health  of  their  child,"  Pope  says.  "Parents  need  to  be  advocates  and  cheerleaders,  not  graders  and  correctors.  And  you  certainly  don't  want  to  say  to  your  kid,  'Give  me  half  of  the  homework!'"What's  the  magic  number  when  it  comes  to  homework?"In  high  school,  nothing  over  two  hours.  In  middle  school,  no  more  than  90  minutes,"  she  replied.What  about  in  elementary  school?  "There  is  no  correlation  between  homework  and  academic  achievement  in  elementary  school."But  what  about  those  nonacademic  skills  teachers  talk  about,  like  a  sense  of  responsibility?  Doesn't  homework  in  the  early  years  teach  children  how  to  become  more  organized  and  to  meet  deadlines?  The  research  doesn't  show  that,  Pope  says."Look,  we're  not  talking  about  picketing,"  observed  Pope.  "Parents  need  to  advocate  for  their  children  with  the  tools  and  numbers  and  research  in  hand.  We're  talking  about  respectful  dialogue."</TEXT></DOC>

She  is  a  part-time  master's  student  of  creative  writing  at  Oxford  University.(CNN)  --  I  have  spent  more  than  a  decade  of  my  professional  career  on  international  television,  my  face  visible  to  millions  each  day.  Yet  I  have  spent  a  lifetime  hiding.For  years,  I  guard  a  painful  secret:  I  can't  bear  to  look  in  the  mirror.  I  shrink  from  bright  light.  A  gaze  that  lingers  a  second  too  long  makes  me  panic.  A  hot  summer  day  sends  me  into  the  shadows.I  have  fish-like  scales.  There  are  tiny  red  islands  floating  on  the  surface  of  my  skin.  They  combine  to  create  continents  with  jagged  surfaces.  They  turn  black  and  start  to  smell.  There  is  blood  and  pus.My  scalp  spits  out  silver  flakes.  My  ears  are  filled  with  crusts.  I  leave  white  specks  wherever  I  sit.  I  float  in  long,  loose  clothes.  My  hands  betray  me.  The  sores  sit  openly.  My  nails  are  dented  with  pockmarks.  I  find  strands  of  hair  on  the  sheets  and  pillowcases  every  morning.I  suffer  from  psoriasis.  It's  ravaged  my  body  since  I  was  8.  At  its  worst  my  plaques  look  like  leprosy.  I  feel  like  a  leper."Please  can  you  leave  the  pool,"  a  woman  once  told  me  when  I  was  22,  visiting  the  Dead  Sea  in  Israel,  "we're  not  comfortable  with  you  in  it."  She  is  horrified  at  my  body.  I  am  ashamed.  I  hang  my  head.The  landscape  from  my  neck  down  is  chaos.So  I  choose  to  look  away.  I  am  able  to  dress  perfectly  in  the  dark.  I  can  feel  my  way  around  a  room  or  a  closet  full  of  clothes.  I  instinctively  choose  the  dimmest  corner  of  a  restaurant  to  sit  in.  Winters  are  a  relief  only  because  I  won't  stand  out  covered  from  top  to  toe.More:  Stacy  London  on  battling  skin  shame  with  fashionMy  face  is  flawless.  Not  a  blemish.  Not  a  mark.  Compliments  are  endless.  But  I  am  acutely  aware  that  a  horror  film  unfolds  in  secret  beneath  my  clothes.  I  am  effervescent  and  radiant  on  the  outside  and  rotting  inside.  Which  is  the  real  me?The  cameras  fire  up,  the  red  light  turns  on.  I  am  splendidly  made  up.  I  lose  myself  in  the  moment.  I  am  energized.  I  am  focused.  It's  only  my  face.  It  is  floating.  It's  all  that  exists.  It  gives  me  confidence.No  one  has  it  all.  I  fight  my  body  and  myself  all  my  life.  I  hit  rock  bottom  many  times  because  of  my  disease.  It  seems  futile  to  try  anymore.  "Who  will  ever  want  me  like  this"  I  cry  hysterically  at  home.  "No  one  could  ever  touch  me."  My  mother  pulls  me  out  self-loathing  and  defeatism.  When  I  want  to  give  up,  she  will  not  let  me.She  becomes  an  expert  on  psoriasis.  She  reads  medical  journals  and  approaches  alternative  healers.  She  takes  me  for  acupuncture  and  hypnosis.  She  mixes  various  acids  in  a  lab  for  me  to  use  on  my  skin  and  soaks  me  in  a  tub  full  of  Dead  Sea  salt.  The  rest  of  the  day,  I  am  in  a  messy,  smelly  cream.  Endless  personal  research,  trial  and  error  bring  occasional  relief.Imagine  the  nightmarish  teen  years.  I  cower  from  close  friendships.  No  one  can  know  the  truth.  I  never  date.  Intimacy  is  out  of  the  question.  I  have  no  sensation  of  touch.  The  scales  are  too  thick.The  itch  is  unbearable.  I  try  and  ignore  it.  It's  impossible.  It  agitates  me.  I  use  all  my  strength  and  I  tear  at  my  skin.  I  am  violent.  I  scratch  back  and  forth  until  there  is  blood.  It  is  too  raw  to  do  any  more.  I  am  filled  with  rage  and  humiliated.So  I  disappear  in  my  head,  create  fictional  stories  and  characters.  I  play  out  entire  conversations,  lives  and  deaths,  stories  of  courage  and  cowardice  to  escape  myself.  My  mind  is  living  a  separate  life  from  the  body  beneath  it.Somehow,  my  imagination  takes  me  far.  I  am  in  my  early  20s,  and  it's  the  beginning  of  my  career.  I  am  anchoring  the  prime  time  shows  in  Kenya.  Tonight  is  a  big  opportunity.  My  game  face  is  on.I've  spent  the  afternoon  on  hair  and  makeup.  As  I  settle  into  the  anchor's  chair,  I  hear  the  faint  rustle  of  plastic  shrink  wrap.  I  have  wrapped  up  my  legs  and  torso  in  the  clingy  film  after  soaking  my  scales  in  Vaseline  so  that  the  pain  is  lessened  and  the  putrid  smell  contained.  The  director  calls  out.  The  floor  manager  cues  me.  The  lights  on,  news  copy  in  my  hands,  I  smile  and  welcome  millions  of  Kenyans  into  the  studio.The  contrast  is  sharp  --  behind  closed  doors,  I  have  given  up.  I  am  on  the  floor.  I  am  crying,  screaming  and  itching  insanely.  My  mother  cries.  I  rarely  see  her  cry.  The  last  time  was  when  my  grandfather  died.Then  an  angel  arrives.A  family  friend  approaches  mum.  "Your  daughter  looks  unwell.  She  is  losing  her  hair.  What  is  the  matter?"  My  mother,  at  her  wits  end,  tells  the  woman  the  truth.  "George,"  the  angel  says.  "Tell  her  to  go  to  George."George  is  a  small  town  in  South  Africa.  I  learn  there  is  a  clinic  that  specializes  in  treating  severe  skin  disease.  I  adamantly  refuse.  I  have  had  enough  of  doctors,  hospitals,  foul  smelling  topical  creams  and  hopes  dashed.  Mum  convinces  me.In  a  week,  I  find  myself  there  against  my  wishes.  I  withstand  the  indignity,  once  again,  of  being  naked,  the  grotesque  lesions  under  neon  light,  and  I  listen  to  the  shocked  gasps  of  the  doctors  and  nurses."We've  never  seen  it  this  bad,"  one  says  in  the  tiny  examination  room.I  glance  dully  outside  the  window  of  my  room  to  see  a  blue  lake  and  a  blue  sky  amid  green  trees  and  grass.  Postcard  perfect.  I  count  the  hours.Who  could  imagine  where  I  am?  I  am  a  celebrity  in  Nairobi,  making  it  big."What  do  you  do?"  I  am  asked."Nothing,"  I  respond  curtly  to  any  one  who  dares  make  conversation  with  me.  I  certainly  don't  want  to  start  a  conversation  about  being  on  television  or  hosting  a  radio  show  for  that  matter.  What  would  my  viewers  on  KTN  and  listeners  on  Capital  FM  Radio  think  of  me?Mind,  body  and  spirit  are  the  focus  at  this  clinic.  It  sounds  insane  to  me.  I  am  told  to  do  mediation,  deep  relaxation  and  creative  visualization  three  times  a  day.  I  lie  on  the  floor  listening  to  the  voice  in  charge."Every  day  in  every  way  I  am  getting  better  and  better.  I  have  no  desire  to  eat  the  foods  I  know  are  bad  for  me..."  I  brainwash  myself.  It  works.I  eat  yogurt  or  bran  for  breakfast,  salads  or  fish  for  lunch  and  chicken  for  dinner.  Nothing  tastes  good.  I  yearn  for  Tabasco.  I  drink  only  herbal  tea  and  torrents  of  water.I  write  a  long  letter  to  my  psoriasis,  describing  how  it  causes  me  pain,  how  it  hurts  my  relationships,  how  it  makes  me  weak.  I  blame  it  for  not  allowing  me  to  be  free.  I  blame  it  for  my  rage,  my  violence,  my  bullying  and  my  inability  to  feel  loved,  for  my  need  for  praise  and  constant  reassurance.I  berate  and  belittle  it.  I  coax  and  cajole  it.  I  remind  it  of  my  sexless  life.  I  beg  and  plead  for  it  to  go  away.  Then  I  thank  my  psoriasis.  It  has  taught  me  to  have  no  vanity,  more  compassion  and  to  withhold  judgment.I  am  crying,  emotionally  drained,  and  hot  underneath  my  long  sleeves  and  jeans.  I  take  a  shovel,  pick  a  spot  outside  and  dig  deep.  I  place  the  pages  into  the  hole.  I  plant  a  tree.  I  use  my  hands  to  touch  the  earth.  Nature  seems  surprisingly  reassuring.In  this  instance,  I  bury  my  past.  I  have  said  everything  I  needed  to  say  to  my  skin.  The  tree  will  give  life,  oxygen.  Perhaps  it  will  give  me  a  chance  to  breathe  again.A  breakthrough.It  has  been  two  weeks,  and  I  see  something  no  one  else  can  see  --  a  tiny  shift.  In  the  center  of  one  thick  plaque,  there  is  a  slight  thinning.  I  can  discern  this  little  dent  only  because  I  have  been  touching  my  skin.This  small  success  galvanizes  me  to  stick  rigidly  to  the  tough  diet  I  have  promised  to  undertake.  I  am  ecstatic,  fully  of  new  energy.  My  smile  is  real.  I  am  positive.I  return  to  Nairobi  with  a  new  mindset,  a  sense  of  control.  I  maintain  the  regimen  like  a  military  staff  sergeant.Every  28  days,  I  see  progress.  It  is  small.  But  it  is  there.  The  months  pass.  The  smell  stops.  The  centers  of  the  lesions  disappear  like  small  mountains  collapsing  on  themselves.  They  turn  from  red  to  pink  to  white.I  watch  with  fascination  the  metamorphosis  of  my  skin.  The  continents  on  my  body  move  apart  with  the  seismic  change  in  my  mind.  The  scales  no  longer  build.  Then  they  are  gone.  I  can't  believe  it.It  has  been  six  months.  I  am  clear.  I  am  in  remission.  I  have  no  scales.  I  am  normal.  I  am  finally  free.And  there  is  no  medication.  Only  food.  "Let  food  be  thy  medicine  and  medicine  be  thy  food."When  I  walk  triumphantly  into  my  dermatologist's  office,  she  is  startled.  I  healed  myself  with  the  power  of  my  mind,  I  announce.  She  is  shocked.  She  later  tells  me  she  believes  there  is  a  place  for  natural  healing  in  medicine.I  can't  say  what  will  work  for  others,  but  I  believe  that  diet,  mindset  and  a  wonderful  support  system  were  the  best  long-term  answers  for  me.  There  is  a  place  for  light  therapy  or  steroid  cream  or  biological  medication,  but  back  then  I  healed  myself  from  the  inside  out.After  my  transformation,  my  family  takes  me  to  Mombasa,  on  the  Kenyan  coast.  I  don't  dread  it  for  the  first  time  in  my  life.I  have  a  new  bikini,  dark  blue  with  a  yellow  rim.  I  have  never  worn  one.  It  is  so  soft.  It  feels  feminine.  I  have  never  felt  like  a  woman  the  way  I  do  when  I  put  it  on.  I  see  all  my  curves  in  a  different  light.  The  mirror  is  not  my  enemy  any  longer.Zain  Verjee's  psoriasis  went  into  remission  for  10  years.  She  still  battles  the  condition  today.

But  engineering  full  organs,  with  their  complicated  cell  structures,  is  much  more  difficult.Enter  3-D  printers,  which  because  of  their  precise  process  can  reproduce  the  vascular  systems  required  to  make  organs  viable.  Scientists  are  already  using  the  machines  to  print  tiny  strips  of  organ  tissue.  And  while  printing  whole  human  organs  for  surgical  transplants  is  still  years  away,  the  technology  is  rapidly  developing."The  mechanical  process  isn't  all  that  complicated.  The  tricky  part  is  the  materials,  which  are  biological  in  nature,"  said  Mike  Titsch,  editor-in-chief  of  3D  Printer  World,  which  covers  the  industry.  "It  isn't  like  3-D  printing  plastic  or  metal.  Plastic  doesn't  die  if  you  leave  it  sitting  on  an  open-air  shelf  at  room  temperature  for  too  long."The  idea  of  printing  a  human  kidney  or  liver  in  a  lab  may  seem  incomprehensible,  even  creepy.  But  to  many  scientists  in  the  field,  bioprinting  holds  great  promise.  Authentic  printed  organs  could  be  used  for  drug  or  vaccine  testing,  freeing  researchers  from  less  accurate  methods  such  as  tests  on  animals  or  on  synthetic  models.Then  there's  the  hope  that  3-D  printers  could  someday  produce  much-needed  organs  for  transplants.  Americans  are  living  longer,  and  as  we  get  deeper  into  old  age  our  organs  are  failing  more.  Some  18  people  die  in  the  United  States  each  day  waiting  in  vain  for  transplants  because  of  a  shortage  of  donated  organs  --  a  problem  that  Anthony  Atala,  director  of  the  Wake  Forest  Institute  for  Regenerative  Medicine  and  a  pioneer  in  bioprinting,  calls  "a  major  health  crisis."An  'exciting  new  area  of  medicine'Bioprinting  works  like  this:  Scientists  harvest  human  cells  from  biopsies  or  stem  cells,  then  allow  them  to  multiply  in  a  petri  dish.  The  resulting  mixture,  a  sort  of  biological  ink,  is  fed  into  a  3-D  printer,  which  is  programmed  to  arrange  different  cell  types,  along  with  other  materials,  into  a  precise  three-dimensional  shape.  Doctors  hope  that  when  placed  in  the  body,  these  3-D-printed  cells  will  integrate  with  existing  tissues.The  process  already  is  seeing  some  success.  Last  year  a  2-year-old  girl  in  Illinois,  born  without  a  trachea,  received  a  windpipe  built  with  her  own  stem  cells.  The  U.S.  government  has  funded  a  university-led  "body  on  a  chip"  project  that  prints  tissue  samples  that  mimic  the  functions  of  the  heart,  liver,  lungs  and  other  organs.  The  samples  are  placed  on  a  microchip  and  connected  with  a  blood  substitute  to  keep  the  cells  alive,  allowing  doctors  to  test  specific  treatments  and  monitor  their  effectiveness."This  is  an  exciting  new  area  of  medicine.  It  has  the  potential  for  being  a  very  important  breakthrough,"  said  Dr.  Jorge  Rakela,  a  gastroenterologist  at  the  Mayo  Clinic  in  Phoenix  and  a  member  of  the  American  Liver  Foundation's  medical  advisory  committee."Three-D  printing  allows  you  to  be  closer  to  what  is  happening  in  real  life,  where  you  have  multiple  layers  of  cells,"  he  said.  With  current  2-D  models,  "if  you  grow  more  than  one  or  two  layers,  the  cells  at  the  bottom  suffocate  from  lack  of  oxygen."To  accelerate  the  development  of  bioprinted  organs,  a  Virginia  foundation  that  supports  regenerative  medicine  research  announced  in  December  it  will  award  a  $1  million  prize  for  the  first  organization  to  print  a  fully  functioning  liver.One  early  contender  for  the  prize  is  Organovo,  a  California  start-up  that  has  been  a  leader  in  bioprinting  human  body  parts  for  commercial  purposes.  Using  cells  from  donated  tissue  or  stem  cells,  Organovo  is  developing  what  it  hopes  will  be  authentic  models  of  human  organs,  primarily  livers,  for  drug  testing.The  company  has  printed  strips  of  human  liver  tissue  in  its  labs,  although  they  are  still  very  small:  four  by  four  by  one  millimeter,  or  about  one-fourth  the  size  of  a  dime.  Each  strip  takes  about  45  minutes  to  print,  and  it  takes  another  two  days  for  the  cells  to  grow  and  mature,  said  Organovo  CEO  Keith  Murphy.  The  models  can  then  survive  for  about  40  days.Organovo  has  also  built  models  of  human  kidneys,  bone,  cartilage,  muscle,  blood  vessels  and  lung  tissue,  he  said."Basically  what  it  allows  you  to  do  is  build  tissue  the  way  you  assemble  something  with  Legos,"  Murphy  said.  "So  you  can  put  the  right  cells  in  the  right  places.  You  can't  just  pour  them  into  a  mold."Ethical  concernsNot  everyone  is  comfortable  with  this  bold  new  future  of  lab-built  body  parts,  however.A  research  director  at  Gartner  Inc.,  the  information-technology  research  and  advisory  firm,  believes  3-D  bioprinting  is  advancing  so  quickly  that  it  will  spark  a  major  ethical  debate  by  2016."Three-D  bioprinting  facilities  with  the  ability  to  print  human  organs  and  tissue  will  advance  far  faster  than  general  understanding  and  acceptance  of  the  ramifications  of  this  technology,"  Pete  Basiliere  said  in  a  recent  report."These  initiatives  are  well-intentioned,  but  raise  a  number  of  questions  that  remain  unanswered,"  Basiliere  added.  "What  happens  when  complex  'enhanced'  organs  involving  nonhuman  cells  are  made?  Who  will  control  the  ability  to  produce  them?  Who  will  ensure  the  quality  of  the  resulting  organs?"Bioprinted  organs  are  also  likely  to  be  expensive,  which  could  put  them  out  of  reach  of  all  but  the  wealthiest  patients.Murphy  said  Organovo  only  uses  human  cells  in  creating  tissues,  and  doesn't  see  any  ethical  problems  with  what  his  company  is  doing."People  used  to  worry  about  doing  research  on  cadavers  ...  and  that  dissipated  very  quickly,"  he  said.  "We  don't  think  there's  any  controversy  if  you're  producing  good  data  and  helping  people  with  health  conditions."Most  experts,  including  Wake  Forest's  Atala,  don't  think  we'll  see  complex  3-D-printed  organs,  suitable  for  transplants,  for  years  if  not  decades.  Instead,  they  believe  the  next  step  will  be  printing  strips  of  tissue,  or  patches,  that  could  be  used  to  repair  livers  and  other  damaged  organs."We  are  very  eager  to  put  pieces  of  tissue  to  work  for  surgical  transplants,"  said  Organovo's  Murphy,  who  hopes  his  company  will  be  ready  to  begin  clinical  trials  within  five  years.Of  course,  any  use  of  3-D-printed  tissue  in  surgical  procedures  would  require  approval  by  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration.  That  review  process  could  take  up  to  a  decade.By  then,  the  notion  of  a  surgeon  putting  a  3-D-printed  kidney  into  a  patient  may  not  seem  so  bizarre.  Then  again,  this  swiftly  evolving  technology  may  create  new  moral  conundrums."The  ethical  questions  are  bound  to  be  the  same  concerns  we  have  seen  in  the  past.  Many  major  medical  breakthroughs  have  suffered  moral  resistance,  from  organ  transplants  to  stem  cells,"  said  Titsch  of  3D  Printer  World."Will  only  the  rich  be  able  to  afford  it?  Are  we  playing  God?  In  the  end,  saving  lives  tends  to  trump  all  objections."</TEXT></DOC>

The  virus  is  transmitted  by  contact  with  the  fluids  of  infected  people  or  animals.Medecins  Sans  Frontieres  (MSF)  describes  Ebola  as  "one  of  the  world's  most  deadly  diseases."  It  is  rare,  but  it  creates  panic,  because  there  is  no  cure  and  it's  fatal  in  most  cases,  according  to  MSF."The  priority  is  to  isolate  suspected  cases,"  said  MSF,  which  has  set  up  two  isolation  facilities  in  the  most  affected  districts,  Gueckedou  and  Macenta,  both  in  southern  Guinea.Four  of  the  fatalities  from  the  disease  are  in  Conakry,  the  capital  city,  which  is  on  the  coast.Genetic  analysis  of  the  virus  shows  that  it  is  closely  related  to  Zaire  Ebola  virus,  which  was  reported  in  2009  in  the  Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo  (formerly  Zaire),  according  to  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention.Senegal's  Interior  Ministry  decided  to  close  its  border  with  Guinea  until  further  notice  to  prevent  the  spread  of  the  disease,  according  to  Senegal's  state  news  agency.The  World  Health  Organization  says  that,  to  date,  no  confirmed  cases  of  Ebola  have  been  found  outside  of  Guinea,  but  at  least  12  suspected  cases  are  under  investigation  in  neighboring  Liberia  and  Sierra  Leone.READ:  What  is  Ebola  and  why  does  it  kill?Joseph  Netto  and  Pierre  Meilhan  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

"In  fact,  the  associations  between  sadism  and  ...  scores  were  so  strong  that  it  might  be  said  that  online  trolls  are  prototypical  everyday  sadists."Sadism  is  a  tendency  to  take  pleasure  in  other  people's  pain  or  discomfort.The  article  was  published  last  week  in  the  journal  Personality  and  Individual  Differences.As  defined  in  the  article,  online  trolling  is  "the  practice  of  behaving  in  a  deceptive,  destructive,  or  disruptive  manner  in  a  social  setting  on  the  Internet  with  no  apparent  instrumental  purpose."So,  as  opposed  to  cyberbullying,  saying  nasty  things  during  an  argument  over  politics  or  even  making  hateful  comments  that  reflect  the  commenter's  true  feelings,  trolls  are  offensive  for  the  sheer  enjoyment  of  it.  Or,  in  Internet  parlance,  "for  the  lulz.""Trolls  operate  as  agents  of  chaos  on  the  Internet,  exploiting  'hot-button  issues'  to  make  users  appear  overly  emotional  or  foolish  in  some  manner,"  the  article  reads.  "If  an  unfortunate  person  falls  into  their  trap,  trolling  intensifies  for  further,  merciless  amusement.  This  is  why  novice  Internet  users  are  routinely  admonished,  'Do  not  feed  the  trolls!'."Survey  respondents  were  asked  about  their  Internet  behavior,  including  how  much  time  they  spend  online  and  whether  they  comment  in  places  like  YouTube  or  on  news  websites.  They  also  were  given  tests  that  measured  responses  against  psychology's  ominously  named  "Dark  Tetrad":  narcissism,  Machiavellianism,  psychopathy  and  sadistic  personality.Commenters  who  said  they  enjoy  trolling  other  users  more  than  other  options  (which  included  debating  topics  and  making  new  friends)  consistently  scored  higher  on  the  "tetrad"  and  displayed  a  tendency  to  enjoy  trolling  because  it  is  pleasurable,  the  authors  wrote.The  questions  asked  to  determine  sadistic  tendencies  included  ''I  enjoy  physically  hurting  people,"  "I  enjoy  making  jokes  at  the  expense  of  others"  and  "I  enjoy  playing  the  villain  in  games  and  torturing  other  characters."To  be  clear,  the  article  is  not  based  on  a  random  sampling  of  respondents.For  their  final  study,  researchers  gave  their  questionnaire  to  188  Canadian  psychology  students  who  got  extra  course  credit  for  completing  the  surveys  and  609  United  States  residents  who  use  a  website  that  lets  people  fill  out  surveys  for  a  small  amount  of  money.  Those  respondents  were  paid  50  cents  for  filling  out  the  questionnaire.But  it  speaks  to  a  growing  concern  about  behavior  that  has  existed,  certainly,  since  the  dawn  of  the  Internet  and  in  other  forms  for  much,  much  longer.Sites  like  YouTube  and  the  Huffington  Post  have  banned  anonymous  comments,  requiring  users  to  create  an  account  that  identifies  them  by  name,  while  others  have  taken  different  tacks  to  try  to  moderate  comment  sections."These  findings  provide  a  preliminary  glimpse  into  the  mechanism  by  which  sadism  fosters  trolling  behavior,"  the  article  says.  "Both  trolls  and  sadists  feel  sadistic  glee  at  the  distress  of  others.  Sadists  just  want  to  have  fun  ...  and  the  Internet  is  their  playground."</TEXT></DOC>

And  for  that,  nothing  worked  as  powerfully  as  time  spent  outdoors,  which  meant  that  a  quiet  corner  of  Dutchess  County,  in  upstate  New  York,  was  a  better  setting  for  her  downtime  than,  say,  the  über-social  Hamptons.elledecor.com:  9  rooms  with  awe-inspiring  views"I  love,  love,  love  being  outside,"  she  says.  "I  take  inspiration  constantly  from  things  I  see  in  nature."elledecor.com:  8  most  unique  homes  you  can  rent  on  airbnbToday  Mellen  is  the  creative  director  for  Calvin  Klein  Home;  as  such,  she  oversees  nine  different  product  categories  encompassing  everything  from  teacups  to  sofas.  Yet  she  still  trades  in  her  leather  pumps  for  Blundstone  work  boots  every  Friday  evening  before  heading  north  to  the  cottage  that  captured  her  heart.elledecor.com:  7  inspiring  bathroom  makeoversShe  remembers  the  first  time  she  saw  it:  "The  Realtor  and  I  drove  up  the  driveway—it's  really  long  and  goes  over  a  stream,  and  all  the  trees  were  weighed  down  with  snow.  It  was  so  tucked  back;  we  were  like,  'This  has  to  be  a  mistake.'  Inside,  the  owners  had  left  a  fire  going  in  the  fireplace.  I  fell  in  love  with  the  place  immediately."elledecor.com:  Here's  the  newest  surprising  'it'  color  to  decorate  withShe  also  fell  for  the  sellers  themselves,  an  older  couple  who  had  lived  in  the  house  since  it  was  first  built  as  a  fishing  cabin  in  the  1960s,  and  had  painstakingly  cared  for  it  ever  since.  "They  had  records  for  everything:  how  much  they'd  paid,  every  repair,  every  warranty.  And  all  the  tools  in  the  shed  were  meticulously  labeled:  'potato  hoe,'  'garden  hoe.'"  When  they  moved  out,  they  left  her  a  canoe,  a  lawn  mower,  and  a  sense  of  reverence  for  the  spirit  of  the  place.elledecor.com:  You  know  your  decorating  style  is  preppy  when  ..."I  told  them,  'I'll  never  touch  anything,'"  says  Mellen.  And  for  a  long  time,  she  kept  her  word.  But  Mellen's  creativity,  it  turns  out,  is  not  just  a  contemplative  or  reactive  practice.  She  creates.  Constantly.  Gradually  she  began  making  the  house  her  own,  installing  windows  in  the  back  rooms  and  painting  the  walls,  which  were  paneled  in  dark,  knotty  pine.  She  planted  a  garden  and,  because  she  longed  for  a  new  porch,  got  out  a  shovel  and  dug  the  foundation  for  it  herself,  then  used  the  rocks  she'd  unearthed  to  make  a  stone  wall.And  when  a  cherry  tree  started  encroaching  on  the  house  and  had  to  be  cut  down,  she  had  the  wood  milled  and  used  it  to  make  her  dining  room  table.  An  ash  tree,  meanwhile,  became  paneling  for  the  bathroom  walls.Finally,  two  years  ago,  she  undertook  a  major  renovation.  Even  then,  her  motivation  was  practical  as  much  as  it  was  aesthetic.  "There  was  frost  on  the  bedroom  windows  in  the  wintertime,"  she  says.  "It  wasn't  energy  efficient.  And  if  you  took  a  bath,  you  ran  out  of  hot  water."She  built  a  studio  onto  the  garage,  and  outfitted  it  with  a  potter's  wheel  and  supplies  to  paint  and  dye  fabrics.  The  kitchen,  meanwhile,  needed  a  deeper  rethinking.  "The  cabinets  had  scallop  edges,"  she  says.  "Plus  it  was  small,  and  I  love  to  cook.  I  entertain  a  lot."  Indeed,  Mellen  is  known  for  exotic  meals  inspired  by  her  frequent  travels.  "My  friends  joke  that  I  could  make  food  from  any  country  just  from  what's  in  my  pantry,"  she  says.The  influence  of  her  international  travels  is  evident  beyond  the  pantry  as  well.  All  over  the  house  are  objects  and  furnishings  Mellen  acquired  abroad,  including  rugs  from  Morocco,  copper  faucets  from  Italy,  a  set  of  nesting  tables  from  England  (made  of  elm,  "they're  incredibly  fragrant,"  she  says),  and  a  mirrored  panel  from  India.  Interspersed  throughout  are  numerous  pieces  from  the  Calvin  Klein  Home  collections,  which,  despite  the  company's  reputation  for  austere  minimalism,  blend  happily  into  the  eclectic,  rustic  mix.  "Our  furniture  is  modern,  but  not  super--hard-edged  modern,"  says  Mellen.  "The  materials  and  finishes  make  it  warm."One  of  my  philosophies  at  Calvin  Klein  is:  You  can't  really  expect  someone  to  go  out  and  buy  all  brand-new  matching  furniture,"  she  continues.  "Everyone  has  heirlooms  or  meaningful  pieces  with  journeys  and  stories  behind  them.  You  want  to  be  able  to  mix  them  with  what  is  new  and  modern."At  Mellen's  house,  that  mix  is  constantly  changing  in  small  and  subtle  ways.  "I'm  always  making  little  vignettes  out  of  things  I  find,"  she  says.  "Last  weekend,  I  found  a  dead  beetle  and  set  it  on  top  of  a  rock.  I'll  have  that  next  to  a  bird's  nest  that  blew  out  of  a  tree,  and  a  feather  that  I  found  in  the  yard."Creating  keeps  her  happy;  it  always  has.  "When  I  was  little,  I  had  a  dollhouse  I  made  myself,"  she  says.  "And  I  loved  decorating  it.  I  was  always  working  on  it.  Then  my  parents  bought  me  a  really  swanky  new  dollhouse,  and  it  wasn't  as  fun."Collecting,  building,  designing,  inventing,  and  playing  in  the  woods:  "All  the  stuff  that  kids  do,"  she  says.

Here  are  a  few  highlights:*  Meyers'  new  office  at  30  Rockefeller  Plaza  needs  a  decorator.Described  as  having  "bare  walls,  a  few  boxes,  a  fresh  legal  pad  on  the  otherwise  empty  desktop,"  the  home  base  for  his  new  "Late  Night"  program  leaves  something  to  be  desired  ...  for  now.Jerry  Seinfeld  and  Louis  C.K.  go  boating  over  coffeeMeyers  apparently  has  yet  to  move  out  of  his  "SNL"  office  and  currently  "commutes"  between  the  two.  "It's  like  having  two  families,"  he  tells  Time.  "I  feel  like  Ray  Liotta  at  the  end  of  'Goodfellas,'  with  the  helicopter  following  me."*  Meyers'  last  'SNL'  episode  ...  won't  be  before  the  beginning  of  February,  says  the  mag.  So  that  means  he's  in  for  at  least  two  episodes,  including  the  show's  January  18  return.  (His  new  "Late  Night"  gig  begins  February  24.)*  His  studio  is  still  being  built,  but  the  show's  format  is  not.  Meyers'  new  studio,  which  literally  sits  "on  top  of  the  new  'Tonight'  digs,"  is  still  getting  built.  And,  describes  the  mag,  "like  a  groom  planning  a  wedding,  he  doesn't  yet  even  know  if  he'll  have  a  DJ  or  a  band."'Sherlock'  UK  return  posts  record  ratingsBut  format-wise,  don't  look  for  him  to  reinvent  the  wheel  —  there  will  be  a  desk,  a  monologue,  celebrities,  and  the  like.  That  said  ...*  The  content  will  have  a  Meyers  spin.  Though  Meyers  and  Co.  claim  there's  still  much  to  be  decided,  it  seems  they  have  a  pretty  good  idea  of  what  they  want  already.  Producer  Mike  Shoemaker  and  Meyers,  for  example,  talk  of  booking  "more  authors,  politicians  and  explainers"  and  of  having  sketches  "with  staffers  playing  recurring  characters."*  Amy  Poehler  will  be  on  his  first  show.  Or  at  least  she  plans  to  be.  Meanwhile,  she  told  Time  of  her  former  "SNL"  colleague:  "He  enjoys  bringing  the  best  out  of  people.  Maybe  it's  his  improv  training,  but  he  really  knows  how  to  make  other  people  look  good."See  the  original  story  at  EW.com.CLICK  HERE  to  Try  2  RISK  FREE  issues  of  Entertainment  Weekly©  2011  Entertainment  Weekly  and  Time  Inc.

Not  to  mention  now,  13  years  after  her  husband  left  the  White  House,  the  prohibitive  favorite  to  be  the  next  Democratic  presidential  nominee.Also  in  the  Blair  archives,  this  note  from  a  conversation  during  the  1993-94  health  care  debate:  Hillary  Clinton,  her  friend  Blair  wrote,  wanted  to  make  sure  she  found  a  way  to  "best  preserve  her  general  memories  of  the  administration  and  of  health  care  in  particular."Why?"Revenge,"  according  to  Blair's  notes.Confidant's  papers:  Clinton  wanted  to  keep  records  for  'revenge'To  conservatives,  it's  more  proof  of  a  Clinton  machine  that  targets  its  enemies.  To  supporters,  it's  either  something  that  can  be  written  off  as  a  reaction  in  the  intense  political  heat  of  the  mid-1990s  or,  to  some,  proof  of  the  toughness  and  shrewdness  that  Democrats  will  need  to  keep  the  White  House  in  2016.Blair,  now  deceased,  was  a  Clinton  confidant  dating  back  to  Bill  Clinton's  days  as  the  governor  of  Arkansas.  I  spoke  to  her  regularly  as  then-Gov.  Clinton  prepared  for  and  then  sought  the  presidency,  and  she  was  a  close  friend  of  both  Clintons.  So  her  notes  are  worth  reading  if  your  goal  is  a  better  understanding  of  the  Clintons  and  those  roller-coaster  days.But  as  reporters  and  Republican  researchers  read  through  them  now,  their  lasting  value  and  place  depend  on  whether  there  are  discoveries  that  add  new  perspective  to  a  Hillary  Clinton  public  image  that  has  evolved  significantly  over  the  past  quarter-century.Blair  papers  offer  insight  into  Hillary  ClintonIn  1992,  when  then-Gov.  Clinton  often  sold  the  "two  for  one"  theme  as  he  promoted  his  wife's  policy  intellect,  she  was  at  times  on  the  defensive,  about  her  continued  use  of  her  maiden  name  or  her  high-profile  corporate  law  work  in  Arkansas.Who  can  forget  her,  "I  suppose  I  could  have  stayed  home  and  baked  cookies  and  had  teas"  rejoinder  when  challenged  about  her  professional  choice  in  March  1992,  while  campaigning  for  her  husband  in  Chicago.Sixteen  years  later,  she  bowed  out  of  the  Democratic  presidential  race,  making  note  of  the  18  million  votes  she  received,  and  it  was  just  a  year  and  a  few  weeks  ago  that  she  aggressively  answered  GOP  critics  in  Congress  who  believe  her  State  Department  could  have  prevented  the  deaths  of  four  Americans  in  Benghazi,  Libya.Throughout  that  evolution,  she  has  had  a  roller-coaster  ride  in  public  opinion  polls.  Several  veteran  pollsters  and  strategists  contacted  in  recent  days  were  skeptical,  despite  their  racy  quotes  and  insights,  that  the  Blair  files  would  change  public  opinion  in  any  dramatic  fashion.One  top  GOP  pollster  said  absent  a  blockbuster  revelation,  opinions  of  Clinton  and  her  political  leanings  and  character  are  "baked  in"  and  "part  of  the  complicated  mixture  of  all  the  stuff  people  know  and  think  about  her."A  longtime  Clinton  confidant  concurred,  though  in  language  mostly  not  fit  for  family  friendly  reading.  "I  do  not  see  a  lot  of  news  here,"  this  veteran  Democratic  hand  said  of  the  Blair  files.Some  of  the  chatter  in  Washington  this  past  week  focused  on  whether  all  the  talk  of  her  past  --  and  her  husband's  past  --  might  dissuade  Clinton  from  becoming  candidate  Clinton  again.But  the  longtime  Clinton  confidant  puts  his  money  on  a  candidacy.In  those  Blair  notes,  there  are  perhaps  a  few  helpful  guideposts,  including  a  conversation  with  her  friend  about  how  Clinton  adversaries  grew  so  frustrated  by  how  Bill  and  Hillary  weathered  storm  after  storm.Why  Hillary  forgave  Bill  over  Monica"This,  she  said,  is  what  drives  their  adversaries  totally  nuts,"  Blair  wrote.  "That  they  don't  bend,  do  not  appear  to  be  suffering."Hillary  Clinton's  office  declined  to  comment  on  the  materials  in  the  Blair  archives.But  perhaps  she  had  her  old  friend's  writings,  and  the  media  attention  they  are  drawing,  in  mind  Thursday.  At  an  event  focused  on  helping  women  and  girls  around  the  world,  she  turned  reflective  for  a  moment."One  of  the  best  pieces  of  advice  I've  ever  heard  is  from  Eleanor  Roosevelt  in  the  1920s,  who  said  that  women  in  politics  or  public  roles  should  grow  skin  like  a  rhinoceros,"  she  said.  "I  think  there's  some  truth  to  that."Then,  the  woman  who  spoke  to  her  friend  in  the  1990s  of  cataloging  her  enemies  and  someday  exacting  revenge  said  this:  "It's  important  to  learn  how  to  take  criticism  seriously  but  not  personally.  ...That  is  not  an  easy  task.  I  can  tell  you  that  from  many  years  of  experience  and  a  lot  of  missteps  along  the  way."Clinton  on  taking  criticism:  'Don't  get  dragged  down'Just  the  smart  thing  to  say  at  a  public  gathering,  or  another  of  the  many  evolutions  of  Hillary  Clinton?Stay  tuned.</TEXT></DOC>

Tabata.  Rock  climbing.  The  PE  class  of  today  isn't  the  same  one  you  probably  remember.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Join  @CNNHealth  on  Twitter  Friday  at  1  p.m.  ET  for  a  live  chat  about  staying  active  as  a  family  with  celebrity  trainer  and  father  David  Kirsch.  Use  #FitFamilies  to  join  in  the  conversation.(CNN)  --  It's  been  called  the  fourth  "R"  of  education:  reading,  writing,  arithmetic  and  now,  aerobics.  But  the  gym  class  of  generation  Wii  isn't  the  same  one  you  probably  remember  from  school."You  hear  sometimes  the  old  stories  ...  where  you  roll  the  ball  out  and  students  just  played  the  game,"  says  Hanna  Vaandering,  president  of  the  Oregon  Education  Association.  "That's  not  what  physical  education  is  about  today."As  they  struggle  to  keep  kids  active  in  the  midst  of  an  obesity  epidemic,  PE  teachers  are  using  technology  and  the  latest  fitness  trends  to  inspire  even  the  most  nonathletic  children  to  develop  a  lifelong  love  for  exercise."If  you  don't  have  health,  what  do  you  have?"  Vaandering  asks.  "You've  got  to  make  sure  (students)  understand  how  to  take  care  of  their  body."Fighting  an  epidemicStop  me  if  you've  heard  these  statistics  before:  Approximately  17%  of  Americans  age  2  to  19  years  old  are  obese.  Though  recent  studies  have  shown  signs  of  progress,  an  estimated  one  out  of  every  eight  preschoolers  in  the  United  States  is  still  obese,  according  to  the  CDC.  And  only  25%  of  adolescents  between  the  ages  of  12  and  15  met  the  national  fitness  recommendation  of  60  minutes  of  moderate-to-vigorous  physical  activity  daily  in  2012.PE  teachers  have  struggled  to  fight  the  effects  of  childhood  obesity  in  class,  says  Vaandering;  many  children's  motor  skills  are  not  where  they  should  be  and  cardiovascular  endurance  is  a  big  problem.And  frankly,  "the  kids  are  lazier,"  says  Rich  Muller,  a  PE  teacher  at  Dwight-Englewood  School  in  Englewood,  New  Jersey.  "They  don't  want  to  work.  They  don't  want  to  do  anything."Not  just  flag  football  anymoreIn  his  28  years  as  an  educator,  Muller  has  seen  a  significant  shift  in  the  kinds  of  activities  taught  in  gym  classes.  Just  a  decade  ago,  he  says,  the  focus  was  95%  on  team  sports.  Now  teachers  are  incorporating  golf,  rock  climbing,  bowling  and  even  ping-pong  into  their  curriculum."I'm  trying  to  find  that  environment  where  they  can  find  that  one  lifelong  activity,"  says  Matthew  Pomeroy,  a  PE  teacher  at  Merton  Intermediate  School  in  Merton,  Wisconsin.  "All  those  different  things  that  kids  can  kind  of  be  engaged  in  and  enjoy."Is  yoga  too  religious  for  schools?While  kids  in  Pomeroy's  district  tend  to  be  more  active  than  the  average  American  middle  schooler,  he  sees  another  troubling  trend:  students  who  are  spending  10  to  12  months  of  the  year  playing  only  one  sport.  While  that's  great  for  physical  fitness,  he  says,  orthopedic  surgeons  are  seeing  an  increase  in  children's  sports  injuries  related  to  such  repetitive  motions.Both  Muller  and  Pomeroy  offer  students  at  their  respective  schools  a  choice  every  day:  They  can  play  volleyball  or  do  yoga;  they  can  practice  archery  or  work  out  in  the  weight  room.  Zumba.  CrossFit.  Geocaching.  Tabata.  Spinning.  All  these  and  more  are  offered  to  encourage  students  to  move."The  participation  level  has  skyrocketed  because  they  have  more  options,"  Muller  says.  "It's  fun.  We  have  hardly  any  complaints  like  we  used  to."TechnologyIf  there's  one  thing  Pomeroy  is  pumped  about,  it's  using  technology  in  his  class.  The  self-proclaimed  Twitter  fanatic  has  reached  out  to  PE  teachers  all  over  the  world  to  bring  new  ideas  to  his  students.Pomeroy's  class  uses  iPads  to  analyze  their  archery  or  free  throw  techniques.  With  an  app  called  Coach's  Eye,  they  record  videos  of  their  shot,  then  play  it  back  while  discussing  their  form.  Pomeroy  has  also  split  his  class  into  groups  to  create  their  very  own  workout  videos  --  recording  these  at  home  is  easier  for  some  students  than  performing  live  in  front  of  their  peers,  he  says.Many  schools  provide  pedometers  and  heart  rate  monitors  for  students,  Vaandering  says.  When  she  taught  elementary  PE,  she  encouraged  her  students  to  increase  the  number  of  steps  they  took  during  every  class."You'd  see  their  little  feet  moving  while  we're  giving  instructions  because  they  want  to  get  more  steps,"  she  says  with  a  laugh.Pomeroy  has  taken  technology  even  further,  using  it  to  connect  his  students  with  others  across  the  globe.  In  one  instance  he  teamed  up  with  a  PE  teacher  in  the  United  Kingdom  to  pull  off  an  international  dance  team  competition  via  Skype.  Another  time,  his  students  gave  jump  rope  lessons  to  their  peers  abroad."Sometimes  for  phys  ed,  you  just  need  to  get  out  of  the  gym,"  Pomeroy  says.StressPerhaps  one  of  the  biggest  differences  Vaandering  sees  in  students  today  is  high  levels  of  stress.  An  overemphasis  on  standardized  tests  and  budget  cuts  has  removed  important  stress  outlets  such  as  art  class  and  PE  in  some  schools,  she  says.  A  few  districts  in  Oregon  have  even  cut  recess  for  elementary  school."That's  so  not  in  line  with  brain  research  and  what  science  tells  us  about  a  child's  learning  (process),"  Vaandering  says.  "In  reality  there  needs  to  be  a  balance  and  a  respect  for  the  whole  child."Why  kids  need  recessSome  schools  are  getting  the  message  that  stress  reduction  is  an  important  part  of  a  child's  overall  well-being.  They're  incorporating  yoga  and  meditation,  Muller  says,  while  educating  the  mind,  body  and  spirit.In  health  class  at  Dwight-Englewood,  students  are  offered  the  opportunity  to  use  apps  like  Calm.com,  which  provides  a  soothing  screen  and  sounds  in  timed  blocks  to  calm  the  mind."It's  amazing  how  much  better  you  feel  after  two  minutes,"  Muller  says.What  you  can  doParents  play  a  big  role  in  their  children's  success  at  school,  Vaandering  says,  whether  it's  in  math  class  or  gym  class."It  really  is  important  to  do  family  activities,"  she  says.  "Enjoying  each  other's  company,  going  hiking,  playing  pickleball  on  the  weekend."Pomeroy  agrees.  "You  can  make  such  a  great  connection  with  your  kids  through  physical  activity."What  does  your  family  do  to  stay  fit?

Is  it  a  sign  of  women's  insecurity  --  or  comfort  --  with  the  aging  process?</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Kelly  Wallace  is  CNN's  digital  correspondent  and  editor-at-large  covering  family,  career  and  life.  She  is  a  mom  of  two.  Read  her  other  columns  and  follow  her  reports  at  CNN  Parents  and  on  Twitter.(CNN)  --  When  it  comes  to  aging,  I  know  I  am  lucky,  at  least  so  far,  because  usually  when  I  tell  people  how  old  I  am  (47!),  they're  surprised.On  the  one  hand  they're  saying  they  don't  think  I  look  my  age,  which  could  be  considered  a  compliment.  But  on  the  other  hand,  they  are  clearly  thinking,  "Wow,  I  didn't  realize  she's  so  old.""Hey,  47  isn't  ancient!"  I  want  to  say,  but  never  do.But  who  am  I  to  criticize?  I  had  the  same  preconceptions  around  age  when  I  was  younger.Will  our  attitudes  about  aging  --  especially  the  differences  in  how  aging  men  and  women  are  viewed  --  ever  change?READ:  Selfie  named  word  of  the  year  for  2013A  new  research  project  about,  of  all  things,  the  "selfie,"  shows  we  women  may  have  a  long  way  to  go.The  project  called  Selfiecity,  backed  by  the  City  University  of  New  York,  California  Institute  of  Telecommunication  and  Information,  and  the  Andrew  W.  Mellon  Foundation,  is  exploring  the  impact  of  the  selfie  on  our  society.  Researchers  looked  at  selfies  shared  on  Instagram  in  five  major  international  cities,  Bangkok,  Berlin,  Moscow,  New  York  and  Sao  Paulo,  over  six  months.While  they  found  that  women,  on  average,  take  more  selfies  than  men,  the  situation  reverses  itself  after  age  40.READ:  Obama  selfie:  Danes  surprised  by  global  attentionMen  are  more  likely  than  women  after  hitting  the  big  4-0  to  take  and  post  selfies  on  Instagram  than  women.Ladies,  why  is  this  so?  I  am  only  half-seriously  asking  the  question  because  I  think  I  know  the  answer.  It's  the  reason  I  don't  love  taking  selfies  myself.  Who  wants  to  see  my  laugh  lines  --  that's  what  I  call  them!  --  up  close  and  personal,  or  the  big  bags  under  my  eyes?  I  know  I'm  aging  and  I'm  generally  OK  with  it,  but  why  do  I  need  a  reminder  of  it  on  my  iPhone?"Women  over  40  are  probably  more  insecure  about  how  they  look  (over  40)  than  men  are,"  said  Jenny  Dean  Schmidt,  host  of  "The  Channelmom  Show"  in  Denver,  on  Facebook.  "I'm  over  40,  so  I  know.  I'd  probably  be  snapping  away  if  I  was  22.""Obviously  guys  are  looking  better  over  40.  Or  at  least  that's  what  they  think,"  said  Lela  Davidson,  award-winning  author  of  "Blacklisted  from  the  PTA"  and  "Who  Peed  on  My  Yoga  Mat?"But  Amanda  Rodriguez,  who  hasn't  reached  the  40  milestone  just  yet,  had  another  take.  She  believes  selfies  might  be  more  about  getting  external  reassurance,  and  that  men  over  40  might  need  it  more  than  women.Selfies  "are  something  people  do  to  garner  attention  of  others,  so  people  who  desire  or  require  that  maybe  post  them  more?"  suggested  Rogriguez,  host  of  the  blog  Dude  Mom."Maybe  guys  over  40  are  having  a  mid  life  crisis  and  use  the  selfie  to  see  if  women  are  still  interested  in  them?"  said  Kelly  Glover  of  the  plus  size  blog  Big  Curvy  Love."As  for  women  dropping  back  in  the  selfie  stakes  after  40,  maybe  they've  just  grown  out  of  it  and  the  men  haven't,"  said  Glover.READ:  Michelle  Obama  'fabulous'  at  50:  Has  the  big  birthday  changed?I  have  to  admit  I  never  thought  about  it  that  way.I'm  still  thinking  one  of  the  bigger  reasons  more  men  than  women  take  selfies  is  because  women  are  less  welcoming  of  the  aging  process.  Just  consider  the  impact  it  could  have  on  all  of  us  if  we  aging  women  made  ourselves  much  more  visible  in  this  world  --  and  yes,  took  more  selfies.NBC's  "Today"  show  gathered  a  group  of  women  in  their  40s  and  above  this  week  as  part  of  a  series  called  "Love  Your  Selfie."  The  women  talked  about  the  body  parts  they  despised,  how  they  feel  invisible  in  this  world  and  how  they  don't  love  the  way  they  look  in  selfies.But  then,  as  part  of  the  shoot,  they  took  selfies  and  unbeknownst  to  them,  "Today"  showcased  their  selfies  on  a  large  billboard  in  midtown  Manhattan  directly  across  from  where  the  interview  was  taking  place.  Their  reactions  were  priceless.  They  were  first  freaked,  but  then  they  laughed  and  cheered  each  other  on.They  looked  beautiful.  Each  and  every  one  of  them.READ:  For  women  over  50:  Bikinis,  botox  and  bling?Diane  Smith,  an  Emmy  Award  winning  television  journalist,  radio  talk  show  host,  author  and  speaker,  told  me  via  e-mail  that  after  age  50  and  a  career  on  television,  she  rarely  takes  selfies."I  need  good  lighting,  hair  and  makeup  to  see  myself  the  way  I  imagine  myself,"  said  Smith,  who  co-authored  the  New  York  Times  bestseller  "Obsessed-America's  Food  Addiction  and  My  Own"  with  Mika  Brzezinski  of  MSNBC.Asked  what  it  will  take  for  women  in  their  40s,  50s  and  beyond  to  love  the  way  they  look,  she  said  that'll  happen  when  society  "stops  holding  up  women  in  their  20s  and  30s  as  the  only  ones  with  sex  appeal,  and  beauty.""I  think  we  need  to  accept  that  women  are  beautiful  at  all  ages,  and  that  the  wrinkles,  laugh  lines  etc.  that  are  on  my  face  are  telling  the  story  of  a  life  well  lived  ...  not  a  life  with  no  value  left."I  couldn't  agree  more.So  how  about  us  40  and  above  women  start  a  movement  of  sorts?  Let's  take  more  selfies  than  our  male  contemporaries  and  post  them,  embracing  the  laugh  lines,  bags  and  age  spots,  knowing  we  really  do  get  more  beautiful  with  age.Will  differences  in  how  aging  men  and  women  are  viewed  in  society  ever  change?

West  Virginia's  governor  is  asking  federal  authorities  to  do  further  studies  on  the  state's  water  after  last  month's  chemical  spill  near  Charleston.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Charleston,  West  Virginia  (CNN)  --  Is  it  really  safe?West  Virginia's  governor  is  asking  federal  authorities  to  do  further  study  on  the  possible  health  effects  caused  by  last  month's  chemical  spill  near  Charleston."It  is  critical  this  study  is  funded  and  that  work  begins  immediately,"  wrote  Gov.  Earl  Ray  Tomblin  in  a  letter  Tuesday  to  Dr.  Tom  Frieden,  director  of  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention.On  January  9,  the  chemical  --  4-methylcyclohexane  methanol,  or  MCHM  --  was  discovered  leaking  from  a  storage  tank  into  the  Elk  River  and  from  there  into  Charleston's  water  supply.  Its  licorice  smell  alerted  residents  to  the  contamination  and  led  to  a  do-not-use  order  for  300,000  West  Virginians,  some  of  whom  could  not  drink  or  bathe  in  their  water  for  more  than  a  week.It  also  underscored  that  little  is  known  about  the  health  effects  of  the  chemical,  which  is  used  to  wash  coal  prior  to  market  in  order  to  reduce  ash.The  spill  was  originally  estimated  at  about  7,500  gallons,  but  Freedom  Industries  said  late  last  month  that  about  10,000  gallons  of  chemical  had  escaped.  The  company  also  told  regulators  that  a  second  chemical  --  a  mix  of  polyglycol  ethers,  known  as  PPH  --  was  part  of  the  leak."I  am  committed  to  the  health  and  well-being  of  West  Virginians  and  believe  there  is  a  pressing  need  to  further  study  the  potential  health  effects  resulting  from  exposure  to  water  contaminated  with  crude  MCHM  and  PPH,"  Tomblin  said.An  independent  water  test  conducted  early  this  month  at  CNN's  request  found  trace  levels  of  MCHM,  both  in  untreated  river  water  and  in  tap  water  from  two  homes  in  Charleston.  The  amounts  ranged  from  less  than  0.5  parts  per  billion  to  1.6  parts  per  billion  --  well  below  the  1  part  per  million  that  the  CDC  has  said  it  considers  unlikely  to  be  associated  with  any  adverse  health  effects."We  stand  willing  to  continue  to  assist  and  will  be  discussing  with  officials  there  what  additional  toxicology  and  epidemiology  studies  may  be  needed,"  said  Laura  Bellinger,  a  CDC  spokeswoman.Dr.  Rahul  Gupta,  the  health  officer  and  executive  director  of  the  Kanawha-Charleston  and  Putnam  County  health  departments,  has  called  for  a  long-term  study  to  be  carried  out  "in  a  manner  able  to  capture  any  long-term  impact."In  the  wake  of  the  spill,  two  waves  of  patients  sought  treatment  from  private  doctors  and  10  emergency  rooms  in  a  nine-county  area  for  non-specific  symptoms  such  as  rash,  nausea,  vomiting  and  cough,  Gupta  told  CNN  on  Wednesday.The  first  peak  --  about  250  patients  --  occurred  in  the  first  three  days  after  the  spill  was  reported  on  January  9,  he  said.A  lull  ensued  during  the  several  days  of  the  do-not-use  advisory,  followed  by  a  second  peak  --  about  the  same  number  --  during  the  first  few  days  after  the  advisory  was  lifted  on  January  13,  he  said.There  is  widespread  distrust  of  the  water,  with  only  about  1%  of  the  200  people  who  attended  town  hall  meetings  in  late  January  about  the  matter  saying  they  were  drinking  it,  he  said.Gupta,  who  has  a  masters  degree  in  public  health,  acknowledged  that  his  findings  were  "non-scientific"  and  that  he  did  not  know  what  the  baseline  incidence  would  be  of  patients  appearing  at  an  ER  with  such  symptoms,  but  said  the  anecdotes  point  to  the  need  for  further  studies."Those  two  peaks  are  undeniable,"  he  said.  "Perhaps  there  is  something  going  on  here."Gupta  said  the  water  in  his  own  house  continues  to  smell  of  licorice,  and  that  he  avoids  drinking  tap  water,  though  he  would  not  be  opposed  to  doing  so.  "The  question  becomes,  is  a  pregnant  mom  going  to  drink  it?  Should  developing  brains  of  children  be  drinking  it?"The  CDC  has  expressed  similar  concerns.  "Due  to  limited  availability  of  data,  and  out  of  an  abundance  of  caution,  pregnant  women  may  wish  to  consider  an  alternative  drinking  water  source  until  the  chemical  is  at  non-detectable  levels  in  the  water  distribution  system,"  it  said  in  a  paper  dated  February  5.  "For  mothers  with  babies,  there  is  no  research  that  suggests  consuming  water  with  these  low  levels  of  MCHM  poses  any  health  risk  to  their  baby.  However,  if  you  have  any  concerns,  please  consult  your  doctor."But  the  West  Virginia  Poison  Center  said  in  a  posting  on  February  10  that  some  symptoms,  such  as  nausea  and  headaches,  may  not  indicate  that  the  chemicals  were  harmful."These  symptoms  are  not  due  to  toxic  effects  but  are  a  body's  physical  and  real  response  to  unusual  smells/tastes,"  it  said,  adding  that  the  poison  center  received  calls  from  more  than  1,900  patients  reporting  chemical  exposures  related  to  the  drinking  water  in  the  days  after  the  spill  was  reported.  "Most  reported  symptoms  included  mild  rashes  and  reddened  skin  from  dermal  exposure,  or  GI  distress  (nausea,  vomiting  and/or  diarrhea)  from  ingesting  contaminated  water.  The  symptoms  tended  to  be  mild  and  self-limiting."It  urged  that  anyone  with  continuing  symptoms  be  evaluated  for  other  medical  conditions,  and  noted  that  viral  gastroenteritis,  influenza,  the  common  cold  and  other  infections  are  all  common  at  this  time  of  year.A  spokeswoman  for  West  Virginia  America  Water  Co.  said  the  company  was  continuing  to  flush  the  system  to  get  rid  of  pockets  of  licorice  smell  that  remain.  "For  us,  it's  not  over  until  we  resolve  the  odor  issue,"  said  Maureen  Duffy.Dr.  Tanja  Popovic,  the  director  of  the  CDC's  National  Center  for  Environmental  Health,  told  reporters  on  February  5  that  repeated  testing  had  shown  the  water  to  be  acceptable  for  all  uses."What  I  can  say  is  that  with  all  the  scientific  evidence  that  we  have,  with  everything  that  numerous  people  have  worked  on  so  far,  I  can  say  that  you  can  use  your  water  however  you  like,"  Popovic  said.  "You  can  drink  it,  you  can  bathe  in  it,  you  can  use  it  how  you  like."Tomblin  said  then  that  tests  had  shown  levels  of  less  than  10  parts  per  billion  or  too  low  to  detect,  and  that  he  and  his  staff  had  been  drinking  the  water  "for  the  last  couple  of  weeks."  But  when  asked  whether  he  could  declare  it  "100%  safe,"  he  said,  "No.""The  only  thing  that  we  can  rely  upon  is  what  the  experts  tell  us,  and,  you  know,  for  all  the  tests  done  that's  who  we've  got  to  depend  upon,"  Tomblin  said.A  federal  grand  jury  is  probing  the  spill  at  Freedom  Industries,  sources  familiar  with  the  grand  jury's  activities  have  told  CNN.CNN's  Elizabeth  Cohen  and  John  Bonifield  reported  from  Charleston,  Tom  Watkins  reported  and  wrote  from  Atlanta,  Stephanie  Gallman  and  Matt  Smith  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Follow  the  "Sassy  Six"  on  Twitter  and  Facebook  as  they  train  to  race  the  Nautica  Malibu  Triathlon  with  Dr.  Sanjay  Gupta  on  September  14.(CNN)  --  I've  never  understood  how  someone  can  eat  just  one  Oreo.In  my  mind,  those  scrumptious  cookies  are  supposed  to  be  eaten  in  groups  of  six  or  eight  or  more,  and  it  would  be  a  culinary  sin  not  to  wash  them  down  with  a  large  glass  of  milk.My  name  is  Ron  Cothran,  and  I  am  a  food  addict.I  used  to  fill  up  on  stuff,  not  really  knowing  what  I  was  eating  but  just  going  through  the  motions  until  I  got  my  "fix."  Most  of  the  time  I  was  left  with  guilt,  gas  and  a  growing  stomach  to  accompany  my  gluttony.People  would  tell  me  simply  "don't  eat  that"  or  "just  don't  buy  it"  or  "leave  it  alone."  Once  in  a  while,  it  would  work.  But  most  of  the  time,  there  was  an  almost  uncontrollable  urge  to  indulge  --  I  just  had  to  have  whatever  it  was  that  I  thought  my  taste  buds  were  craving.My  name  is  Ron  Cothran,  and  I  am  a  food  addict.Is  it  possible  for  a  person  to  be  addicted  to  something  that  they  need  to  sustain  life?  Modern  science  tells  us  that  the  nicotine  in  cigarettes  can  be  as  addictive  as  heroin.  We  know  that  alcoholics  are  always  susceptible  to  their  drink  of  choice.But  what  about  food?  There's  compelling  research  to  suggest  certain  foods  affect  the  brain's  pleasure  centers  the  same  way  addictive  substances  do,  but  experts  disagree  on  whether  the  cravings  rise  to  the  level  of  addiction.Diabetes  took  my  teeth  but  not  my  lifeAfter  my  gastric  bypass  surgery,  I  had  to  eat  only  soft  foods  for  two  weeks.  During  that  time,  a  national  chain  was  advertising  its  chicken-fried  steak  sandwich.  That  was  the  last  thing  I  needed  after  what  I  had  just  put  my  body  through.  But  the  urge  was  so  strong  that  I  ended  up  going  to  the  restaurant,  ordering  the  sandwich,  and  bite  by  bite,  chewing  each  morsel,  then  spitting  it  out  back  into  the  bag.How  stupid  was  that?  I  could  have  endangered  myself  if  I  had  swallowed,  but  I  felt  I  had  to  satisfy  the  craving.My  name  is  Ron  Cothran,  and  I  am  a  food  addict.I  know  now  that  my  addiction  to  food  was  a  symptom  of  a  much  deeper  problem.  I  can't  tell  you  when  it  started,  but  food  had  become  my  confidant.  It  wouldn't  openly  condemn  me;  it  wouldn't  make  fun  of  me.  It  made  me  feel  good  (while  I  was  eating  it),  and  it  was  always  there  when  I  wanted  attention.  It  was  my  little  secret  --  my  reward  for  working  so  hard  for  everybody  else.Fit  Nation:  Too  young  not  to  runI  didn't  realize  this  about  myself  until  I  had  gone  through  my  surgery  and  was  forced  to  find  a  new  way  to  deal  with  difficult  circumstances.  I  no  longer  could  eat  to  feel  better;  I  needed  to  find  a  healthier  way  to  deal  with  life.I  chose  to  make  a  healthy  lifestyle  my  goal,  and  notable  successes  I  found  along  the  way  became  the  warm  fuzzies  I  needed  to  validate  that  I  was  a  worthy  individual.  I  believe  that  my  food  addiction  is  real.  I  have  been  "sober"  now  for  six  years  and  two  months,  and  I  feel  great.Here's  the  good  news:  As  long  as  you  have  breath,  you  have  the  ability  to  change.  It  is  not  a  battle  of  the  tongue,  but  a  battle  of  the  mind.  Yes,  I  used  weight  loss  surgery  to  start  the  process,  but  it  is  only  a  tool,  not  a  cure.  I  had  to  hit  rock  bottom  before  I  realized  that  I  have  the  ability  to  decide  each  day  how  my  life  is  going  to  go.Once  I  made  the  decision  to  live  the  second  half  of  my  life  better  than  the  first,  a  new  journey  began.  It  has  been  rough  at  times.  I  still  get  a  craving  now  and  then,  but  the  difference  is  in  how  I  respond.  I  have  let  things  into  my  life  that  have  so  much  more  value  than  the  satisfaction  of  a  chicken-fried  steak  sandwich.Nothing  tastes  as  good  as  the  feeling  of  good  health.More  from  Ron:  That  dying  patient  could  have  been  me</TEXT></DOC>

Jeffrey  Sinclair  --  once  one  of  the  U.S.  Army's  top  commanders  in  Afghanistan  and  accused  of  "sodomy  ...  by  force"  and  other  military  crimes  --  is  to  set  to  plead  guilty  Thursday  to  some  charges  but  not  the  most  serious  levied  against  him,  his  lawyer  said.Sinclair  will  plead  guilty  on  three  of  the  eight  charges  he's  facing  in  military  court,  according  to  the  office  of  lawyer  Richard  Scheff.  These  include  "wrongfully  engaging  in  ...  inappropriate  relationships"  with  three  women  soldiers  from  2009  to  2012  overseas  in  Iraq,  Afghanistan  and  Germany  as  well  as  domestically  at  Fort  Bragg,  North  Carolina,  and  Fort  Hood,  Texas.He'll  also  admit  to  having  requested  and  possessed  "pornographic  and  sexually  explicit  photographs  and  movies,"  having  "sexually  explicit  communications  with  a  female  Army  captain,  and  trying  "to  engage  in  an  inappropriate  relationship"  with  another  woman.  And  the  brigadier  general  will  plead  guilty  to  impeding  the  investigation  into  him  by  deleting  nude  photographs  and  an  e-mail  account,  his  lawyer  said.Army  general  faces  sexual  conduct,  other  chargesBut  Sinclair  will  not  admit  to  the  most  serious  accusations  against  him,  including  the  sodomy  charge  and  that  he  threatened  "to  kill  (one  of  the  soldiers)  and  her  family  if  she  told  anyone  about  their  relationship,  or  words  to  that  effect."He  is  also  charged  with  "using  his  rank  and  authority  to  coerce  and  compel"  a  woman  "subject  to  his  orders  ...  to  maintain  a  sexual  relationship  with  him  and  prevent  her  from  ending  (that)  relationship.""The  government  now  has  a  big  problem:  It  took  pathetically  weak  assault  charges  and  put  a  fancy  wrapper  around  them,"  Scheff  said.  "We  just  tore  the  wrapper  off.  The  prosecution  team  no  longer  gets  to  distract  us  with  salacious  details  about  acts  that  aren't  even  criminal  in  the  civilian  world."Yet  Sinclair  could  still  be  found  guilty  on  all  the  charges  against  him.It's  up  to  a  military  judge  to  accept  the  guilty  pleas  as  is,  though  Scheff's  office  indicates  that  they  expect  he'll  do  so.  Moreover,  the  full  trial  is  still  set  to  proceed  as  planned  with  opening  arguments  kicking  off  at  some  point  Thursday.Sinclair  was  sent  to  Fort  Bragg  from  Afghanistan  in  2012,  the  same  year  the  last  alleged  incidents  occurred  and  when  he  was  originally  charged.

I'm  a  mess."  Those  words,  said  with  all  the  English  delicacy  that  Jemma  Simmons  can  muster,  pretty  much  sums  up  what  I  believe  should  be  fans'  emotional  state  after  this  episode.  Returning  after  a  month-long  break,  Agents  of  S.H.I.E.L.D.  came  back  in  a  big  way.  From  the  beginning  (poor  Skye!)  to  the  end  (Lorelei!)  to  all  the  action  in  between,  the  hour  was  an  intense  ride  that  really  showed  the  ways  in  which  the  series  is  finally  starting  to  find  its  feet  and  take  advantage  of  its  storytelling.We  pick  up  almost  exactly  where  we  left  off  in  the  previous  episode,  with  Skye  pretty  much  close  to  death  after  getting  shot  by  Quinn  and  being  brought  into  the  S.H.I.E.L.D.  trauma  center  in  Switzerland.  The  show  isn't  holding  anything  back,  and  we're  not  taking  any  easy  roads  out  of  this,  either...because  from  the  looks  of  it,  Skye's  pretty  much  screwed  unless  someone  can  perform  a  miracle.  (Or  find  a  miracle  serum.)  The  entire  team  camps  out  in  the  waiting  room,  while  Ward  and  Fitz  continue  to  blame  themselves  for  the  situation.  May  tries  to  talk  them  out  of  their  guilt  —  it's  on  Quinn,  not  them  —  and  Coulson  is  just  upset,  leaving  angry  phone  calls  as  he  tries  to  get  in  touch  with  Director  Fury.We  basically  find  out  that  the  bullet  perforated  Skye's  stomach  and  penetrated  her  small  and  large  intestines,  and  the  only  options  are  keeping  her  on  life  support  or  taking  her  off  of  it.  This  is  where  May  finally  loses  it  and,  like  any  good  bad-ass,  she  takes  out  her  anger  by  marching  right  into  the  room  where  they're  holding  Quinn  hostage,  proceeding  to  beat  the  ever-living  crap  out  of  him.  I  admit  it  —  I  cheered.  Go  Melinda  May!It's  Coulson  and  Ward  who  get  her  to  stop,  telling  her  she  needs  to  fly  the  plane  to  Bethesda,  because  they're  going  to  try  to  save  Skye  another  way.  Coulson  wants  to  bring  Skye  to  the  doctors  that  brought  him  back  from  the  dead,  because  if  they  could  resurrect  him  from  being  impaled  by  an  Asgardian,  they  could  certainly  repair  a  simple  bullet  hole,  right?  Right.  The  drastic  measure  forces  Coulson  to  come  clean  to  FitzSimmons  about  everything  that  happened  after  the  Battle  of  New  York,  which  eventually  gets  around  to  everyone,  so  by  the  end  of  the  episode,  no  one's  really  in  the  dark  anymore  about  Tahiti.Agents  of  S.H.I.E.L.D.:  See  EW's  full  coverageBoth  Fitz  and  Simmons  are  basically  in  shock  about  the  truth  concerning  Coulson's  resurrection,  with  Simmons  claiming  that  it's  "medically  impossible."  Coulson  hands  over  his  medical  records,  clearance  level  be  damned,  and  instructs  them  to  find  out  about  what  was  used  to  save  him  so  they  can  use  that  information  to  fix  Skye.  I'm  pretty  sure  at  this  point,  Simmons  would  jump  out  of  a  plane  for  Skye,  so  it  doesn't  really  take  much  convincing.  (I  also  really  want  the  Skye/Simmons  slumber  party  now.  Someone  make  this  happen.)Ward  finds  May  piloting  The  Bus  and  asks  about  Coulson,  seeming  surprised  that  she  already  knew  what  he  was  just  finding  out.  He's  a  little  skeptical  of  the  whole  thing  —  flying  halfway  around  the  world  to  try  to  find  a  magical  miracle  cure  that  may  not  even  work  and  really,  how  does  that  make  any  sense?  May  shuts  up  him  pretty  quickly,  telling  him  "people  like  us  need  people  like  him.  So  yeah,  it  makes  sense."  (To  her  credit,  May  does  show  the  smallest  hint  of  emotion  when  Ward  tells  her  he  enjoyed  watching  her  go  after  Quinn,  but  that  may  have  been  more  satisfaction  than  anything  else.)Their  talk  is  interrupted  by  three  S.H.I.E.L.D.-issued  planes  who  are  attempting  to  descend  on  The  Bus,  because  apparently,  not  handing  over  Quinn  for  interrogation  meant  that  the  team  disobeyed  a  direct  order.  So  what's  S.H.I.E.L.D.  going  to  do?  Make  them  hand  him  over,  of  course.  Coulson's  not  happy  about  this,  and  not  just  because  it  means  that  he  now  has  to  deal  with  more  authority.  "They  scratch  my  plane,  I'm  gonna  be  pissed,"  he  tells  Ward.  (Well,  now  you  understand  why  Fury  was  so  upset  that  you  pretty  much  destroyed  his  plane  AND  the  bar...)Turns  out  that  the  S.H.I.E.L.D.  guys  that  come  aboard  to  find  Quinn  are  Agent  Garrett  (Bill  Paxton)  and  Agent  Triplett  (B.J.  Britt),  with  Garrett  being  Ward's  old  handler  and  Trip  being  the  guy  that  replaced  Ward  when  he  joined  up  with  Coulson.  It's  a  slightly  awkward  reunion  all  around,  through  less  intense  than  I  expected.  I  actually  enjoy  that  the  show  didn't  go  the  cliché  route  of  making  Paxton's  character  the  bad  guy,  and  I  thought  his  chemistry  with  Clark  Gregg  really  added  to  the  episode.Garrett  tries  to  get  Coulson  to  give  up  Quinn,  which  leads  Coulson  to  question  his  motives.  Turns  out  Garrett  wants  Quinn  because  of  personal  reasons  as  well  —  he  lost  three  of  his  own  men  to  him  —  and  he's  been  on  the  hunt  ever  since.  Trip  just  wants  to  know  how  Coulson  got  such  a  nice  plane  ("He  died,"  Ward  deadpans)  before  he  tries  to  get  Ward  to  give  up  Quinn's  location.  The  two  erupt  in  a  fight,  before  Coulson  and  Garrett  break  them  up  to  explain  they  have  come  to  a  compromise:  Garrett  gets  to  interrogate  Quinn,  as  long  as  Coulson  can  keep  him  on  the  plane.And  oh,  what  an  interrogation.  Quinn's  still  smarting  from  May's  attack,  and  Garrett  seems  to  have  done  his  training  at  The  Jack  Bauer  School  of  Intense  Torture  given  the  way  he  almost  rips  Quinn's  tongue  out  of  his  mouth.  "I  shot  Skye  because  the  Clairvoyant  told  me  to"  is  all  Quinn  gives  up  when  he's  pressed.  He  then  tells  Garrett  it  wasn't  just  luck  that  led  him  to  find  and  kill  his  men,  that  the  Clairvoyant  spoke  to  him  on  that,  too.  "You  think  it  was  just  a  roll  of  the  dice?  It  was  the  Clairvoyant.  The  Clairvoyant  sees  everything.  Except  what  happened  to  him."  After  telling  Garrett  the  truth  about  his  death,  Coulson  finally  realizes  that  this  means  what  the  Clairvoyant  really  wants  is  to  figure  out  how  Coulson  survived,  and  that  he'll  do  anything  to  find  out.Meanwhile,  Fitz  and  Simmons,  baffled  by  medical  records,  are  trying  to  figure  out  how  Coulson  is  technically  alive.  They  call  in  May,  alerting  her  to  the  fact  that  despite  what  Coulson  thinks,  he  was  never  treated  in  Bethesda.  In  fact,  not  only  is  the  facility,  including  the  doctors  and  the  operating  room,  not  a  part  of  S.H.I.E.L.D.,  none  of  it  exists  at  all.  They  tell  Coulson  about  their  findings,  and  he's  quick  to  shoot  them  down.  "This  is  S.H.I.E.L.D.,  there  are  always  secrets,"  he  argues,  still  not  believing  they  can't  find  a  way  to  save  Skye  based  on  how  he  was  saved  himself.  He  expects  May  to  talk  him  out  of  it,  but  she's  in  agreement  with  doing  whatever  needs  to  be  done,  as  long  as  they  remember  one  thing:  acknowledging  that  "if  we  do  everything  to  save  Skye,  we'll  give  the  Clairvoyant  exactly  what  he  wants."  But  guess  what,  Clairvoyant?  Family  trumps  fear.  Game  on.Fitz  and  Simmons  figure  out  that  Coulson  was  injected  with  some  sort  of  element  that  acted  as  a  miracle  drug,  called  GH325.  The  only  problem?  Simmons  has  no  idea  where  to  find  it.  But  surprise!  Fitz  does,  and  this  is  why  these  two  are  awesome,  because  they're  getting  each  other's  back  in  the  smallest  of  ways  and  it's  such  a  joy  to  watch  them  work.  Fitz  has  a  lead  from  a  contact  at  the  Triskelion,  which  allows  them  to  gain  access  into  a  bunch  of  S.H.I.E.L.D.  files.  (Spoiler  alert:  FitzSimmons  knows  how  to  use  holograms.  Coulson  and  Ward,  take  note.)They  find  a  file  detailing  a  World  War  II  bunker  called  "Guest  House,"  which  Simmons  determines  is  the  "GH"  in  the  drug.  It's  not  a  S.H.I.E.L.D.  facility,  but  they  figure  out  that  given  the  Level  10  operative  information,  Fury  has  been  there.  Gaining  further  access  looks  to  be  impossible  thanks  to  an  encrypted  file,  but  before  the  science  bros  can  lament  the  fact  that  they  don't  have  Skye  here  to  help  them  crack  it,  they  discover  that  the  encryption  is  actually  a  map.'Agents  of  S.H.I.E.L.D.'  react:  Making  'T.R.A.C.K.S.'Coulson,  Ward,  Fitz  and  Garrett  take  on  the  mission  to  go  into  the  bunker,  while  May,  Trip  and  Simmons  stay  with  Skye  on  the  plane.  The  place  seems  deserted,  but  upon  attempting  to  gain  access,  Coulson  is  asked  for  a  passcode.  He  tries  (a  little  too  nicely)  to  reason  with  the  security  men  before  Garrett  gets  antsy  and  just  take  the  easy  way  out  by  shooting  the  security  camera,  which  allows  them  to  force  their  way  inside.Thanks  to  Fitz's  lock  picking  skills  and  gadgets,  they  manage  to  find  their  way  through  the  facility,  where  they  realize  communication  with  The  Bus  has  been  cut.  Soon  after,  they're  met  by  an  attack  from  the  guards  of  the  Guest  House.  Coulson  (again!)  tries  to  reason  with  them,  but  to  no  avail,  and  the  team  takes  down  one  guard  and  injures  another.  Coulson  attempts  to  get  the  injured  guard  to  talk,  asking  him  about  the  drug,  and  the  guard  seems  to  recognize  Coulson,  which  immediately  throws  him  off.  "Do  I  know  you?"  He  asks  the  guard.  "Do  you  know  about  the  timer?"  the  guard  asks  in  return,  and  the  team  soon  realizes  that  the  place  is  rigged  to  blow.  Fortunately,  Ward  and  Garrett  have  this  covered.  They  attempt  to  disarm  the  explosives  while  Coulson  keeps  searching  for  the  drug,  finding  instead  the  operating  room  that  he  was  treated  on.  His  flashback  triggers  memories  that  lead  him  to  search  a  storage  room,  and  with  the  help  of  Fitz,  he  finds  the  elusive  GH325  in  a  locked  cabinet.  Coulson  instructs  Fitz  to  take  it  back  to  Skye,  but  he  stays  behind  to  search,  his  interest  piqued  by  a  large,  metal  door  simply  marked  "T.A.H.I.T.I."So,  apparently  there's  a  difference  between  "Tahiti"  and  "T.A.H.I.T.I."  Tahiti,  as  we  know,  is  a  slew  of  false  memories  designed  to  make  Coulson  think  that  he  went  on  a  relaxing  vacation  instead  of,  you  know,  dying.  T.A.H.I.T.I.  is  the  name  of  the  secret  facility  where  he  was  actually  revived.  Clever,  right?  (And  no,  I  have  no  idea  what  it  means,  if  it  means  anything  at  all.  I've  actually  spent  far  too  long  trying  to  be  smart  and  figure  this  out,  but  I'm  at  a  loss.  Then  again,  I  would  have  never  figured  out  S.H.I.E.L.D.  on  the  first  try,  either.)Unable  to  disarm  the  timer,  Garrett  goes  to  rescue  Coulson,  finding  him  wandering  through  the  facility  as  if  in  a  daze  and  freaking  out  about  how  they  can't  give  Skye  the  serum.  He  doesn't  explain  his  sudden  change  of  heart,  though,  and  the  team  manages  to  escape  right  before  the  Guest  House  collapses,  leaving  Garrett  to  note  that  at  least  the  Clairvoyant  won't  be  able  to  track  them  there.Back  on  The  Bus,  Trip  and  Simmons  are  having  a  bonding  moment  over  Simmons'  loyalty  to  Skye.  Their  sweet  exchange  is  interrupted,  however,  when  Skye  starts  to  take  a  turn  for  the  worse,  which  results  in  the  three  desperately  trying  to  keep  her  alive  until  Coulson  and  the  team  return.  Once  Fitz  returns  with  the  magical  serum,  they  inject  it  despite  Coulson's  warnings,  and  after  a  few  scary  moments  (seriously,  I  was  actually  starting  to  think  they  might  go  for  it),  Skye  stabilizes  and  seems  to  improve.  Instead  of  being  relieved,  Coulson  looks  upset,  which  doesn't  go  unnoticed  by  May  and  Ward.Garrett  and  Coulson  return  to  Quinn,  telling  him  that  because  Skye  lived,  they  won't  be  killing  him  —  instead,  Skye  will  testify  against  Quinn.  Garrett  also  calls  out  the  Clairvoyant  for  being  a  "no-show,"  claiming  that  maybe  Quinn  was  the  one  that  was  being  played  all  this  time,  instead  of  thinking  he  was  playing  everyone  else.  Garrett  removes  Quinn  from  The  Bus  and  hints  to  Coulson  that  he  may  be  seeing  him  soon  (we  know  that  Bill  Paxton  has  at  least  a  four  episode  arc,  so  let's  all  hear  it  for  more  Agent  Garrett!)  Personally,  I  never  would  have  thought  Paxton's  guest  appearance  would  be  so  fun,  but  I  really  enjoyed  what  he  brought  to  the  team.'Marvel's  Agents  of  S.H.I.E.L.D.'  recruits  Bill  Paxton  as  guest  starWhile  Skye  recuperates,  May  comes  to  talk  to  Coulson  to  find  out  why  he's  not  happy  about  saving  Skye's  life,  and  why  he  was  so  against  trying  to  save  her  with  the  thing  that  saved  him.  Coulson  doesn't  really  respond,  but  through  a  flashback,  we  see  what  happened  after  Coulson  entered  the  T.A.H.I.T.I.  door,  and  how  he  found  a  bunch  of  GH  serums  hooked  up  to  a  series  of  tubes,  which  were  hooked  up  to  a  chamber  also  called  "GH."  Inside  the  chamber?  A  seemingly  half  grown  man  with  guts  and  organs  lying  in  disgusting  blue  goo,  whose  identity  --  and  origins  --  remain  a  mystery.  It's  understandable  that  this  kind  of  thing  would  freak  anyone  out,  but  let's  just  think  for  a  moment  about  how  Coulson  is  remembering  how  he  was  just  dead  himself,  and  the  fact  that  he  knows  Skye  could  be  a  part  of  that,  now...well...let's  just  say  that  I  can  see  why  he  was  a  little  spooked.  But  what's  done  is  done,  and  Skye  is  alive,  and  it  also  means  that  near  death  experiences  aside,  Coulson  and  Skye  are  linked  in  a  way  that  no  one  else  will  really  understand.  This  should  prove  interesting  for  their  already  close  relationship,  and  maybe  having  shared  PTSD-like  reactions  will  help  them  to  grow  even  closer.Initially,  I  was  surprised  when  the  episode  seemed  to  end  at  least  five  minutes  ahead  of  time,  but  that  was  before  we  were  treated  to  what  could  be  considered  an  extended  tag.  In  Death  Valley,  a  woman  is  seen  crossing  the  desert,  coming  across  a  motel  with  two  newlyweds.  While  the  wife  is  inside  checking  out,  the  girl  approaches  the  husband,  at  first  seemingly  flirting  (because  obviously,  all  versions  of  flirting  involve  asking,  "is  all  of  Midgard  this  desolate?"  Unless  you're  Thor.  Then  it  involves  smashing  your  coffee  cup  on  the  floor  and  demanding  "another!")  She  compromises  the  poor  man,  persuading  him  to  give  her  a  ride  down  the  highway,  where  he  also  mentions  he'll  protect  her  at  whatever  the  cost.  Ah,  Lorelei.  Ever  the  whore.  (Nice  introduction,  right?)Next  week,  the  Asgardians  descend  on  Earth  as  we  see  more  of  Lorelei,  and  also  Jaimie  Alexander's  Lady  Sif  (check  out  that  fight  scene  preview!)  But  what  did  you  think  of  this  week's  episode?  What  are  your  theories  on  the  half-grown  man?  And  did  you  really  think  Skye  would  die?  (I  kind  of  wanted  them  to  go  there  for  shock  value.  But  it  was  still  a  good  scare.)See  the  original  story  at  EW.com.CLICK  HERE  to  Try  2  RISK  FREE  issues  of  Entertainment  Weekly©  2011  Entertainment  Weekly  and  Time  Inc.

The  second  went  into  the  gym  floor.  The  third  sped  toward  the  stands  where,  some  12  to  15  feet  away,  it  hit  two  of  a  throng  of  students  who  had  been  waiting  for  classes  to  start."The  victims  were  random,"  the  state  police  chief  said.Having  carried  out  three  search  warrants  and  conducted  at  least  60  "primary  interviews,"  Kassetas  laid  out  these  and  other  details  related  to  Tuesday  morning's  shooting  at  Berrendo  Middle  School.  But  he  didn't  disclose  everything,  including  the  preteen  shooter's  possible  motive."We  did  find  evidence  that  the  suspect  had  planned  this  event,"  Kassetas  said.  "I  can't  discuss  the  particulars  as  to  why."It's  a  question  that  many  in  Roswell,  an  eastern  New  Mexico  city  of  just  under  50,000  people,  continue  to  ask  themselves.  That,  and  what  do  they  do  next.The  day  after  a  vigil  attended  by  some  1,500  people,  state  and  local  officials  tried  to  spread  the  word  about  counseling  services  available  to  those  trying  to  make  sense  of  the  violence.Berrendo  Middle  was  closed  Wednesday,  but  it  will  reopen  Thursday.  When  it  does,  its  teachers  will  all  become  counselors,  charged  with  helping  their  students  deal  with  this  tragedy  even  if  they  are  scarred  themselves.School  district  Superintendent  Tom  Burris  said  he  told  those  teachers:  "It's  a  face  of  courage,  it's  a  face  of  love,  and  it's  a  face  of  positive  that  you  have  to  put  on  for  every  one  of  our  kids.  ...  You  are  the  leader  that  is  going  to  lead  these  kids  back  (from)  where  they've  been  in  the  last  two  days."1  student's  condition  critical,  another  is  stableTwo  students  will  not  be  among  them.They  include  13-year-old  Kendal  Sanders,  who  Gov.  Susana  Martinez  said  suffered  injuries  to  her  right  shoulder  in  the  shooting.Her  family  got  good  news  Tuesday  night  when  doctors  at  University  Medical  Center  in  Lubbock,  Texas  --  about  175  miles  east  of  the  school  --  upgraded  her  to  stable  condition.  Kendal  is  likely  to  remain  hospitalized  for  a  week  or  more,  the  governor  said.The  other  victim,  who  is  12  and  who  officials  aren't  naming  because  of  a  request  from  his  family,  suffered  injuries  to  the  side  of  his  face  and  neck,  Martinez  said.  This  boy  has  undergone  at  least  two  surgeries  since  the  incident."He  is  in  worse  condition  than  Kendal,"  the  governor  said  Wednesday  afternoon,  "and  is  still  listed  in  critical  condition."As  they  recover  in  the  west  Texas  hospital,  Martinez  urged  people  to  keep  praying  for  them  and  others  affected  by  the  violence."We  want  to  be  able  to  welcome  them  home,"  the  governor  said.  "We  don't  want  ...  the  extreme  tragedy  of  losing  either  one  of  them."Police:  Suspect  took  parents'  gunAnother  student,  of  course,  who  will  be  missing  is  the  suspect.He  is  being  held  at  an  unspecified  location  in  Albuquerque,  Kassetas  said.  He  has  met  with  his  parents,  who  Kassetas  said  he  believes  are  cooperating  with  authorities.As  a  juvenile,  officials  have  not  named  him,  although  that  may  change  depending  on  whether  he  is  charged  as  an  adult.  As  of  Wednesday,  no  charges  had  been  filed  against  him  yet,  something  Kassetas  attributed  in  part  to  the  "complex"  nature  of  the  case.Kassetas  did  say  the  shotgun  came  from  the  suspect's  home,  and  belonged  to  one  of  his  parents.Authorities  believe  the  12-year-old  "modified  the  weapon  by  cutting  off  the  stock,"  Kassetas  said.Three  search  warrants  have  been  executed  in  connection  with  the  investigation:  on  the  suspect's  locker,  his  duffel  bag  and  his  Roswell  home.Those  searches  unearthed  evidence  that  the  attack  was  planned,  though  Kassetas  didn't  explain  how.Kassetas  said  there's  no  indication  the  shooter  had  any  other  weapons;  he  came  to  school  with  the  three  rounds  that  he  ended  up  firing.But  just  before  he  fired,  authorities  believe  the  suspect  gave  "preliminary  warnings  ...  to  some  select  students  who  he  ran  into  before  he  entered  the  gymnasium,"  Kassetas  said.'Hero'  teacherTeacher  John  Masterson  didn't  know  the  shooter  had  used  up  all  his  ammunition  when  he  walked  to  the  student  and  persuaded  him  to  put  the  gun  down,  Martinez  said."Mr.  Masterson  ...  was  a  hero  ...  who  stood  there  and  allowed  a  gun  to  be  pointed  right  at  him,"  the  governor  said  at  a  vigil  Tuesday  evening,  "and  to  talk  down  that  young  boy  to  drop  the  gun  so  that  there  would  be  no  more  young  kids  hurt."The  Berrendo  staff  directory  lists  John  Masterson  as  an  eighth-grade  social  studies  teacher.Masterson  has  taught  at  the  school  for  a  decade,  and  also  coaches  track  and  soccer,  according  to  the  Albuquerque  Journal.When  contacted  by  the  newspaper,  he  said  police  told  him  not  to  discuss  details  of  the  shooting."It  was  a  harrowing  experience,"  he  told  the  paper.  "All  I  can  say  was  the  staff  there  did  a  great  job."Teachers  train  to  face  school  shooter'These  are  our  kids'The  attack  understandably  has  rattled  residents  of  Roswell,  a  city  about  200  miles  southeast  of  Albuquerque.  It  becomes  the  latest  community  in  the  United  States  --  joining  places  like  Littleton,  Colorado,  and  Paducah,  Kentucky,  and  Newtown,  Connecticut  --  to  go  from  a  relatively  peaceful  enclave  to  a  site  of  a  horrific  school  shooting.Burris,  the  Roswell  superintendent,  said  he  and  other  school  officials  have  received  tremendous  support,  including  offers  from  one  unspecified  Colorado  school  that  "has  been  involved  in  things  like  this."He  said  members  of  the  New  Mexico  community  are  rallying  around  each  other,  with  a  focus  on  not  just  the  two  injured  students  but  also  the  shooter."These  are  our  kids,"  Burris  said.  "They  don't  stop  being  our  kids  because  they  are  injured  or  they  are  incarcerated."For  now,  officials  acknowledge  that  students  are  far  from  over  the  hump.Martinez  recalled  talking  to  one  middle  schooler  who  was  in  the  gym  that  morning,  who  told  her,  "I'm  trying  to  shove  it  down,  I'm  trying  to  push  it  down."Monique  Salcido,  13,  said  she  is  "in  shock."  She  was  in  the  gym,  and  she  saw  two  of  her  friends  get  hit.She  told  CNN's  Piers  Morgan  on  Tuesday  night  that  she  doesn't  want  to  go  back.Said  Monique:  "I  don't  want  to  go  to  Berrendo  again  because  I'm  afraid  it's  going  to  happen  again."CNN's  Lateef  Mungin,  Chuck  Johnston  and  Vanessa  Juarez  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

"This  is  my  friend."Cuomo  asked  Rodman  whether  he  was  planning  to  ask  North  Korean  leaders  about  Kenneth  Bae,  a  U.S.  citizen  who  was  arrested  in  November  2012,  convicted  last  spring  by  North  Korea  of  "hostile  acts"  intended  to  topple  the  government  and  sentenced  to  15  years  in  a  labor  camp.In  response,  Rodman  suggested  the  Korean-American  had  done  something  wrong,  but  did  not  specify  what.Kenneth  Bae's  mother  tells  of  heartbreak"Do  you  understand  what  he  did  in  this  country?"  Rodman  asked  Cuomo.  "No,  no,  no,  you  tell  me,  you  tell  me.  Why  is  he  held  captive  here  in  this  country,  why?  ...  I  would  love  to  speak  on  this."You  know,  you've  got  10  guys  here,  10  guys  here,  that  have  left  their  families,  they've  left  their  damn  families,  to  help  this  country  in  a  sports  venture.  That's  10  guys,  all  these  guys  here,  do  anyone  understand  that?""We  do,"  responded  Cuomo.  "And  we  appreciate  that  and  we  wish  them  well  with  cultural  exchange.""No,  no,  no,  no,"  Rodman  continued.  "I  don't  give  a  rat's  ass  what  the  hell  you  think.  I'm  saying  to  you,  look  at  these  guys  here,  look  at  them  ...  they  dared  to  do  one  thing,  they  came  here."Bae,  a  married  father  of  three,  has  reportedly  suffered  a  series  of  health  problems  during  his  detention.His  mother,  Myunghee  Bae,  who  visited  in  October,  told  CNN  that  her  son  was  a  devout  Christian  who  had  not  understood  the  system  in  North  Korea.  North  Korea  is  officially  an  atheist  state.The  White  House  reactsIn  Washington,  White  House  spokesman  Jay  Carney  noted  that  Rodman  is  on  a  private  trip  and  that  the  United  States  has  called  for  North  Korea  to  release  Bae.  "Our  views  about  Kenneth  Bae  have  not  changed,"  he  said."I  did  not  see  some  of  the  comments  that  Mr.  Rodman  made,  but  I  am  not  going  to  dignify  that  outburst  with  a  response,"  Carney  added.  "I  am  simply  going  to  say  that  we  remain  gravely  concerned  about  Kenneth  Bae's  health  and  continue  to  urge  the  DPRK  authorities  to  grant  his  amnesty  and  immediate  release  on  humanitarian  grounds."Bae  from  North  Korean  prison:  Please  help  meBill  Richardson,  former  governor  of  New  Mexico  and  former  U.S.  ambassador  to  the  United  Nations,  told  CNN  he  was  "disappointed"  by  Rodman's  performance."I  think  Dennis  Rodman  crossed  a  line  this  morning  by  implying  that  Kenneth  Bae  might  be  guilty,  by  suggesting  that  there  was  a  crime,"  the  politician  said.  "There  is  no  crime.  Kenneth  Bae  is  an  American  detainee  that's  been  there  a  year  in  bad  health,  who  deserves  to  come  home."He  said  Rodman  "drank  a  little  bit  too  much  of  the  Kool-Aid  from  the  North  Koreans."After  Rodman's  outburst,  fellow  player  Charles  D.  Smith  tried  to  calm  the  discussion,  but  Rodman  carried  on."You're  the  guy  behind  the  mic  right  now,"  he  told  Cuomo.  "We're  the  guys  here  doing  one  thing.  We  have  to  go  back  to  America  and  take  the  abuse.  Do  you  have  to  take  the  abuse?  Well,  we're  going  to  take  it."Rodman  predicted  his  efforts  and  those  of  his  fellow  athletes  would  "open  the  door"  for  other  people  to  visit  the  country.Smith  pointed  out  that  the  group  comprised  not  only  ex-players,  but  some  40  other  people,  including  a  number  of  other  Americans.'He's  got  a  great  heart'Smith  defended  Rodman,  saying  the  players'  visit  was  about  basketball,  not  politics.  "We  just  hope  the  results  are  positive,  and  we  think  that  they'll  be  positive,"  he  said,  noting  that  the  Americans  had  interacted  earlier  in  the  day  with  their  North  Korean  counterparts,  talking  through  an  interpreter.North  Korea  had  invited  the  American  players  as  a  kind  of  "cultural  exchange"  and  to  "put  smiles  on  people's  faces,"  not  to  influence  the  country's  leaders,  Smith  said."We  are  here  because  it's  about  doing  great  will  around  the  world,"  he  said.Smith  outlined  the  charity  projects  he  has  been  involved  in  worldwide  through  his  sport,  including  visiting  typhoon  victims  in  Asia."We're  doing  what  we  do,  we  play  basketball  and  that's  what  we  love  to  do,"  Smith  said."We  did  not  know  that  it  was  going  to  take  this  type  of  a  negative  spin  on  what  we  were  doing  because  we're  not  politicians,  we're  not  ambassadors.  We're  here  to  do  what  we've  been  doing  most  of  our  lives."Smith  apologized  for  "the  storm  that  has  been  created  by  our  presence."  But,  he  added,  "We're  not  apologizing  for  doing  what  we  do  ...  we're  connecting  people  to  basketball  and  people  to  people."He  cautioned  against  "playing  semantics"  when  discussing  Rodman's  use  of  the  word  "friend"  in  describing  his  relationship  with  Kim."It's  an  associate,"  he  said.  "You  met  someone  once,  and  it's  your  friend  ...  you  can't  meet  someone  once  or  twice  and  take  that  enduring  step."Smith  added  that  the  players  were  interested  only  in  using  basketball  as  a  bridge  to  cultural  exchange.  "None  of  these  guys  are  here  to  talk  any  sense  into  any  politician,"  he  said.Darren  Prince,  Rodman's  agent  for  16  years,  told  CNN  on  Sunday  that  Kenny  Anderson,  Cliff  Robinson,  Vin  Baker,  Craig  Hodges,  Doug  Christie  and  Smith  would  play  against  the  North  Korean  senior  national  team.The  trip  is  Rodman's  fourth  to  the  isolated  nation,  part  of  a  project  he  has  described  as  "basketball  diplomacy."But  the  U.S.  State  Department  has  said  that  attention  should  be  focused  on  the  brutality  of  Kim's  regime.The  NBA  distanced  itself  Tuesday  from  Rodman."The  NBA  is  not  involved  with  Mr.  Rodman's  North  Korea  trip  and  would  not  participate  or  support  such  a  venture  without  the  approval  of  the  U.S.  State  Department,"  NBA  Commissioner  David  Stern  said  in  a  statement  released  by  the  league."Although  sports  in  many  instances  can  be  helpful  in  bridging  cultural  divides,  this  is  not  one  of  them."'Friend  for  life'Rodman,  52,  struck  up  a  friendship  with  Kim  last  February,  when  he  first  traveled  to  North  Korea  with  a  team  of  Harlem  Globetrotters  for  an  exhibition  game  that  was  watched  by  Kim,  who  is  a  basketball  fan.Kim  met  and  dined  with  the  flamboyant  athlete,  and  Rodman  --  unswayed  by  international  condemnation  of  the  country's  human  rights  record  --  told  his  host  he  had  "a  friend  for  life."However,  on  his  last  trip  --  which  took  place  last  month  --  less  than  a  week  after  North  Korea  announced  the  execution  of  Kim's  uncle  and  top  aide,  Jang  Song  Thaek  --  the  two  men  did  not  meet.The  international  outcry  over  the  killing  of  Jang  has  prompted  Paddy  Power,  the  online  betting  company  that  had  supported  Rodman's  project,  to  withdraw  its  association  with  the  event.But  Rodman  has  pressed  on  with  the  plan.  Last  month,  on  his  previous  trip,  he  met  and  coached  the  North  Korean  team.Rodman,  NBA  old-timers  arrive  in  North  KoreaNorth  Korea:  Reality  vs.  the  world  according  to  RodmanCNN's  Jethro  Mullen  contributed  to  this  report</TEXT></DOC>

She  was  floored  when  she  learned  she  had  heart  disease.  Now  after  a  successful  surgery,  she's  spreading  the  word  about  how  to  prevent  our  No.  1  health  killer.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Star  Jones,  a  lawyer  by  trade,  has  worked  as  a  commentator  and  host  on  numerous  television  shows,  most  notably  as  co-host  of  ABC's  "The  View"  from  1997  to  2006.  The  best-selling  author  underwent  open-heart  surgery  after  being  diagnosed  with  heart  disease  four  years  ago.  Today,  Jones  is  a  National  Volunteer  with  The  American  Heart  Association  and  has  received  numerous  awards  and  recognition  for  her  work  as  a  heart-health  advocate.(CNN)  --  As  I  sat  in  Dr.  Valentin  Fuster's  exam  room  at  Mount  Sinai  Hospital  in  Manhattan,  only  one  word  raced  through  my  mind:  "Whoa!"  That  was  it.  I  was  floored.  I  really  couldn't  understand  why  this  was  happening  to  me  --  and  now.I  had  beaten  obesity  and,  for  the  first  time  in  my  life,  I  was  hitting  the  gym  regularly  and  practicing  portion  control  in  my  diet.  I'd  taken  up  tennis  and,  in  fact,  was  actually  pretty  decent.  This  is  me  we're  talking  about  --someone  who'd  never  run  for,  hit  or  even  caught  a  ball  until  I  was  42.Even  though  I  felt  and  looked  great,  I  was  experiencing  what  I  now  know  are  the  classic  symptoms  of  heart  disease:  frequent  intense  heart  palpitations,  light-headedness,  shortness  of  breath  and  extreme  fatigue.But  I  always  thought  that  heart  disease  was  an  old  white  dude's  disease.  That's  what  I'd  seen  on  television  anyway.  It  didn't  happen  to  newly  skinny  black  women  who  had  it  going  on.  Or,  at  least  thought  they  had  it  going  on.I  couldn't  have  been  more  wrong.  I  was  about  to  be  the  face  of  heart  disease.When  my  doctors  told  me  they  were  going  to  crack  my  chest  open  and  take  my  heart  out  of  my  body  to  repair  my  aortic  valve  and  remove  a  subaortic  membrane  to  stave  off  future  heart  issues,  it  scared  the  crap  out  of  me!  I  sincerely  considered  not  having  the  surgery.But  I  knew  I  needed  to  be  strong.  So,  I  got  focused.  I  became  determined.  And  yes,  at  times,  I  was  terrified.Anyone  who  goes  through  cardiac  surgery  and  tells  you  they  weren't  scared  is  lying.  We're  all  human.Fortunately,  the  skill  level  of  my  physicians  and  the  resources  that  were  available  to  me  left  me  encouraged  by  the  prognosis  for  recovery.  Amazingly,  even  though  the  doctors  stopped  my  heart  for  22  minutes  on  the  operating  table,  I  made  it  through  open-heart  surgery  without  any  complications.As  part  of  my  recovery,  I  elected  to  do  cardiac  rehab.  That  was  the  second-best  decision  of  my  life.  Three  months  of  pushing  myself  to  the  limit  with  steadfast  determination  to  recover  fully  was  my  goal.  The  discipline  necessary  to  strengthen  your  heart  after  surgery  is  relentless  and  exhausting  but  so  worth  it.I  was  lucky.  No,  more  like  blessed.  I  came  through  heart  disease,  and  today  I'm  a  survivor.With  my  recovery,  I  realized  I  had  an  obligation  that  reached  beyond  my  own  health.  I  made  a  commitment  to  use  whatever  platform  I  have  in  the  public  eye  to  raise  awareness  of  heart  disease  in  women.According  to  the  American  Heart  Association  and  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention,  heart  disease  is  the  No.  1  killer  of  all  Americans.  It's  the  No.  1  killer  of  African-Americans,  and  it's  the  No.  1  killer  of  women.  So,  you  see,  heart  disease  for  me  is  personal  --  very  personal.For  three  years,  I've  served  as  the  National  Volunteer  for  the  AHA  and  a  volunteer  spokeswoman  for  their  Go  Red  For  Women  movement.The  movement  aims  to  dispel  myths  surrounding  heart  disease  and  raise  awareness.  It's  a  passionate,  emotional  and  social  initiative  designed  to  empower  women  to  take  charge  of  their  heart  health.  The  goal  is  to  harness  the  energy,  passion  and  power  women  have  to  band  together  and,  collectively,  wipe  out  our  No.  1  killer.With  National  Wear  Red  Day  coming  up  this  Friday,  I'm  reminded  that  bringing  awareness  to  heart  disease  isn't  about  just  wearing  red  one  day  a  year.  It's  a  lifestyle.  It's  about  sharing  your  story  and  empowering  each  other  to  make  heart  health  a  priority  starting  now.I'm  thankful  for  the  voice  I  have  when  it  comes  to  fighting  this  preventable  disease.  I've  made  it  my  mission  to  do  what  I  know  how  to  do  --  talk  --  to  anyone  who'll  listen  to  my  story.  And,  believe  me,  I've  been  coast  to  coast  sharing  my  story  and  educating  others  along  the  way.Today,  I'm  living  my  best  life  in  great  health.  I'm  so  proud  I've  spent  the  past  10  years  getting  myself  in  the  best  physical  and  emotional  shape  I  could  be  in.I  learned  late  in  life  that  my  health  is  my  greatest  asset  and  encouraging  healthy  living  is  my  purpose  in  life.  For  she  who  has  health  has  hope,  and  she  who  has  hope  has  everything.</TEXT></DOC>

Some  music-industry  heavyweights  are  betting  the  answer  is  "yes."</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Is  there  room  for  one  more  music-streaming  service  on  the  Web?  Some  music-industry  heavyweights  are  betting  the  answer  is  "yes."Beats  Music,  an  offshoot  of  the  uber-successful  headphone  company  Beats  Electronics,  launched  on  Tuesday  with  a  focus  on  mobile.  It's  available  for  Apple's  iPhone  and  iPods,  Android  devices  and  Windows  phones.  A  specialized  iPad  version  is  in  the  works.It  enters  a  crowded  landscape  populated  with  the  likes  of  Pandora  and  Spotify,  Rhapsody  and  Rdio  and  numerous  other  competitors.  The  difference,  according  to  its  creators,  will  be  Beats'  human  touch."No  one  was  doing  a  music  service;  everyone  was  building  a  music  server,"  Beats  Music  chief  executive  Ian  Rogers  told  WIRED,  a  CNN  content  partner.While  other  streaming  platforms  will  have  bigger  music  catalogues,  Beats  is  banking  on  its  more  robust  suggestion  engine  --  or,  as  a  blog  post  Tuesday  said,  "bringing  you  the  right  song  for  right  now."Like  other  music  services,  Beats  will  use  a  computer  algorithm  to  help  suggest  new  music  for  you  based  on  what  you've  already  listened  to.

"He  did  some  paraphrasing  there."The  "Duck  Dynasty"  patriarch  paraphrased  a  verse  from  Corinthians  and  said,  "Don't  be  deceived.  Neither  the  adulterers,  the  idolaters,  the  male  prostitutes,  the  homosexual  offenders,  the  greedy,  the  drunkards,  the  slanderers,  the  swindlers  --  they  won't  inherit  the  kingdom  of  God.  Don't  deceive  yourself.  It's  not  right."The  younger  Robertson  told  CNN,  "I  believe  what  the  Bible  says.""You  have  to  read  the  Bible  and  make  up  your  own  mind,"  he  said.  "You  have  to  decide,  and  God  will  ultimately  decide  then.  We  don't  profess  to  be  God,  and  we  certainly  don't  profess  to  be  perfect.  Because  we  have  our  own  sins  that  we  deal  with.""Anybody  who  knows  (Phil)  ...  any  gay,  straight,  black,  white,  anybody  who  knows  Phil  knows  that  he  is  about  love  and  his  message  is  about  God's  love,  God's  grace  and  his  forgiveness,  ultimately,"  Korie  Robertson  added.The  couple  appear  in  the  new  film  "God's  Not  Dead,"  which,  according  to  Entertainment  Weekly,  was  a  surprise  hit  with  its  recent  opening  weekend.  It  earned  $8.6  million  in  only  780  theaters.The  Robertson  family  is  halfway  through  filming  season  6  of  the  show,  which  has  brought  in  millions  beyond  the  success  of  its  duck  call  business.But  "Duck  Dynasty"  ratings  have  slipped  since  the  controversy.  And  if  it  all  ended  tomorrow,  both  the  fame  and  the  TV  show,  the  couple  says,  the  family  would  be  just  fine."We  were  able  to  use  that  platform  to  get  out  God's  message,  and  if  it  ended  right  there,  it  ended  right  there,"  Willie  Robertson  said.  "I  felt  like  that  was  pretty  much  what  God  prepared  us  to  do."</TEXT></DOC>

Jolly  will  fill  out  the  term  of  his  former  boss,  Republican  Rep.  Bill  Young,  who  died  in  October.  Young,  first  elected  to  Congress  in  1970,  was  the  longest-serving  Republican  in  the  House.With  national  Republicans  framing  the  race  as  a  referendum  on  Obamacare  and  a  massive  infusion  of  outside  ad  money  to  try  to  influence  the  outcome,  pundits  have  looked  to  the  Florida  race  as  a  bellwether  for  November's  midterm  elections.Special  coverage:  2014  midterm  electionsBut  Jolly  didn't  mention  the  health  care  law  in  his  victory  speech  and  instead  said,  "This  race  is  not  about  defending  a  broken  agenda  in  Washington  or  advancing  a  broken  agenda  in  Washington.  This  race  is  about  defending  Pinellas  County  and  serving  the  people  right  here  in  our  own  community."Sink,  the  state's  former  chief  financial  officer  who  narrowly  lost  the  2010  gubernatorial  election,  said  in  a  concession  statement,  "While  tonight  was  not  the  result  we  were  hoping  for,  I  am  proud  of  the  race  we  have  run  and  so  grateful  for  the  countless  Pinellas  residents,  volunteers  and  supporters  who  put  their  faith  in  our  campaign."Swing  district  in  swing  stateJolly  won  48.5%  of  the  vote,  and  Sink  got  just  under  47%.  Libertarian  candidate  Lucas  Overby  was  a  distant  third,  with  just  under  5%  of  the  ballots  cast.With  Jolly's  win  keeping  the  House  seat  in  GOP  hands,  the  Democrats  still  need  win  17  seats  in  November  to  regain  control  of  the  chamber.  Political  handicappers  say  that's  a  tall  order,  considering  the  shrinking  number  of  competitive  congressional  districts  nationwide.Eight  things  to  watch  between  now  and  Election  DayFlorida-13,  a  swing  district  in  a  swing  state,  covers  most  of  Pinellas  County  between  Tampa  Bay  and  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  including  parts  of  St.  Petersburg.While  Young  captured  58%  of  the  vote  in  his  2012  re-election,  President  Barack  Obama  narrowly  carried  the  district  in  his  2008  and  2012  victories.Attacking  Obamacare  the  right  prescription  for  GOP?While  the  candidates  said  local  issues  mattered  heavily,  national  Republicans  were  quick  to  proclaim  Obamacare  the  biggest  loser."Tonight,  one  of  (House  Democratic  Leader)  Nancy  Pelosi's  most  prized  candidates  was  ultimately  brought  down  because  of  her  unwavering  support  for  Obamacare,  and  that  should  be  a  loud  warning  for  other  Democrats  running  coast  to  coast,"  proclaimed  Rep.  Greg  Walden  of  Oregon,  the  chairman  of  the  National  Republican  Congressional  Committee,  said  in  a  statement."His  (Jolly's)  victory  shows  that  voters  are  looking  for  representatives  who  will  fight  to  end  the  disaster  of  Obamacare,"  added  Republican  National  Committee  Chairman  Reince  Priebus  and  Co-chair  Sharon  Day  in  an  e-mail  blast  to  reporters.CNN  Poll:  Support  for  Obamacare  slightly  edges  upThe  Democratic  National  Committee  claimed  the  issue  of  health  care  actually  kept  the  contest  close."Republicans  fell  short  of  their  normal  margin  in  this  district  because  the  agenda  they  are  offering  voters  has  a  singular  focus  --  that  a  majority  of  voters  oppose  --  repealing  the  Affordable  Care  Act  that  would  return  us  to  the  same  old  broken  health  care  system,"  said  Rep.  Debbie  Wasserman  Schultz  of  Florida,  the  DNC  chair.Tons  of  outside  advertising  money  was  poured  into  the  race,  and  many  of  the  ads  attacking  Sink  focused  on  health  care."Canceled  health  plans.  Higher  premiums.  Medicare  cuts.  People  losing  their  doctors.  A  disaster  for  families  and  seniors.  For  Alex  Sink,  the  priority  is  Obamacare.  Not  us,"  said  the  narrator  in  a  TV  commercial  by  the  Chamber  of  Commerce,  which  backed  Jolly.That  was  a  potent  message  in  a  district  that's  one  of  the  grayest  in  the  nation.  Nearly  a  quarter  of  all  residents  in  Florida  13  are  65  or  older.Jolly  said  he  was  committed  to  getting  rid  of  Obamacare  entirely.  Sink  acknowledged  that  Obamacare  was  a  major  issue.  While  she  highlighted  how  the  Affordable  Care  Act  has  helped  people,  she  also  noted  the  law  has  flaws  and  said  she  was  open  to  GOP  proposals  to  amend  some  of  the  measure's  requirements.Democrats  look  to  NovemberSink  was  the  candidate  national  Democrats  wanted  in  this  race,  and  she  faced  nominal  opposition  in  January's  primary.  Jolly  was  far  from  the  GOP's  dream  candidate  and  had  to  battle  to  win  the  party's  nomination.  Democrats  jumped  on  his  work  as  a  lobbyist  who  worked  for  groups  pushing  to  privatize  Social  Security  after  he  had  left  Young's  staff.National  Democrats,  who  began  to  try  to  lower  expectations  a  few  days  before  the  election,  said  they'll  make  another  run  at  the  district  in  November."Democrats  will  fight  for  Florida-13  in  the  midterm,  when  the  electorate  is  far  less  heavily  tilted  toward  Republicans,"  said  Rep.  Steve  Israel  of  New  York,  chairman  of  the  Democratic  Congressional  Campaign  Committee.Outside  moneySince  it's  one  of  a  dwindling  number  of  competitive  districts  and  the  only  game  in  town,  outside  money  poured  into  the  race,  which  was  the  most  expensive  contest  so  far  this  cycle,  topping  even  last  year's  special  U.S.  Senate  election  in  Massachusetts.In  addition  to  the  approximate  $2.5  million  spent  by  the  two  campaigns,  the  party  committees  and  outside  groups  dished  out  more  than  $9  million  to  run  TV  and  radio  ads,  other  paid  media  and  direct  mail,  according  to  the  Center  for  Responsive  Politics,  which  monitors  outside  spending.The  pro-Republican  group  American  Crossroads,  which  said  it  spend  $500,000  on  the  contest,  said  that  Florida-13  was  just  an  appetizer"A  lot  of  us  rolled  up  our  sleeves  after  2012,  studied  the  Obama  playbook  and  invested  in  targeted  voter  turnout  and  more  effective  messaging.  The  Florida  CD-13  special  was  an  important  test  market,  and  there  was  unprecedented  cooperation  among  outside  groups.  We  intend  to  keep  refining  these  lessons  as  we  prepare  for  the  fall  elections,"  said  Crossroads  CEO  Stephen  Law.While  a  contest  this  far  out  from  Election  Day  rarely  provides  a  preview  of  what  will  actually  happen  in  November,  Jolly's  victory  will  give  the  GOP  bragging  rights."Regardless  of  whether  or  not  the  election  will  tell  us  anything  about  November,  the  two  political  parties  will  learn  lessons  from  this  contest  and  apply  them  to  future  races,"  said  Stuart  Rothenberg,  editor  of  the  nonpartisan  Rothenberg  Political  Report.  Jolly's  win  "means  it's  all  about  Obamacare  for  the  GOP."Zelizer:  Obama  may  hate  the  midterm  results</TEXT></DOC>

"She  has  this  one  part  where  it's  like  a  kiss  cam,  and  I  just  walked  up  to  her  to  give  her  like  a  friendly  girly  kiss,  you  know,  as  us  girls  do,  and  then  she  like,  tried  to  move  her  head  and  go  deeper  and  I  pulled  away.""God  knows  where  that  tongue  has  been.

Dinyal  New's  voice  trails  off,  unable  to  continue.She  sits  in  the  same  pew  of  her  church,  listening  to  the  same  pastor  on  the  same  subject  --  the  loss  of  a  child.Her  two  boys,  Lee  and  Lamar,  were  shot  to  death,  19  days  apart,  young  victims  of  Oakland,  California's  relentless  street  violence.With  a  population  of  nearly  400,000,  Oakland  has  long  been  known  as  a  Bay  Area  pocket  of  urban  violence.  Its  proximity  to  drug  corridors  and  high  poverty  are  fertile  breeding  grounds  for  gang  violence.Nearby  San  Francisco  and  Silicon  Valley  are  routinely  named  "Most  Innovative  Cities  in  America,"  yet  Oakland  makes  it  on  very  different  lists  with  one  of  the  highest  gang  homicide  rates  and  robbery  levels  in  the  country.Last  year,  Oakland  police  touted  a  28%  drop  in  murders,  the  biggest  reduction  in  homicides  since  2004.  After  two  years  of  rising  death  tolls,  Oakland's  police  chief  credited  the  drop  in  homicides  --  from  131  in  2012  to  90  in  2013  --  to  the  city's  violence  reduction  strategy  which  targets  the  most  violent  gangs.But  because  of  Oakland's  size,  its  reduced  homicide  rate  still  makes  it  one  of  the  most  dangerous  cities  in  the  country,  with  a  murder  every  four  days.After  riots,  California  city  gets  new  police  chiefNew's  youngest  son,  Lee  Weathersby  III,  died  on  January  1,  Oakland's  first  murder  of  2014.  A  gunman  approached  the  13-year-old  on  New  Year's  Eve  as  he  walked  home  from  the  Boys  and  Girls  Club,  and  shot  him  28  times.Teachers,  family  members  and  others  who  knew  him  best  say  Lee  wasn't  in  a  gang.  The  eighth  grader  loved  to  play  drums  in  band.  Neighbors  said  Lee  was  a  good  boy.  He  stayed  at  home  playing  video  games  or  hung  out  at  the  Boys  and  Girls  Club,  while  his  single  mother  worked  as  a  social  worker.It's  unclear  why  Lee  was  targeted.Surveillance  video  turned  over  to  Oakland  police  shows  him  walking  down  the  street,  his  youth  apparent  in  his  gait.  He  was  walking  home  from  the  bus  stop.  Usually  he  called  his  mom  to  pick  him  up,  but  his  cell  phone  battery  had  died.  On  the  video,  his  mother  says  you  can  see  a  gunman  approach,  carrying  a  semi-automatic  rifle.Minority  kids  impacted  by  zero-tolerance  lawsDinyal  New  was  at  home,  watching  local  news  of  the  aftermath  of  another  shooting  in  her  neighborhood.  The  report  showed  video  of  a  gurney  being  loaded  into  an  ambulance,  with  the  on-screen  graphic,  "Teen  shot."She'd  seen  it  hundreds  of  times  --  just  another  kid  shot  in  Oakland.Hours  later,  she  rushed  to  the  hospital  with  her  oldest  son  Lamar  where  she  was  called  to  identify  Lee's  body.  She  looked  up  at  a  television  in  the  waiting  room  and  saw  the  local  news  report  again.This  time  it  hit  her:  it  was  Lee  in  that  news  report,  his  body  being  loaded  into  the  ambulance."Thirteen  years  old.  Just  a  baby,  just  a  baby."Another  son  gunned  downLamar  Broussard  had  started  straightening  out  his  life  after  occasional  run-ins  with  the  law,  including  a  stint  in  juvenile  detention.  The  19-year-old  had  been  taking  classes  at  the  local  community  college.He  was  close  to  his  younger  brother,  Lee  --  so  close  that  the  two  still  slept  together  in  the  same  bed.After  Lee's  death,  Dinyal  New  worried  about  Lamar.  Her  youngest  son,  who  was  never  in  trouble,  had  clearly  been  a  target.  Was  it  a  message  to  Lamar?Fearing  for  her  older  son's  safety,  New  asked  Lamar  to  leave  Oakland.  But  with  the  bravado  of  youth,  Lamar  convinced  his  mother  he  was  safe.After  losing  Lee,  New  wanted  to  get  back  into  a  routine,  back  to  her  career  as  a  case  worker  for  the  homeless,  but  says  she  was  exhausted  by  her  grief.Then,  three  days  after  Lee's  funeral,  on  January  19,  she  asked  Lamar  to  run  an  errand  for  her,  to  pay  her  cell  phone  bill.  He  was  two  blocks  from  home  when  friends  started  calling  her  phone.There  had  been  gunfire  in  the  neighborhood,  they  told  her.New  ran  towards  the  corner,  and  spotted  the  yellow  police  tape."I  see  my  son's  car  shot  up.  And  I  just  broke  down  crying."  She  couldn't  approach  the  car.  She  could  see  from  20  yards  away  what  had  happened."The  suspect  stood  on  top  of  the  car  and  just  shot  into  the  car.  Just  shot  into  the  car."She  called  Lamar  repeatedly  from  her  cell  phone.  "He  never  answered.  He  never  answered."  There  was  no  logic  in  it,  she  says,  because  she  already  knew  in  her  heart  that  Lamar  was  gone.In  19  days,  Dinyal  New  went  from  a  mother  of  two,  to  a  mother  of  none.  Oakland  police  will  not  say  whether  the  murders  of  Dinyal's  sons  are  gang-related,  but  because  they  are  brothers,  police  say  their  deaths  "are  possibly  related."New's  horror  may  be  extraordinary,  but  losing  a  child  to  gun  violence  is  a  common  experience  in  Oakland,  says  Naomi  Harry.  "This  city  is  full  of  mourning  mothers,"  she  says.Harry's  son  was  shot  on  a  city  bus,  coming  home  from  school.  He  survived.Alicia  Waters'  son  Jamal  Waters  was  not  so  lucky.  He  was  shot  and  killed  on  Oakland's  streets  six  years  ago.  His  murder  is  still  unsolved.Burying  your  child  defies  the  natural  order,  says  Waters.  But  she  says  it's  normal  in  Oakland."It's  beyond  sickening  to  me,"  says  Waters.  "No  parent  should  ever,  ever  have  to  bury  their  kids.  Especially  like  this.  This  is  crazy.  I  can  no  longer  see  mothers  bury  their  kids  anymore.  I  just  can't."Waters  drops  her  head,  the  tears  still  fresh  six  years  after  she  buried  her  son.Trying  to  make  a  differenceTodd  Walker  thinks  of  himself  as  the  mop-up  man  to  Oakland's  violence.  He  often  picks  up  the  bodies  of  young  African-American  men  lost  to  gun  violence,  after  the  coroner's  work  is  complete.He  plugs  the  bullet  holes  with  plastic  screws  so  the  fluid  doesn't  stain  the  white  satin  of  the  casket,  so  mothers  can  see  their  sons  on  last  time.Walker  estimates  he's  put  a  few  hundred  children,  or  "babies"  as  he  calls  them,  into  caskets.He  picked  up  both  Lee  and  Lamar's  bodies  on  his  gurney."I'm  tired  of  it,"  says  Walker,  52.  "I'm  the  one  who  sees  them  firsthand  at  the  coroner's  office.  I'm  the  one  who's  got  to  identify  them  right  off  the  top.  The  mother's  calling  you:  How  does  their  kid  look?  Sometimes  ...  the  kid's  been  shot  up  so  bad  they  can't  even  identify  them.  It's  real  sad."Walker  held  Dinyal  New's  hand  as  she  picked  out  her  second  casket  this  month.  He's  done  this  hundreds  of  times  --  but  still  finds  himself  at  a  loss  for  words."Ain't  too  much  you  can  say  to  her.  It's  horrible."A  life-long  East  Bay  resident,  Walker  also  coaches  Pop  Warner  football  for  the  neighborhood  boys.  When  he  started  picking  up  the  bodies  of  the  very  boys  he  coached,  Walker  pledged  to  try  and  make  a  difference.He  began  inviting  children  and  their  parents  into  the  MWJ  Mortuary  funeral  home  and  walked  them  through  the  embalming  process.  During  these  tours,  in  which  he  hopes  to  show  young  people  the  sober  reality  of  life  on  the  streets,  Walker  opens  up  the  empty  caskets  and  closes  the  lid  on  the  children."That's  how  it  ends,"  he  tells  the  visitors.His  program,  which  he  now  calls  Restoring  Inner  City  Peace,  or  R.I.P.,  has  proven  so  popular  that  teachers  now  invite  him  to  schools.  For  classroom  visits,  which  can  be  for  children  as  young  as  kindergarten,  Walker  brings  body  bags  and  zips  the  children  inside.His  message  is  always  the  same:  There  is  nothing  romantic  about  guns  and  street  life  --  only  finality  and  darkness."Gun  violence  is  a  regular,  everyday  thing.  There's  shooting  everyday.  All  these  kids  do  not  have  an  education,  but  they  have  a  gun.  And  there's  something  wrong  with  that  picture.  ...  To  me,  the  city  is  failing  these  kids,"  he  says.Walker  says  that  even  the  horror  of  Dinyal  New's  story  will  fade  after  Lamar  is  buried."A  month  or  two  from  now,  it'll  be  over  with,"  he  says.  "We'll  be  talking  about  something  different.  That's  how  it  goes,  year  after  year."Still,  New  is  trying  to  make  Lamar's  service  special.  She's  decorating  the  program  in  his  favorite  colors,  green  and  white.  She's  asked  their  god-sister  to  read  at  the  service."I  need  to  bury  him  right.  I  need  to  do  a  good  job,"  she  says.New  can  make  it  through  today.  The  family  and  the  neighborhood  will  fill  the  church.  She'll  have  plenty  of  support  for  Lamar's  funeral.But  tomorrow?  She'll  be  alone.</TEXT></DOC>

William  Marks  told  CNN.  "Until  we  get  conclusive  evidence  of  debris,  it  is  just  a  guess."Bill  Schofield,  an  Australian  scientist  who  worked  on  developing  flight  data  recorders,  said,  "If  they  do  find  it,  I  think  it'll  be  remarkable."The  decision  about  where  in  the  southern  Indian  Ocean  to  focus  British  and  Australian  naval  ships  equipped  with  sophisticated  listening  technology  was  nothing  more  than  an  educated  guess  of  where  the  plane  may  have  hit  the  water.On  Friday,  ships  did  report  sightings  of  objects,  but  none  were  linked  to  plane  debris.The  British  Royal  Navy  survey  ship  HMS  Echo  and  the  Australian  naval  supply  ship  Ocean  Shield  began  searching  the  depths  Friday  along  a  single  150-mile  (240-kilometer)  track,  said  retired  Air  Chief  Marshal  Angus  Houston,  the  head  of  the  Australian  agency  coordinating  the  search.The  Ocean  Shield  is  equipped  with  high-tech  gear  borrowed  from  the  United  States:•  The  Towed  Pinger  Locator  25  contains  an  underwater  microphone  to  detect  pings  from  the  jet's  voice  and  data  recorders  as  deep  as  20,000  feet  (6,100  meters).  It  is  towed  behind  a  vessel  that  typically  travels  at  1  to  5  knots,  depending  on  the  water's  depth."It  is  a  very  slow  proceeding,"  said  Capt.  Mark  M.  Matthews,  director  of  ocean  engineering.•  The  Bluefin-21  is  an  underwater  vehicle  that  can  scour  the  ocean  floor  for  wreckage  and  can  also  be  used  to  find  mines.  It  is  16.2  feet  long,  weighs  1,650  pounds,  can  work  for  25  hours  at  3  knots  and  can  operate  to  a  depth  of  nearly  15,000  feet.The  ocean  in  the  search  area  is  6,500  feet  to  13,000  feet  deep.Since  the  devices  don't  require  daylight,  they  can  search  around  the  clock.The  HMS  Echo  also  carries  advanced  sensor  and  survey  equipment.But  time  is  running  out  --  the  batteries  that  power  the  recorders'  pingers,  or  locator  beacons,  are  designed  to  last  at  least  30  days  from  the  time  they  begin  operating.The  Boeing  777-200ER  was  carrying  239  people  from  Kuala  Lumpur,  Malaysia,  to  Beijing  when  it  disappeared  on  March  8.  If  it  crashed  into  the  water,  its  recorders'  pingers  could  go  mute  as  soon  as  Monday.The  decision  about  where  to  focus  the  underwater  search  was  based  on  the  same  kind  of  analysis  of  radar,  satellite  imagery  and  other  data  that  investigators  have  used  to  determine  a  series  of  shifting  search  areas  in  recent  weeks."The  area  of  highest  probability  as  to  where  the  aircraft  might  have  entered  the  water  is  the  area  where  the  underwater  search  will  commence,"  Houston  told  reporters  Friday.  "It's  on  the  basis  of  data  that  arrived  only  recently,  and  it's  the  best  data  that  is  available."'Long  way  to  go'The  search  also  was  continuing  above  the  waves.Officials  have  repeatedly  warned  of  a  potentially  prolonged  hunt  for  the  missing  passenger  jet.Houston  said  Friday  he  expects  the  search  area  to  continue  to  be  adjusted  on  "a  semi-regular  basis.""We've  still  got  a  long  way  to  go,"  he  said.In  the  case  of  Air  France  Flight  447,  which  crashed  into  the  Atlantic  Ocean  in  2009,  officials  found  debris  on  the  surface  after  five  days  of  searching.  But  it  took  them  nearly  two  years  to  find  the  main  pieces  of  wreckage,  the  flight  recorders  and  many  of  the  bodies  of  those  on  board.With  Flight  370,  the  search  teams  have  even  fewer  clues.On  Thursday,  Australian  Prime  Minister  Tony  Abbott  warned  that  "we  cannot  be  certain  of  ultimate  success  in  the  search"  for  the  Malaysian  aircraft.  He  described  it  as  the  most  difficult  search  "in  human  history."Authorities  have  yet  to  explain  why  the  plane  flew  off  course  or  where  it  ended  up;  investigations  into  the  227  passengers  and  12  crew  members  have  yielded  no  suggestion  that  any  of  them  might  have  been  behind  the  disappearance.6  missteps  in  the  investigationFamilies'  frustrationsMalaysian  officials  held  a  briefing  for  Malaysian  relatives  of  those  aboard  MH370  on  Thursday  evening  at  a  Kuala  Lumpur  hotel,  but  attendees  told  CNN  that  nothing  new  had  emerged.Mohammad  Sahril  Shaari,  whose  cousin  Mohammad  Razahan  Zamani  was  a  honeymooning  groom  on  the  plane,  said  the  three-hour  session  had  felt  like  a  "waste  of  time."He  added,  "I  was  hoping  for  some  news  that  they  had  tracked  the  plane  or  some  parts  of  it,  but  nothing  like  that  happened."Selamat  Bin  Omar,  the  father  of  another  passenger,  Malaysian  civil  flight  engineer  Mohammed  Khairul  Amri  Selamat,  said  officials  described  in  detail  the  satellite  data  that  has  led  investigators  to  the  current  search  area."They  could  not  tell  us  if  the  plane  crashed,"  he  said.  "They  said  they  were  still  looking  into  it."Danica  Weeks,  wife  of  passenger  Paul  Weeks,  said  after  the  meeting  that  the  jet's  disappearance  still  perplexes  her.  "The  hardest  process  for  me  is  understanding  that  a  commercial  airliner  can  just  go  black,"  the  New  Zealander  told  CNN's  Paula  Newton."That  someone  can  just  turn  off  all  communications,  all  matter  of  tracking  an  airliner,  and  it  can  just  disappear.  And  this  is  the  mystery."About  the  search  for  the  plane,  she  said,  "If  it's  there,  they  will  find  it.  But  are  they  in  the  right  place?  It's  all  calculations.  It's  all  guesswork."Hanging  on  to  hopeWeeks  said  her  infant  son  Jack  will  celebrate  his  first  birthday  next  month,  and  their  3-year-old  son,  Lincoln,  was  still  coming  to  grips  with  their  loss."Dad  was  everything  for  him,"  she  said.  "He  read  Lincoln  always  his  bedtime  story,  and  they  had  this  saying  that  they'd  say  --  you  know,  'Good  night,  I  love  you  and  see  you  in  the  morning  for  breakfast.'"And  now  he  comes  out  and  I  tell  him  that  Dad  is  up  in  the  sky,  and  we  come  out  every  night  and  we  find  the  brightest  star.  We  find  the  brightest  star  and  he  says,  'Good  night,  Daddy,  I  love  you.  See  you  in  the  morning  for  breakfast.'  And  that  breaks  my  heart."But,  four  weeks  after  the  plane  vanished,  she  too  has  not  given  up  on  seeing  him  for  breakfast."I  know  it  sounds  crazy,  but  I  still  have  a  slight  hope,  you  know,"  she  said,  adding  that  she  will  be  able  to  grieve  only  after  confronted  by  evidence  of  his  death."The  grief  at  this  point  still  hasn't  started  for  me,"  she  said.  "I  have  my  moments,  but  until  I  have  evidence,  I  still  don't  know."The  partner  of  American  passenger  Philip  Wood  was  also  among  those  who  attended  Friday's  meeting.  "The  only  thing  I  learned  last  night  after  three  hours  is  that  the  Malaysian  families  are  more  calm  and  rational  than  the  Chinese,"  Sarah  Bajc  told  CNN's  Judy  Kwon  in  an  e-mail."But  they  are  equally  frustrated  and  have  totally  lost  faith  in  the  Malaysian  government."Bajc  noted  that  officials  have  concluded  that  the  jetliner  flew  over  Malaysia  "for  quite  a  long  time.""It  is  impossible  that  this  relatively  sophisticated  military  power  didn't  see  it,"  she  said.  "They  are  clearly  hiding  something.  We  just  don't  know  what."Malaysia  refuses  to  let  families  hear  the  plane's  radio  communicationsThe  Malaysian  Department  of  Civil  Aviation  denied  a  request  by  Malaysian  families  to  release  the  audio  recording  of  radio  communications  among  the  pilot,  co-pilot  and  air  traffic  control,  two  people  who  attended  the  briefing  said.The  department's  chief,  Azharuddin  Abdul  Rahman,  told  the  relatives  that  even  the  families  of  pilot  Zaharie  Ahmad  Shah  and  co-pilot  Fariq  Abdul  Hamid  have  not  been  allowed  to  listen  to  the  recording  because  it  is  part  of  an  ongoing  investigation,  the  two  attendees  said.Malaysian  authorities  released  a  transcript  of  the  recording  Tuesday."This  is  an  event  that  is  so  unprecedented  and  I  think  that  is  so  significant  that  it  can  never  be  allowed  to  get  off  the  screens,  get  off  the  radar,"  K.S.  Narendran  told  CNN's  Erin  Burnett.His  wife,  Chandrika  Sharma,  was  on  the  flight."My  concern  is  that  if  we  don't  really  get  to  the  bottom  of  it,  we  cannot  really  be  certain  that  we  are  safe  and  that  we  are  secure  every  time  we  board  a  flight."Ocean  Shield:  A  mission  of  hope  in  search  for  Flight  370Flight  370:  High-tech  search  toolsInside  the  flight  simulatorRead  the  cockpit  transcriptCNN's  Elizabeth  Joseph  reported  from  Perth,  and  Tom  Watkins  reported  and  wrote  from  Atlanta.

It  wasn't  her  birthday,  nor  was  it  her  anniversary.January  1  was  the  first  day  she'd  be  eligible  to  get  health  insurance.That's  what  she  thought  anyway.As  soon  as  the  Obamacare  marketplaces  opened  in  October,  the  Wisconsin  stay-at-home  mom  tried  to  log  into  the  website.  It  crashed.  Repeatedly.  She  said  she  tried  seven  or  eight  times."I  kept  seeing  the  news  stories  that  said  it  was  supposed  to  get  smoother,  but  I'd  get  all  the  way  to  the  end  of  signing  up  and  it  would  crash  again,"  Braun-Gross  said.48  million  Americans  without  health  insuranceShe  ended  up  calling  the  marketplace's  official  phone  bank.  That  did  the  trick,  but  it  still  took  weeks  for  the  paperwork  to  get  to  her  so  she  could  finally  pick  a  plan.  Despite  the  aggravation  she  said  having  health  insurance  will  totally  be  worth  it.Having  previously  been  denied  insurance  because  of  pre-existing  conditions,  including  her  weight,  she  has  worried  every  day  for  the  year  she  has  lived  without  it.  She  wonders  what  would  happen  if  she  or  her  husband  got  sick;  he  has  a  physically  demanding  job  running  a  tree-cutting  business."You  know  something  as  simple  as  a  sprained  ankle,  none  of  that  is  covered  right  now.  None  of  it,"  Braun-Gross  said.  "To  add  the  cost  of  that  to  the  debt  we  already  have,  we'd  basically  be  up  a  creek."Braun-Gross  is  like  more  than  48  million  other  Americans  who  weren't  eligible  or  didn't  have  enough  money  to  pay  for  health  insurance  in  the  past.Obamacare  is  supposed  to  change  all  that.  The  law  forbids  insurance  companies  from  rejecting  people  like  Braun-Gross  because  of  their  pre-existing  conditions.  To  make  that  affordable,  though,  the  administration  had  to  require  all  Americans,  with  a  few  exceptions,  to  buy  a  health  insurance  policy.  That  part  of  the  law  went  into  effect  this  year.The  idea  is  that  more  healthy  people  will  buy  insurance,  and  the  money  the  insurance  companies  save  on  them  will  cover  the  costs  of  insuring  the  older  and  sicker  people  who  will  now  be  in  the  system.Some  2.1  million  have  gotten  private  health  insurance  in  the  first  three  months  of  open  enrollment.  And  nearly  1  million  signed  up  for  Obamacare  in  the  first  weeks  of  January  alone,  according  to  the  administration.Health  care  timelineEmployers  will  provide  health  insurance  for  three  out  of  every  five  Americans  in  2014,  according  to  the  Congressional  Budget  Office.  Another  12%  will  get  it  through  Medicaid  or  the  Children's  Health  Insurance  Program.But  for  those  Americans  without  insurance,  a  central  feature  of  Obamacare  --  health  insurance  marketplaces,  also  known  as  exchanges  --  can  make  a  big  difference  in  helping  them  find  a  plan.  Many  are  eligible  for  government  assistance  to  pay  for  those  plans.With  so  many  politicians  fighting  over  this  controversial  legislation,  and  with  all  the  computer  glitches,  the  details  about  how  to  sign  up  may  have  gotten  a  little  lost.  More  than  half  of  Americans  still  don't  know  about  the  important  Obamacare  deadlines,  according  to  one  survey.You've  got  until  Wednesday  January  30  to  sign  up  if  you  want  coverage  to  start  on  March  1.Here's  what  you  need  to  know:The  deadlineOpen  enrollment  runs  through  March  31.  Plans  bought  through  the  exchanges  this  month  won't  start  until  the  next.In  most  of  the  country  December  24  is  the  cutoff  date  if  you  want  your  plan  to  start  on  January  1.  On  Monday,  the  administration  said  it  was  extending  the  December  23  deadline  for  another  day.America's  Health  Insurance  Plans,  the  health  insurance  industry  trade  group,  said  consumers  now  have  until  January  10  though  to  make  their  first  payment  for  coverage  retroactive  to  January  1.  If  you  sign  up  after  that  in  January  or  February  your  coverage  will  start  the  following  month.  The  enrollment  period  closes  March  31  and  won't  re-open  until  October  15.Opinion:  Worried  about  Obamacare?  Fear  notWhen  Massachusetts  rolled  out  a  similar  health  insurance  mandate  in  2007,  the  biggest  spike  in  enrollments  came  in  the  two  months  before  people  would  be  charged  a  penalty  for  not  having  coverage,  according  to  Jon  Kingsdale,  who  ran  the  state's  health  benefit  exchange  then.  He  also  noticed  many  people  came  back  to  the  state's  website  to  evaluate  the  potential  plans  more  than  once.The  experts  advise  you  to  take  your  time.  Comparison  shop  to  find  the  policy  that  works  best  for  you.Where  to  startIf  you  have  Internet  access,  start  with  the  Web.  Healthcare.gov  will  have  the  information  you  need.  The  government  site  will  link  to  where  you  sign  up  for  the  program.There  have  been  challenges  with  these  websites,  but  the  Obama  administration  said  December  16  that  the  issues  should  be  resolved.If  you  can  get  into  the  website,  go  first  to  "get  insurance."  That  tab  will  get  you  to  a  page  that  will  walk  you  through  whatever  marketplace  is  available  to  you.  Some  states  set  up  their  own;  the  federal  government  runs  the  rest.  On  this  site  you  can  also  compare  the  plans  available  in  your  area.You  may  also  want  to  see  if  you  are  eligible  for  Medicaid  here.  So  far,  26  states  have  decided  to  expand  who  is  eligible  for  the  federal  government-funded  health  program  for  lower  income  families  and  individuals.  Four  others  are  currently  considering  expansion.You  can  also  enroll  by  mail.Obama  offers  funding  to  help  communities  understand  ObamacareThe  government  has  set  up  call  centers  to  help  people  with  open  enrollment.  Call  1-800-318-2596  (TTY:  1-855-889-4325).  The  number  is  staffed  around-the-clock.  Information  is  available  in  more  than  150  languages.There  will  also  be  specially  trained  advisers  in  communities.  These  "navigators,"  as  they  are  known,  can  help  you  in  person.  There  will  also  be  federally  authorized  marketplace-designated  organizations.  They  will  be  based  in  community  health  centers,  at  the  mall,  in  drug  stores  and  in  churches.  Depending  on  state  law,  traditional  agents  and  insurance  brokers  can  also  help.If  you  would  like  to  find  a  navigator,  go  to  Localhelp.healthcare.gov.  The  government  site  lets  you  plug  in  your  ZIP  code  and  it  will  give  you  the  closest  location  to  get  help.  The  website  will  list  the  phone  number,  the  address,  the  e-mail  address,  the  website  address,  the  office  hours,  and  details  on  how  they  can  help.Unlike  brokers  or  agents,  navigators  and  marketplace-designated  organizations  can  educate  you  about  the  plans,  but  they  cannot  tell  you  which  plan  to  pick.  Their  advice  is  free.  If  someone  who  is  a  navigator  or  a  federally  designated  organization  tries  to  charge  you,  it  is  a  scam.Most  common  Obamacare  scams  so  farThe  health  care  plansThere  are  several.  The  bronze  level  will  be  basic,  silver  midrange,  while  gold  and  platinum  will  be  higher-end.  There  will  also  be  a  catastrophic  option.  Catastrophic  insurance  covers  three  doctor  visits  per  year  at  no  cost  and  preventive  care  such  as  screenings  and  vaccines.  This  plan  will  carry  a  higher  deductible.All  plans  bought  through  the  exchanges  must  offer  the  same  coverage  benefits.  All  offer  free  preventive  care.  Nearly  all  cap  out-of-pocket  costs  to  $6,350  and  $12,700  per  family.  No  one  can  be  turned  away.  No  one  will  be  penalized  because  of  their  gender  (women  often  paid  more  in  the  old  insurance  system).  Only  smokers  may  be  penalized  in  some  plans  and  some  older  people  may  pay  more.The  costWhat  varies  with  the  plans  is  cost.  Some  will  carry  higher  deductibles.  Some  ask  for  higher  co-pays.  Costs  will  vary  based  on  where  you  live.  If  you  want  to  see  what  your  bill  may  look  like,  be  sure  to  check  out  the  premium  estimate  tool  on  HHS.gov.The  majority  of  people  uninsured  today  can  find  a  policy  for  $100  or  less  a  month,  taking  into  account  subsidies  and  Medicaid  eligibility,  according  to  the  Obama  administration.No  matter  what  the  cost,  you  will  pay  a  monthly  premium,  and  may  also  have  a  co-pay  or  be  asked  to  meet  a  deductible  when  you  go  to  the  doctor  or  hospital.Millions  eligible  for  Obamacare  subsidies,  but  most  don't  know  itThe  good  news  is  if  you  go  through  the  exchanges  rather  than  buy  directly  from  an  insurance  company,  you  will  likely  be  eligible  for  tax  breaks  and  subsidies  to  pay  for  your  insurance.  The  assistance  is  available  to  those  with  incomes  of  up  to  four  times  the  federal  poverty  level  --  this  year,  that's  $45,960  for  an  individual  or  $94,200  for  a  family  of  four  --  and  will  be  calculated  on  a  sliding  scale.You  can  take  this  subsidy  as  a  tax  credit  or  the  government  will  pay  the  insurance  company  directly.ExemptionsSome  Americans  will  be  exempt  from  the  health  insurance  mandate,  according  to  the  Congressional  Budget  Office.These  are  people  who  can't  afford  it:  For  example,  people  who  make  so  little  they  don't  have  to  file  a  tax  return  are  exempt.People  who  are  in  this  country  without  authorization  are  exempted,  as  are  members  of  a  federally  recognized  American  Indian  tribe  who  are  eligible  for  services  through  an  American  Indian  health  care  provider  and  people  with  certain  religious  beliefs  that  conflict  with  acceptance  of  the  benefits  of  private  or  public  insurance.People  with  certain  hardships  are  also  exempt;  so  are  people  in  states  that  don't  expand  Medicaid.If  you  don't  get  insuranceIf  you  don't  sign  up  to  get  insurance,  you'll  list  that  on  your  2014  tax  return.The  fee  for  the  first  year  is  $95  per  adult  and  $47.50  per  child  (up  to  $285  per  family),  or  1%  of  your  income,  whatever  is  higher.In  2015,  it  jumps  to  2%  of  your  income,  or  $325  per  adult  and  $162.50  per  child.  In  2016,  it  will  jump  to  2.5%  of  your  income.No  thanks,  Obamacare  I'll  pay  the  penaltyWhile  some  may  rather  pay  the  small  fee  the  first  year  than  pay  premiums  that  would  cost  more,  experts  predict  most  people  will  sign  up  for  insurance."I  think  the  penalties  should  be  higher,  but  they  are  still  enough  to  make  the  law  effective,"  said  Jonathan  Gruber,  an  economist  at  MIT  who  was  an  architect  on  both  the  Massachusetts  and  U.S.  health  plans.  "In  Massachusetts  we  had  people  flooding  in  to  sign  up.  You  know  Americans  are  almost  uniquely  law-abiding  people,  we  massively  overpay  our  taxes  in  terms  of  what  people  do  in  the  rest  of  the  world.  When  you  say  it  is  the  law  to  have  health  insurance  I  think  people  will  get  health  insurance."Enroll  America,  a  nonpartisan  nonprofit  that  is  helping  educate  Americans  about  the  program,  said  it  has  had  a  positive  response  once  people  have  an  explanation  of  what's  coming."For  the  most  part,  the  people  we  encounter  are  thrilled  that  they  will  finally  have  health  care,"  said  Enroll  America's  Jessica  Barbara  Brown.  "For  many  people  this  will  be  the  first  time  they  have  ever  had  access  to  care.  This  can  be  life-changing."Taxpayer  guide  to  ObamacareAmy  Braun-Gross  agrees.  Her  health  insurance  will  come  just  in  time  as  she,  like  her  husband,  will  take  on  a  physically  demanding  job  next  month.  She  is  going  to  be  a  fitness  instructor."Not  having  insurance  because  of  the  pre-existing  conditions  got  me  thinking  --  I  want  to  be  healthier,"  Braun  Gross  said.  "I'm  losing  weight,  feeling  healthier  and  now  if  something  were  to  happen  I'll  be  covered."</TEXT></DOC>

"I've  got  things  I  don't  want  people  to  know  but  I  didn't  really  go  running  for  cover  for  a  new  way  to  encrypt."The  comedian  gave  the  closing  keynote  at  the  RSA  conference,  ignoring  requests  from  privacy  activists  and  some  members  of  the  cybersecurity  community  to  back  out  of  the  event.A  number  of  security  speakers  dropped  out  of  the  RSA  conference  when  Reuters  reported  in  December  that  RSA  had  an  undisclosed  $10  million  contract  with  the  NSA  to  build  a  back  door  for  the  government  agency  into  encryption  software.  Some  protesters  put  on  a  counter-conference  nearby  Thursday  called  TrustyCon,  and  protesters  passed  out  anti-NSA  information  outside  of  a  conference  location  in  downtown  San  Francisco.Though  he  is  not  a  security  expert,  Colbert's  reaction  was  closely  watched  by  those  outside  of  the  community.  RSA  typically  closes  out  its  week-long  conferences  with  big-name  speakers,  often  from  the  political  sphere.  Condoleezza  Rice,  Bill  Clinton  and  Tony  Blair  have  all  held  the  honor  at  previous  conferences.  This  year  it  hired  Colbert.Some  called  for  the  TV  host  to  boycott  the  event,  and  privacy  group  Fight  for  the  Future  had  started  an  online  petition  asking  Colbert  not  to  attend."Now  a  lot  of  people,  maybe  some  in  this  room,  were  upset  to  learn  I'd  be  speaking  here  today.  Many  of  you  see  me  as  a  champion  of  privacy,"  said  Colbert.  "Which  I  know  because  I  read  your  emails."Colbert  was  quick  to  defend  RSA  and  his  decision  to  keep  the  paid  gig.  He  said  he  believed  the  security  company  was  exonerated  by  its  claim  to  have  promoted  the  supposedly  compromised  standard  a  full  two  years  before  the  NSA  payoff.Colbert  asked  if  it  was  fair  to  boycott  this  conference  when  other  major  companies  such  as  Apple,  Microsoft,  Verizon  and  Yahoo  had  all  been  linked  to  the  NSA.  He  also  joked  that  as  a  freedom  lover,  he  doesn't  engage  in  boycotts.  And  that  he  had  signed  a  contract  so  his  conscience  was  clear,  as  long  as  his  check  cleared.While  the  RSA  got  a  pass,  Colbert  didn't  go  as  easy  on  the  NSA  or  Edward  Snowden,  whom  he  referred  to  as  "practically  a  war  criminal"  for  taking  top  secret  U.S.  intelligence  to  China  and  then  to  Russia."Was  Mordor  not  accepting  asylum  requests?"  he  quipped.The  lines  between  the  blustering  right-leaning  character  Colbert  plays  on  TV  and  the  more  liberal  comedian  himself  were  fluid  during  the  talk,  but  he  seemed  genuine  in  his  criticisms  of  the  agency  and  its  famous  whistleblower."We  can  trust  the  NSA  because  without  a  doubt  it  is  history's  most  powerful,  pervasive,  sophisticated  surveillance  agency  ever  to  be  totally  pwned  by  a  29-year-old  with  a  thumb  drive,"  said  Colbert.The  rest  of  the  talk  was  a  mix  of  jokes  and  light  political  commentary,  with  some  security  humor  thrown  in  to  appease  the  cryptographer  audience.  He  joked  about  his  own  fictional  security  startup,  CloudFog,  and  took  questions  from  the  audience  about  "Lord  of  the  Rings,"  Jane  Fonda,  acting  and  politics.In  the  end,  the  comedian  placed  the  blame  for  the  NSA's  programs  on  Americans."We  all  deserve  credit  for  this  new  surveillance  state  that  we  live  in  because  we  the  people  voted  for  the  Patriot  Act.  Democrats  and  Republicans  alike,"  said  Colbert.  "We  voted  for  the  people  who  voted  for  it,  and  then  voted  for  the  people  who  reauthorized  it,  then  voted  for  the  people  who  re-re-authorized  it."U.S.  wants  to  extend  time  it  can  hold  surveillance  dataBig  data,  big  business,  Big  Brother?</TEXT></DOC>

She  declined  to  speculate  on  what  sentence  the  teen  might  face.Calling  the  case  "precedent-setting,"  Fisher  said  the  case  should  serve  as  a  warning  to  teens  about  what  they  text  and  post  online.The  case  began  in  November  2012  when  the  teen  learned  that  her  17-year-old  boyfriend  was  still  in  contact  with  his  former  girlfriend."The  accused  was  not  at  all  happy  that  he  was  still  in  touch  with  his  ex,"  Fisher  told  CNN.The  teenager  initially  threatened  the  ex-girlfriend  on  Facebook,  the  prosecutor  said.  She  then  texted  five  explicit  pictures  of  the  ex-girlfriend  that  she  found  on  her  boyfriend's  phone  to  a  group  of  people,  Fisher  said.The  teen's  attorney,  Christopher  Mackie,  said  the  charges  were  inappropriate."Our  sights  have  always  been  set  on  the  constitutional  question.  ...She  never  denied  that  she  did  this,"  he  told  CNN.

Initially,  Rushing  told  police  that  two  black  men  --  one  of  them  armed  --  forced  their  way  into  the  home  before  Rushing  chased  them  away  with  a  shotgun,  police  said.Later,  the  intruders  were  described  as  white  and  Hispanic.  Though  the  gunman  was  described  as  running  through  the  house  while  firing  his  weapon,  police  said,  not  a  single  item  in  the  home  appeared  to  be  knocked  over.On  Thursday,  Rushing  and  Ethan  Alexander  Thompson,  19,  were  formally  charged  with  two  counts  of  first-degree  murder  and  conspiracy  to  commit  murder,  according  to  court  papers.Timothy  Alan  Delahoy  Jr.,  18,  was  charged  with  two  counts  of  conspiracy  to  commit  murder  and  two  counts  of  accessory  after  the  fact  of  murder.  Cody  Xavier  Davis,  19,  was  charged  with  two  counts  of  conspiracy  to  commit  murder  and  two  counts  of  accessory  after  the  fact  of  murder.On  Friday,  Wesley  Bankston,  17,  was  charged  with  two  counts  of  first-degree  murder  and  two  counts  of  conspiracy  to  commit  murder,  police  said.  He  was  charged  as  an  adult,  but  his  lawyer  told  the  court  that  she  would  seek  to  have  him  tried  as  a  juvenile.All  five  have  pleaded  not  guilty.The  teens  were  being  held  on  bond  of  between  $2  million  and  $5  million,  court  officials  said.  Lawyers  for  Rushing  and  Bankston  declined  to  comment;  attorneys  for  the  others  could  not  immediately  be  reached  for  comment.A  court  affidavit  obtained  by  CNN  said  that  on  January  20  Thorsten  Rushing  allegedly  met  with  Thompson  and  Bankston  and  they  agreed  that  Thompson  would  help  remove  the  evidence  after  the  shootings  and  that  Bankston  would  drive.At  the  Rushing  home,  the  affidavit  said,  Thompson  hid  in  a  closet  for  several  hours  before  Thorsten  Rushing  allegedly  killed  his  father  and  brother.  He  used  a  9mm  Glock  to  shoot  them,  authorities  contend.Police  said  Thorsten  Rushing  and  Thompson  then  allegedly  pumped  two  shots  into  a  wall  to  make  it  seem  as  if  the  intruders  shot  at  Thorsten.  The  affidavit  said  the  teens  collected  the  evidence  in  a  bag  and  called  Bankston  so  that  he  could  drive  them  to  dispose  of  it.  Later,  Thorsten  Rushing  allegedly  fired  a  shotgun  blast  into  a  wall  before  calling  911.After  the  slayings,  the  five  teens  met  at  the  home  of  Thorsten  Rushing's  grandparents  to  discuss  what  happened,  the  affidavit  said.They  allegedly  talked  about  burning  the  evidence  bag  but  keeping  the  Glock  in  a  car  belonging  to  Bankston's  father.  Delahoy,  Davis  and  Bankston  later  took  outdoor  target  practice  with  the  "murder  weapon,"  the  affidavit  said.Last  Saturday,  nearly  a  week  after  the  slayings,  Rushing  and  his  four  friends  --  described  as  polite  young  men  and  good  students  --  were  arrested  after  investigators  discovered  holes  in  their  stories,  police  said.The  slayings  were  supposed  to  happen  earlier.  Two  days  before  the  January  20  shooting,  police  said,  Uwe  Rushing  bumped  into  a  masked  man  as  he  was  leaving  the  house.  The  masked  man  ran  off.A  couple  of  days  later,  police  responded  to  a  2:05  a.m.  call  of  a  shooting  at  the  Rushing  home.  The  bodies  of  the  father  and  son  were  found  in  the  living  room.  Thorsten  Rushing  told  investigators  that  two  men  entered  the  home  through  a  rear  door,  and  one  of  them  shot  his  father  and  brother  before  Rushing  got  a  shotgun  and  fired  at  the  men,  who  fled.Florida  community  reels  after  mom  kills  son,  daughter,  self"The  story  and  the  evidence  and  the  crime  scene  just  didn't  add  up  to  where  it  was  making  any  sense,"  said  Capt.  Craig  Akard,  Lawton  police  spokesman.Further  investigation,  including  consultations  with  the  medical  examiner,  began  to  unravel  the  version  of  events  recounted  by  Rushing  and  his  friends,  police  said.The  motive  has  not  been  confirmed,  Akard  said,  but  he  added  that  there  was  "a  little  bit  of  turmoil"  in  the  household."Most  of  the  people  we  talked  to  said  the  family  was,  I  guess  you  could  say,  the  Three  Musketeers,"  Akard  said.  "They  got  along.  They  did  stuff  together.  But  now  that  this  happened,  we're  starting  to  hear,  'OK,  maybe  it  wasn't  quite  as  good  as  people  said  it  was.'

Gloria,  one  of  three  children  the  couple  adopted  from  Africa,  died  in  January  of  last  year.A  verdict  in  the  case  is  expected  on  March  27.The  prosecutor,  repeating  the  arguments  he  gave  in  the  last  hearing  in  the  case,  argued  that  the  evidence  proved  the  Huangs  had  deliberately  starved  Gloria.He  said  that  in  intentionally  neglecting  to  take  the  girl  to  a  doctor  when  they  found  out  she  had  not  eaten  for  days,  the  couple  caused  her  death.Medical  reports  presented  to  the  court  concluded  that  the  victim  died  of  starvation  and  that  her  body  was  emaciated,  he  said.  He  also  said  that  witnesses  testified  that  the  girl  was  locked  up  in  her  room  as  punishment  and  that  she  was  deprived  of  food.The  prosecutor  also  painted  a  picture  of  Grace  and  Matthew  Huang  as  inhumane  people  who  had  been  cheaply  sold  their  adopted  child  by  her  poverty-stricken  parents  in  Africa.Brother  says  he  saw  her  eatDefense  lawyer  Sami  Abou-Sheikha,  who  asked  for  an  acquittal  in  the  case,  insisted  on  his  clients'  innocence  and  said  Gloria  died  of  reasons  that  had  nothing  to  do  with  her  parents'  actions.Referring  to  the  same  reports  as  the  prosecutor,  he  said  the  girl  had  an  inflamed  pancreas  and  lung,  that  her  stool  showed  traces  of  food  that  was  one  or  two  days  old,  and  that  her  bladder  retained  liquid.He  also  reminded  the  court  that  Gloria's  brother  had  testified  that  he  had  seen  her  eat  a  short  while  before  her  death  and  that  she  had  been  playing  with  her  siblings  on  that  day.The  attorney  also  said  that  Gloria  always  had  water  bottles  in  her  room  and,  even  if  not,  she  had  access  to  water  from  the  bathroom  in  her  room.  Gloria  also  had  a  history  of  eating  disorders,  as  shown  by  medical  documents,  he  said.Travel  banThe  Huangs  appealed  to  the  court  to  lift  a  travel  ban  preventing  them  from  leaving  Qatar  and  presented  a  psychiatrist's  report  indicating  that  their  two  sons  were  suffering  as  a  result  of  their  long  absence.  The  U.S.-based  doctor  is  overseeing  therapy  of  the  boys,  who  were  separated  from  their  parents  after  their  arrest  and  taken  back  home  with  a  relative.Their  request  to  lift  the  travel  ban  was  denied."We  have  lost  our  daughter,  and  our  sons  have  lost  their  sister,"  Matthew  Huang  said  outside  the  courtroom."This  court  has  taken  more  than  a  year  of  our  lives,  and  the  process  has  only  made  it  worse.  In  the  midst  of  our  innocence,  we  feel  that  we  have  been  kidnapped,  and  we  just  want  to  go  home."U.S.  Embassy  representatives  were  also  present  for  the  hearing.READ:  Qatar  set  deadline  by  FIFA  over  conditions  for  migrant  workersJournalist  Riham  Schebl  reported  from  Doha,  and  Laura  Smith-Spark  wrote  in  London.</TEXT></DOC>

Thousands  of  veterans  were  forced  to  wait  months  for  simple  screening  tests  like  colonoscopies,  and  by  the  time  they  got  diagnosed,  it  was  too  late.Hospital  delays  are  killing  America's  war  veteransThe  wait  lists  for  gastrointestinal  appointments  at  the  hospitals  number  in  the  thousands  and  go  back  as  far  as  2010.  Both  hospitals  say  the  wait  list  issues  have  been  resolved,  but  according  to  the  visiting  members  of  Congress,  the  VA  still  cannot  explain  why  or  who  was  responsible  for  the  poor  treatment  of  veterans.Rep.  John  Barrow,  a  Georgia  Democrat  whose  district  includes  the  Charlie  Norwood  VA  center,  said  Congress  has  "a  duty  to  make  sure  that  the  veterans  who  serve  get  the  best  health  care  possible.  And  it  is  very  obvious  that  for  too  long  and  for  too  many  folks  that  hasn't  happened."Citing  a  lack  of  any  disciplinary  action  and  lack  of  ability  to  identify  who  at  the  VA  caused  the  backlogs  to  exist,  Barrow  told  reporters,  "Our  goal  here  today  is  to  try  to  get  to  the  bottom  of  what  happened  and  to  prevent  this  from  ever  happening  again.  What's  important  (is  for)  folks  to  understand  this  is  just  one  step  of  a  multistage  affair  to  get  to  the  bottom  of  what  happened  and  to  hold  accountable  those  who  were  responsible."The  Veterans  Affairs  Committee  has  been  looking  into  problems  at  VA  medical  centers  for  the  past  year  and  says  the  VA  administration  continues  to  stonewall  and  withhold  information  the  congressmen  believe  is  critical  to  understanding  why  the  VA  appears  to  be  run  so  poorly.  The  VA  has  also  refused  CNN's  repeated  requests  to  interview  Secretary  of  Veterans  Affairs  Eric  Shinseki  or  any  other  VA  official  on  camera.VA  hospital  apologizes  for  deathsMiller  said  the  practice  at  the  VA  seems  to  be  to  hold  no  one  accountable  for  errors,  and  instead  transfer  poorly  performing  executives  and  employees  to  other  facilities  instead  of  firing  them.In  an  interview  with  CNN,  Miller  said  he  and  his  committee  will  continue  to  demand  to  know  the  names  of  those  responsible  and  to  demand  disciplinary  action.  "That's  why  we  asked  the  question  again  today  ...  tell  us  exactly  who  was  disciplined  and  how."  Miller  said,  "I  don't  want  to  hear  the  excuse  anymore  that  it  was,  'well,  it  was  multifaceted,  there  were  many  people  involved.'...  Well,  if  there  were  many  people  involved,  then  they  all  need  to  go."Miller,  who  said  he  has  been  reluctant  to  make  his  investigations  political,  did  say  it  is  time  the  White  House  starts  paying  attention  to  the  deteriorating  treatment  of  the  nation's  veterans.  He  said  he  has  been  frustrated  by  a  lack  of  cooperation  from  the  Veterans  Administration  leadership,  and  that  Shinseki  has  not  paid  enough  attention  to  the  medical  problems  at  VA  medical  centers.  Miller  also  said  it  is  time  President  Obama  pay  as  much  attention  to  what  is  happening  at  VA  medical  centers  as  he  does  to  what's  happening  in  Washington  or  Hawaii,  a  reference  to  the  president's  recent  vacation  to  his  home  state."It's  time  for  him  (Shinseki)  to  show  some  passion.  And  certainly  it's  time  to  show  some  passion  from  the  President.  I  mean,  the  fact  that  we've  had  veterans  who  have  died  in  the  very  facilities  that  are  supposed  to  be  taking  care  of  them,  and  not  by  natural  means,  by  means  that  could  have  been  prevented,  is  egregious."The  congressman  said  his  group  has  given  the  VA  30  days  to  respond  to  their  requests  for  those  answers.</TEXT></DOC>

Jan  Brewer,  a  Republican  and  onetime  small  business  owner  who  vetoed  similar  legislation  last  year  but  has  expressed  the  right  of  business  owners  to  deny  service.The  measure  has  drawn  criticism  from  Democrats  and  business  groups  who  said  it  would  sanction  discrimination  and  open  the  state  to  the  risk  of  damaging  litigation."With  the  express  consent  of  Republicans  in  this  Legislature,  many  Arizonans  will  find  themselves  members  of  a  separate  and  unequal  class  under  this  law  because  of  their  sexual  orientation,"  Anna  Tovar,  the  state  senate  Democratic  minority  leader,  said  in  a  statement.  "This  bill  may  also  open  the  door  to  discriminate  based  on  race,  familial  status,  religion,  sex,  national  origin,  age  or  disability."In  a  letter  to  Brewer  on  Friday,  the  Greater  Phoenix  Economic  Council  urged  the  governor  to  veto  Senate  Bill  1062,  saying  the  "legislation  will  likely  have  profound,  negative  effects  on  our  business  community  for  years  to  come.""The  legislation  places  businesses  currently  in  Arizona,  as  well  as  those  looking  to  locate  here,  in  potentially  damaging  risk  of  litigation,  and  costly,  needless  legal  disputes,"  council  President  Barry  Broome  wrote,  adding  that  four  unidentified  companies  have  vowed  to  locate  elsewhere  if  the  legislation  is  signed.He  added,  "With  major  events  approaching  in  the  coming  year,  including  Super  Bowl  XLIX,  Arizona  will  be  the  center  of  the  world's  stage.  This  legislation  has  the  potential  of  subjecting  the  Super  Bowl,  and  major  events  surrounding  it,  to  the  threats  of  boycotts."The  bill  is  being  pushed  by  the  Center  for  Arizona  Policy,  a  conservative  group  opposed  to  abortion  and  same-sex  marriage.  The  group  has  justified  the  measure  on  grounds  that  the  proposal  protects  people  against  increasingly  activist  federal  courts."As  we  witness  hostility  towards  people  of  faith  grow  like  never  before,  we  must  take  this  opportunity  to  speak  up  for  religious  liberty,"  the  group  said  on  its  website,  asking  people  to  contact  Brewer  and  urge  her  to  sign  the  bill.  "The  great  news  is  that  SB  1062  protects  your  right  to  live  and  work  according  to  your  faith."Cathi  Herrod,  the  center's  president,  told  CNN  on  Friday,  "The  Arizona  bill  has  a  very  simple  premise,  that  Americans  should  be  free  to  live  and  work  according  to  their  religious  faith.  It's  simply  about  protecting  religious  liberty  and  nothing  else."Herrod  said  the  bill's  opponents  are  "showing  unbelievable  hostility  toward  religious  beliefs.""America  still  stands  for  the  principle  that  religious  beliefs  matter  (for)  something  in  this  country,  that  we  have  the  right  to  freely  exercise  our  religious  beliefs,"  she  said.But  Robert  Boston,  a  spokesman  for  the  Washington-based  Americans  United  for  Separation  of  Church  and  State,  told  CNN  the  legislation  would  "fling  the  door  wide  open  to  discrimination,  not  just  against  gay  people,  but  basically  to  any  class  of  individuals  that  a  religious  fundamentalist  decides  he  or  she  doesn't  want  to  deal  with."He  added,  "A  woman  who  is  pregnant  out  of  wedlock,  for  example,  'Well,  out  the  door,  you  don't  get  served  in  my  business.'  "The  Arizona  legislation  was  passed  as  conservative  states  work  to  counter  laws  legalizing  same-sex  marriage.  Arizona  voters  approved  a  ban  on  same-sex  marriage  as  a  state  constitutional  amendment  in  2008.The  American  Civil  Liberties  Union  of  Arizona  called  the  bill  "unnecessary  and  discriminatory.""What  today's  bill  does  is  allow  private  individuals  and  businesses  to  use  religion  to  discriminate,  sending  a  message  that  Arizona  is  intolerant  and  unwelcoming,"  the  group  said  in  a  statement.Some  Republican  legislators  have  defended  the  bill  as  a  First  Amendment  issue,  while  Democrats  dismissed  it  as  an  attack  on  gays  and  lesbians."We  saw  it  with  Russia  and  the  Olympics,"  said  state  Rep.  Chad  Campbell,  a  Phoenix  Democrat,  who  voted  against  the  legislation,  according  to  KPHO.  "I  mean,  hey,  I'm  not  sure  if  Russia  is  any  less  progressive  than  Arizona  now  against  gay  rights  to  be  quite  honest  with  you."Monica  Jones,  a  Phoenix  resident,  agreed:  "Think  about  what  this  says  to  the  rest  of  the  country.  We  are  not  Russia.  We  are  a  first  nation.  And,  as  Americans,  we  have  civil  rights."</TEXT></DOC>

But  in  what's  being  called  a  breakthrough  in  regenerative  medicine,  researchers  have  found  a  way  to  make  stem  cells  by  purposely  putting  mature  cells  under  stress.Two  new  studies  published  Wednesday  in  the  journal  Nature  describe  a  method  of  taking  mature  cells  from  mice  and  turning  them  into  embryonic-like  stem  cells,  which  can  be  coaxed  into  becoming  any  other  kind  of  cell  possible.  One  method  effectively  boils  down  to  this:  Put  the  cells  in  an  acidic  environment."I  think  the  process  we've  described  mimics  Mother  Nature,"  said  Dr.  Charles  Vacanti,  director  of  the  laboratory  for  Tissue  Engineering  and  Regenerative  Medicine  at  Brigham  &  Women's  Hospital  in  Boston  and  senior  author  on  one  of  the  studies.  "It's  a  natural  process  that  cells  normally  respond  to."Both  studies  represent  a  new  step  in  the  thriving  science  of  stem  cell  research,  which  seeks  to  develop  therapies  to  repair  bodily  damage  and  cure  disease  by  being  able  to  insert  cells  that  can  grow  into  whatever  tissues  or  organs  are  needed.  If  you  take  an  organ  that's  functioning  at  10%  of  normal  and  bring  it  up  to  25%  functionality,  that  could  greatly  reduce  the  likelihood  of  fatality  in  that  particular  disease,  Vacanti  said.This  method  by  Vacanti  and  his  colleagues  "is  truly  the  simplest,  cheapest,  fastest  method  ever  achieved  for  reprogramming  [cells],"  said  Jeff  Karp,  associate  professor  of  medicine  at  the  Brigham  &  Women's  Hospital  and  principal  faculty  member  at  the  Harvard  Stem  Cell  Institute.  He  was  not  involved  in  the  study.Scientists  grow  minibrains  from  stem  cellsBefore  the  technique  described  in  Nature,  the  leading  candidates  for  creating  stem  cells  artificially  were  those  derived  from  embryos  and  stem  cells  from  adult  cells  that  require  the  insertion  of  DNA  to  become  reprogrammable.Stem  cells  are  created  the  natural  way  every  time  an  egg  that  is  fertilized  begins  to  divide.  During  the  first  four  to  five  days  of  cell  division,  so-called  pluripotent  stem  cells  develop.  They  have  the  ability  to  turn  into  any  cell  in  the  body.  Removing  stem  cells  from  the  embryo  destroys  it,  which  is  why  this  type  of  research  is  controversial.Researchers  have  also  developed  a  method  of  producing  embryonic-like  stem  cells  by  taking  a  skin  cell  from  a  patient,  for  example,  and  adding  a  few  bits  of  foreign  DNA  to  reprogram  the  skin  cell  to  become  like  an  embryo  and  produce  pluripotent  cells,  too.  However,  these  cells  are  usually  used  for  research  because  researchers  do  not  want  to  give  patients  cells  with  extra  DNA.The  new  method  does  not  involve  the  destruction  of  embryos  or  inserting  new  genetic  material  into  cells,  Vacanti  said.  It  also  avoids  the  problem  of  rejection:  The  body  may  reject  stem  cells  that  came  from  other  people,  but  this  method  uses  an  individual's  own  mature  cells."It  was  really  surprising  to  see  that  such  a  remarkable  transformation  could  be  triggered  simply  by  stimuli  from  outside  of  the  cell,"  said  Haruko  Obokata  of  the  Riken  Center  for  Developmental  Biology  in  Japan  in  a  news  conference  this  week.The  process  is  called  STAP,  which  stands  for  "stimulus-triggered  acquisition  of  pluripotency."  Karp  estimates  that  the  method  is  five  to  10  times  faster  than  other  means  of  reprogramming  cells.Have  a  taste  of  the  world's  first  stem  cell  burgerResearchers  used  mice  to  study  the  STAP  cell  phenomenon.  They  genetically  altered  the  mice  donating  stem  cells  to  "label"  those  cells  with  the  color  green.  For  instance,  they  modified  mice  such  that  their  cells  would  light  up  green  in  response  to  a  particular  wavelength  of  light.The  scientists  exposed  blood  cells  from  these  genetically  altered  mice  to  an  acidic  environment.  A  few  days  later,  they  saw  that  these  cells  turned  into  the  embryonic-like  state  and  grew  in  spherical  clusters.Scientists  put  the  cell  clusters  into  a  mouse  embryo  that  had  not  been  genetically  modified.  It  turned  out,  the  implanted  clusters  could  form  tissues  in  all  of  the  organs  that  the  researchers  tested.  The  scientists  knew  that  the  cells  came  from  the  original  mouse  because  they  turned  green  when  exposed  to  a  particular  light.Besides  modifying  acidity,  researchers  also  stressed  the  cells  in  other  ways,  such  as  lowering  the  oxygen  environment  and  disrupting  the  cell  membrane.  Increasing  acidity  was  one  of  the  most  effective  methods  of  turning  mouse  blood  cells  into  STAP  cells.There  are,  of  course,  some  caveats.For  now,  the  STAP  cell  procedure  has  only  been  demonstrated  in  cells  from  young  mice.  The  effectiveness  in  humans,  and  the  risks,  are  unknown.Researchers  have  not  yet  shown  how  STAP  embryonic-like  stem  cells  compare  with  bona  fide  embryonic  stem  cells  or  induced  pluripotent  stem  cells,  Karp  said.Also,  although  the  study  was  "rigorous"  and  "well-controlled,"  it  did  not  demonstrate  exactly  why  the  stress  on  the  cells  caused  them  to  become  STAP  cells,  Karp  said.As  with  everything  in  science,  more  research  is  required  to  confirm  the  findings  and  learn  more  about  the  implications.Vacanti  hopes  the  process  could  get  tested  clinically  in  humans  within  three  years.  He  noted  that  induced  pluripotent  stem  cells  are  already  being  explored  in  Japan  in  humans  and  the  same  "platforms"  could  be  utilized  for  STAP  cells.STAP  cells  also  have  an  additional  property  that  embryonic  stem  cells  and  induced  pluripotent  stem  cells  do  not:  They  can  become  placental  cells.  Scientists  can  manipulate  them  to  contribute  to  tissues  of  either  the  embryo  or  the  placenta.What  therapeutic  purpose  growing  more  placenta  could  serve,  Vacanti  isn't  sure  --  unless,  that  is,  you  wanted  to  create  an  embryo  and  bring  it  to  term.Cloning  stem  cells:  What  does  it  mean?But  that's  not  the  goal  of  this  research.  Vacanti  and  colleagues  want  to  explore  possible  ties  to  cancer  from  the  STAP  cell  process;  it  could  potentially  help  to  model  the  process  by  which  cells  become  cancerous  and  explore  if  there  is  a  way  to  reverse  the  process.Stem  cell  research  as  a  field  has  been  growing  at  "lightning  speed,"  Karp  said.New  reprogramming  approaches  to  stem  cells  are  emerging  all  the  time,  he  said,  and  this  one  in  particular  "looks  incredibly  promising."Follow  Elizabeth  Landau  on  Twitter  at  @lizlandau</TEXT></DOC>

Remove  ovaries  by  35</TITLE><TIME>Tue,  25  Feb  2014  07:12:46  EST</TIME><ABSTRACT>Women  with  BRCA1  mutations  should  remove  their  ovaries  by  age  35,  according  to  a  study  that  published  online  Monday.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  A  new  study  on  healthy  women  with  genetic  mutations  that  sharply  increase  the  risk  of  breast  and  ovarian  cancer  supports  the  old  adage:  An  ounce  of  prevention  is  worth  a  pound  of  cure.The  report,  published  online  Monday  in  the  Journal  of  Clinical  Oncology,  studied  nearly  5,800  women  with  specific  genetic  mutations  called  BRCA1  and  BRCA2.Researchers  found  that  women  with  BRCA1  and  BRCA2  mutations  who  protectively  had  their  ovaries  removed  reduced  their  risk  of  ovarian,  fallopian  tube,  or  peritoneal  cancer  by  80%,  and  their  overall  risk  of  death  by  77%.BRCA  stands  for  breast  cancer  susceptibility  genes,  a  class  of  genes  known  as  tumor  suppressors.  Mutations  of  the  BRCA1  and  BRCA2  genes  have  been  linked  to  hereditary  breast  and  ovarian  cancer.According  to  Monday's  study,  women  with  BRCA1  mutations  should  have  preventive  ovarian  surgery--  known  as  prophylactic  oophorectomy  --  by  age  35,  as  waiting  appears  to  increase  the  risk  of  ovarian  cancer.  In  contrast,  women  with  BRCA2  mutations  can  safely  delay  surgery  until  their  40s,  the  study  suggests,  as  their  risk  of  ovarian  cancer  is  not  as  strong.The  new  research  provides  doctors  with  additional  information  to  support  the  risk-reducing  surgery,  said  ovarian  cancer  expert  Dr.  Shannon  Westin.Removing  the  ovaries  in  these  patients  "provides  more  benefits  than  just  the  reduction  in  ovarian  cancer  because  this  study  shows  there's  a  survival  benefit  that  has  not  been  shown  this  clearly  before,"  she  said.7  questions  on  cancer  gene  testingWestin  is  an  assistant  professor  in  the  Department  of  Gynecologic  Oncology  and  Reproductive  Medicine  at  the  MD  Anderson  Cancer  Center  in  Houston.  She  was  not  involved  in  the  study.According  to  the  American  Cancer  Society,  previous  studies  have  shown  that  removing  the  ovaries  of  a  premenopausal  woman  with  BRCA  mutations  can  reduce  the  risk  of  ovarian  cancer  by  85%  to  95%,  and  the  risk  of  breast  cancer  is  cut  by  50%  to  60%.But  Monday's  study  is  the  first  study  to  show  an  overall  mortality  reduction  benefit."To  me,  waiting  to  have  oophorectomy  until  after  35  is  too  much  of  a  chance  to  take,"  said  Steven  Narod,  professor  of  medicine  at  the  University  of  Toronto  in  Canada,  and  the  study's  lead  author.  "These  data  are  so  striking  that  we  believe  prophylactic  oophorectomy  by  age  35  should  become  a  universal  standard  for  women  with  BRCA1  mutations."BRCA  mutations  grabbed  national  headlines  last  year  when  actress  Angelina  Jolie  announced  she  carries  a  mutation  of  the  BRCA1  gene  and  had  underwent  a  preventive  double  mastectomy  at  age  37  to  reduce  her  risk  of  breast  caner.Jolie's  mother,  actress  and  producer  Marcheline  Bertrand,  died  of  ovarian  cancer  in  2007  at  the  age  of  56."My  doctors  estimated  that  I  had  an  87  percent  risk  of  breast  cancer  and  a  50  percent  risk  of  ovarian  cancer,  although  the  risk  is  different  in  the  case  of  each  woman,"  Jolie  wrote  in  a  New  York  Times  op-ed  article  in  May."Once  I  knew  that  this  was  my  reality,  I  decided  to  be  proactive  and  to  minimize  the  risk  as  much  I  could,"  she  said.  "I  started  with  the  breasts,  as  my  risk  of  breast  cancer  is  higher  than  my  risk  of  ovarian  cancer,  and  the  surgery  is  more  complex."Dr.  Agustin  Garcia,  an  associate  professor  of  Clinical  Medicine  at  Keck  Medicine  of  University  of  Southern  California,  said  another  important  aspect  of  the  study  is  how  it  breaks  down  the  differences  researchers  saw  between  BRCA1  and  BRCA  2  carriers."In  most  of  the  guidelines,  we  don't  distinguish  between  the  two,  but  this  study  separated  the  two  groups  for  potential  age  for  prophylactic  oophorectomy,"  said  Garcia,  who  was  not  involved  in  the  research.He  said  the  study  tells  women  with  the  BRCA2  mutation  they  can  probably  wait  until  they  are  50  to  have  their  ovaries  and  fallopian  tubes  removed."These  results  could  make  a  real  difference  for  women  with  BRCA  mutations,  who  face  tough  decisions  about  whether  and  when  to  undergo  a  prophylactic  oophorectomy,"  Don  Dizon,  a  member  of  the  cancer  communications  committee  at  the  American  Society  of  Clinical  Oncology,  said  in  a  statement."Importantly,  for  women  who  will  be  undergoing  this  surgery  early  in  life,  it's  reassuring  to  see  that  it  carries  long-lasting  benefits,  substantially  reducing  ovarian  cancer  risk  as  well  as  total  mortality  risk,"  he  added.Why  more  women  are  choosing  double  mastectomiesCNN's  Ed  Payne  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

A  satirist  who  writes  for  the  New  Yorker,  she's  confessed  that  the  book  --  about  an  unnamed,  neurotic  college  girl  who  spends  10  years  pining  for  a  pretentious  PhD  student  --  is  based  on  her  own  experience  with  her  own  unnamed  douche  nugget,  which  is  probably  why  it  feels  SO  right.Cosmopolitan:  10  Ways  to  Finally  Get  Over  Him2.  "This  Is  How  You  Lose  Her"  by  Junot  DiazThe  lovelorn  main  character  routinely  screws  over  the  women  he's  dating,  but  you  can't  help  but  like  him  a  little  bit,  since  he's  one  of  those  inimitable  Diaz  protagonists.  It's  snappy  and  fun  to  read,  and  the  final  story  will  remind  you  that  men  need  to  realize  they're  assholes  before  they  become  non-assholes,  which  sometimes  takes  awhile.3.  "Ethan  Frome"  by  Edith  WhartonA  departure  from  Wharton's  normal  New  York  society  jam,  this  sad-as-hell  stark  and  beautiful  novella  is  about  a  man  with  a  sickly  wife  living  in  a  small  town  who  falls  for  her  pretty  young  caretaker.  It  does  not  end  well.  People  have  worse  lives  than  you.  Now  go  change  out  of  those  sweatpants,  muchacha.Cosmopolitan:  24  Things  Not  to  Say  to  a  Girl  Who's  Been  Cheated  On4.  "I  Don't  Care  About  Your  Band"  by  Julie  KlausnerI'll  let  Ms.  Klausner,  a  comedian  and  successful  podcaster,  sell  this  for  you."As  a  kid,  I  took  my  cues  from  [Miss]  Piggy,  chasing  every  would-be  Kermit  in  my  vicinity  with  porcine  voracity  and  what  I  thought  was  feminine  charm.  Remember  how  content  Kermit  was,  just  strumming  his  banjo  on  a  tree  trunk  in  the  swamp?  That's  the  guy  I've  chased  my  whole  life,  killing  myself  trying  to  show  him  how  fabulous  I  am.  Kermit  never  appreciated  what  he  had  in  Piggy,  because  she  was  just  one  great  thing  about  his  awesome  life.  I  wonder  how  many  guys  from  my  generation  looked  to  Kermit  as  an  example  of  what  the  coolest  guy  in  the  room  looks  like.  How  maybe  they  think  it's  fine  to  defer  the  advances  of  the  fabulous  women  they  know  will  always  be  there,  while  they  dreamily  pursue  creative  endeavors  and  dabble  with  other  contenders."GAH,  IT'S  JUST  SO  GOOD.Cosmopolitan:  A  Complete  Valentine's  Day  Schedule  for  a  Single  Woman5.  "Monica's  Story"  by  Andrew  MortonYes,  that  Monica.  You  might  feel  like  it's  confusing  that  this  book  is  on  the  list,  but  not  only  is  it  "Scandal"-level  entertainment  (and  real  life!),  you  also  look  back  at  the  1998  scandal  in  a  totally  different  way  than  you  might  have.  She  was  22  and  infatuated  with  a  manipulative  married  man.  Sure,  he  also  happened  to  be  the  most  powerful  guy  in  the  free  world,  but  the  story  is  more  relatable  than  you  might  think.  I  felt  stuff.6.  "Dolores  Claiborne"  by  Stephen  KingNot  for  the  faint-hearted.  A  blue-collar  housekeeper  in  a  police  station,  being  questioned  about  the  murder  of  her  longtime  employer,  an  eccentric  and  wealthy  elderly  woman  --  and  that's  just  where  it  starts.  The  heart  of  Dolores'  story  is  the  actions  she  takes  when  her  drunk,  abusive  husband  rapes  their  young  daughter.  It's  a  chilling  book  but  showcases  the  resilience  of  women,  even  those  trapped  in  unbearable  circumstances,  in  a  really  powerful  way.Cosmopolitan:  What  Guys  Say  Versus  What  They  Really  Mean7.  "Winesburg,  Ohio"  by  Sherwood  AndersonConnected  tales  of  a  small  town  and  its  residents,  who  are  mostly  lonely  and  sexually  repressed.  Not  as  bleak  as  "Ethan  Frome,"  but  similar  deal,  except  the  female  characters  are  more  human  and  complex.8.  "The  Position"  by  Meg  WolitzerThis  novel  tracks  a  suburban  family,  whose  mother  and  father  published  a  "The  Joy  of  Sex"-style  book  of  sex  positions  with  paintings  of  themselves  as  the  models,  over  a  period  of  about  20  years.  The  book  became  a  cult  success,  and  their  children  (two  girls  and  two  boys)  grow  up  in  its  shadow.  It  depicts  adult  relationships  in  a  very  realistic  but  still  interesting,  way  --  and  the  character  of  Holly,  the  older  girl,  is  fascinating.Cosmopolitan:  9  Things  He  Doesn't  Want  You  to  Know9.  "Random  Family:  Love,  Drugs,  Trouble  and  Coming  of  Age  In  The  Bronx"  by  Adrian  Nicole  LeBlancThis  sprawling  reported  non-fiction  book  is  so  absorbing  that  you'll  forget  about  all  your  problems.  LeBlanc,  a  journalist,  captures  the  tiniest  aspects  of  the  lives  of  two  teenage  Puerto  Rican  girls  as  they  grow  up  in  a  bad  neighborhood,  have  kids  young,  and  one  ends  up  in  prison  for  working  as  a  mill  girl  for  her  flashy  heroin-dealing  boyfriend.  (At  the  end  of  the  book,  they're  in  their  late  twenties  and  mid-thirties;  LeBlanc  spent  10  years  basically  living  with  their  families.)  But  LeBlanc  doesn't  condescend  to  the  women,  nor  does  she  criticize  their  choices.  She  simply  observes  and  reports,  and  her  dedication  shows  that  she  truly  cares  about  breaking  the  cycle  of  poverty.10.  "How  Did  You  Get  This  Number"  by  Sloane  CrosleyCrosley  is  like  your  smartest,  funniest  female  friend,  who  articulates  all  the  delights  and  inconveniences  about  being  a  young,  ambitious  woman  in  a  big  city  that  you've  always  felt  but  never  known  how  to  explain  it.  The  last  essay,  "Off  the  Back  of  a  Truck,"  is  about  Crosley's  relationship  with  a  guy  who  secretly  had  another  long-term  girlfriend  at  the  same  time.  The  girlfriend  eventually  finds  Crosley  in  the  guy's  phone  (under  "Doug")  and  calls  her.  It's  really  rough,  and  it  articulates  the  steps  of  breakups  in  a  way  that  will  confirm  you're  not  insane  for  wanting  to  smack  everyone  who  asks,  "How  long  were  you  dating?"Cosmopolitan:  Why  Dinner  On  The  First  Date  Is  The  WorstWhat  books  helped  you  move  on  after  a  break-up?

What's  the  trick?</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Walking  the  streets  of  the  world's  leading  fashion  capitals  --  New  York,  Paris,  Milan,  Tokyo  --  one  might  expect  to  see  women  strutting  sidewalks  in  the  most  avant-garde  of  outfits.After  all,  these  women  have  access  to  the  most  creative  fashion  minds  on  the  planet,  said  Eva  Chen,  editor  of  Lucky  magazine.  But  what  you  actually  see,  she  said,  is  a  flood  of  impeccably  dressed  women  wearing  black."It's  an  urban  uniform  to  wear  black  and  dark  colors,"  Chen  said.  "I  look  at  the  way  I  dress  and  how  my  editors  dress,  and  there  are  days  when  people  look  super  New  Yorky."But  why?  Here  are  the  secrets.Secret  No.  1:  Build  on  blackBlack,  navy,  brown  and  dark  greens  and  purples  are  practical  and  typical  winter  wear  colors.  On  a  blustery  winter  day,  these  dark  hues  are  thermodynamic  armor.  But  it's  the  artful  eye  of  an  urban  fashionista  that  turns  them  from  drab  to  fab.Women  in  New  York,  for  example,  effectively  color-code  their  closets,  Chen  said.  The  black  skirt  they  just  bought  will  pair  easily  with  the  black  blazer  they  already  own,  the  black  boots,  the  black  sweater,  the  black  shirt  that  are  already  in  their  closet.  "Black  is  always  chic,"  she  said,  so  there's  an  added  aspect  of  wardrobe  longevity."It's  easy  for  me,  when  I'm  shopping,  to  rationalize  a  little  black  dress,  a  blazer  or  a  motorcycle  jacket,"  said  Janelle  Lloyd  of  the  street  fashion  and  decor  blog  Girls  Off  Fifth."I  have  three  of  each  of  those  things  in  my  closet.  Those  are  things  you're  going  to  throw  on  every  day  and  look  chic  and  look  classic  and  wear  for  a  lot  of  different  occasions."Twenty-four  hour  transitions  are  the  key  to  Lloyd's  wardrobe.  It's  not  uncommon  for  one  day's  outfit  to  need  to  function  as  casual,  business,  cocktail  and  gala  wear.  The  safe  bet,  Lloyd  said,  is  on  black."We  don't  go  home  after  work  and  change,"  she  said  of  her  fellow  city-dwellers,  who  often  follow  a  full  day's  work  with  drinks,  dinner  and  the  periodic  gala  event."Instead,  you're  switching  from  a  flat  to  a  heel  or  you're  throwing  on  a  different  jacket  instead  of  your  blazer  from  work,"  she  said.  They  just  cart  the  makeup,  shoes  and  extra  jacket  needed  to  go  from  day  look  to  evening  look  inside  a  roomy  bag.Secret  No.  2:  Treat  neutrals  like  dark  colorsIn  the  fashion  world,  black  is  the  universal  color  of  style,  Chen  said.  The  day-to-day  wardrobes  of  busy  urban  women  are  built  on  black  and  other  dark  colors  like  navy.  (A  current  trend  is  mixing  black  and  navy  in  the  same  outfit,  Chen  noted.)  From  there,  they  add  color."As  an  editor,  two  years  ago  --  which  kind  of  gives  an  insight  into  my  fashion  mind  --  my  New  Year's  resolution  was  to  start  wearing  more  color.  And  by  color,  I  meant  gray,"  she  said.That's  part  of  the  secret  to  big  city  style,  she  said.  Fashionable  urbanites  think  differently  about  color.For  example,  layers  of  pale  neutrals,  including  such  business-appropriate  colors  as  beige,  khaki,  camel,  blush,  white,  pale  blue  and  cream,  are  not  only  beautiful  in  their  own  right,  Lloyd  said,  but  go  together  as  easily  as  the  utilitarian,  darker  options."They  are  really  a  staple  in  a  woman's  wardrobe.  Urban  women  love  to  look  fashion-forward,  but  we're  also  really  busy,  and  these  colors  are  easy  to  put  on,"  the  blogger  said.Sarah  Owen,  Street  Style  expert  for  trend  forecaster  company  WGSN,  studies  fashion  from  the  runways  and  the  streets.  In  the  same  way  that  catwalk  trends  tend  to  trickle  down  into  mainstream  fashion,  street  trends  tend  to  "bubble  up,"  she  said.  Somewhere  in  the  middle  is  how  the  majority  of  urban  women  dress.The  dark  palette  city  women  prefer  is  available  to  shoppers  through  both  high  and  fast  fashion.  Although  runway  fashions  and  magazine  spreads  might  be  dominated  by  color  and  pattern,  Chen  said,  designers  know  that  their  customers  value  practicality.  They  often  create  commercial  collections  of  their  runway  lines  that  feature  simpler  silhouettes  executed  in  black,  navy  and  beige,  she  said.Secret  No.  3:  Punctuate  with  strong  colorLest  these  ladies  be  thought  of  as  one-note  dressers,  Chen  points  out  that  there  are  a  few  bright  colors  that  regularly  punctuate  big  city  fashions."What  we're  seeing  a  lot  here  in  New  York  and  also  on  the  runway  is  a  bright,  electric  blue,"  she  said.  Shocking  blue  is  a  great  color  to  break  up  a  dark  wardrobe  with  because  it's  a  strong  statement  color,  but  at  the  same  time,  it  could  be  considered  neutral,  Chen  said."It's  not  girly;  it's  not  too  muddy  or  earthy;  it's  just  a  strong  fashion  color,"  she  said.A  strong  red  is  also  a  New  York  favorite,  especially  on  lips,  Chen  said.For  the  upcoming  spring  and  summer  seasons,  dark  forest  green  has  become  another  power  color,  as  evidenced  by  the  recent  collections  by  Marni,  Bottega  Veneta  and  Gucci.  "Everyone  here  at  the  (Lucky  magazine)  office  is  going  crazy  about  forest  green,"  Chen  said.Lloyd,  who  calls  New  York  home  now,  spent  her  formative  years  in  Atlanta,  where  clothing  tends  to  be  more  colorful,  she  said."Women  in  the  South  have  been  peacocks  for  many  years,"  she  said.  "Southern  culture  has  always  been  very  strong,  so  they're  not  necessarily  going  to  look  to  a  city  like  New  York  for  their  fashion  choices.  They'll  make  their  own."It's  a  fashion  sense  that  makes  perfect  sense  to  Owen.  U.S.  cities  with  Latin  American  influence  like  Miami  are  more  willing  to  experiment  with  vibrant  color."Those  places  in  warmer  regions,  like  Brazil,  Ibiza,  when  I  go  to  Mexico  and  cover  Fashion  Week  there  as  well,  everyone  is  in  head-to-toe  color,"  she  said.  "Cities  like  New  York  and  Tokyo  are  a  little  more  grounded  in  their  seriousness  and  their  sophisticated  color  combinations  and  palettes."Of  course,  the  tonal  differences  between  cities  go  beyond  color.  When  Chen  lived  in  Los  Angeles  in  2013,  she  looked  forward  to  wearing  all  her  "wildly  impractical"  shoes,  since  she  would  be  driving  to  work  instead  of  walking."That  said,  when  I  was  in  LA,  I  didn't  wear  any  of  those  shoes,"  she  lamented.  Turns  out,  that  city's  style  was  way  more  relaxed  than  she  expected.</TEXT></DOC>

So  while  Friday's  California  Superior  Court  hearing  did  signal  apparent  progress  in  the  hot-button  case,  it  does  not  represent  a  final  agreement.Earlier  in  this  hearing,  the  judge  asked  attorneys  for  the  McMath  family  and  Children's  Hospital  Oakland  to  confer  to  attempt  to  settle  the  issue  of  what  will  happen  with  Jahi.After  this  hearing  broke,  representatives  for  both  the  family  and  hospital  headed  to  federal  court.There,  a  magistrate  will  oversee  mandatory  talks  between  representatives  of  the  hospital  and  the  family,  CNN  affiliate  KTVU  reported.Both  hearings  occurred  on  the  same  day  that  the  coroner  for  Alameda  County  issued  a  death  certificate  for  Jahi.  This  action  is  not  directly  connected  to  Friday's  pair  of  legal  proceedings.Meanwhile,  a  deadline  looms.  A  judge  has  ruled  that  Jahi  can  be  cut  off  a  ventilator  at  5  p.m.  Tuesday.Bleeding  profuselyLast  month,  Jahi  had  surgery  to  remove  her  tonsils,  adenoids  and  extra  sinus  tissue.  Doctors  had  recommended  the  surgery  to  treat  pediatric  obstructive  sleep  apnea,  a  condition  that  made  her  stop  breathing  in  her  sleep  and  caused  other  medical  problems.Before  the  surgery,  Jahi  was  worried  that  she  would  never  wake  up,  according  to  her  uncle.  She  seemed  fine  after  the  surgery  and  asked  for  a  Popsicle  because  her  throat  hurt.Opinion:  Let  the  parents  decideIt  wasn't  long  before  something  went  terribly  wrong.  In  the  intensive  care  unit,  the  girl  began  bleeding  profusely  --  an  image  that  her  mother  said  would  be  forever  seared  in  her  mind.According  to  family  members,  Jahi  went  into  cardiac  arrest.  Days  later,  she  was  declared  brain  dead.Hospital  officials  have  said  privacy  laws  prevent  them  from  discussing  details  of  the  case.More  supportThe  family  of  Terri  Schiavo  has  joined  the  battle  recently."Together  with  our  team  of  experts,  Terri's  Network  believes  Jahi's  case  is  representative  of  a  very  deep  problem  within  the  U.S.  healthcare  system  --  particularly  those  issues  surrounding  the  deaths  of  patients  within  the  confines  of  hospital  corporations,  which  have  a  vested  financial  interest  in  discontinuing  life,"  the  Terri  Schiavo  Life  &  Hope  Network  said  in  a  statement.Schiavo  was  a  brain-damaged  woman  who  died  in  2005  after  living  on  a  feeding  tube  for  more  than  a  decade.  She  was  the  subject  of  a  lengthy  legal  battle  between  her  parents  and  her  husband,  Michael  Schiavo,  who  maintained  that  she  wouldn't  have  wanted  to  live  in  a  "persistent  vegetative  state."The  organization  said  it  has  been  overseeing  the  efforts  of  several  groups  to  help  get  Jahi  transferred  out  of  Children's  Hospital  Oakland  and  brought  "to  a  safe  place."Jahi's  family  said  Tuesday  that  it  had  found  a  facility  in  New  York  willing  to  take  her.  The  Oakland  hospital  "refused  to  agree  to  allow  us  to  proceed  in  that  matter,"  Jahi's  uncle  Omari  Sealey  said.The  hospital  denied  the  accusation."We  have  done  everything  to  assist  the  family  of  Jahi  McMath  in  their  quest  to  take  the  deceased  body  of  their  daughter  to  another  medical  facility,"  hospital  spokesman  Sam  Singer  said."To  date,  they  have  been  unwilling  or  unable  to  provide  a  physician  to  perform  the  procedures  necessary,  transportation,  or  a  facility  that  would  accept  a  dead  person  on  a  ventilator.  Our  hearts  and  thoughts  go  out  to  them  in  this  tragic  situation,  but  the  statements  being  made  by  their  attorney  and  some  family  members  are  misleading  and  untrue."Family  attorney  Christopher  Dolan  had  accused  the  hospital  of  being  "hell-bent"  on  ending  Jahi's  life.In  addition  to  the  coroner,  a  judge  has  declared  Jahi  brain  dead  as  well.  Doctors  say  there's  no  chance  she  will  come  back  to  life.Sealey  said  Wednesday  that  the  family  still  hopes  to  move  her  to  another  facility.He  accused  the  hospital  of  starving  his  niece  by  not  using  a  feeding  tube  to  provide  her  with  nutrients.Singer  said  a  judge  had  dismissed  the  family's  request  for  additional  medical  procedures  Tuesday,  including  a  feeding  tube.CNN's  Greg  Botelho  and  Elizabeth  Landau  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

New  Year's  Eve  2013  on  TV  looked  a  lot  like  the  year  itself.Celebs  were  all  over  TV  ringing  in  2014  with  performances.  It  wasn't  a  "Wrecking  Ball,"  but  Cyrus  sang  before  the  ball  dropped  on  "Dick  Clark's  New  Year's  Rockin'  Eve  with  Ryan  Seacrest  "  on  ABC.  Clad  in  a  gold  sequined  outfit  and  a  furry  coat,  Cyrus  joked  that  "This  is  the  most  clothes  I've  been  in  in  2013."She  was  joined  on  the  show  with  Thicke,  who  also  performed,  as  well  as  several  other  musical  acts  including  Icona  Pop  and  Macklemore  and  Ryan  Lewis.  "The  View's"  Jenny  McCarthy  co-hosted  with  Seacrest  on  the  show  that  after  more  than  40  years  has  been  a  New  Year's  Eve  institution.Earlier  Seacrest  joked  that  he'd  be  watching  Cyrus  and  her  crazy  antics."This  is  a  ball  she  cannot  touch,"  Seacrest  said.  "This  one  she  cannot.  She's  not  allowed  to.  But  she  can  be  standing  under  it  when  it  goes  down,  when  it  drops."Over  on  NBC,  "The  Voice"  judge  Blake  Shelton  teamed  up  with  that  show's  host,  Carson  Daly,  for  "New  Year's  Eve  With  Carson  Daly."  Shelton  was  one  of  the  performers  joining  a  roster  that  included  "American  Idol"  judge  Mariah  Carey.CNN  once  again  featured  the  antics  of  Anderson  Cooper  and  comedienne  Kathy  Griffin,  live  from  Times  Square  in  New  York  City.Before  the  festivities,  Griffin  had  sent  Cooper  a  topless  pic  of  herself,  threatening  to  also  appear  that  way  on  the  show.  While  that  didn't  come  to  pass,  she  offered  plenty  of  ribbing  of  her  co-host,  including  teasing  Cooper  that  Ryan  Seacrest  was  so  rich  "He  could  come  up  here  and  purchase  you  right  now.""You  do  realize  you'll  never  live  up  to  your  mother,  right?"  Griffin  told  Cooper,  referring  to  his  mother,  Gloria  Vanderbilt.  "I  just  need  to  say  that."Cooper  got  off  a  few  zingers  of  his  own,  telling  Griffin,  "I  roll  deep.  I  know  Mackelmore."Other  networks  that  also  offered  programming  to  ring  out  2013  included  the  Mario  Lopez-hosted  "New  Year's  Eve  Live"  on  Fox  where  rapper  J.Cole  and  Panic!  At  the  Disco  performed  and  "BET:  106  &  Party:  New  Year's  Eve  2013"  which  featured  Trey  Songz  and  ASAP  Rocky.</TEXT></DOC>

It  reports  that  sales  of  his  latest  album,  "Unorthodox  Jukebox,"  rose  by  164%  after  Mars  took  to  the  Super  Bowl  stage  with  the  Red  Hot  Chilli  Peppers.  The  album  was  released  in  December  2012.Such  an  increase  in  sales  is  not  rare  or  unexpected.  Last  year's  halftime  performer,  Beyonce,  reportedly  saw  a  bump  in  sales  of  her  "4"  album  by  123%.And  Mars  is  not  an  unknown  quantity,  though  some  of  Sunday's  viewers  may  have  just  discovered  him.  In  2010,  he  won  a  Grammy  for  best  male  pop  vocal  performance  for  his  song  "Just  the  Way  You  Are."  In  January,  "Unorthodox  Jukebox"  won  Mars  his  second  Grammy,  this  time  for  best  pop  vocal  album.7  things  we  love  about  Bruno  MarsThe  album  may  re-enter  the  top  10  when  sales  figures  are  released  by  Soundscan  on  Wednesday.  This  year's  Super  Bowl  drew  a  record-breaking  111.5  million  viewers.As  is  customary,  Mars  did  not  receive  an  appearance  fee  for  his  Super  Bowl  performance.  Artists  do  it  for  the  exposure,  and  that  has  clearly  paid  off  for  Mars.Zack  O'Malley  Greenburg  from  Forbes  writes  that  the  singer  may  see  the  most  return  in  increased  ticket  prices  and  sales  for  his  Moonshine  Jungle  tour."In  2013,  the  singer  grossed  $72.4  million  on  84  shows;  his  average  ticket  price  sits  at  about  $66,"  O'Malley  Greenburg  writes.  "With  the  added  exposure  from  the  Super  Bowl,  he  could  easily  push  prices  closer  to  the  $120  average  of  his  halftime  show  predecessor,  Beyonce."</TEXT></DOC>

As  an  activist,  she  has  worked  with  the  Ms.  Foundation  for  Women,  the  Third  Wave  Foundation,  the  NGO  Forum  on  Women,  and  the  World  Health  Organization.  She  is  the  author  of  "The  Big  Lie:  Motherhood,  Feminism,  and  the  Reality  of  the  Biological  Clock."(CNN)  --  In  "The  Big  Lie:  Motherhood,  Feminism,  and  the  Reality  of  the  Biological  Clock,"  I  explore  many  Big  Lies,  one  of  which  is  that  women  can  delay  motherhood  until  we're  ready  and  if  we're  not  able  to  get  pregnant  naturally,  then  science  will  make  it  happen  for  us.Another  Big  Lie  I  write  about  is  that  we  don't  need  feminism  anymore.  In  a  way,  these  are  two  sides  of  the  same  lie.In  the  book,  I  make  a  strong  argument  for  why  we  need  feminism  more  than  ever.  The  language  of  the  biological  clock  has  been  around  for  decades,  but  conflicting  or  misleading  messages  persist.  I  believe  it  is  the  very  role  of  feminists  to  arm  women  with  knowledge  so  that  they  can  make  better  choices  to  take  control  of  their  future.Some  people  claim  that  no  one  is  unaware  of  the  impact  of  age  on  fertility.  They're  wrong.A  Fertility  Centers  of  Illinois  public  survey  in  2012  showed  that  only  18.2%  of  respondents  accurately  guessed  how  many  couples  are  affected  by  fertility  problems,  and  28.1%  didn't  know  that  fertility  declines  rapidly  in  women  after  age  35.  In  addition,  68.4%  of  survey  respondents  weren't  aware  that  as  part  of  a  couple,  both  men  and  women  are  equally  likely  to  be  infertile.We  should  be  getting  this  knowledge  from  our  health  educators  and  doctors,  and  we  should  be  getting  it  earlier,  possibly  during  sex  education.'The  Big  Lie'  in  putting  off  pregnancyHeadlines  continue  to  distort  the  reality.  Just  last  week,  Jezebel  ran  a  piece  with  the  title,  "New  study  suggests  biological-clock  frenzy  is  bulls--t."Among  the  actual  findings  of  the  study,  by  the  National  Center  for  Health  Statistics,  is  that  while  the  use  of  infertility  services  had  declined  between  2006  and  2010,  white  women  with  higher  education  levels  and  household  income  were  the  ones  more  likely  to  use  such  services.As  sociology  professor  Arthur  Greil,  whom  I  also  interviewed  for  my  book,  said  to  HealthDay,  "Women,  and  especially  middle-class  white  women,  are  delaying  having  a  first  child  even  longer  than  before.  Part  of  that  reason  may  be  because  they  have  confidence  that  infertility  treatments,  when  they  need  them,  will  work.  For  a  lot  of  them,  it's  a  false  confidence  because  the  treatments  work  better  when  you're  young."I  started  writing  "The  Big  Lie"  after  my  third  miscarriage  in  2011;  my  first  was  three  years  earlier,  when  I  was  37.Since  my  book  came  out,  I've  seen  comments  along  the  lines  of,  "Just  because  she  failed  doesn't  mean  others  will.  I  have  a  friend  who  had  two  kids  naturally  in  her  40s."And  maybe  they  will  succeed,  but  they  should  know  that  they  will  be  pushing  back  against  tougher  and  tougher  odds.  As  it  happens,  my  doctors  were  clear  that  the  biggest  factor  was  my  age.  The  pathologies  from  my  first  two  miscarriages  showed  chromosomal  abnormalities  (by  age  40,  half  our  eggs  are  chromosomally  abnormal;  by  age  42,  that  figure  is  90%);  the  third  was  a  blighted  ovum  --  which  happens  when  a  fertilized  egg  implants  in  the  uterus  but  the  embryo  doesn't  develop.I  believe  we  are  at  a  critical  juncture  where  women  of  my  generation  are  hitting  our  40s  and  realizing  that  while  many  of  us  don't  have  children  by  choice,  many  of  us  don't  have  them  because  we  waited  too  long.U.S.  women  having  fewer  childrenWe  have  been  a  guinea-pig  generation  when  it  comes  to  delaying  fertility.  According  to  a  Pew  study  that  was  conducted  in  2008,  nearly  one  in  five  American  women  had  ended  her  childbearing  years  without  having  a  child,  compared  with  one  in  10  in  the  1970s.Of  course,  there  are  many  paths  to  parenthood  and  one  of  the  objectives  of  my  book  is  to  encourage  people  to  pursue  those  options  (surrogacy,  egg  donation  and  freezing,  single  parenthood,  etc.).  Also,  adoption:  there  are  more  than  100,000  children  waiting  to  be  adopted  in  the  United  States  alone.  In  2012,  there  were  about  400,000  children  in  foster  care.However,  many  of  the  options  are  costly,  and  we  cannot  separate  conversations  about  the  pursuit  of  parenthood  from  the  economics  of  it.  According  to  a  2012  report  from  the  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture,  it  costs  about  $235,000  to  raise  a  child  for  the  first  17  years.  When  you  factor  in  fertility  treatments  or  adoption  costs,  etc.,  many  people  simply  can't  afford  to  have  children.I  believe  we  have  to  make  parenthood  a  more  attainable  goal  by  incorporating  more  fundamental  fertility  awareness  in  sex  education  and  by  providing  more  support  through  guaranteed  parental  leave,  widespread  insurance  coverage  for  fertility  treatments,  subsidized  childcare,  etc.I  intended  my  book  to  be  a  conversation-starter  and  policy-changer.  I  explore  how  various  factors,  including  feminism's  early  victories  and  advances  in  reproductive  science,  dovetailed  to  create  an  atmosphere  in  which  women  believed  their  timetables  for  motherhood  were  more  within  their  controls.Ultimately,  though,  "The  Big  Lie"  is  a  feminist  book,  intended  to  get  women  to  push  past  the  rhetoric  and  to  arm  themselves  with  information.Five  questions  on  egg  freezingOne  point  of  feminism,  after  all,  has  always  been  to  push  back  against  the  sort  of  magical  thinking  that  tells  a  woman  that  someone  will  be  there  to  come  to  the  rescue,  whether  a  husband  or  a  fertility  doctor.  That  mind-set  holds  us  back  from  solutions;  we  have  to  balance  the  heartbreaking  scenarios  with  the  optimistic  ones.  Feminism  provides  a  framework  within  which  to  argue  for  solutions  to  many  of  the  issues  that  cut  across  geographic  and  economic  lines.When  I  started  telling  my  story,  I  was  shocked  to  discover  how  many  others  had  stories  to  tell,  too  --  if  not  about  themselves,  it  was  about  a  friend,  mother,  daughter,  etc.  A  2009  survey  of  infertility  patients  by  pharmaceutical  giant  Schering-Plough  revealed  that  61%  hide  the  struggle  to  get  pregnant  from  friends  and  family.I  am  hopeful  that  my  book  will  encourage  others  to  normalize  the  discourse.  I've  received  dozens  of  e-mails  and  read  many  more  comments  by  those  for  whom  some  aspect  of  my  story  rings  true.  I  am  certainly  not  the  only  woman  to  have  multiple  miscarriages.  I'm  not  the  only  woman  whose  marriage  was  a  casualty  of  the  process.And  I'm  not  the  only  woman  to  feel  like  maybe  I  waited  too  long  to  try  to  have  a  biological  child.  Nor  am  I  the  first  to  write  about  all  these.  There  are  excellent  books  by  Peggy  Orenstein,  Amy  Richards,  Miriam  Zoll  and  more.I've  been  inspired  by  those  who  turn  adversity  into  action.  Supreme  Court  Justice  Sonia  Sotomayor  wrote  in  her  memoir,  "My  Beloved  World,"  "There  are  uses  to  adversity,  and  they  don't  reveal  themselves  until  tested  ...  Difficulty  can  tap  unsuspected  strengths."In  my  case,  I  took  what  I  learned  from  my  mistakes  and  from  my  experience  with  delayed  motherhood  and  used  it  as  a  starting  point  to  interview  dozens  of  women  of  various  ages,  sociologists,  adoption  counselors,  and  fertility  doctors  about  their  opinions.The  result  is  a  book  that  I  hope  will  help  others.  I  explore  the  choices  that  women  have  to  make  during  the  course  of  their  lives  --  including  the  choice  to  have  children  or  not.Women  and  men  need  to  share  their  stories,  educate  themselves,  strategize  for  their  goals,  advocate  for  a  better  future  --  and  not  to  be  afraid  of  feminism.  Women  don't  need  any  more  Big  Lies.The  opinions  expressed  are  solely  those  of  Tanya  Selvaratnam.Watch  Sanjay  Gupta  MD  Saturday  at  4:30pm  and  Sunday  at  7:30am  ET.

For  a  guy  with  zero  piloting  experience,  I  have  to  ask:  Is  this  legal?</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  It's  New  Year's  Eve,  and  we're  suspended  2,000  feet  above  Atlanta  by  an  iconic  bag  of  gas.  It's  kind  of  hard  to  believe  I'm  actually  flying  the  Goodyear  blimp.For  a  guy  with  zero  piloting  experience,  I  have  to  ask:  Is  this  legal?"Yep,"  Goodyear  pilot  Matt  Lussier  says,  sitting  on  my  right.  "I'm  a  certified  instructor,  and  you're  my  student."Let  me  set  the  scene.  High  above  the  downtown  Georgia  Dome,  where  the  Chick-fil-A  Bowl  is  being  played,  Lussier,  camera  operator  Tom  O'Keefe  and  I  are  sitting  in  a  tiny  metal  gondola  with  a  passenger  and  cockpit  area  about  6  feet  wide  and  15  feet  long.  We're  surrounded  by  windows,  some  of  which  are  open.Looking  out  those  windows  ...  it's  a  loooooooong  way  down.And  winds  out  of  the  northwest  at  about  12  mph  are  making  it  a  little  chilly.We  have  to  wear  headphones  to  communicate  with  each  other  above  the  roar  of  the  blimp's  twin  propeller  engines.  I  don't  mind  telling  you,  it's  more  than  a  little  unnerving.As  Lussier  put  it  more  than  once  this  night:  "That's  blimpin'!"In  front  of  me  on  the  floor  are  two  pedals."Put  your  feet  on  the  pedals,  and  push  the  right  pedal  down  about  four  inches,"  Lussier  says.  When  I  do  this,  the  rubbery  192-foot-long  aircraft  slowly  begins  to  turn  right.  "Now,  push  the  right  pedal  all  the  way  to  the  floor."  As  I  do  that,  I'm  surprised  when  the  left  pedal  starts  to  push  up  against  the  sole  of  my  left  foot.Now,  the  blimp's  right  turn  begins  to  speed  up.Next,  Lussier  tells  me  to  floor  the  other  pedal  --  the  one  under  my  left  foot.Slowly,  the  lumbering  airship  reverses  itself,  bringing  us  back  to  a  straight  course.A  wooden  "elevator  wheel"  to  the  right  of  the  pilot's  seat  is  used  to  point  the  airship  up  or  down.  No  fancy  "fly-by-wire"  electronics  here.  It  blows  my  mind  to  think  that  the  controls  at  my  feet  are  directly  connected  by  cables  to  the  rudder  and  elevators  on  the  blimp's  tail.My  five  minutes  as  a  blimp  pilot  trainee  hammered  home  this  fact:  These  aircraft  are  the  ships  of  the  skies.  They  perform  a  lot  like  ships  or  even  submarines,  Lussier  says.  The  wind  is  the  equivalent  of  ocean  currents.The  32-year-old  Lussier,  who's  been  "blimpin'  "  for  Goodyear  since  2011,  answered  some  of  CNN  readers'  blimp  questions.  I'll  tick  a  few  off:•  Nope,  no  bathrooms  aboard.  It  takes  discipline.•  No  parachutes,  either.  The  blimp  flies  too  low  for  them  to  be  effective  safety  equipment.•  No  seat  belts.  No  oh  s**t  handles  like  you  might  find  in  an  SUV.•  The  blimp  does  have  Sirius/XM  satellite  radio,  when  the  signal  isn't  blocked  by  the  giant  helium  bag.•  Via  radio,  an  ESPN  TV  director  orders  specific  beauty  shots  for  the  bowl  broadcasts  from  Lussier  and  O'Keefe.  Those  images  are  beamed  via  microwave  to  a  truck  on  the  ground.  Although  we  can't  watch  the  ESPN  broadcast,  we  can  see  O'Keefe's  video  on  a  cockpit  monitor.•  The  blimp  has  the  same  cockpit  indicators  you'd  expect  on  a  plane,  including  altitude,  speed  and  direction.•  The  blimp  has  radar  to  track  nearby  aircraft.•  Rules  call  for  the  blimp  to  stay  1,000  feet  above  any  obstacles,  including  skyscrapers,  and  2,000  feet  away  horizontally.Goodyear  blimp:  Surprising  factsI  also  got  a  heart-pounding  first-hand  look  at  what  makes  blimp  takeoffs  and  landings  so  challenging.But  first,  some  of  you  wanted  to  know  why  an  experienced  airplane  pilot  like  Lussier,  who's  been  flying  since  his  teen  years  in  North  Carolina,  would  shift  his  career  from  flying  private  corporate  planes  to  a  whole  other  kettle  of  fish:  blimps.The  answer:  Lussier  loves  working  with  people.  As  a  pilot,  he  wanted  more  than  a  job  that  flew  passengers  from  point  A  to  point  B.Flying  for  Goodyear  --  and  showing  off  what's  arguably  the  world's  most  iconic  blimp  --  means  he  and  the  other  blimp  crews  help  raise  hundreds  of  thousands  of  dollars  each  year  for  groups  such  as  the  Boys  and  Girls  Club  and  the  United  Way.  Hour-long  blimp  rides  are  auctioned  off  at  fundraisers,  and  the  money  goes  to  help  the  needy.Lussier  seems  to  have  been  born  to  fly.  When  he  was  3,  Lussier's  mother  asked  him  what  he  wanted  to  be  when  he  grew  up.  "I  told  her  I  wanted  to  be  a  bird.  So  I  guess  I  found  the  next  best  thing:  flying."He  competed  against  about  1,600  other  applicants  to  join  Goodyear's  blimp  team,  surviving  a  half-dozen  interviews  before  he  got  the  gig."I  don't  want  to  fly  anything  else  ever  again,"  Lussier  says.  "It's  absolutely  my  dream  job."Blimpin'  is  all  about  appreciating  the  joy  of  flying  "slow  and  low,"  as  Lussier  puts  it  --  sometimes  so  slow  and  so  low  that  it's  not  unheard-of  to  be  passed  by  flocks  of  Canada  geese.While  we  regular  travelers  enjoy  the  comfort  of  being  sealed  away  from  the  forces  of  nature  in  airline  cabins,  blimpin'  puts  Lussier  closer  to  the  true  experience  of  flight.  He  loves  to  fly  with  the  windows  open.  In  hot  weather,  he'll  often  lean  out  the  window  at  2,000  feet  to  cool  off.Helium  headsMany  of  the  blimp's  controls  and  flight  procedures  are  the  same  as  airplanes.  But  airship  aficionados,  affectionately  known  as  helium  heads,  know  what  really  sets  these  machines  apart:  helium.The  helium  inside  the  blimp's  giant  gas  bag,  known  as  "the  envelope,"  is  lighter  than  air.  It  makes  the  blimp  always  want  to  rise,  even  when  you're  trying  to  land."They're  homesick  angels,"  says  Lussier.Airplanes  take  flight  when  wind  rushes  across  and  under  their  wings,  pushing  them  into  the  air.  With  blimps,  the  lift  of  the  helium  creates  a  pulling  sensation,  as  if  a  puppeteer  is  in  control  from  above.These  homesick  angels  also  have  a  devilish  side:  The  helium  and  the  wind  can  make  takeoffs  and  landings  very  tricky.For  some  reason,  I  thought  the  takeoff  would  be  more  like  a  balloon  ride,  gently  rising  from  the  ground  to  our  eventual  altitude.  The  reality  is  a  bit  more  dramatic.I'm  not  overstating  it  when  I  say  this:  Taking  off  in  the  blimp  is  a  scary,  thrilling,  white-knuckle  ride.  On  this  night,  Lussier  performed  one  of  blimpin's  more  difficult  maneuvers:  a  "pull  off."Blimps  take  off  best  by  heading  directly  into  the  wind.  But  that's  not  always  possible.  A  "pull  off"  is  a  trick  that  pilots  use  when  obstacles  stand  in  the  way.  In  this  case,  the  obstacles  are  a  ditch  and  a  huge  mast  that  is  used  to  tether  the  blimp.Using  the  rudder  pedals,  Lussier  "threads  the  needle"  between  the  two,  steering  the  blimp  like  a  boat  crossing  a  river  with  a  strong  current.Next,  using  engine  control  levers  with  his  left  hand  and  the  elevator  wheel  in  his  right  hand,  Lussier  points  the  blimp's  nose  upward  and  guns  the  power.The  blimp's  two  engines  throttle  up  to  a  deafening  roar  as  they  push  their  propellers  2,800  revolutions  per  minute.  Suddenly,  I'm  nearly  on  my  back  as  Lussier  points  the  blimp  up  at  a  25-degree  angle  --  only  5  degrees  short  of  maximum.Heeeeeeeere  we  go.The  airship  ascends  at  1,500  to  2,000  feet  per  minute.  In  no  time  at  all,  we're  1,000  feet  high  and  beginning  to  level  off.Here  come  the  ZeppelinsAt  the  stroke  of  midnight,  hours  after  our  rumbling  takeoff,  we  find  ourselves  looking  down  at  the  city's  traditional  giant  "peach"  drop.  This  might  well  be  the  most  unusual  New  Year's  transition  I'll  ever  see.2014  also  will  be  unique  for  Goodyear.Zeppelin:  Latest  way  to  see  ParisIt  plans  to  begin  phasing  out  the  GZ-20A  blimps  --  like  I'm  riding  in  --  and  replacing  them  with  high-tech  Goodyear  NTs.  These  sleek,  new  bad  boys  are  co-produced  by  the  maker  of  the  famous  Zeppelin  airships  of  the  early  20th  century.  Goodyear  NTs  will  have  internal  frameworks,  unlike  blimps,  which  will  allow  the  fleet  to  go  faster  and  maneuver  better  than  ever  before.Eventually,  Goodyear's  current  fleet  of  three  iconic  blimps  will  retire  --  perhaps,  some  speculate,  to  become  museum  exhibits.Of  course,  the  usefulness  of  airships  extends  way  beyond  broadcasting  and  promotional  purposes.A  U.S.-based  company  called  Aeros  is  developing  a  new  kind  of  airship  that  would  carry  cargo  long  distances  over  the  Arctic.  The  defense  industry  has  also  been  working  on  an  airship  that  would  carry  heavy  military  equipment  and  be  able  to  land  or  takeoff  from  virtually  any  terrain.  The  Pentagon  tested  a  surveillance  blimp  in  2012.Dirigible  resurgence?Those  airship  applications  are  taking  off,  but  after  more  than  six  hours  aboard  the  Spirit  of  Innovation,  I'm  ready  to  experience  a  blimp  landing.Atlanta's  brightly  lit  skyline  is  dotted  with  spectacular  orange,  red  and  green  fireworks  shooting  into  the  air  far  below  as  we  motor  toward  DeKalb-Peachtree  Airport.Obviously,  planes  rely  on  gravity  to  bring  them  down  to  Earth.  With  blimps,  not  so  much,  because  the  helium  makes  them  want  to  keep  going  up.  "You  drive  it  down;  you  don't  fly  it  down,"  Lussier  explains.A  weather  event  called  a  temperature  inversion  is  going  to  make  this  landing  a  little  more  challenging.  This  happens  when  warmer  air  traps  cooler  air  near  the  ground.  The  cooler  air  will  cause  a  blimp  to  lift  when  it  approaches  a  landing  strip.The  runway  looms  large  in  our  windshield,  about  100  feet  under  the  gondola.To  cut  the  blimp's  tendency  to  lift,  Lussier  comes  down  low  to  let  the  chilly  air  near  the  ground  cool  his  helium.  Then  we  circle  back  around  for  a  landing  attempt."We'd  better  try  to  stay  above  airport  property,"  Lussier  says.  We'd  very  much  like  to  avoid  any  surprise  New  Year's  Eve  fireworks  from  the  neighbors.  Should  I  be  nervous?Armed  with  red  flashlights,  a  15-member  Goodyear  ground  crew  lines  up  along  the  airstrip  and  grabs  the  rope  lines  hanging  from  our  blimp.Lussier  aborts  our  first  landing  attempt,  a  common  occurrence.  Circling  back,  we  try  again.As  the  wheel  under  the  gondola  hits  the  pavement,  you  hear  a  comforting  shushhhhhhhh  as  Lussier  reverses  engines  to  slow  us  down.This  unforgettable  ride  is  done.  All  in  all,  we've  burned  about  62  gallons  of  "100  Low-Lead"  airplane  fuel.The  next  day,  the  crew  will  pack  up  its  five-vehicle  convoy  and  follow  the  Spirit  of  Innovation  as  it  flies  toward  Florida  for  another  college  bowl.  There,  they  plan  to  do  it  all  over  again,  practicing  a  century-old  profession  unique  among  aviators.Like  Lussier  says:  That's  blimpin'!</TEXT></DOC>

The  wildlings  are  coming.For  thousands  of  "Game  of  Thrones"  fans,  that  brief  immersion  into  the  life  of  a  Night's  Watch  soldier  in  the  HBO  show  is  becoming  a  reality  this  week,  thanks  to  an  exhibit  at  the  South  by  Southwest  Interactive  festival  that  employs  one  of  the  hottest  gadgets  in  tech."Ascend  the  Wall"  is  part  of  a  traveling  exhibit  promoting  the  wildly  popular  fantasy  epic,  which  returns  for  its  fourth  season  next  month.  It's  built  using  Oculus  Rift,  a  virtual-reality  headset  that  has  captured  the  imaginations  of  gamers  since  its  $2.4  million  debut  on  Kickstarter  in  2012.Designed  specifically  for  video  gaming,  the  Rift  provides  a  360-degree  field  of  vision,  allowing  wearers  to  view,  and  react  to,  their  surroundings  in  a  realistic  manner.  The  device's  capabilities  were  inspiring  to  Mike  Woods,  creative  director  of  Framestore,  the  London-based  visual-effects  company  that  developed  "Ascend  the  Wall.""It's  whatever  you  want  it  to  be,"  said  Woods,  whose  company  recently  scored  an  Academy  Award  for  best  visual  effects  for  "Gravity"  and  has  another  for  2008's  "The  Golden  Compass.""They  know  that  they're  reinventing  gaming,"  he  added.  "There  are,  literally,  endless  possibilities."At  the  exhibit,  which  also  featured  props,  costumes  and  other  "Game  of  Thrones"  displays,  visitors  lined  up,  sometimes  for  several  hours,  for  a  turn  in  a  bank  of  booths  designed  to  look  like  the  elevators  that  carry  soldiers  on  the  show's  massive,  icy  wall.Once  inside,  they're  fitted  with  the  Oculus  Rift  and  a  set  of  headphones,  and  the  experience  begins.The  visuals  are  built  using  a  gaming  engine,  and  the  booth's  floor  and  walls  are  equipped  with  rumble  packs  that  help  create  the  illusion  of  movement.  A  set  of  air  vents  complete  the  experience,  flicking  on  and  off  to  cool  the  temperature  and  give  the  sense  that  the  wearer  has,  indeed,  exited  the  elevator  into  a  howling  wind  above.The  end  result  is  impressive.  Rift's  full  field  of  view  makes  it  difficult  not  to  keep  looking  over  your  shoulder,  expecting  an  unpleasant  surprise.  And  when  it  moves  you  to  the  edge  of  the  wall,  it's  a  challenge  to  not  instinctively  scramble  back,  despite  intellectually  knowing  you're  standing  still  in  an  Austin  music  hall.Oculus  made  at  least  one  big  fan  with  the  exhibit:  Actor  Kristian  Nairn,  an  avid  gamer  who  also  happens  to  play  gentle  giant  Hodor  on  "Game  of  Thrones.""I  was  excited  to  try  the  Oculus  Rift  ...  Wasn't  ready  for  the  awesome,"  Nairn  wrote  on  Twitter  after  checking  it  out  on  Saturday.  "I'm  telling  you,  if  you  are  excited  about  it,  (it's)  better  than  you  hope!"In  another  post,  he  said  he  was  picturing  how  the  Rift  could  be  used  with  games  such  as  "Skyrim"  and  "World  of  Warcraft.""They  will  be  perfect  for  it,"  he  wrote.Naim  wasn't  the  only  one  singing  its  praises.  Many  of  those  who  waited  in  a  long  line  to  test  out  the  Oculus  seemed  similarly  wowed."The  Oculus  experience  at  the  #GOTExhibit  is  ridiculously  good,"  tweeted  Andy  Kinsella,  executive  producer  at  Google  Creative  Lab.  "Wanted  it  to  last  for  hours."The  fourth  season  of  "Game  of  Thrones"  kicks  off  April  4.Merging  a  popular  cable  TV  series  with  cutting-edge  technology  appeared  to  be  a  winning  combination  at  South  by  Southwest,  where  the  first  five  days  of  the  10-day  festival  are  devoted  to  film  and  digital  culture.At  times,  the  wait  to  get  into  the  exhibit  itself  (never  mind  the  Oculus  experience)  was  more  than  two  hours.  And  festival  organizers  said  that,  as  of  Sunday,  "Game  of  Thrones"  was  the  ninth-most  popular  topic  in  tweets  that  also  mentioned  South  by  Southwest.Assange  to  SXSW:  We're  all  being  watchedKevin  Bacon  on  'Six  Degrees'  game:  'I  was  horrified'</TEXT></DOC>

"We've  also  made  it  easier  to  craft  and  share  beautiful  stories  of  your  own."The  first  section  of  the  new  app  will  be  your  Facebook  News  Feed.  It  won't  have  all  the  functions  of  the  native  Facebook  app,  but  it  will  present  your  friends'  posts,  along  with  stories  from  other  news  categories,  in  a  slicker,  prettier  package.According  to  Facebook,  the  News  Feed  section  will  feature  a  new  design  for  photos  and  video  and  the  ability  to  read  longer  written  posts.Users  can  then  customize  the  app  by  adding  more  than  a  dozen  other  topics,  "from  photography  and  sports  to  food,  science  and  design."  Facebook  promises  "a  rich  mix  of  content  from  emerging  voices  and  well-known  publications."There  will  be  no  buttons  to  push.  Instead,  users  will  be  able  to  flip  through  stories  and  other  posts  by  tilting  the  phone  in  various  ways  and  swiping  with  their  fingers.When  posting  your  own  stories,  Paper  will  let  you  look  at  a  preview  before  sharing.Paper  will  be  the  first  release  from  Facebook  Creative  Labs,  which  is  devoted  exclusively  to  developing  new  mobile  apps  for  the  site.In  the  early  days  of  its  2012  public  stock  offering,  Facebook  was  knocked  by  some  for  not  having  fully  realized  how  to  make  money  off  of  the  rapidly  growing  mobile  market.  But  that  appears  to  have  turned  around  in  a  big  way,  and  Paper  could  give  the  company  another  mobile  platform  on  which  to  advertise.On  Wednesday,  Facebook  reported  that  945  million  of  its  1.2  billion  users  visited  the  site  via  a  smartphone  or  tablet  in  the  last  few  months  and  that  mobile  represented  53%  of  the  site's  advertising  revenue  --  up  from  23%  last  year  and  zero  in  2011.</TEXT></DOC>

"What  the  f***?"  a  surprised  Bullock  said  before  joking  that  she's  an  action  star.The  49-year-old  wasn't  the  only  to  go  off-script  that  night:  Bradley  Cooper  sneaked  in  the  expletive  during  the  best  comedy  acceptance  speech,  calling  his  co-stars  "these  f***ing  actors."So  the  two  played  it  a  little  loose,  but  on  the  other  hand,  they  were  probably  still  riding  a  high  from  that  morning's  celebration.  Cooper,  too,  is  nominated  for  an  Oscar  this  year  in  the  best  supporting  actor  category.2014  Oscars:  The  nominees  listIn  fact,  some  of  the  Critics'  Choice  picks  mirrored  Academy  nominations  for  Oscars  earlier  that  day:  Matthew  McConaughey,  Cate  Blanchett,  Alfonso  Cuaron  and  "12  Years  A  Slave's"  Lupita  Nyong'o  were  all  winners.Could  this  be  a  reflection  of  what  we'll  see  on  Oscars  night?  "12  Years"  director  Steve  McQueen  is  probably  hoping  so.  Although  it  was  Cuaron's  "Gravity"  that  won  the  most  awards  --  a  total  of  seven,  including  best  director,  best  score,  best  sci-fi/horror  film  and  best  visual  effects  --  it  was  "12  Years"  that  took  home  the  big  prize  of  the  night,  best  picture.The  film's  screenwriter,  John  Ridley,  also  won  the  Critics'  Choice  award  for  best  adapted  screenplay.Here's  the  full  list  of  winners.

This  has  small  furry  creatures,  adoption  and  interspecies  bonding.  We've  long  awaited  the  moment  when  the  Super  Bowl  gives  up  on  football  and  just  makes  the  Puppy  Bowl  the  main  event,  and  we  consider  this  Budweiser  commercial  to  be  the  first  step  toward  that  glorious  day.The  Muppets  steal  a  carThe  Muppets  are  mostly  around  for  fun,  but  they  often  sneak  in  a  lesson  or  two  while  they're  at  it.  With  their  Super  Bowl  commercial,  they  impart  a  very  useful  one:  do  not,  under  any  circumstances,  pull  over  for  a  Muppets  bus  --  unless  you  want  them  to  hijack  your  car.

The  film,  directed  by  Ivan  Reitman  and  also  starring  Jennifer  Garner  and  Ellen  Burstyn,  features  Costner  as  the  general  manager  of  the  Cleveland  Browns  as  he  grapples  with  the  responsibility  of  having  the  No.  1  draft  pick.  We're  getting  shades  of  "Jerry  Maguire"  from  this  movie,  and  we  like  it.'Noah'  trailerAdmittedly,  the  promotion  for  "Noah"  is  a  bit  of  a  downer  (#TheFloodIsComing?  That's  a  great  thought  to  have  during  the  Super  Bowl),  but  we  can't  help  but  be  excited  to  see  what  Darren  Aronofsky's  going  to  do  with  this  classic  Biblical  story.

"It's  still  early."Kunis,  30,  and  Kutcher,  36,  are  also  said  to  be  engaged.Mila  Kunis  and  Ashton  Kutcher:  A  love  storyReps  for  the  stars  haven't  commented  on  the  engagement  or  baby  reports,  but  the  actors  have  made  no  attempts  at  hiding  their  status.

Sometimes  not  knowing  is  worse  than  knowing,  an  expert  says.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Not  knowing.  It's  the  hardest  part.That's  the  truth  facing  the  loved  ones  of  slain  or  missing  Americans.So  when  a  19-year-old  Pennsylvania  woman  already  facing  murder  charges  told  a  newspaper  reporter  that  she'd  killed  before  --  over  and  over  again,  from  Alaska  to  North  Carolina  --  loved  ones  couldn't  help  but  sit  up  and  take  notice,  said  Kristy  Dyroff,  a  spokeswoman  for  the  National  Organization  for  Victim  Assistance."Anyone  hands  them  the  least  glimmer  of  hope,  they  latch  on  to  it,"  she  said.  "The  biggest  difficulty  for  victims  is  they  have  no  control,  and  they're  trying  to  regain  some  by  doing  something  proactive."Murder  suspect's  bombshell  claims  raise  questionsOn  Sunday,  the  Daily  Item  newspaper  in  Sunbury,  Pennsylvania,  published  a  jailhouse  interview  with  murder  suspect  Miranda  Barbour  in  which  she  claimed  a  string  of  killings  dating  back  six  years  --  to  when  she  was  13."I  would  lure  these  people  in,"  the  Daily  Item  quoted  her  as  saying.  "I  studied  them.  I  learned  them  and  even  became  their  friend.  I  did  this  to  people  who  did  bad  things  and  didn't  deserve  to  be  here  anymore."Barbour  took  credit  for  more  than  22  but  fewer  than  100  killings,  Daily  Item  reporter  Francis  Scarcella  told  CNN  affiliate  WNEP.  Authorities  haven't  verified  her  claims,  although  they  are  investigating.Barbour  and  her  husband,  Elytte  Barbour,  22,  do  face  murder  charges  in  the  2013  death  of  42-year-old  Troy  LaFerrara,  who  police  say  was  strangled  and  repeatedly  stabbed  by  the  couple  before  being  dumped  in  a  yard.If  her  other  claims  are  true,  Barbour  would  be  one  of  the  nation's  most  prolific  serial  killers.Gary  Ridgway,  known  as  the  Green  River  Killer,  pleaded  guilty  to  killing  49  women  in  Washington  state  in  the  1980s  and  1990s.  Randy  Steven  Kraft  may  have  killed  as  many  as  65  young  men  in  the  1970s  and  early  1980s.Based  on  the  numbers  she  gave  Scarcella,  Barbour  would  have  had  to  kill  on  average  somewhere  between  every  three  weeks  and  every  three  months.  For  six  years.  Without  leaving  a  trace.Yet  in  the  2013  killing,  police  documents  show  Barbour  told  police  she  and  her  husband  couldn't  clean  up  all  the  blood  LaFerrara's  killing  left  in  her  CR-V,  and  that  one  of  the  ways  investigators  traced  the  killing  to  her  was  her  own  cell  phone.  The  last  number  dialed  on  LaFerrara's  phone  led  to  Barbour,  according  to  police.Even  the  prosecutor  who  hopes  to  convict  the  couple,  Northumberland  County  District  Attorney  Tony  Rosini,  said  he  discounts  Barbour's  other  claims."We  have  been  in  contact  with  other  law  enforcement  agencies  where  she  has  lived  and  haven't  received  any  information  verifying  what  she  said,"  Rosini  told  WNEP.That  means  little  to  loved  ones  of  victims  clinging  to  a  desperate  need  for  answers  --  and  there  are  plenty  of  people  in  that  situation.The  FBI  estimates  more  than  87,000  people  were  missing  in  the  United  States  at  the  end  of  2012.  And  in  just  the  last  five  years,  more  than  26,000  killings  have  gone  unsolved.In  North  Carolina,  where  Barbour  and  her  husband  lived  before  moving  to  Pennsylvania,  advocates  for  families  of  missing  persons  and  crime  victims  have  already  heard  from  some  people  asking  about  possible  links  to  the  case."Anytime  anything  like  this  happens,  we  start  getting  e-mails  and  phone  calls.  I  started  getting  texts  last  night,"  said  Monica  Caison,  the  founder  of  the  Wilmington-based  Community  United  Effort  Center  for  Missing  Persons."It  sends  everybody  into  a  panic  mode  --  a  hopeful  panic  mode,"  Caison  said.  "They  want  to  be  one  of  those,  but  they  don't  want  to  be  one  of  those.  They  want  their  nightmare  to  end."Some  people,  those  whose  loved  ones  are  still  missing,  take  notice  of  such  cases  not  out  of  hope  the  trail  will  lead  to  a  dead  body,  Dyroff  said.  Instead,  they  want  to  keep  hope  alive.  By  finding  out  that  a  professed  killer's  claims  are  false,  they  can  continue  believing  their  loved  one  is  still  alive,  she  said.And  most  of  the  time,  stories  such  as  Barbour's  do  turn  out  to  be  concoctions,  retired  FBI  investigator  Keith  Lanning  told  CNN."A  lot  of  these  individuals,  particular  some  of  the  adult  survivors,  have  emotional  and  psychological  problems,  and  a  lot  of  their  motivation  is  to  get  attention  and  forgiveness  for  various  problems  in  their  lives,"  he  said.Some  just  want  to  try  to  cash  in  on  a  fragile  connection  to  a  case  in  hopes  of  working  themselves  out  of  trouble  with  the  law,  said  Dyroff.Whatever  their  motivation,  it  ends  up  leaving  victims  hurt  all  over  again,  Dyroff  said."When  you  can't  get  any  of  those  pieces  to  fall  into  place,  it's  very  hard,"  she  said.Woman  accused  in  Craigslist  slaying  tells  newspaper:  I've  killed  lots  of  othersCNN's  Matt  Smith  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

And  on  Thursday,  she  showed  just  how  serious  she  is  about  her  career.At  the  Marc  Jacobs  show,  held  during  New  York  Fashion  Week,  a  nearly  unrecognizable  Jenner  stalked  the  catwalk  in  a  bobbed  wig,  pale  eyebrows,  and  a  sheer  shirt  with  no  bra.  While  fans  of  the  reality  series  have  watched  the  striking  brunette  grow  up  on  TV  they  probably  haven't  ever  seen  her  like  this,  and  her  haute  look  threw  several  for  a  loop.Jenner  hasn't  responded  personally  to  the  attacks  on  social  media,  but  she  hasn't  had  to.  Her  older  sister,  Khloe  Kardashian,  has  hit  back  at  her  sister's  critics."She's  too  dope  for  you  2  understand!  Yall  would  trade  places  with  her  in  a  second!"  Kardashian  tweeted.  "The  hate  is  real!  Lol  bye  haters!  #ModelLife  #Simple"And  then,  just  to  put  a  period  on  her  point,  the  29-year-old  added:  "Basic  b*****s  NOT  wanted."So  what  does  Jenner's  mom,  Kris,  think?  She  couldn't  be  happier.  "I  am  so  so  proud  of  you  @kendalljenner,"  Kris  posted  on  Instagram.And  the  beaming  mom  has  plenty  to  applaud:  Not  only  has  her  teen  daughter  taken  New  York  Fashion  Week  by  storm,  but  she's  also  made  it  into  the  hallowed  fashion  pages  of  Vogue  magazine.</TEXT></DOC>

The  Peruvian  court  system  sentenced  him  in  2012,  but  he  will  be  eligible  for  release  in  2038  because  of  the  time  he  already  has  spent  in  custody.In  the  United  States,  he's  been  indicted  on  federal  charges  of  extortion  and  wire  fraud.  American  authorities  accuse  him  of  extorting  money  from  Holloway's  mother  by  offering  bogus  information  about  her  daughter's  disappearance.Holloway,  an  18-year-old  from  Alabama,  was  last  seen  in  the  early  hours  of  May  30,  2005,  leaving  a  nightclub  in  Aruba  with  van  der  Sloot  and  two  other  men.She'd  gone  to  the  Caribbean  island  with  100  classmates  to  celebrate  their  graduation  from  Mountain  Brook  High  School  in  suburban  Birmingham,  Alabama.Holloway's  body  has  never  been  found,  and  she  was  declared  legally  dead  in  2012.  Nobody  has  been  charged  in  her  disappearance.The  courts  in  Peru  convicted  van  der  Sloot  in  2012  of  murdering  Stephany  Flores,  21,  in  his  Lima  hotel  room.  The  judges  gave  him  a  sentence  two  years  short  of  the  30-year  maximum.Investigators  have  said  they  believe  van  der  Sloot,  a  26-year-old  Dutch  national,  killed  Flores  after  she  found  something  related  to  the  Holloway  case  on  his  computer  while  visiting  his  hotel  room.Van  der  Sloot  confessed  to  robbery  in  addition  to  murder,  admitting  that  he  stole  Flores'  belongings,  including  more  than  $300  in  local  currency,  credit  cards  and  the  victim's  van  as  a  means  to  leave  the  country.  He  fled  to  Chile  and  was  arrested  a  few  days  later.CNN's  Marilia  Brocchetto  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

I  thought  the  Iraq  war  was  over.  Why  is  there  still  fighting?Well,  actually  last  year  was  the  deadliest  since  2008.  The  number  of  dead  reached  its  worst  levels  since  the  height  of  the  Iraq  war,  when  sectarian  fighting  between  the  country's  Shiite  majority  and  its  Sunni  minority  pushed  it  to  the  brink  of  civil  war.  Those  tensions  continue  to  be  fueled  by  widespread  discontent  among  the  Sunnis,  who  say  they  are  marginalized  by  the  Shiite-led  government  and  unfairly  targeted  by  heavy-handed  security  tactics.Al-Maliki  tells  troops  not  to  strike  Falluja  neighborhoodsSunni  anger  has  made  it  easier  for  al  Qaeda-linked  militants  to  recruit  and  operate  while  eroding  the  public's  cooperation  with  security  forces.  Violence  has  flared  in  recent  days  because  of  the  arrest  of  a  Sunni  lawmaker  in  Ramadi  and  the  dismantling  of  protest  sites  by  the  army  in  Falluja  and  Ramadi.Sunnis  have  rejected  the  authority  of  the  government,  and  some  Sunni  officers  in  the  army  have  deserted  to  fight  Iraqi  forces  and  attack  police  stations  and  prisons.  Now  fears  are  mounting  that  national  elections  in  April  will  bring  more  violence  and  descend  into  civil  war.2.  Wait,  I  thought  al  Qaeda  was  on  the  run?  Now  they  control  parts  of  Iraq?The  U.S.  made  impressive  gains  in  weakening  the  so-called  "core  al  Qaeda"  leadership  in  Afghanistan  and  Pakistan,  but  affiliate  groups,  specifically  in  Iraq,  are  gaining  strength.Since  the  2011  withdrawal  of  U.S.  troops,  the  Sunni-led  group  tied  to  al  Qaeda,  known  as  the  Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  al-Sham  (ISIS),  has  staged  a  comeback  amid  Iraq's  growing  sectarian  tensions  and  launched  a  series  of  bloody  attacks  on  government  buildings  and  personnel,  killing  thousands  of  civilians.ISIS  has  been  working  doggedly  to  exploit  the  security  vacuum  across  Iraq.  Conflicting  reports  say  ISIS  this  weekend  captured  the  western  city  of  Falluja  and  took  control  of  most  parts  of  the  principal  capital  of  Ramadi.  Iraqi  troops  are  now  battling  insurgents  in  both  places  for  control.3.  Falluja  and  Ramadi  were  pretty  important  to  the  U.S.  during  the  Iraq  war.  Isn't  the  U.S.  going  to  help?Both  were  important  battlegrounds  for  the  U.S.  during  the  Iraq  war.  Falluja  was  an  insurgent  stronghold  until  U.S.  Marines  fought  their  bloodiest  battle  of  the  war  in  2004  to  drive  militants  out.In  Ramadi,  the  U.S.  supported  the  "Awakening,"  in  which  tribal  leaders  turned  on  al  Qaeda  and  aligned  themselves  with  American  and  Iraqi  forces  to  secure  Anbar  province.  That  was  a  turning  point  in  the  war.  Now  that  U.S.  troops  are  all  out  of  Iraq,  Washington  is  not  eager  to  go  back  in.Kerry  said  Sunday  the  U.S.  would  help  the  Iraqis  in  their  fight  against  al  Qaeda,  but  "this  is  their  fight."Kerry:  We'll  help  Iraq  but  not  send  troops4.  What  does  Syria  have  to  do  with  it?The  international  community  has  long  been  concerned  about  spillover  from  the  civil  war  in  Syria,  and  the  conflict  is  clearly  helping  to  fuel  violence  and  tensions  in  neighboring  and  tensions  in  Iraq.  ISIS  was  formerly  known  as  al  Qaeda  in  Iraq  but  was  renamed  to  reflect  its  growing  ambitions  in  Syria  and  Lebanon.  Their  goal  is  to  establish  a  single  Islamic  state,  or  caliphate,  based  on  sharia  law.Anbar  province  shares  a  400-mile  border  with  Syria  and  because  of  the  power  vacuum  there,  ISIS  fighters  move  back  and  forth  between  the  countries  and  mount  attacks  on  both  sides  of  the  border.  But  with  recent  setbacks  in  Syria,  ISIS  has  increased  its  attention  to  Iraq.5.  I  heard  these  ISIS  guys  are  in  Lebanon,  too?  This  region  is  a  mess.There  are  signs  ISIS  may  have  its  sights  on  Lebanon  as  well.  The  group  said  it  carried  out  a  suicide  bombing  on  Thursday  in  a  Hezbollah-controlled  southern  suburb  of  Beirut.  And  it  warned  about  more  attacks  against  Hezbollah  if  it  continued  to  send  fighters  to  Syria  to  defend  Syrian  President  Bashar  al-Assad  against  the  rebels.Weak  governments  in  Iraq,  Syria  and  Lebanon  have  helped  al  Qaeda  gain  strength,  and  now  Kerry  calls  ISIS  "the  most  dangerous  players  in  the  region."Iraq,  Syria  and  Lebanon  are  all  seen  by  many  experts  as  proxy  wars  between  Shiite  Iran  and  Saudi  Arabia,  a  Sunni  nation.  A  full-blown  civil  war  in  Iraq,  in  addition  to  Syria,  could  further  increase  sectarian  tensions  and  destabilize  the  region.Still  out  there  and  growing  --  al  Qaeda  on  the  reboundU.S.  sending  missiles,  drones  to  help  Iraq  government</TEXT></DOC>

Why  did  you  stop  me?"  Bieber  asked  the  police  officer  who  pulled  him  over  just  after  4  a.m.,  according  to  the  arrest  report.Bieber,  19,  was  released  from  a  Miami  jail  an  hour  after  he  made  a  brief  appearance  through  a  video  link  before  a  Miami  judge,  who  set  a  "standard"  $2,500  bond  Thursday  afternoon.He  strutted  out  of  the  jail  dressed  in  black,  with  a  baggy  hoodie  covering  his  head.  His  pants  appeared  to  be  baggy  leather.  Bieber  briefly  sat  on  top  of  a  black  Cadillac  Escalade,  where  he  waved  to  screaming  fans,  before  he  was  chauffeured  away.At  the  bail  hearing,  the  singer,  dressed  in  an  orange  jail  uniform,  stood  silently  with  his  lips  sometimes  pursed  as  attorney  Roy  Black  represented  him  in  the  hearing  earlier.Black  told  Judge  Joseph  Farina  that  he  had  been  retained  by  Bieber's  manager.  He  said  his  partner  had  been  denied  access  to  Bieber  in  jail  before  the  hearing.Bieber  was  booked  into  a  Miami  jail  after  failing  a  sobriety  test,  Miami  Beach  Police  Chief  Raymond  Martinez  told  reporters  Thursday.Bieber  "made  some  statements  that  he  had  consumed  some  alcohol,  and  that  he  had  been  smoking  marijuana  and  consumed  some  prescription  medication,"  Martinez  said.A  Miami  Beach  officer  saw  Bieber  driving  a  yellow  Lamborghini  in  a  race  against  a  red  Ferrari  in  a  residential  area  of  Miami  Beach,  Martinez  said.  The  cars  were  speeding  at  about  55  to  60  mph  in  a  30  mph  zone,  he  said.Police  report  details  Bieber  arrestThe  officer  pulled  Bieber's  car  over,  but  the  singer  was  "was  not  cooperating  with  the  officer's  instructions,"  Martinez  said."At  first,  he  was  a  little  belligerent,  using  some  choice  words  questioning  why  he  was  being  stopped  and  why  the  officer  was  even  questioning  him,"  he  said.He  allegedly  ignored  a  police  officer's  request  to  keep  his  hands  on  the  car  while  he  did  "a  cursory  patdown  for  weapons,"  the  report  said."I  ain't  got  no  f***ing  weapons,"  the  arresting  officer  quoted  Bieber  as  saying.  "Why  do  you  have  to  search  me?  What  the  f***  is  this  about?"The  arrest  report  describes  Bieber  as  having  a  "flushed  face,  bloodshot  eyes,  and  the  odor  of  alcohol  on  his  breath."Bieber  failed  a  field  sobriety  test,  Miami  Beach  Police  Sgt.  Bobby  Hernandez  told  CNN.Two  black  SUVs  blocked  the  traffic  at  26th  and  Pine  Tree  Drive,  which  "facilitated  an  open  road"  for  the  two  cars  to  race  on  Pine  Tree,  the  report  said.The  Ferrari's  driver,  identified  as  19-year-old  Def  Jam  recording  artist  Khalil  Sharieff,  was  also  arrested  on  a  drunken  driving  charge,  police  said.Sharieff  posted  a  photo  on  his  Instagram  account  of  Bieber  in  the  yellow  Lamborghini  with  a  woman  behind  the  wheel  early  Thursday.  "U  know  bizzle  brought  that  lambo  out,"  he  wrote  in  the  caption.Another  posting  showed  a  photo  of  a  Ferrari  steering  wheel  with  the  caption:  "Miami  nights  ridin  thru  yo  city  in  that  hot  wheel."A  tweet  posted  Wednesday  evening  on  Sharieff's  verfied  Twitter  account  linked  to  a  video  of  him  playing  basketball  with  Bieber.Bieber  flew  to  Miami  on  Monday.Other  complaintsAnother  police  department  in  the  Miami  area  is  investigating  a  report  that  some  of  its  officers  escorted  Bieber's  caravan  between  Miami  strip  clubs  this  week  without  authorization.Opa-Locka  Assistant  City  Manager  David  Chiverton  told  CNN  affiliate  WSVN-TV  that  "at  some  point,  the  escort  took  them  at  least  to  two  locations  that  we  know  of.""The  police  administration  had  no  knowledge  of  this  escort,  and  it  is  not  the  norm  for  those  things  to  occur  without  the  chief  and  his  administration  authorizing  such  escorts,"  Chiverton  told  the  TV  station.Thursday's  incident  marks  the  first  time  the  teen  singer  has  been  arrested,  although  he  is  under  investigation  on  allegations  of  egging  his  California  neighbor's  home.Los  Angeles  County  sheriff's  deputies  used  a  felony  search  warrant  last  week  to  raid  Bieber's  mansion  in  the  felony  vandalism  investigation.  They  seized  Bieber's  iPhone  and  the  security  camera  system,  which  detectives  have  been  examining  for  clues  about  who  tossed  eggs  over  a  fence  that  splattered  onto  the  next-door  house,  causing  an  estimated  $20,000  in  damage.Bieber  is  having  some  issuesDeputies  have  also  investigated  reports  by  Bieber's  neighbors  that  he  raced  his  expensive  sports  car  down  the  streets  of  the  exclusive  Oaks  community  of  Calabasas,  California,  but  no  charges  ever  resulted.One  neighbor  accused  Bieber  of  spitting  in  his  face  during  a  heated  confrontation  last  March.  Deputies  have  responded  to  complaints  about  loud  parties  at  Bieber's  place.The  Los  Angeles  County  district  attorney's  office  concluded  it  couldn't  prove  the  spitting  or  speeding  cases  in  court,  so  it  declined  to  prosecute.Prosecutors  also  rejected  a  misdemeanor  battery  complaint  from  a  photographer  who  accused  Bieber  of  attacking  him  in  the  parking  lot  of  a  Calabasas  shopping  center  as  he  was  taking  photos  of  Bieber  and  his  then-girlfriend,  Selena  Gomez,  in  May  2012."We  didn't  do  this  search  warrant  to  send  a  message,"  Sheriff's  Lt.  David  Thompson  said  last  week.  "That's  not  what  we  do,  but  we  hope  maybe  that  understanding  the  gravity  of  this  will  change  some  of  the  behavior."Bieber's  phone  seized  in  egging  probeStars  who  threatened  to  retire  and  didn'tCNN  en  Español's  Adriana  Hauser  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

The  following  is  an  edited  version  of  that  interview:How  do  you  diagnose  kidney  stones?One  of  the  most  common  presentations  is  the  flank  pain  on  one  side.  It  sometimes  radiates  down  into  the  stomach,  and  it  can  actually  radiate  down  into  the  genital  area.  That  type  of  pain  is  pretty  commonly  seen  in  stone  patients.Sometimes  there's  nausea  and  vomiting.  Those  type  of  symptoms  are  something  that  gives  us  a  clue  that  this  may  be  a  stone.The  CAT  scan  is  the  gold  standard  for  imaging  for  kidney  stones.  That's  usually  the  way  to  diagnose  it.  You  can't  do  it  from  a  blood  test  or  anything  else.Why  do  people  say  that  they  are  so  painful?It  blocks  the  flow  of  urine  in  the  kidney,  and  it  causes  backup.  And  it's  an  excruciating  pain.  A  lot  of  people  do  describe  it  as  worse  than  childbirth.When  the  system  is  trying  to  push  urine  out,  what  happens  is:  your  kidney  and  your  ureter  --  they  have  this  muscle  propagation  that  goes  down  the  kidney  into  the  ureter  --  when  it's  trying  to  push  and  the  stone  is  blocking  it,  you  get  these  intense  pains.  That's  why  we  call  it  colicky,  it  comes  and  goes  and  it's  extremely  painful  and  the  main  reason  for  the  pain  is  the  backup  of  urine.What's  happening  exactly?Usually,  if  they  have  two  kidneys,  they  urinate  fine,  because  you're  getting  urine  on  the  other  side.  The  problem  is,  that  kidney  is  producing  urine  but  it  can't  get  pushed  down.If  you  take  a  pipe  and  you  clog  it  off  and  somehow  you're  still  getting  fluid  into  the  other  end  ...  if  it's  a  pipe  that  can  expand,  it  starts  expanding.The  backup  is  like  that.  It  causes  a  great  deal  of  pain  because  you're  expanding  your  system.  You  don't  have  any  pop-off  valve.  Once  it  starts  expanding,  it's  expanding  unnaturally.It's  called  hydronephrosis,  and  it's  basically  backup  of  urine  into  the  kidney.What  to  do  for  kidney  stonesAre  there  particular  risk  factors?There  are  certain  diseases  associated  with  kidney  stones,  things  like  hypoparathyroidism,  or  some  bowel  diseases  where  your  absorption  isn't  normal.Things  like  obesity  and  diabetes  are  associated  with  kidney  stones.  The  main  dietary  factors  are  low  water  intake  and  high  salt  intake  and  animal  protein  --  anything  you  killed  to  eat.  If  you  have  high  amounts  of  those  intakes,  it  causes  your  urine  to  acidify  and  then  it  becomes  more  prone  to  having  stones.It  just  depends  on  the  person.  If  you  have  a  family  history,  you're  more  apt  to  get  a  stone.What  is  the  treatment?If  the  stones  are  small  enough,  they  usually  pass  on  their  own.  Sometimes  it  can  be  an  uneventful  passage,  or  sometimes  it's  just  an  excruciating  passage,  but  we  can  help  them  out  with  pain  medicine  and  some  other  medicines.We  say  greater  than  5  mm  we  start  watching  them  closely.  They  have  a  higher  chance  of  requiring  surgery  to  pass  the  stone.So  it's  possible  that  with  pain  medicine,  it  could  go  away  on  its  own?Yep,  they  can  pass  it.  As  long  as  it's  small  enough,  and  there's  nothing  abnormal  in  their  system  that  prevents  it  from  moving  through,  if  it's  small  enough  people  can  pass  the  stones  by  themselves.How  long  does  that  take?It  can  take  a  few  days.  Depending  on  where  the  stone  is  and  how  small  it  is.  Sometimes  we  monitor  up  to  six  weeks,  but  if  the  stone  isn't  progressing,  we'll  go  ahead  and  take  care  of  it.If  the  pain  is  so  much  that  they  can't  endure  it,  then  we  will  go  ahead  and  treat.  If  their  pain  is  coming  and  going,  and  well-controlled  with  things  like  ibuprofen  or  other  pain  medicine,  sometimes  we  just  wait  and  let  them  try  and  pass  it.What  does  surgery  involve?There  are  three  types  of  surgery.There's  shock  wave  lithotripsy  --  it's  a  noninvasive  procedure  where  you  basically  put  shock  waves  onto  the  stone  externally  to  break  up  the  stone.  That's  a  good  treatment  if  it  works.  It  requires  not  as  much  anesthesia.The  other  that  we  use  most  commonly  probably  here  is  ureteroscopy:  taking  a  little  telescope  without  any  incision,  you  just  go  up  where  you  pee,  go  up  to  the  stone,  and  you  use  (a)  laser  to  break  the  stone  into  pieces.The  much  more  invasive  way  is  called  percutaneous  nephrolithotomy,  and  that's  when  you  go  through  the  back.  That's  for  very  large  stones.The  incisions  are  only  about  1  cm,  and  you  use  telescopes  and  you  basically  get  into  the  kidney,  onto  the  stone,  with  one  telescope  through  the  back,  and  you  treat  the  stone.Kidney  stones  in  kidsIf  someone  has  had  this  once,  are  they  at  more  risk  of  having  it  again?Definitely.  If  you  have  a  stone,  you  do  have  a  much  higher  risk  of  getting  another  stone  within  the  next  5  to  10  years.What  are  these  stones  made  of?About  95%  of  people  have  calcium  stones.  But  there  are  other  stones.  There  (are  stones)  associated  with  infection,  there's  stones  associated  with  acid  urine  called  uric  acid  stones.  There's  some  medications  actually  cause  stones.Can  stones  ever  be  fatal?They  can.  If  you  have  a  stone  passing  down  and  there's  an  infection  behind  it,  and  the  urine  can't  get  out,  so  the  infection  sits  there,  it  festers  and  can  be  like  an  abscess  and  it  can  actually  be  fatal  if  you  don't  get  treated.Stones  can  also  cause  kidney  issues.  If  you  leave  a  stone  in  there  that's  blocking  your  kidney,  and  it's  a  chronic  condition  --  it's  been  in  there  for  a  long  time  --  usually  you  see  loss  of  function  in  that  kidney.Some  stones,  believe  it  or  not,  are  completely  asymptomatic.  People  don't  even  know  they  have  them.  It  can  be  a  very  large  stone  or  a  small  stone,  but  they  get  a  CAT  scan  for  some  other  reason,  and  that's  when  we  pick  it  up.Are  you  seeing  more  of  these  cases?With  the  increase  in  obesity,  we  know  that  that's  one  of  our  biggest  risk  factors,  and  it  is  increasing  in  the  population.  We're  seeing  more  people  developing  stones.  We're  seeing  more  children  developing  stones.  We  think  this  is  really  largely  due  to  diet.We're  seeing  it  in  all  populations.  Before,  males  were  highly  predominant  stone  formers  versus  females.  Now  females  are  catching  up.  And  kids  had  a  very  low  rate  of  stone  disease,  and  now  we're  seeing  more  kids  with  it.  I  think  diet,  the  foods  we  eat,  have  really  been  playing  a  part  in  the  increase  we're  seeing.</TEXT></DOC>

It's  a  decision  many  people  are  weighing.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Tracey  Madigan  was  looking  forward  to  watching  hockey  games  at  the  Olympics  with  her  three  kids  this  year.  Now,  she's  scrambling  to  cancel  their  plane  tickets  because  Sochi  just  doesn't  seem  safe.Growing  security  concerns  surrounding  the  Games,  she  says,  made  her  rethink  the  family  vacation  plans  she  made  months  ago."We  wanted  to  do  it  to  be  a  cultural  learning  experience  for  the  kids,"  she  says,  "and  now  that's  not  worth  the  risk."It's  a  worry  many  people  are  weighing  as  warnings  about  the  possibility  of  terrorists  targeting  the  Sochi  games  grew  this  week.Athletes  say  they're  still  eager  to  compete  in  the  Games,  which  are  less  than  three  weeks  away.  Organizers  say  they're  confident  officials  have  a  handle  on  the  situation.  And  Russia's  leaders  say  they've  stepped  up  security  around  the  area  in  a  "Ring  of  Steel"  that  attackers  won't  penetrate.But  those  reassurances  haven't  stopped  serious  concerns  about  safety  among  spectators,  competitors  and  security  analysts.Warnings  fuel  travel  fearsAfter  decades  of  hearing  about  the  Olympics  from  afar  as  her  husband  helped  cover  them  for  a  French-Canadian  television  network,  Madigan  decided  this  was  the  year  for  the  family  to  fly  from  Washington,  D.C.,  to  Sochi  and  join  him.She  started  worrying  when  she  learned  about  last  month's  terrorist  attacks  in  Volgograd,  Russia,  which  killed  more  than  30  people,  but  she  tried  to  tamp  down  her  concerns.A  U.S.  State  Department  travel  alert  earlier  this  month  convinced  her  that  the  situation  was  serious.The  wording  of  the  alert,  which  calls  large-scale  public  events  like  the  Olympics  "an  attractive  target  for  terrorists,"  and  mentions  previous  attacks  in  Russia  was  strong  enough  to  make  Madigan  decide  to  back  out."It's  an  official  voice  telling  you  that  yes,  your  fears  are  right.  ...  OK,  it's  not  just  me.  There's  another  voice,  a  voice  with  some  gravitas  saying,  'Be  careful  out  there.'"And  the  potential  security  threats  seem  to  be  mounting,  Madigan  said."It  hasn't  stopped,"  she  said.  "Over  the  past  couple  of  days,  it's  continuing."So  while  news  reports  surged  this  week  about  new  threats  to  the  games,  a  wanted  terror  suspect  on  the  loose  and  warships  readying  to  evacuate  U.S.  citizens  if  necessary,  Madigan  has  been  canceling  plane  tickets.  Taking  her  kids  to  Sochi,  she  said,  is  out  of  the  question."We  fear  not  only  for  their  safety,  but  also  the  repercussions  that  it  would  have  if  they  were  in  the  part  of  the  world  that  experienced  something  horrible  ...  and  just  the  logistics  of  getting  out  of  there,"  she  said.Security  concerns  like  Madigan's  are  cited  by  some  as  a  reason  for  sluggish  Olympics  ticket  sales  --  though  vendors  in  the  United  States  told  CNN  that  demand  is  "at  expected  levels"  and  that  last-minute  sales  will  likely  surge  in  Russia.Organizers  in  Russia  said  last  week  that  around  30%  of  available  tickets  still  hadn't  been  purchased,  the  Russian  RIA  Novosti  news  agency  reported.  If  those  seats  remain  unsold,  Russian  President  Vladimir  Putin  suggested  volunteers  might  fill  the  remaining  spots  in  the  stands.'I'm  definitely  going  to  be  vigilant'Canadian  Domenico  Ciarallo  said  he  has  no  plans  to  give  up  his  tickets,  but  he's  worried  about  security,  too.He  was  watching  TV  with  his  mother  in  Montreal  when  news  broke  of  last  month's  bombing  at  the  Volgograd  train  station,  a  transit  hub  400  miles  way  from  Sochi."She  looked  at  me  and  she  said,  'You're  not  going  to  Sochi.  I  lost  your  father,  I'm  not  losing  one  of  my  kids.'"But  Ciarallo  said  he  didn't  cancel  his  trip,  despite  his  mother's  concerns.  He  regularly  travels  around  the  world  on  business  trips  and  knows  that  there's  no  predicting  danger."Anything  can  happen  on  a  plane  or  train  or  automobile.  I  don't  live  by  that,"  he  said.  "For  sure,  I'm  worried.  It's  obviously  a  concern.  But  you  know  what,  I'm  definitely  going  to  be  vigilant,  and  keep  my  eyes  open  around  me,  and  be  aware  of  my  surroundings."In  the  meantime,  he's  looking  forward  to  staying  on  a  cruise  ship  docked  alongside  the  coastal  city  and  picking  up  his  spectator  pass  so  he  can  take  in  as  many  events  as  he  can.As  part  of  the  stepped  up  security  measures  for  this  year's  games,  Russia  required  visitors  to  provide  photos,  passport  information  and  ticket  numbers  in  advance  to  receive  the  passes.That,  Ciarallo  said,  shows  how  serious  they  are  about  keeping  the  Games  safe."I'm  probably  95%  excited  and  nervous,  and  maybe  5%  scared,"  he  said.  "I  think  once  we  get  there,  I  think  that  kind  of  fear  will  start  to  recede.  I  think  you  really  have  to  hit  the  ground  running  and  see."Coach:  Athletes  must  'try  and  fight  through'  fearsTara  Lipinski,  who  won  a  gold  medal  in  figure  skating  in  the  1998  Winter  Olympics  and  will  be  attending  this  year's  games  as  a  commentator  for  NBC,  said  she  feels  safe,  despite  the  warnings."You  can't  take  this  lightly.  But  at  the  same  time,  being  at  the  Olympics,  I  have  never  experienced  security  that  high.  So  hopefully  that  will  put  these  athletes  at  ease,"  she  told  CNN  Monday.  "I'm  hoping  that  the  atmosphere  is  not  overshadowed  by  this."Boston  Bruins  coach  Claude  Julien,  who  will  serve  as  assistant  coach  for  Canada's  men's  hockey  team,  told  ESPN  this  week  that  he's  determined  to  push  forward."There's  no  doubt  that  what's  happened  lately  is  certainly  --  (terrorists  are)  trying  to  obviously  shake  us  and  probably  in  a  lot  of  cases  they  are  succeeding.  But  ...  we  have  to  try  and  fight  through  that,"  he  said.  "At  the  same  time,  you  have  to  hope  that  the  people  in  charge  are  doing  the  best  they  can.  There's  never  any  guarantees  in  this  life  and  you'd  like  to  make  it  as  safe  as  possible.  That's  basically  all  I  can  say,  because  my  job  is  to  go  there  and  help  coach  a  team  and  hope  that  the  people  in  charge  of  that  are  going  to  do  the  best  job  they  can  and  make  it  a  successful  Olympics."Security  has  also  become  a  top  concern  for  journalists  covering  the  Olympics  this  year,  said  NBC  Special  Correspondent  Meredith  Vieira,  who  will  be  cohosting  the  network's  coverage  of  the  opening  ceremony."We  had  a  lot  of  conversations  at  NBC  News  about  it  and  (NBC)  Sports,  and  after  a  certain  point,  it's  a  bit  of  a  leap  of  faith,  you  know,"  she  told  CNN's  "Piers  Morgan  Live.""You  hope  that  the  security  is  there.  I  hope  that  they  (the  Russians)  share  information  more  than  they  have  with  the  U.S.  Right  now,  that's  kind  of  a  rough  point.  But  I'm  going.  And  you  know,  they  talk  about  that  'Ring  of  Steel,'  and  I  hope  it's  there."Analysts:  Sochi  faces  unique  riskThe  Olympics  are  expected  to  bring  6,000  athletes  from  85  countries  to  Sochi.  And  throngs  of  spectators  are  expected  to  watch  from  the  stands,  with  nearly  40,000  security  officers  standing  guard.It's  nothing  new  to  worry  about  security  at  the  Olympics  or  any  major  sporting  event.  And  authorities  have  vowed  for  months  that  safety  is  a  top  priority.But  the  situation  is  different  in  Sochi,  some  security  experts  say,  particularly  with  recent  terrorist  attacks  elsewhere  in  the  country."The  threats  have  been  backed  up  with  incidents,  with  attacks,"  said  Carl  Herron,  a  former  crisis  response  agent  for  the  FBI  who  was  at  the  London  and  Turin  Olympics.  "The  percentage  of  something  happening  from  here  on  is  probably  high.  It  can  happen  two  days  before  the  Olympics  start,  or  it  can  happen  today,  so  that  really  escalates  the  intensity  of  the  security  apparatus."Terror  analysts  say  Sochi  is  uniquely  at  risk  because  Islamic  militant  hotbeds  are  within  the  country  --  leaving  the  Olympics  closer  than  ever  to  danger."This  group  does  not  have  to  fly  in  from  the  Middle  East  or  North  Africa  or  Asia  or  some  remote  location,"  former  FBI  assistant  director  Tom  Fuentes  said.

Apple  has  also  made  legal  filings  in  support  of  the  companies'  lawsuit.Under  the  agreement,  companies  will  be  allowed  to  publish  broad  categories  of  data  on  government  requests  for  customer  information  made  via  national  security  letters,  and  orders  made  by  surveillance  court,  both  for  general  customer  data  and  for  content  of  customer  communications.The  companies  will  also  be  allowed  to  say  how  many  customer  accounts  are  affected.  The  detail  companies  can  provide  will  be  limited  to  groups  of  a  thousand,  or  250,  depending  on  which  option  companies  choose  to  use.The  court  complaints  have  been  dismissed,  a  spokeswoman  for  the  companies  said  in  a  statement."We  filed  our  lawsuits  because  we  believe  that  the  public  has  a  right  to  know  about  the  volume  and  types  of  national  security  requests  we  receive,"  the  statement  said.  "We're  pleased  the  Department  of  Justice  has  agreed  that  we  and  other  providers  can  disclose  this  information.  While  this  is  a  very  positive  step,  we'll  continue  to  encourage  Congress  to  take  additional  steps  to  address  all  of  the  reforms  we  believe  are  needed."The  lawsuit  by  the  companies  followed  leaks  by  former  National  Security  Agency  contractor  Edward  Snowden  that  made  public  the  existence  of  certain  NSA  surveillance  programs.The  government  has  fought  the  corporate  request,  saying  even  broad  numbers  would  hurt  national  security.  The  companies  have  argued  they  should  be  allowed  to  publish  aggregate  data,  in  part  to  reassure  customers.The  companies  contend  their  businesses  are  hurt  by  any  perception  they  are  arms  of  vast  government  surveillance.Currently,  they  can  release  information  on  general  law-enforcement  requests  with  no  specifics.In  a  January  17  speech  at  the  Justice  Department,  President  Barack  Obama  signaled  his  administration  was  willing  to  allow  the  companies  to  make  data  public.The  night  before  the  speech,  tech  company  lawyers  met  at  the  White  House  with  lawyers  from  the  Justice  Department  and  intelligence  agencies,  according  to  a  government  official  familiar  with  the  meeting.Deputy  Attorney  General  James  Cole,  and  his  chief  of  staff,  David  O'Neil,  proposed  a  compromise  that  prompted  the  White  House  to  include  the  issue  in  the  President's  speech.Last  Thursday  and  Friday,  the  company  lawyers  and  Justice  Department  officials  completed  terms  of  their  agreement,  the  official  said.</TEXT></DOC>

"Gonzo  treated  himself  to  a  massage  today  to  try  to  work  out  all  of  his  stuntman  kinks.  Even  weirdos  need  pampering.  #bougielife  #yolo,"  reads  the  caption  to  this  pic:The  Muppets'  curmudgeonly  yet  lovable  critics,  Statler  and  Waldorf,  are  still  trying  to  get  the  hang  of  taking  the  perfect  selfie  --  "This  is  the  fanciest  calculator  we've  ever  seen!"  they  were  heard  saying  when  the  photo  was  taken  --  while  Rowlf  is  clearly  a  selfie  king.From  the  Swedish  Chef  to  Miss  Piggy's  evil  alter  ego,  everyone  has  gotten  in  on  the  first-person  photo  sessions.  The  only  people  noticeably  missing  from  the  account  are  the  Muppets'  human  co-stars  in  "Muppets  Most  Wanted,"  like  Tina  Fey,  Ty  Burrell  and  Ricky  Gervais.As  with  the  first  "Muppets"  film,  which  also  starred  Amy  Adams,  Chris  Cooper  and  Rashida  Jones,  the  "Muppets"  sequel  has  plenty  of  human  star  power.  In  addition  to  Fey  and  Gervais,  "Muppets  Most  Wanted"  also  has  appearances  from  Tom  Hiddleston,  Salma  Hayek,  Stanley  Tucci  and  Lady  Gaga.Directed  by  James  Bobin,  who  also  helmed  the  first  film,  "Muppets  Most  Wanted"  takes  the  fan-favorite  characters  to  Europe,  where  they  find  themselves  entangled  in  a  jewel  heist  led  by  a  Kermit  the  Frog  doppelganger.The  movie,  which  released  a  Super  Bowl  trailer  earlier  this  month,  arrives  in  theaters  March  21.</TEXT></DOC>

Virginia  water  weeks  after  leak</TITLE><TIME>Fri,  28  Mar  2014  12:43:56  EDT</TIME><ABSTRACT>Tap  water  testing  in  10  homes  in  West  Virginia  found  a  chemical  that  leaked  from  an  industrial  storage  facility  in  January  was  still  in  the  water  supply  a  month  later,  though  at  levels  within  the  state's  allowable  threshold.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Tap  water  testing  in  10  homes  in  West  Virginia  found  a  chemical  that  leaked  from  an  industrial  storage  facility  in  January  was  still  in  the  water  supply  a  month  later,  though  at  levels  within  the  state's  allowable  threshold.On  January  9,  a  chemical  called  4-methylcyclohexane  methanol,  or  MCHM,  was  discovered  leaking  from  a  storage  tank  into  the  Elk  River  and  from  there  into  Charleston's  water  supply.  The  licorice-like  smell  of  the  chemical  --  which  is  used  to  clean  coal  --  alerted  residents  to  the  contamination  and  led  to  a  do-not-use  order  for  300,000  West  Virginians,  some  of  whom  could  not  drink  or  bathe  in  their  water  for  more  than  a  week."Water  is  continually  flowing  through  the  system  and  it's  cleaning  it  out,"  said  Andrew  Whelton,  a  professor  at  the  University  of  South  Alabama  and  a  leader  of  an  independent  testing  group.  "But  clearly  the  evidence  exists  that  chemicals  still  remain  in  the  drinking  water."At  the  state's  request,  Whelton's  group  independently  sampled  tap  water  in  10  homes  February  11-18  from  the  affected  area,  finding  concentrations  as  high  as  6.1  parts  per  billion,  and  as  low  as  0.5  parts  per  billion.While  the  chemical  was  detected  in  all  10  homes,  each  home  was  sampled  multiple  times,  and  some  samples  showed  levels  below  the  detectible  level  of  0.5  parts  per  billion.West  Virginians:  We  don't  drink  the  waterThere  has  been  no  testing  in  people's  homes  since  February,  but  Whelton  recently  told  CNN  that  today  "levels  are  likely  much  lower  than  they  were"  at  the  time  of  that  testing.Whelton's  group  will  convene  a  panel  of  experts  on  April  1  to  discuss  whether  West  Virginia's  threshold  of  10  parts  per  billion  is  adequately  safe."The  latest  data  we  have  through  our  survey  is  up  to  March  1,  and  what  we  found  was  5%  or  less  (of  residents)  are  actually  using  the  water,"  Dr.  Rahul  Gupta,  health  officer  and  executive  director  of  the  Kanawha-Charleston  and  Putnam  County  health  departments,  said  Friday.  "And  that's  matched  anecdotally,  when  you  go  out  into  the  community,  ask  people  --  there's  very  few  people  relatively  speaking  two  and  a  half  months  down  the  road  actually  using  the  water."Little  is  known  about  the  health  effects  of  the  chemical,  which  is  used  to  wash  coal  before  market  to  reduce  ash.  There  are  no  studies  of  human  consumption.The  spill  was  originally  estimated  at  about  7,500  gallons,  but  Freedom  Industries,  owner  of  the  facility  where  the  leak  occurred,  said  in  late  January  that  about  10,000  gallons  of  chemical  had  escaped.  The  company  also  told  regulators  that  a  second  chemical  --  a  mix  of  polyglycol  ethers,  known  as  PPH  --  was  part  of  the  leak.Officials  lifted  the  do-not-use  order  later  in  January,  saying  the  chemical  was  found  at  very  low  levels.  But  some  weren't  so  sure,  especially  since  they  said  they  smelled  odd  odors.  Whelton's  testing  confirmed  a  licorice  or  a  sweet  smell  in  some  of  the  samples."People  should  be  concerned  that  this  chemical  was  not  present  before,  and  it  is  present  now,  and  there  needs  to  be  answers  as  to  why  the  odors  remain  and  what's  causing  those  odors,"  said  Whelton.An  independent  water  test  conducted  in  February  at  CNN's  request  found  trace  levels  of  MCHM  in  untreated  river  water  and  in  tap  water  from  two  homes  in  Charleston.  The  amounts  ranged  from  less  than  0.5  parts  per  billion  to  1.6  parts  per  billion,  well  below  the  1  part  per  million  that  the  CDC  has  said  it  considers  unlikely  to  be  associated  with  any  adverse  health  effects.In  the  wake  of  the  spill,  Gupta  said  in  February,  two  waves  of  patients  sought  treatment  from  private  doctors  and  10  emergency  rooms  in  a  nine-county  area  for  nonspecific  symptoms  such  as  rash,  nausea,  vomiting  and  cough.The  first  peak  --  about  250  patients  --  occurred  in  the  first  three  days  after  the  spill  was  reported  on  January  9,  he  said  in  February.A  lull  ensued  during  the  several  days  of  the  do-not-use  advisory,  followed  by  a  second  peak  --  about  the  same  number  --  during  the  first  few  days  after  the  advisory  was  lifted  on  January  13,  he  said.The  adverse  symptoms  seem  to  have  all  but  stopped,  Gupta  said  Friday.West  Virginia  asks  feds  to  study  possible  health  effects  of  chemical  spillGupta  acknowledged  in  February  that  his  findings  were  "nonscientific"  and  that  he  did  not  know  what  the  baseline  incidence  would  be  of  patients  appearing  at  an  ER  with  such  symptoms,  but  said  the  anecdotes  point  to  the  need  for  further  studies.He  has  called  for  a  long-term  study  to  be  carried  out  "in  a  manner  able  to  capture  any  long-term  impact."But  the  West  Virginia  Poison  Center  said  in  a  posting  on  February  10  that  some  symptoms,  such  as  nausea  and  headaches,  may  not  indicate  that  the  chemicals  were  harmful."These  symptoms  are  not  due  to  toxic  effects  but  are  a  body's  physical  and  real  response  to  unusual  smells/tastes,"  it  said,  adding  that  the  poison  center  received  calls  from  more  than  1,900  patients  reporting  chemical  exposures  related  to  the  drinking  water  in  the  days  after  the  spill  was  reported."Most  reported  symptoms  included  mild  rashes  and  reddened  skin  from  dermal  exposure,  or  GI  distress  (nausea,  vomiting  and/or  diarrhea)  from  ingesting  contaminated  water.  The  symptoms  tended  to  be  mild  and  self-limiting."A  spokeswoman  for  West  Virginia  American  Water  Co.  said  in  February  the  company  was  continuing  to  flush  the  system  to  get  rid  of  pockets  of  licorice  smell  that  remain.  "For  us,  it's  not  over  until  we  resolve  the  odor  issue,"  said  Maureen  Duffy.On  March  21  and  22,  the  company  tested  water  going  into  and  coming  out  of  the  water  treatment  facility,  and  did  find  MCHM  in  the  water  leaving  the  facility,  though  at  levels  below  1  part  per  billion,  officials  there  said.Company  officials  said  they  will  be  changing  their  16  filters,  scheduled  to  begin  next  week.  The  process  will  take  eight  weeks  to  complete,  according  to  the  utility  company."Until  they  change  the  filters  ...  we're  not  going  to  use  the  water  at  all,"  says  Jacquelyn  Bevan,  a  local  resident.  "We  haven't  used  it  since  day  1."Dr.  Tanja  Popovic,  the  director  of  the  CDC's  National  Center  for  Environmental  Health,  said  February  5  that  repeated  testing  had  shown  the  water  to  be  acceptable  for  all  uses."What  I  can  say  is  that  with  all  the  scientific  evidence  that  we  have,  with  everything  that  numerous  people  have  worked  on  so  far,  I  can  say  that  you  can  use  your  water  however  you  like,"  Popovic  said.  "You  can  drink  it;  you  can  bathe  in  it;  you  can  use  it  how  you  like."Grand  jury  investigating  chemical  spill</TEXT></DOC>

Like  the  $100  Roku  3  set-top  box,  the  new  $50  Roku  Streaming  Stick  has  a  large  selection  of  apps  for  streaming  content,  including  all  the  major  online  services  such  as  Netflix,  Hulu  and  Amazon  Instant.The  new  Roku  stick  is  about  the  size  of  a  pack  of  gum  and  will  be  available  in  April.As  game  consoles,  cable  boxes  and  other  bulky  accessories  pile  up  in  living  rooms,  the  smaller,  more  discreet  stick  approach  is  becoming  an  appealing  choice  for  consumers  who  want  to  watch  Internet  content  on  their  TV  screens  without  adding  to  the  clutter.This  is  not  Roku's  first  foray  into  the  stick  form  factor.  But  unlike  its  2-year-old  $90  version,  the  Streaming  Stick  will  pop  into  any  HDMI  port,  making  it  compatible  with  many  more  televisions.The  Roku  Streaming  Stick  will  compete  directly  against  Google's  well-received  Chromecast,  released  last  year.  The  Google  dongle  costs  only  $35  and  also  plugs  into  any  TV  HDMI  port.  To  watch  Internet  content  on  the  Chromecast,  you  hit  a  button  on  compatible  apps  from  an  Android  or  iOS  smartphone  or  tablet.Both  sticks  require  a  separate  power  source,  either  through  a  USB  port  on  the  back  of  the  TV  or  by  plugging  into  a  wall.The  Roku  Streaming  Stick  will  cost  a  few  bucks  more  than  the  Chromecast  but  includes  a  dedicated  remote  control,  like  other  Roku  products.  For  people  who  prefer  navigating  with  soft  buttons  to  swiping  a  smartphone  screen,  this  can  be  a  big  plus.Roku's  biggest  advantage  is  content.  Because  the  service  has  been  around  for  a  while,  it  has  many  more  streaming  options  than  the  Chromecast.  There  are  currently  about  1,200  available  apps  for  Roku.Google  recently  opened  up  its  Chromecast  device  to  outside  developers,  so  it's  possible  a  wave  of  new  content  is  on  its  way.  For  now,  its  big  names  are  Netflix,  HBO  Go,  Hulu,  YouTube  and  Google  Play,  plus  a  handful  of  smaller  apps.A  third  major  competitor  in  the  streaming-to-TV  space  is  Apple  TV.  Apple's  offering  is  still  an  old-fashioned  box,  but  it  could  just  be  a  matter  of  time  before  the  company  jumps  on  the  stick-shaped  bandwagon.  It  has  more  content  options  than  a  Chromecast  but  still  lags  behind  the  Roku.  Of  course,  an  Apple  device  would  appeal  to  people  already  deep  into  the  Apple  ecosystem.Cable  companies  have  been  slow  to  update  their  set-top  boxes,  and  smart  TVs  haven't  caught  on  in  the  same  way  that  easy-to-use  Apple  TV,  Chromecast  and  Roku  have.  Roku  is  also  working  directly  with  television  manufacturers  to  integrate  its  technology  into  their  TVs.</TEXT></DOC>

According  to  a  police  report,  the  ex-boyfriend  claimed  Capriati  started  screaming  at  him  before  punching  him  with  a  closed  fist  four  times  in  the  chest.The  ex-boyfriend,  Ivan  Brannan  Jr.,  said  he  was  eventually  able  to  lock  himself  in  the  men's  locker  room,  according  to  the  police  report.  Four  days  later,  he  went  to  police  headquarters  and  outlined  what  he  said  were  "seven  other  incidents  pertaining  to  Capriati  stalking/harassing/following"  him.Brannan  said  he'd  dated  the  American  tennis  player  from  May  2011  to  February  2012.Capriati's  camp  has  denounced  the  allegations."The  current  facts  being  circulated  by  Mr.  Brannan  are  an  overexaggeration  and  the  police  report  is  one-sided  in  (his)  favor,  since  they  failed  to  get  Ms.  Capriati's  side  of  the  story,"  read  a  statement  attributed  to  the  ex-tennis  player's  legal  representative  last  year.Capriati  burst  on  the  tennis  scene  as  a  teenager,  breaking  into  the  sport's  ranking  of  top  10  players  by  14  and  advancing  to  the  semifinals  of  the  French  Open  in  1990.She  remained  a  force  on  the  tour  into  the  early  1990s,  highlighted  by  a  gold  medal  win  at  the  1992  Summer  Olympics  in  Barcelona,  Spain.But  Capriati's  star  status  faded  the  next  few  years,  a  time  that  included  widely  reported  arrests  on  shoplifting  and  marijuana  possession  charges.  She  remained  off  the  court  into  the  late  1990s.The  New  York-born  tennis  player  came  back  strong  at  the  end  of  the  decade,  and  in  2001  won  the  Australian  Open  and  the  French  Open  on  her  way  to  becoming  the  world's  No.  1  player  that  year.  Another  Australian  Open  title  came  the  following  year.The  2004  season  was  Capriati's  last.  Eight  years  later,  she  was  inducted  into  the  International  Tennis  Hall  of  Fame.CNN's  Janet  DiGiacomo  and  Greg  Botelho  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

A  senior  writer  for  ESPN  and  lecturer  at  Northwestern  University,  the  former  Hechinger  Institute  fellow  has  had  his  commentary  recognized  by  the  Online  News  Association,  the  National  Association  of  Black  Journalists  and  the  National  Lesbian  and  Gay  Journalists  Association.  Follow  him  on  Twitter  @locs_n_laughs.(CNN)  --  In  the  fall  of  1995,  I  jumped  into  a  large  van  with  about  20  other  young  black  men,  and  we  headed  out  from  the  small  college  town  of  Kalamazoo,  Michigan,  to  Washington.Destination:  the  Million  Man  March.The  mission:  addressing  the  ills  crippling  black  men.We  were  an  intellectually  curious  and  rambunctious  group.  Loud,  idealistic  Gen  Xers,  raised  on  the  sweet  nectar  of  Public  Enemy's  message  of  personal  responsibility  and  the  films  of  Spike  Lee  that  encouraged  us  to  fight  the  power.  So  convinced  that  this  event  was  going  to  change  the  world  that  when  we  turned  on  the  radio,  and  McFadden  and  Whitehead's  "Ain't  No  Stopping  Us  Now"  came  on,  I  took  the  song  as  providence.Nearly  20  years  later  and  I'm  sure  I  don't  need  to  rattle  off  all  of  the  discouraging  statistics  regarding  men  of  color  in  this  country  to  illustrate  that  moment  was  anything  but  the  awakening  it  was  designed  to  be.Yet  I  sat  Thursday  in  the  East  Room  of  the  White  House  --  listening  to  President  Barack  Obama  as  he  announced  his  "My  Brother's  Keeper"  initiative,  looking  at  the  young  men  who  stood  on  risers  behind  him,  listening  to  the  affirmative  audibles  of  the  attendants,  like  the  congregation  of  a  Southern  Baptist  church  --  and  I  found  myself  fondly  reminiscing.  I  found  myself  inspired.When  I  first  came  to  Washington  to  address  the  unique  circumstances  hindering  men  of  color,  it  was  with  a  megaphone  shouting  at  the  White  House.  On  this  day,  I  was  in  the  White  House,  and  the  megaphone  had  been  replaced  with  a  microphone  clipped  to  a  podium  that  bears  the  seal  of  the  President.Progress.Afterward  I  was  asked  if  I  thought  this  initiative  would  make  a  difference.My  answer  was  yes.True,  the  cynic  will  look  at  the  laundry  list  of  already  created  programs  --  locally  and  nationally  --  that  were  designed  to  dismantle  the  debilitating  factors  that  have  plagued  men  of  color  over  the  years,  look  at  "Keeper"  and  shrug.Others  will  accuse  Obama  of  promoting  division  by  using  the  office  to  highlight  the  issues  of  minorities  over  those  of  their  white  counterparts.  As  if  one  in  three  black  males  being  projected  to  go  to  prison  at  some  point  in  their  lives  can  be  construed  as  some  sort  of  highlight.But  such  is  the  world  of  the  first  black  President  of  these  United  States.Obama  spent  the  first  five  years  of  his  administration  cautiously  touching  on  the  issue  of  race  --  a  beer  summit  here,  a  hypothetical  "son"  in  the  wake  of  the  killing  of  Trayvon  Martin  there  --  likely  for  fear  of  being  perceived  as  only  caring  about  the  needs  of  "his  people"  as  opposed  to  "the  people."As  a  result,  he  has  been  the  target  of  sharp  criticism  from  some  within  the  black  community  who  see  him  aggressively  addressing  the  pain  of  the  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,  and  transgender  community,  or  tackling  issues  such  as  immigration  that  greatly  affect  Latinos,  and  they  wonder  what  about  us?What  about  our  pain?The  wealth  of  black  households  has  declined  more  than  any  other  demographic  during  Obama's  time  as  President  and  those  hurt  most  by  this  wonder:  What  about  us?Blood  continues  to  flow  and  bullets  fly  in  the  neighborhood  streets  he  calls  home  and  the  residents  wonder,  what  ...  about  ...  us?Thursday  he  said,  I  hear  you.I  was  asked  if  that  would  make  a  difference.My  answer  is  yes.Obama's  address  was  not  about  government.It  was  about  community.His  community,  which  is  my  community,  which  is  your  community.For  as  much  as  the  narrative  has  historically  reflected  a  storyline  framed  around  the  troubles  of  one  section  of  society,  the  reality  is  no  section  is  immune  economically  from  the  effects  of  this  crisis.Men  of  color  are  more  prone  to  drop  out  of  high  school  than  anyone  else.A  majority  of  inmates  lack  a  high  school  diploma.In  a  21-year  span  ending  in  2003,  the  amount  of  money  spent  on  prisons  increased  by  570%.That  money  comes  from  taxes.Dots  connected.Not  to  mention  the  loss  of  workers  and  the  well-documented  effects  of  unplanned  pregnancies  coupled  with  absentee  fathers.And  when  news  reports  of  young  men  dying  from  gang  violence  no  longer  elicit  an  emotional  response  --  a  sad  reality  the  President  talked  about  --  we  are  indeed  in  a  moral  crisis.Will  "Keeper"  make  a  difference?.Yes.Whether  Obama  is  freed  from  the  need  to  appease  now  that  he's  in  his  second  term  or  driven  by  the  urgency  of  the  moment,  the  forming  of  "My  Brother's  Keeper"  is  the  most  tangible  manifestation  of  his  "Change  We  Can  Believe  In"  slogan  in  years.  And  while  $200  million  promised  by  various  corporations  and  philanthropic  groups  is  but  a  "drop  in  the  bucket"  in  terms  of  the  resources  needed  --  as  one  of  his  critics,  Tavis  Smiley,  pointed  out  soon  thereafter  --  the  fact  he  was  able  to  raise  that  amount  quietly  is  an  indication  that  addressing  this  crisis  has  been  on  his  mind  for  some  time.Even  if  he  was  hesitant  to  talk  about  it.Michael  Cruz,  a  local  student  involved  in  an  education  supplemental  program  called  Communities  in  Schools,  was  one  of  those  young  men  standing  on  the  risers  behind  the  president.  He  spoke  to  me  about  what  it  was  like  to  spend  time  with  Obama  and  how  he  has  already  been  encouraged  by  what  the  President  wants  to  do."People  are  always  trying  to  bring  your  self-esteem  down,"  the  16-year-old  from  Washington  told  me.  "I  have  neighbors  and  kids  in  school  telling  me  that  I  won't  turn  out  to  be  anything  and  stuff  like  that."Some  parts  of  my  neighborhood  are  good  and  some  parts  people  are  doing  drugs  and  stuff  like  that.  But  I  try  not  to  pay  any  attention  to  them  and  stay  focused  on  my  goals."Goals  that  include  going  to  college  and  becoming  a  chemical  engineer.Over  the  past  two  days,  he  has  gotten  to  know  Michael  Carter,  a  15-year-old  at  his  school.  While  Cruz  has  two  parents  in  the  home,  Carter  said  he  is  raised  by  his  mother  and  gets  support  from  his  aunts  and  cousins  who  help  him  stay  out  of  trouble."Getting  to  know  Michael  has  been  a  great  experience  because  he  has  goals  like  I  do,"  Carter  said.  "I  didn't  know  him  before,  but  now  that  I  have,  we've  become  good  friends.  I  know  I  will  do  all  I  can  to  encourage  him  and  help  him  because  seeing  him  do  well  will  inspire  me  to  do  well."Carter,  who  wants  to  attend  Syracuse  University  and  major  in  computer  science,  is  his  brother's  keeper.And  so  if  you  saw  the  President's  address  or  read  some  of  his  remarks  and  wonder  if  it  would  make  a  difference  ...First  think  of  Cruz  and  Carter  and  invariably  your  answer  will  be  yes.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  LZ  Granderson.</TEXT></DOC>

Connect  with  Cynthia  on  Facebook,  Twitter  and  Pinterest.(Health.com)  --  The  start  of  the  new  year  is  the  ultimate  opportunity  to  undo  the  holiday  damage,  make  a  fresh  start  and  resolve  to  avoid  the  indulgences  that  have  left  you  feeling  less-than-confident  about  your  body.To  get  results  that  won't  fizzle  out  before  February,  check  out  my  previous  post  "5  questions  to  ask  before  trying  any  diet"  on  Health.com,  as  well  as  the  tips  below  for  coping  with  the  challenges  that  often  go  along  with  a  new  quest  to  shed  pounds.Confusion  over  which  approach  is  bestThe  top  question  I'm  asked  these  days  is,  "What  should  I  do?!"  Nearly  everyone  I  talk  to  feels  overwhelmed  about  the  myriad  of  popular  approaches  others  swear  by,  many  of  which  are  drastically  different  from  each  other,  including  detoxes  and  cleanses,  ditching  carbs  and  eating  like  a  caveman,  going  gluten  free,  and  becoming  vegan.I  don't  think  there  is  a  one-size-fits-all,  but  in  my  15+  years  counseling  clients,  I  do  know  this:  if  a  particular  approach  doesn't  feel  right  for  you,  it  will  surely  backfire.For  example,  I  recently  had  a  client  who,  before  working  with  me,  had  cut  out  all  carbs,  including  whole  grains,  fruit,  and  most  veggies.  Despite  struggling  with  fatigue,  headaches,  mood  swings,  intense  cravings,  and  trouble  concentrating  at  work,  she  tried  to  stick  with  it,  because  an  ultra  low-carb  diet  seemed  to  be  the  trendy  way  to  lose  weight.  After  breaking  down  and  bingeing  on  bread,  then  sweets,  and  realizing  that  her  body  and  brain  "just  didn't  work  right"  without  any  carbs,  she  was  ready  for  a  different  approach.Before  you  begin  your  chosen  weight  loss  tactic,  do  a  gut  check  to  be  sure  it  feels  sane  and  sustainable.  And  if  a  structured  plan  isn't  right  for  you,  focus  on  committing  to  a  few  changes  you  know  you  can  stick  with,  like  trading  fast  food  for  quick  homemade  meals,  ditching  diet  products,  or  consistently  making  simple  swaps,  like  eating  spaghetti  squash  instead  of  spaghetti.Health.com:  16  ways  to  lose  weight  fastNot  losing  weight  fast  enoughI  know  that  seeing  quick  results  is  key  for  staying  motivated,  and  feeling  confident  and  inspired  to  stay  on  track,  but  it's  important  to  put  numbers  in  perspective.If  you  don't  hit  a  double  digit  loss  within  a  week,  don't  assume  that  your  approach  isn't  working.  Shedding  just  a  single  pound  of  body  fat  is  like  melting  16  ounces  of  shortening  (one  of  those  short,  round  tubs)  off  of  your  frame,  which  can  make  a  huge  difference  in  how  you  feel  and  how  your  clothes  fit.  On  the  flip  side,  losing  water  weight,  which  is  far  easier  and  faster,  does  nothing  to  change  your  body  composition,  and  you  can  regain  it  all  within  a  matter  of  hours.So  rather  than  getting  hung  up  on  numbers,  focus  on  how  you  feel,  whether  your  jeans  fit  looser,  and  how  your  body  is  changing,  like  clearer  skin,  less  facial  puffiness,  etc.And  if  you  really  aren't  seeing  results,  it  may  be  time  to  get  honest  about  your  habits  --  check  out  my  previous  post  "5  little  white  lies  you  tell  yourself  that  derail  weight  loss"  on  Health.com.BloatingOne  of  the  side  effects  of  adopting  a  cleaner,  healthier  eating  plan  you  may  not  expect  is  an  increase  in  bloating.  Upping  your  intake  of  fruits,  veggies,  whole  grains,  beans,  lentils,  and  nuts,  can  mean  a  considerable  increase  in  your  daily  fiber  intake.Because  fiber  doesn't  get  broken  down  and  absorbed  from  your  GI  tract  into  your  blood  stream,  it  has  to  work  its  way  through  your  system,  which  can  take  a  few  days.  Eating  fiber  is  also  kind  of  like  strength  training  to  your  digestive  tract,  because  your  GI  muscles  have  to  contract  to  push  the  fiber  through,  to  be  eliminated.  Continuing  to  eat  this  way  consistently,  and  drinking  plenty  of  water,  helps  to  lessen  the  effects,  but  your  belly  may  balk  initially.Health.com:  Best  superfoods  for  weight  lossJust  remember  that  bloating  has  nothing  to  do  with  your  weight  or  body  composition.  In  other  words,  trading  a  muffin  or  scone  for  oatmeal  topped  with  fresh  fruit  and  nuts  may  make  your  belly  a  bit  rounder  after  breakfast,  but  if  you're  losing  body  fat  and  upgrading  your  nutrition  game,  it's  worth  a  little  temporary  expansion  -  and  in  time,  your  body  will  adjust.Lack  of  supportThis  is  probably  the  top  barrier  my  clients  face  when  trying  to  stick  with  a  new  lifestyle  approach.Often  significant  others,  friends,  family  members,  and  coworkers  sanction  skipping  the  gym,  offer  tempting  treats,  or  suggest  social  activities  that  revolve  around  unhealthy  patterns,  like  pizza  and  Redbox,  or  going  out  to  dinner."I  feel  like  everyone  is  out  to  sabotage  me!"  is  a  phrase  I  hear  a  lot.  If  you  find  yourself  in  the  same  boat,  seek  out  support  where  you  can.Recruit  another  health  conscious  coworker  to  eat  lunch  with,  connect  with  like-minded  friends  via  email,  text,  or  online,  and  celebrate  your  own  successes  by  giving  yourself  regular  pats  on  the  back  or  healthy  rewards  for  getting  through  challenging  situations.  Even  something  small,  like  a  song  download,  new  app,  a  10-minute  chair  massage,  or  a  single  fresh  flower  for  your  desk  can  help  you  stay  in  an  empowered  frame  of  mind  that  makes  it  easier  to  cope  when  you  lack  support  from  others.And  if  you  need  to  have  a  heart-to-heart  with  the  people  closest  to  you  (to  ask  for  help,  or  at  the  very  least  to  not  be  hindered),  check  out  my  previous  post  "DOs  and  DON'Ts  for  dealing  with  food  pushers"  on  Health.com.Slipping  up  on  difficult  daysRegardless  of  how  great  you  feel  after  revamping  your  eating  habits  and  regularly  hitting  the  gym,  there  are  going  to  be  days  when  you'll  want  to  give  up.The  truth  is  it  does  take  more  time,  energy,  and  awareness  to  live  healthfully.  So  after  a  stressful  day,  when  you're  already  tired  and  you  still  have  to  cook  dinner,  you  may  feel  like  throwing  in  the  towel.  Plus,  we're  practically  programmed  from  birth  to  turn  to  food  as  a  way  to  soothe,  escape,  reward,  and  comfort  ourselves  -  so  when  you're  mad  at  your  boss  or  boyfriend,  foregoing  a  healthy  home-cooked  meal  and  ordering  a  pizza  instead  kind  of  go  hand  in  hand.Health.com:  10  ways  your  personality  affects  your  weightWhen  you  feel  that  urge,  reach  out  to  your  support  systems,  focus  on  the  rewards  of  staying  on  track  that  go  far  beyond  weight  loss,  like  improvements  in  your  mood,  sleep,  and  self-confidence,  and  try  to  remember  how  great  you  feel  when  you're  taking  care  of  yourself.  And  if  you  still  wind  up  falling  off  the  wagon,  start  fresh  the  next  day.Losing  weight  is  about  consistency,  not  perfection,  so  don't  let  one  "off"  meal  or  day  derail  you  completely  --  steadily  eating  healthfully  and  being  active,  with  a  few  slip  ups  here  and  there,  will  produce  far  better  results  than  streaks  of  strict  days  followed  by  an  equal  or  greater  number  of  indulgent  ones.This  article  originally  appeared  on  Health.comCopyright  Health  Magazine  2011</TEXT></DOC>

Bills  were  introduced  in  the  Senate  and  House,  but  little  progress  was  made."Will  we  be  able  to  have  more  of  an  impact  if  we  can  get  Congress,  for  example,  to  pass  a  minimum  wage  law  that  applies  to  everybody,  as  opposed  to  me  just  through  executive  order  making  sure  that,  folks  who  are  contractors  to  the  federal  government  have  to  pay  a  minimum  wage?  Absolutely,"  said  Obama.On  Tuesday,  he  promised  to  take  action  raising  the  minimum  wage  for  government  contract  workers  to  $10.10  per  hour.The  nation's  unemployment  rate  fell  to  6.7%  in  December,  but  the  drop  came  mainly  from  workers  leaving  the  labor  force.Roughly  4  million  people  are  considered  long-term  unemployed,  those  out  of  work  for  27  weeks  or  more.  Efforts  backed  by  Obama  to  extend  a  federal  program  providing  jobless  benefits  to  that  group  fell  flat  this  month  in  Congress.Weak  job  growthObama  added  that  his  administration  will  continue  reaching  out  to  the  House  and  Senate  on  key  initiatives."But  I'm  not  going  to  wait  for  them,"  the  President  said.Critics  have  said  Obama's  push  for  executive  action  illustrates  diminished  expectations.  But  he  stressed  key  accomplishments  achieved  through  Congress  during  his  five  years  in  office,  including  health  care  and  education."In  no  way  are  my  expectations  diminished,  or  my  ambitions  diminished.  But  what  is  obviously  true,  is  we've  got  divided  government  right  now.  The  House  Republicans,  in  particular,  have  had  difficulty  rallying  around  any  agenda,  much  less  mine.  And  in  that  kind  of  environment,  what  I  don't  want  is  the  American  people  to  think  that  the  only  way  for  us  to  make  big  change  is  through  legislation,"  Obama  said.Companies  to  pledge  help  for  long-term  joblessIn  a  separate  interview,  Rep.  Paul  Ryan,  the  2012  Republican  vice  presidential  candidate  and  a  potential  White  House  hopeful  next  time  around,  told  Tapper  that  Obama  appears  to  be  circumventing  the  Constitution  with  an  "end  run"  around  Congress."If  there's  something  he  thinks  needs  to  be  changed  in  law,  then  he  needs  to  make  the  case  to  Congress,"  Ryan  said,  noting  that  there  is  an  "effective  way"  to  use  the  bully  pulpit  "to  encourage  good  things."</TEXT></DOC>

But  even  so,  criminal  charges  could  complicate  things  for  the  19-year-old  singer  --  and  if  he's  charged  with  and  convicted  of  any  drug  offenses,  that  could  change  the  equation.What  crimes  lead  to  deportation?In  addition  to  the  charges  he  faces  in  Florida,  investigators  in  California  are  also  weighing  whether  Bieber  will  face  a  felony  vandalism  charge  tied  to  an  egg  attack  there.Immigration  lawyers  say  convictions  on  those  charges  wouldn't  generally  lead  to  deportation  for  someone  like  Bieber,  who  has  a  visa  allowing  him  to  legally  live  in  the  United  States  because  of  his  "extraordinary  ability"  in  the  arts.That's  because  those  charges  aren't  considered  to  be  aggravated  felonies  or  crimes  of  moral  turpitude  --  the  two  types  of  crimes  that  federal  law  defines  as  grounds  for  the  deportation  of  non-citizen  immigrants.And  according  to  federal  law,  only  violent  crimes  and  sentences  longer  than  one  year  result  in  a  re-evaluation  of  a  person's  visa  status.Translation  for  those  of  you  who  aren't  legal  eagles:  Bieber's  probably  not  going  anywhere.But  when  it  comes  to  deportation  proceedings,  it's  not  a  simple  matter."It's  a  very  complex  area  of  immigration  law,"  said  Annaluisa  Padilla,  a  California  immigration  lawyer.An  "aggravated  felony"  sounds  severe.  And  often  they  are;  crimes  like  murder,  rape  or  sexual  abuse  are  among  the  violations  that  fit  that  description.But  crimes  that  might  sound  less  serious  to  the  average  person  can  also  be  considered  aggravated  felonies.In  2000,  for  example,  a  federal  appeals  court  determined  that  a  man  with  a  green  card  was  an  aggravated  felon  after  a  misdemeanor  conviction  for  stealing  Tylenol  and  cigarettes,  according  to  the  Transactional  Records  Access  Clearinghouse  Immigration  project  at  Syracuse  University,  which  follows  immigration  trends  and  statistics.Sometimes,  Padilla  said,  a  crime  considered  a  misdemeanor  at  the  state  level  is  viewed  as  a  felony  by  federal  immigration  officials.The  bottom  line:  Until  investigators  finish  weighing  their  options  and  the  criminal  case  against  Bieber  proceeds,  it's  impossible  to  predict  how  his  immigration  status  could  be  impacted.Drugs  could  change  the  equationAfter  his  arrest  in  Florida  last  week,  Bieber  "made  some  statements  that  he  had  consumed  some  alcohol,  and  that  he  had  been  smoking  marijuana  and  consumed  some  prescription  medication,"  Miami  Beach  Police  Chief  Raymond  Martinez  said.Since  then,  breathalyzer  tests  have  suggested  Bieber  was  not  too  drunk  to  legally  drive  when  he  was  pulled  over  by  Miami  Beach  police  early  Thursday.  But  it  could  be  two  or  three  weeks  before  tests  that  should  give  a  more  accurate  blood-alcohol  reading  and  could  tell  if  he  was  high  on  pot  are  back  from  the  lab.When  authorities  searched  Bieber's  California  home  earlier  this  month,  a  deputy  found  suspected  illegal  drugs  at  the  bedside  of  Bieber  house  guest  Lil  Za,  who  now  faces  a  felony  drug  charge.  But  a  detective  who  searched  other  parts  of  the  home  told  CNN  last  week  that  he  saw  "no  sign  of  drugs"  there.Bieber  hasn't  been  charged  with  any  drug-related  crimes  in  connection  with  either  case.But  if  drugs  were  involved,  that  could  change  the  equation  when  it  comes  to  immigration  issues,  experts  say."He  may  have  a  difficult  time  returning  to  the  U.S.  after  traveling,"  Padilla  said.  "If  there  is  a  conviction  on  the  use  of  marijuana,  he  may  run  into  some  issues  when  renewing  his  visa  or  even  attempting  to  apply  for  residency."And  if  authorities  add  a  drug  charge  into  the  mix,  that  could  eventually  put  deportation  on  the  table,  said  Ira  Kurzban,  an  attorney  in  Miami  who  wrote  a  widely  used  reference  book  on  immigration  law."Deportation  grounds  for  drug-related  crimes  are  broadly  defined,"  Kurzban  said.  But  a  drunk-driving  charge  that  isn't  drug-related,  he  said,  "is  not  a  basis  to  deport  somebody."Decision  near  on  Bieber's  egging  charge;  singer  takes  it  easy  in  PanamaA  double  standard?Bieber  was  released  Thursday  from  a  Miami  jail  an  hour  after  he  made  a  brief  appearance  through  a  video  link  before  a  judge,  who  set  a  $2,500  bond  that  afternoon.Since  his  arrest,  some  critics  have  wondered  whether  Bieber  wouldn't  be  deported  for  reasons  that  have  little  to  do  with  the  law.In  a  CNN.com  opinion  column  last  week,  CNN  contributor  Ruben  Navarrette  suggested  the  wealthy  singer's  star  status  might  be  getting  him  special  treatment."Bieber  has  an  estimated  net  worth  of  about  $130  million,"  Navarrette  wrote.  "I  bet  that,  right  about  now,  many  of  those  Mexican  immigrants  who  were  deported  because  they  came  to  the  attention  of  local  police  officers  for  a  burned-out  taillight,  or  for  not  making  a  complete  stop  at  an  intersection,  are  wishing  that  they  had  been  a  rich,  white  kid  with  marginal  music  ability  and  too  much  money.  If  so,  things  might  have  gone  differently  for  them."But  Padilla  says  there's  a  key  difference  between  such  examples  and  Bieber's  case:  He  has  a  visa."The  reason  an  individual  who  had  failed  to  stop  at  a  stop  sign  or  is  driving  without  a  license  comes  in  contact  with  immigration  authorities  is  because  they're  undocumented,"  Padilla  said.  "You're  not  comparing  apples  to  apples."CNN's  Alan  Duke  and  Todd  Leopold  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Follow  her  on  Twitter  or  Facebook.(CNN)  --  New  research  shows  that  some  students  are  doing  more  than  three  hours  of  homework  a  night  --  and  that  all  that  school  work  may  be  literally  making  them  sick.It  may  be  tempting  to  dismiss  this  latest  research,  conducted  in  upper-middle-class  areas,  as  yet  another  manifestation  of  the  eccentricities  of  the  affluent.  This  is,  after  all,  the  same  demographic  that  recently  brought  us  eye-roll-inducing  news  stories  about  $250-an-hour  tutors  who  drill  preschoolers  on  their  ABCs  and  1-2-3s.Could  it  be  that  a  few  short  years  later  those  same  tots  have  graduated  to  marathon  homework  sessions?"The  three  hours  of  homework  a  night  was  an  average,  by  the  way,"  says  Denise  Pope,  senior  lecturer  at  the  Stanford  Graduate  School  of  Education  and  co-author  of  the  study  published  in  the  Journal  of  Experimental  Education."We  had  kids  in  the  study  who  were  doing  way  more,"  as  many  as  five  hours  in  some  cases.  Even  in  schools  that  have  a  policy  limiting  homework,  advanced  placement  and  honors  classes  are  often  exempt.The  study  surveyed  more  than  4,300  students  from  10  high-performing  public  and  private  high  schools  in  upper-middle-class  California  communities.  The  researchers  sought  to  examine  the  relationship  between  homework  load  and  student  well-being  and  engagement,  as  well  as  to  understand  how  homework  can  act  as  a  stressor  in  students'  lives.Is  it  good  to  let  kids  screw  up?Their  findings  were  troubling:  Research  showed  that  excessive  homework  is  associated  with  high  stress  levels,  physical  health  problems  and  lack  of  balance  in  children's  lives;  56%  of  the  students  in  the  study  cited  homework  as  a  primary  stressor  in  their  lives."We  found  a  clear  connection  between  the  students'  stress  and  physical  impacts  --  migraines,  ulcers  and  other  stomach  problems,  sleep  deprivation  and  exhaustion,  and  weight  loss,"  Pope  observed.Pope's  findings  are  particularly  interesting  when  compared  to  recent  National  Assessment  of  Educational  Progress  data  about  homework  trends  for  the  larger  population.As  it  turns  out,  most  students'  homework  load  has  remained  remarkably  stable  since  1984,  according  to  the  Brookings  Institute's  2014  Brown  Center  Report  on  American  Education.So  what's  going  on  with  the  kids  from  affluent  families?Pope  and  her  colleagues  focused  on  upper-middle-class,  privileged  schools  because  it  is  in  these  communities  that  the  accepted  value  of  homework  is  deeply  and  unquestioningly  entrenched.  Here  many  students  describe  schoolwork  and  the  pressures  of  high  academic  performance  as  a  dominating  force  in  their  day.Pope  found  in  her  work  with  Challenge  Success,  a  Stanford  collaboration  formed  in  response  to  increasing  emotional  and  mental  health  issues  in  American  students,  that  homework  kept  coming  up  as  a  tension  point.There  were  parents  who  wanted  more  homework  and  others  who  wanted  less.  There  were  parents  who,  if  the  teacher  was  not  giving  homework  at  the  younger  grades,  would  buy  their  own  workbooks  and  hand  them  to  their  children.  Pope  even  heard  from  parents  lamenting  that  they  had  not  seen  their  children  over  an  entire  holiday  weekend  because  they  were  attempting  to  complete  homework  assignments."We  realized  that  we  need  intervention  around  homework,"  she  said,  and  not  just  with  high  school  students.  While  the  present  study  was  conducted  with  high  schoolers,  "we  have  the  same  data  from  the  younger  years."The  researchers  acknowledged  the  limitation  of  their  reliance  on  students'  self-reporting,  but  felt  that  it  was  important  to  explore  the  students'  firsthand  descriptions  of  their  experiences  with  excessive  homework.And  while  some  of  the  grousing  about  having  too  much  homework  and  feeling  stressed  out  may  seem  like  typical  adolescent  complaints,  this  latest  study  joins  a  growing  body  of  research  that  paints  a  disturbing  tableau  about  the  unrelenting  pressure  on  privileged  children.That  children  growing  up  in  poverty  are  at-risk  for  a  number  of  ailments  is  both  intuitive  and  well-supported  by  research.  More  difficult  to  believe  is  the  growing  consensus  that  children  on  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum,  children  raised  in  affluence,  may  also  be  at  risk.Suniya  S.  Luthar,  professor  of  psychology  at  Arizona  State  University,  dismissed  the  hesitation."When  you  say  that  poverty  is  a  risk  factor,  that  doesn't  mean  that  all  poor  kids  are  troubled,"  she  said.  "It's  exactly  the  same  for  upper-middle-class  children  of  upwardly  mobile  families.  All  we  are  saying  is  that  a  larger  proportion  of  these  children  are  at  risk,  as  compared  to  the  average  American  community."Zakaria:  U.S.  must  spend  more  on  education  for  poorer  childrenLuthar's  rigorous  (and  fascinating)  research  first  sounded  the  alarm  on  how  youth  from  upper-middle-class  communities  are  at  risk  for  a  number  of  serious  disturbances,  including  drug  and  alcohol  abuse,  depression  and  anxiety.The  reason:  an  enormous  amount  of  pressure,  including  "family  dynamics,  peer  norms,  pressures  at  schools,  and  policies  in  higher  education,"  writes  Luthar  in  a  rigorous  analysis,  "I  Can,  Therefore  I  Must:  Fragility  in  the  Upper  Middle  Classes."These  findings  have  implications  that  go  far  beyond  homework,  stress  levels  or  even  health.  They  are  also  part  of  a  larger  cultural  conversation  about  the  profound  downsides  of  our  all-work,  no-play,  winner-takes-all  society.In  the  meantime  it  is  important  to  keep  in  mind  that  the  single  most  robust  protective  factor  for  chronic  and  potentially  toxic  childhood  stress  is  social  and  family  support;  that  is,  a  responsive  relationship  with  an  adult  caregiver."Parents'  first  responsibility  is  to  the  health  of  their  child,"  Pope  says.  "Parents  need  to  be  advocates  and  cheerleaders,  not  graders  and  correctors.  And  you  certainly  don't  want  to  say  to  your  kid,  'Give  me  half  of  the  homework!'"What's  the  magic  number  when  it  comes  to  homework?"In  high  school,  nothing  over  two  hours.  In  middle  school,  no  more  than  90  minutes,"  she  replied.What  about  in  elementary  school?  "There  is  no  correlation  between  homework  and  academic  achievement  in  elementary  school."But  what  about  those  nonacademic  skills  teachers  talk  about,  like  a  sense  of  responsibility?  Doesn't  homework  in  the  early  years  teach  children  how  to  become  more  organized  and  to  meet  deadlines?  The  research  doesn't  show  that,  Pope  says."Look,  we're  not  talking  about  picketing,"  observed  Pope.  "Parents  need  to  advocate  for  their  children  with  the  tools  and  numbers  and  research  in  hand.  We're  talking  about  respectful  dialogue."</TEXT></DOC>

He  never  mentioned  the  overwhelming  early  favorite  for  the  2016  Democratic  nomination  --  former  Secretary  of  State  Hillary  Clinton.Clearly  Biden,  the  longtime  senator  who  now  is  the  White  House  conduit  to  blue-collar  union  workers  essential  to  Democratic  support,  is  seriously  considering  a  presidential  run.Asked  by  CNN's  Kate  Bolduan  when  he  would  decide,  Biden  answered  a  realistic  timetable  would  be  the  summer  of  2015.That  response,  and  a  closer  look  at  Biden's  words  Friday,  also  show  that  if  Clinton  decides  to  run  --  as  expected  --  then  Biden  will  step  aside."He  is  effectively  saying,  look,  it  depends  on  what  Hillary  Clinton  decides  to  do,"  noted  Gloria  Borger,  CNN's  chief  political  analyst.Here  are  some  of  Biden's  remarks  in  the  interview  with  Bolduan,  and  a  look  at  what  he  was  really  saying:1)  "There  may  be  reasons  I  don't  run,  but  there's  no  obvious  reason  for  me  why  I  think  I  should  not  run."Biden  is  hedging  his  bets.  He  acknowledges  it  may  not  happen,  but  makes  clear  the  reason  won't  be  because  he  doesn't  want  to  or  isn't  qualified  for  the  job.That's  another  way  of  saying  there  are  circumstances  beyond  his  control,  meaning  a  Clinton  decision  to  enter  the  race.Supporters  are  already  raising  money  for  the  former  first  lady  and  senator  who  served  with  Biden  in  President  Barack  Obama's  Cabinet  and  would  be  the  nation's  first  woman  President.Clinton  has  said  she  will  make  up  her  mind  sometime  in  2014.  Polls  show  her  with  a  commanding  lead  over  other  possible  Democratic  contenders,  including  Biden.2)  "Realistically,  a  year  this  summer."Biden's  answer  when  Bolduan  asks  for  a  timetable  for  his  decision  is  the  clearest  signal  that  his  choice  depends  on  whether  Clinton  runs.To  Peter  Hamby,  CNN  Digital's  national  political  reporter,  waiting  until  the  middle  of  2015  --  just  six  months  or  so  before  the  Iowa  caucuses  --  would  be  way  too  late  to  take  on  Clinton."If  these  guys  are  going  to  get  in  and  run  for  president,  whoever  it  is,  challenging  Hillary  Clinton,  they  really  have  to  start  laying  groundwork,"  Hamby  said.  "They  have  to  raise  money  and  hire  staff  and  recruit  volunteers  in  these  early  states."As  vice  president,  Biden  has  the  advantage  of  constant  media  focus  if  desired,  which  would  help  him  maintain  a  high  profile  without  some  of  the  normal  steps  of  mounting  a  presidential  campaign.That  could  help  if  Clinton  doesn't  run  and  lesser-known  contenders  such  as  Maryland  Gov.  Martin  O'Malley  enter  the  race.  However,  Biden's  lag  in  announcing  his  candidacy  would  leave  him  at  a  huge  disadvantage  against  a  Clinton  campaign  expected  to  have  the  backing  of  the  party  machinery.3)  "Am  I  the  best  qualified  person  to  focus  on  the  two  things  I've  spent  my  whole  life  on  --  give  ordinary  people  a  fighting  chance  to  make  it  and  a  sound  foreign  policy  that's  based  on  national  interest  of  the  United  States,  where  we  not  only  are  known  for  the  power  of  our  military,  but  the  power  of  our  example."Biden  lays  out  his  rationale  for  running,  stressing  his  two  major  strengths  as  a  candidate  --  foreign  policy  and  working-class  ties.As  the  former  chairman  of  the  Senate  Foreign  Relations  Committee,  Biden  has  the  necessary  foreign  policy  credentials,  particularly  against  candidate  ABC  (Anybody  But  Clinton).  However,  her  four  years  as  secretary  of  state  negates  some  or  all  of  a  Biden  advantage.On  appealing  to  middle  class  workers,  Biden  showed  his  strength  in  the  2010  and  2012  elections  when  he  went  to  states  such  as  Ohio  where  Obama  was  less  popular.In  Clinton,  though,  he  would  face  the  wife  of  former  President  Bill  Clinton,  who  remains  extremely  popular  among  traditional  Democratic  constituencies.In  Friday's  interview,  Biden  didn't  mention  Hillary  Clinton  by  name,  but  she  is  the  biggest  factor  in  whether  he  goes  for  it.4)  "It  doesn't  mean  I'm  the  only  guy  that  can  do  it,  but  if  no  one  else  I  think  can  and  I  think  I  can,  then  I  will.  If  I  don't  I  won't."The  vice  president  sums  up  his  future  decision  with  two  qualifiers  --  that  no  else  runs  who  can  do  what  he  can,  and  that  he  still  thinks  he  can  deliver  the  goods.Biden  could  decide  that  he  is  better  qualified  than  Clinton  on  what  he  considers  the  key  issues,  but  he  would  have  to  think  twice  if  her  already  anticipated  campaign  has  started  strongly  and  generated  initial  momentum.If  he  were  to  run  and  win  in  2016,  Biden  would  be  74  when  he  took  office,  making  him  the  oldest  ever  to  begin  a  presidency.  By  the  end  of  his  first  term,  he  would  be  the  oldest  U.S.  President  in  history.So  while  he  remains  energetic  and  passionate,  talking  about  getting  his  Corvette  Z06  from  zero  to  60  in  3.4  seconds,  the  clock  is  ticking  and  Biden  knows  it.</TEXT></DOC>

He  is  the  author  of  "Jimmy  Carter"  and  "Governing  America."(CNN)  --  With  talk  about  the  2016  election  heating  up,  most  of  the  national  media  has  turned  the  focus  on  former  Secretary  of  State  Hillary  Clinton  and  Vice  President  Joseph  Biden.Clinton  and  Biden  would  be  formidable  candidates.  Either  would  be  a  logical  successor  to  President  Barack  Obama  as  the  leader  of  the  Democratic  Party.Yet  if  they  are  to  be  successful,  they  will  need  to  look  outside  the  beltway  to  learn  about  the  kinds  of  issues  that  are  animating  voters  outside  of  Washington.  They  would  do  well  to  draw  on  some  of  the  ideas  that  have  been  percolating  in  recent  months  from  newer  voices  in  the  party.And  at  a  time  when  politicians  can  suffer  quick  downfalls,  as  New  Jersey  Gov.  Chris  Christie  is  learning,  Democrats  would  do  well  to  make  sure  that  they  have  other  potential  candidates  who  can  compete  on  the  national  stage,  should  Clinton  or  Biden  fail  to  materialize  as  2016  candidates.Inside  Politics:  Hillary  Clinton's  telling  words  about  criticsWhoever  runs,  the  future  of  the  Democrats  may  lie  in  learning  from  two  mayors,  two  governors  and  a  gubernatorial  candidate  who  are  all  building  on  the  traditional  Democratic  theme  of  security  --  a  theme  that  has  been  central  to  the  party  since  New  Deal  --  but  trying  to  do  so  in  new  ways.Democrats  have  an  exciting  group  of  mayors  who  have  been  garnering  enthusiasm  for  their  efforts  to  tackle  the  big  economic  and  social  issues  that  Washington  seems  incapable  of  resolving.In  New  York  City,  Mayor  Bill  de  Blasio  has  launched  a  full-scale  attack  on  economic  inequality.  His  campaign  captured  national  attention  when  he  spoke  about  the  tale  of  two  cities,  one  poor,  struggling  and  devastated,  and  the  other  wealthy  and  thriving.De  Blasio  kicked  off  his  time  in  office  with  ambitious  proposals  for  affordable  housing  as  well  as  prekindergarten  education.  He's  already  run  into  obstacles,  including  tensions  with  New  York's  Gov.  Andrew  Cuomo,  who  shot  down  his  plan  for  a  higher  minimum  wage.  De  Blasio  has  had  to  fend  off  complaints  about  snow  removal  and  controversy  over  his  call  to  a  police  official  to  ask  about  the  arrest  of  a  pastor,  who  has  been  one  of  his  strong  supporters.  Still,  the  mayor  has  excited  Democrats  about  the  possibilities  for  the  revitalization  of  urban  liberalism.Donna  Brazile:  Enough  already  with  the  obsession  over  Hillary  ClintonSan  Antonio  Mayor  Julian  Castro,  who  delivered  the  keynote  address  at  the  2012  Democratic  National  Convention,  has  devoted  energy  to  the  challenges  facing  Latinos  in  his  city.  He  has  made  an  impassioned  plea  to  treat  immigration  as  a  human  rights  issue,  urging  Congress  to  provide  a  path  to  citizenship  for  undocumented  immigrants.He  has  also  been  addressing  the  issues  that  greatly  concern  working  families,  such  as  prekindergarten  education  and  job  creation.  The  mayor  has  been  able  to  boast  about  its  strong  economic  record  in  2013,  with  growth  in  health  care  as  well  as  oil  and  gas  development,  in  addition  to  a  thriving  housing  market.  San  Antonio  is  frequently  placed  in  various  Top  10  lists  of  thriving  American  cities.Democratic  governors  have  also  been  making  waves.  In  Maryland,  one  potential  2016  presidential  candidate,  Martin  O'Malley,  has  been  responding  to  social  and  cultural  changes  that  have  been  transforming  the  nation  in  recent  years.O'Malley  has  been  one  of  the  governors  to  preside  over  the  legalization  of  medical  marijuana  and  to  oppose  the  death  penalty.  He  championed  economic  and  financial  assistance  to  illegal  immigrants,  such  as  legislation  that  offers  in-state  tuition  rates  for  universities.He  has  also  been  a  staunch  supporter  of  tougher  gun  control,  something  that  the  national  parties  have  failed  to  achieve  even  in  the  aftermath  of  horrendous  shooting  incidents.  Maryland  has  made  some  notable  progress  in  education  as  well  as  in  attracting  innovative  companies  to  the  state.Gov.  Cuomo  in  New  York  has  tried  to  combine  tough  fiscal  discipline  with  an  ongoing  commitment  to  the  social  safety  net.  Cuomo  has  demonstrated  his  willingness  to  question  some  political  orthodoxies  among  Democrats.Early  in  his  term,  Cuomo  took  on  public  employee  unions  and  got  big  concessions  from  them  in  his  effort  to  limit  spending  and  taxes.  Like  O'Malley,  he  has  supported  same-sex  marriage  legislation.Cuomo  backed  legislation  that  imposed  higher  taxes  on  wealthier  New  Yorkers  earlier  in  his  term,  though  he  disagreed  with  de  Blasio's  push  for  further  increases  this  year,  when  Cuomo  is  running  for  re-election.  He,  too,  has  obtained  stricter  gun  controls  at  a  time  that  the  federal  government  seemed  paralyzed  on  the  issueAnother  source  of  new  ideas  is  Juliette  Kayyem,  a  former  assistant  secretary  of  Homeland  Security  and  former  CNN  contributor.

We  rounded  up  the  highlights  below:She's  a  jokester  on  set  —  until  it's  showtimeWhile  filming  The  One  I  Love,  a  romantic  comedy  (with  a  twist)  that  premiered  at  Sundance  this  year,  Moss's  microphone  had  to  be  moved  because  it  was  picking  up  the  sound  of  her  heartbeat.  "She's  joking  around  casually  and  then  you  yell  'Action'  and  her  heartbeat  goes  to  150  beats  per  minute,"  says  co-star  Mark  Duplass.Helen  Mirren's  a  fanMoss  introduced  herself  to  Dame  Mirren  when  they  sat  at  the  same  table  at  this  year's  Golden  Globes,  to  which  Mirren  replied:  "I  know  who  the  f—  you  are."  Safe  to  say  Moss  has  made  it.The  cast  of  Mad  Men  play  iPhone  games  in  their  off-timeMoss  and  her  costars  get  along  a  lot  better  than  their  characters  do  on  the  show,  apparently  —  so  much  so  that  Moss  and  co.  tend  to  stick  around  after  filming  to  hang  out  in  what  they  call  the  set's  "base  camp,"  an  area  by  the  hair  and  makeup  trailers  that  acts  as  a  sort  of  living  room  for  the  cast.  There,  they  play  Heads  Up!,  a  game  in  which  Moss  excels.She's  lazy"I  don't  go  to  classes.  I  hate  hiking.  I  don't  go  to  flea  markets.  I  would  like  to  do  that  stuff  but  I  just  don't  do  that  stuff.  I  was  like,  'I  guess  we'll  go  to  the  beach,  because  that's  something  I  would  do  if  I  had  time  and  wasn't  so  lazy?'"  Moss  says  as  she  and  New  York's  reporter  drive  to  the  beach.  But  she  does  like  watching  shows  like  Scandal  and  Nashville  in  her  free  time  —  a  woman  after  our  own  heart!She  doesn't  want  to  talk  to  you  about  ScientologyHer  affiliation  with  the  church  is  well-known,  but  she's  done  addressing  it  —  even  to  her  friends.  "I  said  what  it  meant  to  me,  and  anyone  can  go  and  look  at  that  if  they  want  to  know  what  I  feel.  But  now  it's  private,  off  limits."Fred  Armisen  was...  not  the  best  husband"It  was  extremely  traumatic  and  awful  and  horrible,"  Moss  says  of  her  marriage  to  the  comedian,  which  lasted  eight  months.(The  couple  separated  in  2010.)  "At  the  same  time,  it  turned  out  for  the  best.  I'm  glad  that  I'm  not  there.  I'm  glad  that  it  didn't  happen  when  I  was  50.  I'm  glad  I  didn't  have  kids.  And  I  got  that  out  of  the  way.  Hopefully.

Now  it  is  collected  by  the  NSA  under  broad  legal  authority  to  keep  it  for  five  years.It  was  not  immediately  clear  how  the  White  House  proposal  differed  from  the  compromise  announced  by  Reps.  Mike  Rogers  of  Michigan  and  Dutch  Ruppersberger  of  Maryland  --  the  top  Republican  and  Democrat  on  the  House  Intelligence  Committee.Their  plan  would  end  the  automatic  NSA  collection  of  phone  metadata,  with  telecommunications  companies  keeping  such  records  for  at  least  18  months  --  as  they  do  now.Court  approvalTwo  layers  of  court  approval  would  be  needed  to  access  the  records  --  one  for  the  overall  surveillance  program  seeking  the  information,  and  another  for  the  specific  foreign  phone  number  being  investigated,  the  legislators  said.The  Snowden  leaks  unleashed  a  political  firestorm,  with  privacy  advocates  and  others  calling  the  NSA  surveillance  programs  a  violation  of  constitutional  rights.In  particular,  many  Americans  feared  inevitable  abuse  of  a  system  in  which  the  government  collected  billions  of  phone  records  for  possible  review  in  terrorism  investigations.Snowden,  now  living  in  Russia  while  seeking  asylum  from  U.S.  prosecution,  has  repeatedly  described  the  surveillance  programs  illuminated  by  his  leaks  as  unconstitutional.Several  legal  challenges  have  been  mounted  against  the  NSA  programs,  and  some  of  those  cases  could  reach  the  Supreme  Court  in  coming  years  to  set  up  a  judicial  review  of  the  constitutional  limits  of  government  surveillance  in  the  post  9/11  era.Obama  and  the  two  House  legislators  all  said  Tuesday  the  current  system  was  legal,  but  needed  changing  to  reassure  a  skeptical  publicObama:  "People  were  concerned"In  The  Hague,  Obama  argued  that  "clear  safeguards"  exist  against  "some  of  the  dangers  that  people  hypothesize  when  it  came  to  bulk  data.""But  I  recognize  that  people  were  concerned  about  what  might  happen  in  the  future  with  that  bulk  data,"  he  said.  "This  proposal  that's  been  presented  to  me  would  eliminate  that  concern."Rogers  argued  no  abuses  occurred  under  the  present  system,  but  he  acknowledged  public  concern  about  the  possibility  of  problems  down  the  road  if  the  government  kept  such  vast  stores  of  information."That's  really  what  we're  trying  to  do  here  is  alleviate  that  concern  that  there  could  be  abuse  in  the  future  of  these  programs,"  he  said.Authorization  for  the  current  NSA  programs  expires  on  Friday,  and  Obama  will  seek  a  temporary  renewal  until  Congress  passes  reform  legislation,  the  senior  administration  official  said.News  of  the  proposed  changes  came  during  Obama's  trip  to  Europe,  where  he's  mobilizing  support  for  isolating  Russia  over  its  military  occupation  and  annexation  of  Crimea  from  Ukraine.Snowden's  leaks  put  the  NSA's  surveillance  activities  under  global  scrutiny.  The  revelations  included  U.S.  spying  on  European  allies  and  others,  sparking  diplomatic  protests.Nine  months  of  negotiationsIn  January,  Obama  outlined  a  series  of  steps  --  some  immediate  and  some  requiring  time  to  work  out,  possibly  with  Congress  --  that  would  change  aspects  of  the  NSA  collection  of  phone  records  and  other  information  but  generally  leave  intact  the  core  and  function  of  existing  programs.Rogers  and  Ruppersberger  said  Tuesday  that  nine  months  of  negotiations  involving  the  intelligence  community  and  other  stakeholders  led  to  their  proposed  legislation.The  White  House  was  involved  in  the  discussions,  Ruppersberger  said,  while  Rogers  noted  the  Obama  proposal  came  out  after  the  committee  shared  its  plan  with  the  White  House  earlier  this  week.He  noted  that  more  work  remains  to  be  done  to  narrow  differences  with  the  White  House  and  the  Senate."We're  feeling  pretty  good  about  people  starting  to  coalesce  around  a  solution,"  Rogers  said,  adding  that  "there  will  be  people  who  are  married  to  their  own  positions."Initial  reaction  to  the  White  House  plan  included  praise  with  some  caution.Step  forwardDemocratic  Sen.  Ron  Wyden  of  Oregon,  a  leading  critic  of  the  NSA  surveillance  programs,  said  news  of  the  White  House  plan  amounted  to  an  executive  branch  retreat."For  years,  the  executive  branch  said  it  was  essential  to  have  this  information,  that  it  was  indispensable,"  Wyden  said,  noting  he  and  colleagues  argued  against  that  notion.  "Today's  exciting  news  for  the  constitutional  rights  of  the  American  people  is  the  administration  said  they  agree  with  us."Michelle  Richardson,  legislative  counsel  for  the  American  Civil  Liberties  Union,  called  the  reported  White  House  plan  "a  crucial  first  step  towards  reining  in  the  NSA's  overreaching  surveillance.""The  change  would  replace  the  dragnet  surveillance  of  millions  of  innocent  people  with  targeted  methods  that  are  both  effective  and  respect  Americans'  constitutional  rights,"  Richardson  said,  adding:  "It  is  critical  that  the  administration  also  end  other  bulk  collection  programs."CNN's  Jim  Sciutto,  Evan  Perez  and  Diane  Ruggiero  contributed  to  this  report</TEXT></DOC>

The  Hahn  family's  commitment  to  quality  is  driven  in  large  part  by  their  Christian  faith,  which  in  turn  may  soon  threaten  the  company's  very  existence.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Conestoga  Wood  Specialties  was  founded  a  half-century  ago  in  a  Pennsylvania  garage.  The  Hahn  family's  commitment  to  quality  is  driven  in  large  part  by  their  Christian  faith,  which  in  turn  may  soon  threaten  the  company's  very  existence.That  financial  and  constitutional  dynamic  is  now  before  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court,  in  a  high-stakes  encore  to  the  health  care  reform  law  known  as  Obamacare.  The  justices  will  hear  oral  arguments  Tuesday  in  a  dispute  involving  contraception  coverage  and  religious  liberty.The  court  will  review  provisions  in  the  Affordable  Care  Act  requiring  for-profit  employers  of  a  certain  size  to  offer  insurance  benefits  for  birth  control  and  other  reproductive  health  services  without  a  co-pay.  At  issue  is  whether  certain  companies  can  refuse  to  do  so  on  the  sincere  claim  it  would  violate  their  owners'  long-established  personal  beliefs."Our  religion  is  Mennonite;  that  is  our  faith.  Our  company  was  founded  on  that  religion  as  well,"  said  Conestoga's  President  Anthony  Hahn,  son  of  the  privately  held  company's  co-founder.  "We  feel  the  government  has  gone  too  far  in  too  many  instances.  It's  been  troubling  to  us  as  a  family."The  modest  furniture  maker's  pending  lawsuit  is  one  of  nearly  50  that  have  been  filed  in  federal  courts  from  various  corporations,  challenging  the  birth  control  coverage  benefits  in  the  law  championed  by  President  Barack  Obama.  That  law  has  come  in  for  separate,  fierce  political  criticism  over  its  rocky  public  introduction  last  fall.Two  separate  appeals  will  be  heard  together  in  the  high  court's  one-hour  public  session.  A  ruling  expected  by  late  June  could  clarify  whether  businesses  have  a  religious  liberty  right,  or  whether  such  constitutional  protections  apply  only  to  individuals.The  companion  legal  challenge  comes  from  Hobby  Lobby,  an  Oklahoma-based  retail  giant  that  will  have  more  than  700  arts  and  crafts  stores  nationwide  by  year's  end.  Both  corporations  emphasize  their  desire  to  operate  in  harmony  with  biblical  principles  while  competing  in  a  secular  marketplace.  That  includes  their  leaders'  publicly  stated  opposition  to  abortion.Under  the  ACA,  financial  penalties  of  up  to  $100  per  day,  per  employee  can  be  levied  on  firms  that  refuse  to  provide  comprehensive  health  coverage."The  fines  and  implications  are,  in  my  mind,  astronomical,"  said  Hahn,  who  employs  about  1,000  people.  "It's  devastating  to  any  company."Hobby  Lobby,  which  has  about  13,000  workers,  estimates  the  penalty  could  cost  it  $475  million  a  year.The  church-state  issue  now  in  the  spotlight  involves  three-pronged  rules  negotiated  last  year  between  the  Obama  administration  and  various  outside  groups.Under  the  changes,  churches  and  houses  of  worship  are  completely  exempt  from  the  contraception  mandate.Other  nonprofit,  religiously  affiliated  groups,  such  as  church-run  hospitals,  parochial  schools  and  charities  like  the  Little  Sisters  of  the  Poor,  must  either  offer  coverage,  or  have  a  third-party  insurer  provide  separate  benefits  without  the  employer's  direct  involvement.  Lawsuits  in  those  cases  are  pending  in  several  federal  appeals  courts  across  the  country.The  Hobby  Lobby  and  Conestoga  claims  are  in  yet  another  Obamacare  category:  for-profit  corporations  claiming  a  religion-based  exemption.These  suits  follow  the  high  court's  decision  two  years  ago  that  narrowly  upheld  the  key  funding  provision  of  the  health  care  law,  a  blockbuster  ruling  affirming  that  most  Americans  would  be  required  to  purchase  insurance  or  pay  a  financial  penalty,  the  so-called  individual  mandate.The  constitutional  debate  now  shifts  to  the  separate  employer  mandates  and  whether  corporations  themselves  enjoy  the  same  First  Amendment  rights  as  individuals.Three  federal  appeals  courts  around  the  country  have  struck  down  the  contraception  coverage  rule,  while  two  other  appeals  courts  have  upheld  it.  That  "circuit  split"  made  the  upcoming  Supreme  Court  review  almost  certain.David  Green  and  his  family  are  Hobby  Lobby's  owners  and  say  their  evangelical  Christian  beliefs  clash  with  parts  of  the  law's  mandates  for  comprehensive  coverage.They  say  some  of  the  drugs  that  would  be  provided  prevent  human  embryos  from  being  implanted  in  a  woman's  womb,  which  the  Greens  equate  with  abortion.Those  drugs  include  Plan  B  contraception,  which  some  have  called  the  "morning  after"  pill.The  large  retailer  says  it  already  provides  coverage  for  16  federally  approved  forms  of  contraception  --  such  as  condoms  and  diaphragms  --  for  its  roughly  13,000  employees,  who  Hobby  Lobby  says  represent  a  variety  of  faiths.The  White  House  has  said  it  believes  a  requirement  on  contraception  coverage  is  "lawful  and  essential  to  women's  health"  and  expressed  confidence  the  Supreme  Court  would  ultimately  agree.Obamacare's  supporters  say  it  does  not  require  individual  company  owners  to  personally  provide  coverage  they  might  object  to  but  instead  places  that  responsibility  on  the  corporate  entity."Throughout  our  nation's  history,  corporations  have  been  treated  differently  than  individuals  when  it  comes  to  fundamental,  personal  rights  of  conscience  and  human  dignity,"  said  lawyers  for  the  Constitutional  Accountability  Center,  a  progressive  public-interest  legal  group.  "The  First  Amendment's  free  exercise  guarantee  has  always  been  viewed  as  a  purely  personal  liberty."But  lawyers  representing  the  Hahns  say  they  deserve  freedom  from  what  they  call  state  intrusion  into  private  moral  decisions."The  question  in  this  case  is  whether  all  Americans  will  have  religious  freedom  and  will  be  able  to  live  and  do  business  according  to  their  faith,"  said  Matt  Bowman,  senior  legal  counsel  with  the  Alliance  Defending  Freedom.  "Or  whether  the  federal  government  can  pick  and  choose  what  faith  is,  who  are  the  faithful,  and  where  and  when  they  can  exercise  that  faith."A  key  issue  for  the  justices  will  be  interpreting  a  1993  federal  law  known  as  the  Religious  Freedom  Restoration  Act,  requiring  the  government  to  seek  the  "least  burdensome"  and  narrowly  tailored  means  for  any  law  that  interferes  with  religious  convictions.  Can  companies,  churches,  and  universities  be  included,  or  do  the  protections  apply  only  to  "persons?"The  justices  have  a  good  deal  of  discretion  to  frame  the  competing  issues  and  could  reach  a  limited  "compromise"  decision  through  narrow  statutory  interpretation.  They  could  conclude  individual  owners  can  make  the  religious  freedom  claim,  bypassing  the  corporate  rights  argument.Liberals  have  criticized  the  conservative  majority  high  court  for  being  overly  sympathetic  to  business  interests.The  botched  rollout  of  HealthCare.gov,  the  federal  Obamacare  website,  has  become  another  political  flashpoint  along  with  other  issues  that  many  Republicans  say  proves  the  law  is  unworkable.  Some  legal  analysts  say  the  birth  control  mandate  cases  are  only  the  beginning  of  a  broader  legal  fight  that  could  extend  to  end  of  the  decade."It  wouldn't  be  surprising  if  we  had  a  case  at  the  Supreme  Court  every  year  for  the  next  five  about  Obamacare,  as  the  lower  courts  get  in  the  nitty-gritty  of  exactly  how  to  implement  this  complicated  statute,"  said  Thomas  Goldstein,  a  leading  appellate  attorney  and  the  publisher  of  SCOTUSblog.  "There  are  a  lot  of  ambiguities;  there  are  a  lot  of  new  rules  that  agencies  are  (adopting).  There's  a  lot  of  anger  and  a  lot  of  contention  about  putting  this  statute  into  effect."As  for  Conestoga,  Anthony  Hahn  and  his  wife,  Carolyn,  believe  they  are  on  the  right  side  of  the  legal  and  moral  argument.  They  live  in  Lancaster  County  with  their  four  children,  just  down  the  street  from  their  second-generation  kitchen  cabinet  business,  which  has  expanded  over  the  years  into  four  other  states.  Nearby  are  Anthony's  two  brothers,  who  also  work  at  the  company,  and  his  parents,  Norman  and  Elizabeth  Hahn."It's  really  not  only  just  for  Conestoga.  We're  taking  a  stand  for  other  businesses  as  well,"  said  Anthony  Hahn  about  his  appeal.  "This  is  a  religious  liberty  issue  that  is  concerning  to  us."The  cases  are  Sebelius  v.  Hobby  Lobby  Stores,  Inc.  (13-354);  and  Conestoga  Wood  Specialties  Corp.  v.

Should  you  do  the  same?</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Paignton  Zoo  in  Devon,  England,  isn't  monkeying  around  with  their  animals'  diets  anymore.  Zookeepers  are  trading  the  monkeys'  favorite  fruit  in  for  green  leafy  vegetables,  saying  bananas  grown  for  human  consumption  are  full  of  sugar  and  calories."Wait,  even  the  fruit  isn't  healthy  anymore?  What's  left?!?!"  CNN  reader  NeoPrudentist  posted  in  what  was  soon  rated  the  No.  1  comment  on  the  story.What's  left,  indeed.  First  coffee.  Then  salmon.  Now  this?Not  to  worry  --  this  isn't  a  case  of  human  see,  human  do.  Despite  sharing  more  than  90%  of  our  DNA  with  these  fuzzy  primates,  humans  have  some  very  distinct  differences  in  anatomy.Those  English  zookeepers  aren't  totally  wrong.  All  fruit  contains  sugar,  and  bananas  are  slightly  denser  calorie-wise  than  other  types  of  fruit.  But  when  it  comes  to  nutritional  bang  for  your  buck,  bananas  are  hard  to  beat.  Just  remember  --  no  monkey  business:  Eat  'em  in  moderation.SugarBananas  contain  about  14  grams  of  sugar.You  may  have  heard  that  sugar  from  fruit  is  better  than  the  sugar  you  find  in  candy.  But  sugar  has  the  same  molecular  structure  whether  it  comes  from  a  kiwi  or  a  cupcake.Both  contain  fructose  and  glucose,  although  in  varying  proportions.  Neither  kind  of  sugar  is  really  better  or  worse  for  you,  experts  say;  the  body  just  processes  them  differently.  Fructose  is  broken  down  in  your  liver,  while  glucose  starts  to  break  down  in  your  stomach  and  needs  insulin  to  be  fully  metabolized.The  good  thing  about  fruit  is  that  the  sugar  often  comes  with  fiber,  which  slows  digestion  and  gives  the  body  time  to  use  it  as  fuel  instead  of  storing  it  as  fat.Speaking  of  fiber...Bananas  have  about  3.1  grams  of  fiber.Unripe  bananas  are  slightly  better  for  you  than  ripe  bananas,  experts  say.  Greener  bananas  contain  what's  called  resistant  starch,  a  type  of  fiber  that  your  body  has  trouble  absorbing.  Studies  show  resistant  starch  fills  you  up  and  may  even  help  you  burn  fat.Unripe  bananas  score  30  out  of  100  on  the  glycemic  index;  ripe  ones  score  about  50.  The  index  indicates  how  quickly  a  carbohydrate  increases  your  blood  sugar  levels.  Low-GI  foods  may  help  you  lose  weight  because  they  help  control  appetite  and  delay  hunger,  according  to  the  University  of  Sydney.Power  boost!Every  long-distance  runner  knows  the  power  of  a  good  banana.  The  fruit  contains  high  levels  of  potassium  and  magnesium  --  two  nutrients  athletes  lose  when  they  sweat.Bananas  also  have  a  chemical  property  that  may  help  control  stomach  pain  and  reduce  your  risk  of  diarrhea  or  constipation,  according  to  LiveStrong.com.That's  not  all.  One  banana  offers  about  25%  of  your  daily  need  for  vitamin  B6.  B6  is  important  for  about  100  different  metabolic  enzyme  reactions,  according  to  the  National  Institutes  for  Health,  and  is  involved  in  brain  development  during  pregnancy  and  infancy.</TEXT></DOC>

No  way,  responded  California's  highest  court.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Trust  me,  the  scandal-scarred  former  boy  wonder  said.  No  way,  responded  California's  highest  court.The  state  Supreme  Court  rejected  former  journalist  Stephen  Glass'  request  for  admission  to  the  bar  on  Monday,  finding  that  he  had  not  truly  reformed  in  the  15  years  since  he  made  up  facts  in  more  than  40  magazine  articles  --  and  then  lied  some  more  to  cover  up  his  misdeeds  in  one  of  the  journalism  world's  most  infamous  scandals.The  court  found  that  Glass,  who  works  as  a  paralegal  at  a  Beverly  Hills  law  firm,  lacks  "the  good  moral  character"  to  be  a  lawyer.  It  simply  doesn't  buy  the  disgraced  serial  liar's  arguments  that  he  has  changed.In  a  scathing  33-page  opinion  supporting  its  decision  to  deny  Glass  admission  to  the  California  State  Bar,  the  court  concluded  that  he  failed  to  show  genuine  remorse  and  never  fully  came  clean  on  all  his  fabrications  and  that  his  "lack  of  integrity  and  forthrightness"  continued  even  during  his  hearings  before  the  court.Lawyers  and  journalists  aren't  highly  regarded,  although  they  usually  rank  a  notch  above  lobbyists,  members  of  Congress  and  used-car  salespeople  in  Gallup's  annual  Honesty  and  Ethics  survey.Lawyer  jokes  to  the  contrary,  the  court  insisted,  "A  lawyer's  good  moral  character  is  essential  for  the  protection  of  clients  and  for  the  proper  functioning  of  the  judicial  system  itself."Glass,  who  has  declined  to  discuss  the  case  publicly,  could  not  be  reached  for  comment.  His  lawyer,  Arthur  Margolis,  said  he  was  disappointed  by  the  court's  decision.  He  said  there  would  be  no  futher  comment.Stephen  Glass  wants  to  be  a  lawyerGlass,  now  41,  was  a  rising  star  at  The  New  Republic  when  he  was  exposed  as  a  serial  fabulist  in  1998.  His  editors  investigated  and  learned  that  he  had  fabricated  quotes  and  sources  --  sometimes  entire  events  --  in  dozens  of  articles  he  wrote  over  three  years  for  the  magazine  and  other  publications.  The  events  of  his  rise  and  downfall  became  the  basis  of  a  movie,  "Shattered  Glass."Even  while  he  was  writing  magazine  pieces,  Glass  attended  night  classes  at  Georgetown's  law  school.  He  graduated  in  2000  and  passed  the  bar  exams  in  New  York  and  California.Richard  Bradley,  former  editor  of  George  magazine,  said  in  2011  that  at  least  three  pieces  Glass  wrote  for  the  magazine  contained  fabrications.  He  added  that  Glass  was  good  at  "figuring  out  people's  blind  spots."Bradley  said  he  forgave  Glass  long  ago  but  added,  "Being  a  lawyer  is  a  privilege,  not  a  right.  He  can  be  a  fully  contributing,  valuable  member  of  society  without  being  a  lawyer."Glass  withdrew  his  application  to  the  New  York  State  Bar  in  2003  when  it  became  obvious  he  would  be  turned  down.  He  applied  to  the  California  Bar  in  2005  after  he  moved  to  Los  Angeles.  A  bar  review  committee  declined  to  find  him  morally  fit  to  be  a  lawyer;  Glass  appealed,  and  the  California  Supreme  Court  added  "In  Re  Glass  on  Admission"  to  its  docket  for  2012.The  State  Bar  Court  argued  that  the  past  was  not  the  issue:  it's  Glass'  moral  character  today.  The  bar  examiners  --  the  lawyers  who  vet  other  lawyers  --  argued  that  Glass'  lies  were  so  "staggering"  he  hadn't  done  enough  to  demonstrate  he  had  reformed."Going  to  law  school  and  living  a  normal  life  isn't  enough,"  Rachel  Grunberg,  a  lawyer  for  the  bar  court,  said  in  2011.The  Supreme  Court  was  not  impressed  with  Glass'  arguments  that  he  was  sorry  for  what  he  had  done  and  that  he  had  changed.  Nor  was  it  impressed  that  he  had  won  over  a  long  list  of  accomplished  people."Our  review  of  the  record  indicates  hypocrisy  and  evasiveness  in  Glass'  testimony  at  the  California  State  Bar  hearing,"  the  court's  opinion  stated.  "We  find  it  particularly  disturbing  that  at  the  hearing  Glass  persisted  in  claiming  that  he  had  made  a  good  faith  effort  to  work  with  the  magazines  that  published  his  works.  He  went  through  many  verbal  twists  and  turns  at  the  hearing  to  avoid  acknowledging  the  obvious  fact  that  in  his  New  York  bar  application  he  exaggerated  his  level  of  assistance  to  the  magazines  that  published  his  fabrications."Writing  a  book  and  appearing  on  the  TV  newsmagazine  "60  Minutes"  cannot  be  considered  indicators  of  genuine  remorse,  the  court  observed.The  court  also  noted  that  since  Glass'  journalism  career  crashed  and  burned,  he  seemed  less  motivated  to  help  others  and  more  inclined  to  "advance  his  own  career  and  financial  and  emotional  well-being."  Even  his  volunteer  legal  work  was  not  particularly  charitable,  since  all  lawyers  are  expected  to  perform  pro  bono  work,  the  court  noted.</TEXT></DOC>

Why  did  you  stop  me?"  Bieber  asked  the  police  officer  who  pulled  him  over  just  after  4  a.m.,  according  to  the  arrest  report.Bieber,  19,  was  released  from  a  Miami  jail  an  hour  after  he  made  a  brief  appearance  through  a  video  link  before  a  Miami  judge,  who  set  a  "standard"  $2,500  bond  Thursday  afternoon.He  strutted  out  of  the  jail  dressed  in  black,  with  a  baggy  hoodie  covering  his  head.  His  pants  appeared  to  be  baggy  leather.  Bieber  briefly  sat  on  top  of  a  black  Cadillac  Escalade,  where  he  waved  to  screaming  fans,  before  he  was  chauffeured  away.At  the  bail  hearing,  the  singer,  dressed  in  an  orange  jail  uniform,  stood  silently  with  his  lips  sometimes  pursed  as  attorney  Roy  Black  represented  him  in  the  hearing  earlier.Black  told  Judge  Joseph  Farina  that  he  had  been  retained  by  Bieber's  manager.  He  said  his  partner  had  been  denied  access  to  Bieber  in  jail  before  the  hearing.Bieber  was  booked  into  a  Miami  jail  after  failing  a  sobriety  test,  Miami  Beach  Police  Chief  Raymond  Martinez  told  reporters  Thursday.Bieber  "made  some  statements  that  he  had  consumed  some  alcohol,  and  that  he  had  been  smoking  marijuana  and  consumed  some  prescription  medication,"  Martinez  said.A  Miami  Beach  officer  saw  Bieber  driving  a  yellow  Lamborghini  in  a  race  against  a  red  Ferrari  in  a  residential  area  of  Miami  Beach,  Martinez  said.  The  cars  were  speeding  at  about  55  to  60  mph  in  a  30  mph  zone,  he  said.Police  report  details  Bieber  arrestThe  officer  pulled  Bieber's  car  over,  but  the  singer  was  "was  not  cooperating  with  the  officer's  instructions,"  Martinez  said."At  first,  he  was  a  little  belligerent,  using  some  choice  words  questioning  why  he  was  being  stopped  and  why  the  officer  was  even  questioning  him,"  he  said.He  allegedly  ignored  a  police  officer's  request  to  keep  his  hands  on  the  car  while  he  did  "a  cursory  patdown  for  weapons,"  the  report  said."I  ain't  got  no  f***ing  weapons,"  the  arresting  officer  quoted  Bieber  as  saying.  "Why  do  you  have  to  search  me?  What  the  f***  is  this  about?"The  arrest  report  describes  Bieber  as  having  a  "flushed  face,  bloodshot  eyes,  and  the  odor  of  alcohol  on  his  breath."Bieber  failed  a  field  sobriety  test,  Miami  Beach  Police  Sgt.  Bobby  Hernandez  told  CNN.Two  black  SUVs  blocked  the  traffic  at  26th  and  Pine  Tree  Drive,  which  "facilitated  an  open  road"  for  the  two  cars  to  race  on  Pine  Tree,  the  report  said.The  Ferrari's  driver,  identified  as  19-year-old  Def  Jam  recording  artist  Khalil  Sharieff,  was  also  arrested  on  a  drunken  driving  charge,  police  said.Sharieff  posted  a  photo  on  his  Instagram  account  of  Bieber  in  the  yellow  Lamborghini  with  a  woman  behind  the  wheel  early  Thursday.  "U  know  bizzle  brought  that  lambo  out,"  he  wrote  in  the  caption.Another  posting  showed  a  photo  of  a  Ferrari  steering  wheel  with  the  caption:  "Miami  nights  ridin  thru  yo  city  in  that  hot  wheel."A  tweet  posted  Wednesday  evening  on  Sharieff's  verfied  Twitter  account  linked  to  a  video  of  him  playing  basketball  with  Bieber.Bieber  flew  to  Miami  on  Monday.Other  complaintsAnother  police  department  in  the  Miami  area  is  investigating  a  report  that  some  of  its  officers  escorted  Bieber's  caravan  between  Miami  strip  clubs  this  week  without  authorization.Opa-Locka  Assistant  City  Manager  David  Chiverton  told  CNN  affiliate  WSVN-TV  that  "at  some  point,  the  escort  took  them  at  least  to  two  locations  that  we  know  of.""The  police  administration  had  no  knowledge  of  this  escort,  and  it  is  not  the  norm  for  those  things  to  occur  without  the  chief  and  his  administration  authorizing  such  escorts,"  Chiverton  told  the  TV  station.Thursday's  incident  marks  the  first  time  the  teen  singer  has  been  arrested,  although  he  is  under  investigation  on  allegations  of  egging  his  California  neighbor's  home.Los  Angeles  County  sheriff's  deputies  used  a  felony  search  warrant  last  week  to  raid  Bieber's  mansion  in  the  felony  vandalism  investigation.  They  seized  Bieber's  iPhone  and  the  security  camera  system,  which  detectives  have  been  examining  for  clues  about  who  tossed  eggs  over  a  fence  that  splattered  onto  the  next-door  house,  causing  an  estimated  $20,000  in  damage.Bieber  is  having  some  issuesDeputies  have  also  investigated  reports  by  Bieber's  neighbors  that  he  raced  his  expensive  sports  car  down  the  streets  of  the  exclusive  Oaks  community  of  Calabasas,  California,  but  no  charges  ever  resulted.One  neighbor  accused  Bieber  of  spitting  in  his  face  during  a  heated  confrontation  last  March.  Deputies  have  responded  to  complaints  about  loud  parties  at  Bieber's  place.The  Los  Angeles  County  district  attorney's  office  concluded  it  couldn't  prove  the  spitting  or  speeding  cases  in  court,  so  it  declined  to  prosecute.Prosecutors  also  rejected  a  misdemeanor  battery  complaint  from  a  photographer  who  accused  Bieber  of  attacking  him  in  the  parking  lot  of  a  Calabasas  shopping  center  as  he  was  taking  photos  of  Bieber  and  his  then-girlfriend,  Selena  Gomez,  in  May  2012."We  didn't  do  this  search  warrant  to  send  a  message,"  Sheriff's  Lt.  David  Thompson  said  last  week.  "That's  not  what  we  do,  but  we  hope  maybe  that  understanding  the  gravity  of  this  will  change  some  of  the  behavior."Bieber's  phone  seized  in  egging  probeStars  who  threatened  to  retire  and  didn'tCNN  en  Español's  Adriana  Hauser  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Books  include  'Pride  and  Prejudice,'  'The  Great  Gatsby  and  'Life  After  Life.'</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Amazon  released  its  newly  curated  list  of  100  Books  to  Read  in  a  Lifetime  on  Tuesday.Books  on  the  list  include  Jane  Austen's  "Pride  and  Prejudice"  (1813),  F.  Scott  Fitzgerald's  "The  Great  Gatsby"  (1925)  and  Kate  Atkinson's  "Life  After  Life"  (2013).The  list  spans  200  years  of  literature,  along  with  a  wide  range  of  genres  and  intended  audiences;  authors  include  David  Sedaris,  Salman  Rushdie,  J.D.  Salinger,  Michael  Pollan  and  Shel  Silverstein.Sara  Nelson,  editorial  director  of  print  and  Kindle  books  at  Amazon.com,  said  the  list  was  created  through  taxing  months  of  deliberation  among  her  team,  though  no  mathematical  algorithms  were  used."One  of  our  tasks  was  to  have  books  that  don't  feel  like  homework:  'eat  your  vegetables'  books,"  Nelson  said.  "There  was  nothing  in  there  except  'I  loved  this  book  when  I  was  12  for  this  reason.'  We  lobbied  each  other."The  books  are  not  ranked  but  rather  are  listed  alphabetically  to  represent  that  "no  book  is  more  important  than  another,"  she  added.Some  books  that  unanimously  made  the  cut  are  children's  books  like  "Charlotte's  Web"  by  E.B.  White  and  "Unbroken,"  a  nonfiction  book  about  World  War  II  by  "Seabiscuit"  author  Laura  Hillenbrand.Fan  favorites  like  the  first  installments  of  the  "Harry  Potter,"  "Hunger  Games"  and  "Lord  of  the  Rings"  series  made  the  cut.  The  list  also  features  just  one  of  the  No.  1  Amazon  Best  Books  of  the  Year,  Rebecca  Skloot's  "The  Immortal  Life  of  Henrietta  Lacks.""We  tried  to  make  sure  that  we  had  a  pretty  good  balance  of  fiction  and  nonfiction,"  Nelson  said.  "In  terms  of  the  demographic  of  the  writers,  we  never  sat  down  and  said  'we  need  more  women'  or  'we  need  more  books  from  different  cultural  groups  or  countries.'  But  overall,  when  I  eyeball  that  list,  it  seems  to  have  a  lot  of  variation."The  book  most  hotly  debated  by  the  editorial  team  was  George  Orwell's  dystopian  novel  "1984.  ""It  wasn't  so  much  'Is  "1984"  a  great  book?'  but  'Should  we  put  "1984"  or  "Brave  New  World"?  Should  we  put  "Lord  of  the  Rings"  or  "The  Hobbit"?'  On  a  100  book  list,  you  probably  can't  put  both,"  Nelson  said.  "We  tried  to  find  books  that  were  iconic  and  that  would  lead  to  other  books."The  list  leaves  off  classics  like  "Les  Misérables"  and  "Moby  Dick,"  though  some  editors  argued  for  their  inclusion.You  can  vote  for  which  selections  you  like  and  suggest  new  ones  at  Goodreads.  Amazon  will  compile  a  list  of  reader  picks  in  the  coming  weeks.All  the  books  on  the  list  are  included  in  the  gallery  above  --  let  us  know  which  ones  you  agree  with  and  which  you  think  were  unfairly  omitted  in  the  comments  section  below.</TEXT></DOC>

"The  last  thing  families  and  passengers  should  have  to  worry  about  at  such  a  stressful  time  is  how  to  get  information  from  their  carrier."In  the  DOT  order,  Asiana  said  its  job  was  complicated  by  the  limited  number  of  workers  at  San  Francisco's  airport  and  other  circumstances.  Injured  passengers  were  sent  to  13  different  area  hospitals,  and  there  was  no  list  prepared  at  the  time  to  help  the  airline  track  passengers.Hospitals  also  were  reluctant  to  release  information  to  the  airline  due  to  privacy  laws,  the  airline  said.Under  the  Foreign  Air  Carrier  Family  Support  Act  of  1997,  foreign  air  carriers  assure  the  Department  of  Transportation  and  the  National  Transportation  Safety  Board  that  they  will  adhere  to  a  "family  assistance  plan"  in  the  event  of  aircraft  accidents  resulting  in  a  major  loss  of  life.Among  other  things,  airlines  must  publicize  and  staff  a  toll-free  telephone  number  to  take  calls  from  families,  notify  families  as  soon  as  practical  and  commit  sufficient  resources  to  carry  out  the  family  assistance  plan.According  to  the  DOT,  Asiana  failed  to  widely  publicize  any  telephone  number  for  family  members  of  those  on  board,  and  the  only  number  generally  available  to  the  public  that  family  members  could  call  was  Asiana's  toll-free  reservations  line.Asiana  publicized  a  phone  number  established  by  another  entity  18  hours  and  32  minutes  after  the  crash,  the  DOT  said.Locating  this  phone  number  on  Asiana's  website  required  significant  effort,  the  DOT  said,  and  the  reservations  line  did  not  include  a  separate  menu  option  for  calls  related  to  the  crash,  requiring  callers  to  navigate  through  cumbersome  automated  menus.Asiana  also  took  two  days  to  send  a  sufficient  number  of  trained  personnel  to  San  Francisco,  and  initially  lacked  an  adequate  number  of  staff  able  to  communicate  in  the  languages  spoken  by  the  flight's  passengers,  the  DOT  said.According  to  the  DOT,  $400,000  of  the  penalty  is  due  within  30  days.  Up  to  $100,000  will  be  spent  on  multiple  industry-wide  conferences  and  training  sessions  to  provide  others  with  lessons  learned  from  the  Asiana  crash  aftermath.</TEXT></DOC>

He  is  CEO  and  editor  of  the  FP  Group,  publishers  of  Foreign  Policy  magazine,  and  a  visiting  scholar  at  the  Carnegie  Endowment  for  International  Peace.  Follow  him  on  Twitter  at  @djrothkopf.(CNN)  --  You  could  have  gotten  very  good  odds  had  you  predicted  at  the  beginning  of  2013,  when  John  Kerry  took  office  as  secretary  of  state,  that  he  would  end  up  having  the  most  successful  year  of  anyone  in  the  Obama  administration  or,  indeed,  Washington.Kerry  was  an  old  familiar  face,  a  man  whose  moment  had  come  and  gone  with  his  presidential  candidacy  in  2004.  He  was  following  in  the  footsteps  of  the  most  popular  politician  in  America  in  an  administration  not  famous  for  giving  its  Cabinet  members  much  of  the  limelight  that  was  jealously  guarded  for  the  President.He  also  was  going  to  be  thrust  into  an  international  situation  in  which  the  problems  ranged  from  intractable  to  almost  incomprehensible  at  a  time  when  the  people  of  the  United  States  had  precious  little  interest  in  overseas  engagement.Yet  here  we  are  a  year  later  and  Kerry  is  widely  regarded  as  having  transcended  himself,  his  job,  the  limitations  placed  on  him  by  the  White  House,  and  the  challenges  of  the  world  scene.He  is  viewed  as  a  man  who  has  effectively  built  on  the  work  Hilary  Clinton  did  to  restore  diplomacy  to  the  center  of  U.S.  foreign  policy  and,  in  fact,  as  a  greater  risk  taker  than  she  was.He  has  shown  creativity,  tenacity,  the  courage  to  stand  up  to  leaders  overseas  and  his  would-be  minders  in  the  administration  and  has  won  widespread  kudos  for  it.One  very  senior  Middle  East  diplomat  on  Tuesday  described  him  to  me  as  a  "national  treasure"  for  the  United  States.  And  this  is  someone  who  has  many  issues  with  the  United  States'  handling  of  crises  in  Egypt,  Syria,  Iraq  and  Iran.Another  leader  from  the  same  region  described  the  Kerry  Israel-Palestine  peace  process  as  the  "most  remarkable  effort  I  have  seen  in  my  lifetime."  Within  the  State  Department,  while  he  is  not  given  top  grades  as  a  manager  of  that  big  bureaucracy,  he  is  seen  as  a  force  of  nature,  as  someone  who  is  willing  the  department  into  the  central  role  that  for  the  past  decade  was  primarily  occupied  by  the  Pentagon  in  shaping  U.S.  international  priorities.Some  of  the  change  in  the  role  of  diplomacy  is,  of  course,  a  result  of  shifting  away  from  a  war  footing  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan,  withdrawing  our  troops  and  thus  making  military  action  less  central  to  our  initiatives  in  the  Middle  East.  But  that  could  just  as  easily  have  created  a  void.Yet  Kerry  stepped  in  and  from  the  beginning  astonished  everyone  with  his  appetite  to  tackle  the  Israel-Palestine  issue,  his  nimbleness  in  turning  missteps  in  Syria  into  a  chemical  deal  that  would  have  been  hard  to  imagine  months  earlier  and  his  stewardship  of  the  administration's  Iran  nuclear  negotiations.Some  characterized  him  as  a  dreamer  early  on,  a  Don  Quixote.  But  with  the  progress  that  has  already  been  achieved  on  all  three  fronts,  it  is  impossible  not  to  see  him  as  making  a  significant  impact—largely  by  virtue  of  his  tireless  travel  schedule,  his  mastery  of  the  facts  and  his  force  of  personality.Of  course,  it  is  just  a  year  that  has  transpired.  While  expectations  for  the  Kerry  tenure  at  State  may  have  started  low,  he  has  raised  them  considerably.Now  all  eyes  are  on  these  three  deals  to  see  what  happens.  Will  there  be  an  Iran  deal?  If  so,  will  it  be  a  good  one  that  the  Congress  and  our  allies  can  accept  or  will  it  strengthen  Iran  without  gaining  real  peace  of  mind  for  the  United  States  and  our  allies  in  the  region?Will  the  Syria  chemical  deal,  which  the  United  States  has  complained  is  not  resulting  in  the  elimination  of  weapons  fast  enough,  ultimately  deliver  on  its  original  goals?  Or  will  it  continue  to  serve,  as  President  Obama's  own  top  intelligence  official  recently  asserted,  to  strengthen  the  regime  of  Bashar  al-Assad?Opinion:  Are  Syria,  Iran  playing  Obama  for  a  fool?And  what  benefit  will  a  chemical  weapons  deal  achieve  if  Syria  continues  to  fester  and  serve  as  both  a  killing  field  and  a  training  ground  for  an  unprecedented  number  of  extremists?Can  progress  be  made  between  Israel  and  the  Palestinians?  Even  with  the  sniping  that  Kerry  is  receiving  from  top  officials  in  the  Israeli  government?  Even  with  the  divisions  among  the  Palestinians?And  what  of  the  decay  in  Iraq?  The  possibility  that  the  same  will  occur  in  Afghanistan  when  the  United  States  leaves  or  that  in  leaving  there,  we  will  also  become  less  capable  of  fighting  terrorism  in  Pakistan?  What  of  the  shape-shifting  and  spread  of  al  Qaeda  and  similar  extremist  groups?  And  what  of  the  rest  of  the  world  that  feels  that  the  United  States  is  once  again  focused  almost  exclusively  on  the  Middle  East  even  as  large  emerging  markets  are  buffeted  by  crisis,  Africa  is  rocked  by  wars,  and  our  alliances  are  in  desperate  need  of  modernization?No,  while  Kerry  has  had  a  remarkable  year  and  has  been  an  invaluable  asset  for  the  United  States,  he  and  his  team  know  well  that  their  toughest  work  lies  ahead.  His  legacy  and  that  of  the  President  he  serves  will  be  determined  less  by  the  considerable  progress  of  the  past  year  and  much  more  by  whether  the  opportunities  he  has  helped  create  can  be  capitalized  upon  in  the  time  between  now  and  the  end  of  2016.Follow  @CNNOpinion  on  Twitter.Join  us  at  Facebook/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  David  Rothkopf.</TEXT></DOC>

Still,  even  if  this  new  transcript  offers  no  clues  about  the  plane's  mysterious  disappearance,  the  discrepancy  has  provided  fresh  fodder  for  critics  of  Malaysia's  handling  of  the  investigation.Read  the  cockpit  transcriptThat  authorities  gave  one  version  and  let  it  stand  uncorrected  for  weeks  undermines  confidence  in  the  investigation,  air  accident  investigation  experts  told  CNN."High  criticism  is  in  order  at  this  point,"  said  Mary  Schiavo,  a  CNN  aviation  analyst  and  former  inspector  general  for  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation.Malaysian  officials  have  defended  their  work.  Acting  Transport  Minister  Hishammuddin  Hussein  recently  said,  "History  will  judge  us  well."But  Michael  Goldfarb,  a  former  chief  of  staff  at  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration,  said  people  following  the  investigation  "haven't  had  a  straight,  clear  word  that  we  can  have  a  lot  of  fidelity  in.""We  have  the  tragedy  of  the  crash,  we  have  the  tragedy  of  an  investigation  gone  awry  and  then  we  have  questions  about  where  we  go  from  here,"  he  said.Inside  the  flight  simulatorSearch  'could  drag  on'And  where  we  go  from  here  is  a  very  big  question.After  refocusing  their  search  Friday  to  a  new  patch  of  Indian  Ocean  hundreds  of  miles  from  where  they  had  been  looking,  authorities  still  haven't  found  anything  definitively  linked  to  Flight  370.Ten  aircraft  and  nine  ships  crisscrossed  a  46,000-square-mile  (120,000-square-kilometer)  search  zone  on  Tuesday.  With  so  many  planes  in  the  skies  over  the  search  zone,  Australia  sent  an  airborne  air  traffic  control  plane  to  guard  against  accidents.As  of  early  Wednesday  morning,  Australian  search  coordinators  had  not  announced  any  significant  results.Even  as  they're  vowing  to  continue  searching  off  Australia's  west  coast,  officials  aren't  making  guarantees  of  any  imminent  breakthrough."It's  not  something  that's  necessarily  going  to  be  resolved  in  the  next  two  weeks,  for  example,"  retired  Air  Chief  Marshal  Angus  Houston,  the  head  of  the  Australia's  new  Joint  Agency  Coordination  Centre,  told  reporters  Tuesday.The  plane  disappeared  over  the  waters  between  Malaysia  and  Vietnam,  after  signing  off  with  Malaysian  controllers,  but  before  checking  in  with  their  counterparts  in  Vietnam.Authorities  don't  know  what  happened  on  board  after  that,  but  radar  and  satellite  data  show  the  plane  turned  off  course  and  flew  back  across  Malaysia  before  turning  south  over  the  Indian  Ocean.Based  on  sophisticated  analysis  of  satellite  data,  investigators  believe  it  went  down  in  the  southern  Indian  Ocean,  but  they  can't  pinpoint  a  precise  location.A  Malaysian  government  source  told  CNN  on  Monday  that  the  airliner's  turn  off  course  is  being  considered  a  "criminal  act,"  either  by  one  of  the  pilots  or  someone  else.In  a  background  briefing  given  to  CNN,  Malaysian  investigators  said  they  believed  the  plane  was  "flown  by  someone  with  good  flying  knowledge  of  the  aircraft."A  senior  Malaysian  government  official  last  week  told  CNN  law  enforcement  analyst  Tom  Fuentes  that  authorities  have  found  nothing  in  days  of  investigating  the  two  pilots  that  leads  them  to  any  motive,  be  it  political,  suicidal  or  extremist.More  help  on  the  wayChinese  relatives  of  passengers  will  have  a  chance  Wednesday  to  learn  how  the  search  is  unfolding  and  how  it's  been  concluded  the  flight  ended  in  the  Indian  Ocean.Malaysia  Airlines  and  Malaysia's  Department  of  Civil  Aviation  will  lead  a  closed-door  briefing  with  the  Chinese  relatives  in  Kuala  Lumpur,  the  Malaysian  government  said.  Technical  experts  from  Malaysia,  China  and  Australia  will  also  participate,  as  will  the  Chinese  ambassador  to  Malaysia.Meanwhile,  even  more  assets  are  contributing  to  the  search.Hishammuddin  tweeted  the  HMS  Tireless,  a  British  nuclear  submarine,  will  take  part.  It'll  be  joined  by  an  Australian  ship  with  a  pinger  locator  designed  to  listen  for  locator  beacons  attached  to  the  plane's  flight  data  recorder  plus  a  submersible  capable  of  canvassing  the  ocean  floor  for  wreckage.  Both  pieces  of  technology  come  from  the  U.S.  Navy.The  equipment  won't  be  of  any  use,  however,  until  searchers  are  able  to  find  wreckage  from  the  plane  to  help  narrow  the  search  zone.That's  because  neither  the  pinger  locator  nor  the  submersible  can  quickly  scan  the  enormous  area  being  searched.Under  the  best  of  sea  conditions,  the  pingers  can  be  heard  2  nautical  miles  away.  But  high  seas,  background  noise,  wreckage  or  silt  can  all  make  pingers  harder  to  detect.It  will  take  the  ship,  the  Ocean  Shield,  two  more  days  just  to  get  to  the  search  zone,  leaving  precious  little  time  to  locate  the  flight  data  recorders  before  the  batteries  on  its  locator  beacon  run  out.Time  is  running  out:  The  batteries  on  the  flight  data  recorder's  locator  beacon  are  designed  to  last  30  days.  Wednesday  is  the  26th  day  that  authorities  have  been  looking  for  the  plane.There's  no  guarantee  it  will  be  found  anytime  soon.  For  all  the  expertise  and  technology,  there's  still  more  unknown  about  Flight  370  than  is  known  about  it  --  including  its  altitude,  precise  speed  and,  especially,  its  final  resting  place.As  CNN  aviation  analyst  Miles  O'Brien  said:  "We're  seeing  what  amounts  to  a  big  guess."Families  of  newlyweds  still  waitingOcean  Shield:  A  mission  of  hope  in  search  for  Flight  370Mystery  of  Malaysia  Airlines  Flight  370  surfaces  pain  of  1977  tragedyMichael  Pearson  reported  and  wrote  from  Atlanta;  Jim  Clancy  reported  from  Kuala  Lumpur;  CNN's  Catherine  E.

Five  things  that  struck  us  about  the  broadcast  include  "12  Years'  "  best  picture  win,  Ellen's  selfie.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  The  86th  Academy  Awards  are  in  the  record  books.  Here  are  five  things  that  struck  us  about  Sunday's  broadcast:1.  History  for  "12  Years  a  Slave."The  subject  matter  --  the  chronicle  of  a  slave  in  19th-century  America  --  was  challenging,  to  say  the  least,  more  the  stuff  of  educational  documentaries  than  major  motion  pictures.  Moreover,  "12  Years  a  Slave"  did  not  turn  away  from  the  brutality  noted  in  Solomon  Northup's  memoir.  It  lacked  a  major  star  (except  perhaps  Brad  Pitt  in  a  small  role),  was  made  by  a  black  British  director  and  starred  a  black  British  actor.  But  the  searing  film  was  rewarded  with  three  Oscars  Sunday  night  --  including  the  big  prize,  best  picture."This  is  for  all  the  people  who  have  endured  slavery,  and  the  21  million  people  who  still  endure  slavery  today,"  director  Steve  McQueen  said  in  his  acceptance  speech.2.  The  most  tweeted  photo  ever.Barack  Obama,  move  aside  --  you're  now  second  to  Ellen  DeGeneres.  During  Sunday's  show,  the  comedian  and  Oscar  host  went  into  the  audience  to  shoot  a  selfie  featuring  some  of  her  famous  friends.  The  resulting  picture  included  DeGeneres,  Jennifer  Lawrence,  Channing  Tatum,  Julia  Roberts,  Kevin  Spacey,  Brad  Pitt,  Angelina  Jolie,  Lupita  Nyong'o  and  her  brother  Junior,  Meryl  Streep,  Bradley  Cooper  and  Jared  Leto's  eye.  (Cooper  took  the  picture.)  The  2012  photo  of  Barack  and  Michelle  Obama  was  retweeted  more  than  778,000  times.  The  Oscar  picture  had  exceeded  2  million  before  1  a.m.  ET  Monday  --  and  put  a  strain  on  the  social  media  service  for  a  short  time.  The  motion  picture  academy  apologized  for  the  traffic  jam  --  though  its  apology  was  retweeted  "only"  about  4,000  times.3.  Lupita  Nyong'o's  "golden  statue."There  were  few  memorable  speeches  at  Sunday's  awards,  but  newcomer  Nyong'o  --  who  won  best  supporting  actress  for  "12  Years  a  Slave"  --  gave  a  standout.Paying  tribute  to  Patsey,  the  enslaved  woman  she  portrayed  in  the  film,  the  30-year-old  actress  at  times  struggled  to  keep  her  composure.  "It  doesn't  escape  me  for  one  moment  that  so  much  joy  in  my  life  is  because  of  so  much  pain  in  someone  else's,"  she  said.  "When  I  look  down  at  this  golden  statue,  may  it  remind  me  and  every  little  child:  No  matter  where  you  come  from,  your  dreams  are  valid."4.  A  big  night  for  "Gravity.""Gravity,"  Alfonso  Cuaron's  film  about  a  space  mission  gone  wrong,  didn't  win  best  picture,  but  it  did  the  best  by  far  of  any  nominated  film,  winning  seven  Oscars  altogether.  Though  most  were  in  technical  categories,  the  film  won  a  particularly  sweet  prize:  best  director  for  Cuaron,  who  spent  four  years  putting  his  heart  and  soul  into  the  technically  demanding  film,  dazzling  even  the  special-effects  community.Cuaron  is  the  first  Latin  American  to  win  best  director.  One  wonders  what  he'll  do  next.  Always  restless,  his  films  have  included  a  story  set  on  a  dying  Earth  ("Children  of  Men"),  a  Harry  Potter  film  ("Harry  Potter  and  the  Prisoner  of  Azkaban"),  a  moving  drama  set  in  modern  Mexico  ("Y  Tu  Mama  Tambien")  and  an  adaptation  of  a  children's  classic  ("A  Little  Princess").Incidentally,  there  were  two  films  with  10  nominations.  "Gravity"  was  one.  The  other?  "American  Hustle,"  which  went  0-for-10.5.  A  tame  and  unsurprising  show.For  the  most  part,  the  Oscar  prognosticators  were  right:  With  the  possible  exception  of  Nyong'o,  who  beat  Jennifer  Lawrence  for  best  supporting  actress,  all  the  winners  were  expected.Perhaps  more  surprising  was  the  overall  flatness  of  the  show,  which  felt  as  sluggish  as  its  3½-hour  running  time.  There  were  no  spectacular  song-and-dance  numbers  and  few  startling  moments  beyond  Nyong'o's  speech  and  Darlene  Love's  impromptu  performance  of  the  gospel  song  "His  Eye  Is  on  the  Sparrow."  Even  DeGeneres  wasn't  always  sharp.  Her  jokes  were  uneven,  and  some  of  her  stunts  --  notably  an  attempt  to  buy  pizza  for  the  audience  --  didn't  quite  pay  off.However,  give  the  host  credit:  She's  got  that  record-setting  selfie.  As  best  actress  winner  Cate  Blanchett  might  say  to  all  the  complainers,  "Suck  it."The  list  of  winners</TEXT></DOC>

It's  not?  --  two  fellow  Oscars-obsessed  friends  and  I  made  an  annual  game  of  trying  to  predict  who'd  get  nominated.  I  never  won  (I  tied  once),  but  I  never  lost  my  enthusiasm  for  it;  that  is  until  every  magazine  and  website  came  along  with  their  own  predictions  and  took  the  fun  out  of  it.This  year  for  old  times'  sake  we  revived  our  game,  only  doing  the  best  actor  category  because  it's  been  an  impossibly  full  year  of  great  male  lead  performances  that  have  stumped  the  prognosticators.My  14-year-old  nephew  Miles  was  in  on  it  because  he's  been  a  rabid  Oscar  fiend  since  he  was  at  least,  oh,  12.  Call  out  a  category  --  best  actress  say  --  and  a  year  --  1966  --  and  he'll  holler  back  "Julie.  Christie,  not  Andrews."  Am  I  proud,  or  concerned?  Today  the  results  came  in  and  we  all  tied  with  four  corrects  each,  but  with  different  names  on  our  lists.Jude  must  have  known  Christian  Bale  had  the  gale  winds  of  "American  Hustle"  at  his  back.  David,  a  great  strategist,  and  Miles  the  Scorsese  devotee,  both  recognized  Leo  DiCaprio's  high  standing  with  the  Academy,  even  if  Miles  won't  be  seeing  that  film  anytime  soon,  I  pray.  We  all  had  faith  in  Bruce,  Matthew  and  Chiwetel  (funny  how  we  know  them  all  by  first  name.)  I  held  out  for  Robert  Redford  because,  well,  he's  Redford,  and  because  I'm  un-young.  That  should  teach  me  to  stop  leading  with  my  heart.  But  did  anyone  ever  imagine  that  betting  against  Mr.  Oscars  himself,  Tom  Hanks,  could  pay  off?  If  I  had  I  would  have  won  for  once.Of  course,  Oscar  mania  is  not  just  about  the  horse  race.  It's  also  the  spectacle,  the  show  around  the  show.  The  history.  I'm  a  diehard.  I  haven't  missed  an  Oscars  since  I  got  hooked  as  a  teen.  My  favorite  year  was  1978,  the  night  Jane  Fonda  and  Jon  Voight  took  the  best  leads  categories  for  "Coming  Home."  Justice!  Glory!As  a  professional  plower  of  the  fields  of  celebrity,  with  a  license  to  fawn  and  gush  (want  to  see  my  card?)  I've  attended  the  Oscars,  been  inside  the  crimson  cocoon,  felt  the  collective  shock  when  "Shakespeare  In  Love"  beat  "Saving  Private  Ryan"  for  Best  Picture.  I've  stepped  on  a  few  gowns.  Not  even  the  cruel  realization  that  there  are  essentially  two  red  carpets  --  velvet  stanchions  separate  the  stars  on  one  side  from  the  rest  of  us  attendees  --  could  squelch  my  blind  and  blinded-by-the-flashbulbs  enthusiasm.But  like  most  true  believers  I  have  my  moments  of  doubt.  If  you  are  not  in  our  little  club,  I  get  where  you're  coming  from.To  the  Osc-nostics  it  is  all  too  much,  too  little,  and  certainly,  should  you  try  to  slog  through  the  entire  three-and-a-half  hour  ceremony  on  March  2,  too  late.  It  is  kind  of  preposterous:  over-hyped,  over-scored,  overwrought.In  poor  Oscar's  defense,  for  the  past  decade  or  so  Hollywood's  big  night  has  had  to  suffer  indignities  that  the  Academy  of  Old  couldn't  have  imagined:  dwindling  viewership,  the  cultural-relevance  supremacy  of  TV  over  movies,  an  attention  deficit  that  just  can't  sit  still  for  the  live-action  shorts  category,  acting  and  directing  victories  basically  pre-called  by  critics  and  Tweeters  and  bookies,  James  Franco.There's  desperation  in  the  air.  Oscar's  been  trying  too  hard.  This  year's  host  Ellen  Degeneres  will  take  care  of  some  of  that,  I'm  sure.  You  never  see  her  sweat.  Plus,  there's  red  carpet  fatigue,  as  the  Oscars  limp  on  high  heels  to  the  finish  line  of  a  bloated  awards  season  as  overextended  as  Christmas  and  the  NFL.  Critics'  awards,  the  People's  Choice  Awards,  the  Golden  Globes,  the  SAG  Awards  —  you  can  only  cut  to  a  reaction  shot  of  Jennifer  Lawrence  so  many  times  before  it  constitutes  stalking.  But  is  it  Oscar's  fault  that  everyone  else  wants  in  on  the  action?I  recognize  the  madness  --  struggle  with  it  --  but  it's  hopeless.  I  just  can't  shake  my  addiction.  Will  I  sound  like  I'm  on  the  Academy's  payroll  if  I  argue  that  the  Oscars  really  are  a  great  national  tradition?  Movies,  of  course,  which  might  actually  be  getting  better.  And  stars,  our  collective  guilty  delight.  And  glamor,  maybe  even  a  modicum  of  sophistication.And  there  are  less-lofty  traditions  to  savor:  Carping  about  his  speech,  dissing  her  dress.  Trying  to  catch  a  loser  register  a  little  disappointment.  Enduring  campy  production  numbers  with  aerialists.  Dutifully  filling  out  the  ballots  at  your  friend's  Oscars  party  even  if  the  only  movie  you  saw  that  year  starred  Adam  Sandler.  It's  all  part  of  the  ritual.  The  knowing  that  it's  all  too  much,  but  the  kind  of  too  much  that  some  of  us  just  can't  get  enough  of.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Tim  Allis.</TEXT></DOC>

Marco  Rubio  of  Florida  and  Ted  Cruz  of  Texas.There  is  an  Indian  American:  Gov.  Bobby  Jindal  of  Louisiana.And  joining  Jindal,  Rubio  and  Cruz  from  the  Generation  X  ranks  are  Gov.  Scott  Walker  and  Rep.  Paul  Ryan,  both  of  Wisconsin.Boomers  potentially  in  the  mix  include  Pennsylvania  Sen.  Rick  Santorum,  Sen.  Rand  Paul  of  Texas  and  Gov.  Chris  Christie  of  New  Jersey.Three  out  of  the  past  four  Republican  nominees  were  all  well  into  their  60s,  while  the  Democrats  over  the  same  period  went  with  younger  candidates.Now  look:Democrats  are  taking  a  page  from  Ronald  Reagan,  the  oldest  president  ever  on  Inauguration  Day  at  69.Hillary  Clinton  would  be  that  age  on  Election  Day  2016,  if  she  runs  and  wins,  while  Vice  President  Joe  Biden  might  be  considered  historically  "young"  for  a  senator  at  73  at  the  same  point,  but  breaking  new  ground  for  the  Oval  Office.Both  are  quite  pale,  too,  and  so  is  most  of  "the  bench"  of  the  party  that  embraced  history  in  2008  and  nominated  the  first  African  American  for  President  in  Barack  Obama,  who  was  at  the  time  merely  in  his  40s.GOP  race  for  2016  is  wide  open"Democrats  are  known  as  having  great  policies  (for  minorities)  on  paper,  but  it's  harder  to  rise  through  the  ranks,"  said  Andra  Gillespie,  an  associate  professor  of  political  science  at  Emory  University.  "The  Republicans  don't  have  great  policies  on  paper,  but  they  are  often  more  supportive  of  their  minority  candidates."Obama's  election  meant  that  many  of  the  Democratic  old  guard,  folks  like  Clinton  and  Biden,  had  to  bide  their  time  and  wait  until  the  next  cycle.  But  his  time  around  people  like  Massachusetts  Gov.  Deval  Patrick  are  barely  a  consideration,  she  said."If  you  want  to  present  something  different,  young,  charismatic  black  guy  isn't  it,"  Gillespie  said.The  Republican  Party  was  blasted  during  the  2012  presidential  election  as  the  party  of  old,  white,  men  for  their  presidential  and  congressional  candidate  lineups.The  GOP  lost  among  young  people,  minorities  and  women  in  large  numbers  and  was  forced  to  do  some  serious  soul  searching  in  preparation  for  the  2014  midterms  and  2016  presidential  elections.GOP  problem:  'Their  voters  are  white,  aging  and  dying  off'But  even  as  the  Republican  Party  was  taking  a  beating  over  its  lack  of  diversity  and  tin  ear  on  issues  important  to  minorities,  a  class  of  young  guns  who  more  closely  resembled  the  broader  American  electorate  made  headlines  for  their  edgier  brand  of  conservatism."These  candidates  have  been  very  shrewd  and  extremely  media  savvy  and  have  been  able  to  garner  a  lot  of  attention  very  quickly,"  Gillespie  said.  "It's  partly  their  own  skill  and  being  in  the  right  place  at  the  right  time.  But  it's  also  the  Republican  Party  not  wanting  to  look  like  the  party  of  old  white  men."As  a  tea  party  darling,  Rubio  has  earned  nods  from  conservative  corners  for  his  criticism  of  Obamacare,  but  is  also  seen  as  a  more  moderate  voice  in  the  debate  over  immigration  reform.Cruz  and  Paul  rode  that  same  anti-establishment,  tea  party  wave  into  Congress  and  have  since  garnered  attention  for  their  fiery  rhetoric  about  the  ills  of  big  government  and  willingness  to  challenge  the  status  quo.Christie  rose  to  prominence  because  of  his  swaggering  conservative  style  tempered  by  his  willingness  to  reach  across  the  aisle  in  his  state.  He  made  a  splash,  too,  by  giving  Obama  and  his  administration  credit  on  Superstorm  Sandy  recovery  efforts.Meanwhile,  Santorum,  Ryan,  Jindal  and  Walker's  clear  and  direct  conservative  approach  to  fiscal  and  governance  matters  is  seen  in  right  wing  circles  as  a  refreshing  change  from  what  some  in  the  Republican  Party  have  felt  is  a  watered  down  version."The  fact  that  the  Democrats  don't  have  the  depth  of  diverse  talent  like  the  Republicans  do  might  be  an  indication  that,  despite  what  they  might  have  you  believe,  their  party  is  old  and  stale,"  said  Orlando  Watson,  the  Republican  National  Committee  communications  director  for  black  media.RNC  highlights  strategy  for  building  'new  generation  of  black  Republicans'The  slate  of  potential  2016  GOP  presidential  hopefuls—and  to  be  clear,  no  one  on  either  side  of  the  aisle  has  officially  announced  a  bid—may  be  younger  and  more  diverse.But  the  broader  party  is  still  too  old,  too  white  and  too  out  of  touch  with  the  rest  of  America,  said  Lionel  Sosa,  a  veteran  Latino  GOP  strategist  who  has  helped  advise  candidates  since  1980."I  think  our  party  is  stone  deaf  on  the  issue  of  Latinos  and  immigration.  We're  turning  off  not  only  Latinos,  but  also  women,  young  people  and  Asians  with  stupid,  intensive  comments,"  Sosa  said.He  pointed  to  anti-immigration  comments  by  recent  Republican  candidates  and  former  Arkansas  Gov.  Mike  Huckabee's  comments  about  Democrats  thinking  women  "can't  control  their  libidos"  as  "equally  stupid.""GOP  candidates  who  cater  to  the  extreme  right  in  the  primaries,  don't  realize  the  long  term  damage  they're  doing  to  the  Republican  brand  in  terms  of  alienating  the  segment  of  voters  who  are  growing  the  fastest,"  Sosa  said.  "This  damage  will  be  hard  to  overcome  in  the  general  election."</TEXT></DOC>

(They  already  welcomed  their  first  child  together,  North,  last  June.)So  should  we  be  surprised  that  the  rapper,  who's  previously  campaigned  for  his  bride-to-be  to  appear  on  the  cover  of  Vogue  magazine,  can  place  a  checkmark  next  to  that  goal?It's  true.  Kardashian  and  West  are  appearing  on  the  April  issue  of  Vogue  magazine.  And  this,  soon  after  West  proclaimed  on  Ryan  Seacrest's  radio  show  that  it  was  preposterous  it  had  not  yet  happened."There's  no  way  Kim  Kardashian  shouldn't  be  on  the  cover  of  Vogue,"  West  told  Seacrest  back  in  October.  "She's  like  the  most  intriguing  woman  right  now.  ...  and  collectively,  we're  the  most  influential  in  clothing.""No  one  is  looking  at  what  Obama  is  wearing.  Michelle  Obama  can't  Instagram  a  (bathing  suit)  pic  like  what  my  girl  Instagrammed  the  other  day."The  cover  is  vaguely  reminiscent  of  Kardashian's  other  high-profile  appearance  on  the  front  of  People  magazine  in  2011,  when  she  posed  with  her  then-fiancé,  basketball  player  Kris  Humphries.  Except  this  time,  she's  traded  in  the  contemporary  clothing  for  sumptuous  luxury  wares.Calling  Kardashian  and  West  #theworldsmosttalkedaboutcouple,  Vogue  is  promising  a  firsthand  look  inside  the  pair's  "fashionable  life  and  surreal  times,"  including  a  glimpse  of  how  they  interact  as  parents.  The  pair's  daughter,  North,  appears  with  them  in  a  behind-the-scenes  video  of  the  Vogue  photo  shoot.The  unveiling  of  the  issue,  which  arrives  on  newsstands  March  31  and  digitally  March  24,  was  met  with  a  mix  of  reactions,  from  stunned  to  supportive  to  upset."Somewhere,  Victoria  Beckham  is  flipping  a  table,"  joked  one  observer.  "Vogue  negotiates  with  terrorists,"  quipped  another.Vogue  isn't  a  stranger  to  controversy  --  earlier  this  year  it  was  criticized  by  some  for  its  treatment  of  "Girls"  star  Lena  Dunham  --  but  the  vitriol  directed  toward  Vogue  editor  Anna  Wintour  regarding  the  April  issue  has  been  visceral."If  someone  could  start  a  petition  to  have  Anna  Wintour  fired  over  this,  society  would  appreciate  it,"  said  @RunBritRun.  "Anna  Wintour  RETIRE  NOW.  You're  mentally  unstable,"  chimed  in  @Jenovia."I  just  wonder  what  went  through  Anna  Wintour's  mind.  Has  she  gone  mad?"  asked  another  onlooker.Given  the  timing  of  the  issue,  a  handful  wondered  if  Vogue  was  pulling  some  sort  of  elaborate  (not  to  mention  expensive)  April  Fool's  Day  prank.Fans  of  the  couple  were  just  as  breathless  as  Kardashian  tweeted  she  was  when  they  spotted  the  pair's  glossy  cover  shot."If  you're  actually  mad  at  Kim  and  Kanye's  Vogue  cover,"  tweeted  @Kia_Mak,  "go  outside,  start  walking  and  don't  stop  until  you  reach  the  horizon."Added  @PatrickSandberg,  "Kim  and  Kanye  refuse  to  accept  the  limitations  people  try  to  put  on  them  and  it's  inspiring.  They  win."Mostly,  though,  it  looks  some  are  just  confused  by  the  #worldsmosttalkedaboutcouple  hashtag  Vogue  is  trying  to  promote."Wait,"  said  @NikiBlasina.  "That  doesn't  look  like  Jay-Z  and  Beyonce."</TEXT></DOC>

But  she  realized  that  all  she  had  to  lose  was  140  pounds.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Do  you  have  a  weight-loss  success  story  to  share?  Tell  us  how  you  did  it  and  you  could  be  featured  in  our  weekly  weight-loss  story  on  CNN.com.(CNN)  --  Sara  Lugger  was  skeptical  as  she  placed  her  first  $5  bet.  But  she  realized  that  all  she  had  to  lose  was  weight  --  and  a  few  bucks  if  the  money  didn't  motivate  her  to  get  in  shape.A  friend's  success  had  inspired  Lugger  to  join  DietBet,  a  website  that  hosts  private  and  public  games  where  people  can  bet  on  their  own  weight  loss.  Each  game  sets  a  goal,  such  as  losing  4%  of  your  body  weight,  and  users  who  reach  that  goal  split  the  pot.Lugger  was  34  and  weighed  342  pounds.She  had  struggled  with  obesity  most  of  her  life.  In  the  ninth  grade,  she  was  diagnosed  with  ulcerative  colitis,  and  doctors  put  her  on  prednisone.  The  steroid  made  it  difficult  for  her  to  maintain  a  normal  weight.But  in  2004,  Lugger  had  surgery  to  fix  the  colitis.  "From  there  on  out,  I  couldn't  blame  anything  but  my  poor  habits."Shortly  after  her  birthday  in  February  2013,  Lugger  decided  that  reaching  350  pounds  would  be  "unacceptable."  The  Oxford,  Michigan,  resident  realized  that  her  weight  was  holding  her  back  from  doing  the  things  she  wanted  to  do.She  had  been  the  heaviest  person  in  her  college  classes,  where  she  studied  to  become  a  physical  therapist.  And  although  family  and  friends  never  said  anything  outright,  she  noticed  they  didn't  exactly  try  to  set  her  up  on  dates.She  avoided  social  situations  and  outdoor  activities  that  might  call  attention  to  her  size,  and  she  worried  about  traveling  because  fitting  in  an  airplane  seat  was  difficult."For  weeks  before  I  flew,  that  would  be  on  my  mind,"  she  said.After  signing  up  for  DietBet,  Lugger  made  a  plan.  She  threw  out  all  the  junk  food  in  her  house.  She  decided  she  would  wake  up  30  minutes  early  every  morning  to  work  out  on  her  elliptical  machine.  Then,  at  lunch,  she  would  use  the  physical  therapy  equipment  at  her  office  to  strength  train.  That  way,  if  she  wanted  to  go  out  with  friends  in  the  evening,  she  wouldn't  miss  a  workout.upwave:  Don't  miss  a  workout  with  the  one-minute  workout  challenge"I  have  never  seen  her  so  driven  and  persistent  on  a  goal,"  her  friend  Travis  Summerville  said.  "I  don't  know  where  that  came  from,  but  she  chose  a  simple  exercise  regimen  and  diet  style  that  worked  well  for  her,  and  she  just  kept  at  it  consistently."Lugger  traded  her  morning  bowl  of  cereal  for  a  protein  shake.  She  stopped  frequenting  fast-food  places  and  instead  used  Pinterest  to  find  lighter  fare  to  cook  at  home.  She  now  keeps  to  a  1,200-calorie-a-day  diet."I'm  kind  of  an  all-or-nothing  person,"  she  said.  "I  can't  (just)  lean  into  things,  or  it  doesn't  happen."Losing  weight  did  happen.  Lugger  loved  the  support  she  found  from  her  group  on  DietBet  and  signed  up  for  two  more  games  after  the  first  one  ended.  Over  time,  she  upped  her  bets  to  $10  and  then  $50  as  she  gained  confidence  --  and  lost  140  pounds.Lugger's  friend  Christie  Williams  has  also  lost  60  pounds  using  the  site.  Looking  back,  Williams  is  amazed  at  how  heavy  she  and  Lugger  once  were.  But  what  she's  always  loved  about  her  friend  is  still  there,  Williams  says."I  don't  believe  Sara  has  changed  as  a  person.  She  still  laughs  loud,  dances  crazy  and  screams  at  the  wrong  parts  in  horror  movies.  What  has  changed  is  the  activities  we  do.  It's  not  always  takeout  pizza  and  two  movies.  We'll  go  walk  a  couple  of  miles  or  play  "Just  Dance"  before  we  go  out  to  eat."The  friends  are  training  for  an  upcoming  5K  and  helping  each  other  maintain  their  slimmer  figures."We  are  holding  each  other  accountable,"  Williams  said.  "My  biggest  fear  was  (Lugger)  having  a  heart  attack  at  age  45.  That  fear  is  gone,  and  I  don't  want  it  back.  ...  It's  never  going  to  be  easy,  but  it  will  be  easier  than  losing  her  at  a  young  age."Overall,  Lugger  has  won  more  than  $330  on  DietBet.  She's  also  won  a  new  outlook  on  life.Lugger  used  to  tell  her  friends  --  and  herself  --  that  she  didn't  like  basketball  because  she  knew  she  wouldn't  fit  into  the  arena  seats.  Now  she's  a  Detroit  Pistons  fan."Turns  out,  I  really  like  basketball,"  she  said  with  a  laugh.Lugger  is  also  traveling  more.  And  shopping.  She  loves  dressing  in  clothes  she  feels  express  her  style  instead  of  trying  to  hide  in  the  background."I'm  finding  me  more,  and  that's  a  really  neat  thing."</TEXT></DOC>

Diane  Blair  was  one  of  them.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Fayetteville,  Arkansas  (CNN)  --  Only  a  few  people  would  feel  at  ease  to  send  Hillary  Clinton  cartoon  clippings.  Diane  Blair  was  one  of  them.Throughout  much  of  Bill  Clinton's  eight  years  in  the  White  House,  Blair  --  a  political  science  professor  and  longtime  Clinton  friend  --  exchanged  political  and  humor  cartoons  with  the  first  lady.  Nothing,  it  seemed,  was  too  small  or  inconsequential  to  send  back  and  forth.In  May  1996,  Hillary  Clinton  clipped  a  "Mixed  Media"  cartoon  and  sent  it  to  Blair  and  her  husband,  Jim,  with  a  note  that  read,  "It  is  rare  that  I  can  send  you  a  comic  strip  you  and  Jim  haven't  seen  --  but  this  one  is  too  good  not  to  share."It  showed  a  cow  lying  on  a  psychologist's  chair  with  a  thought  bubble  reading,  "I'm  not  a  mad  cow.  ...  I  just  have  issues  ..."  --  a  reference  to  the  mad  cow  scare  at  the  time  and  the  criticism  of  Hillary  Clinton's  role  in  her  husband's  failed  health  care  reform  effort  in  his  first  term.Romney:  Hillary  Clinton  won't  be  judged  by  her  husband's  legacyIn  the  reliably  loyal  and  closely  protective  Clinton  inner  circle,  Blair  was  a  power  center  for  most  of  the  former  first  lady's  life.  She  counseled  Clinton  --  her  friend  since  1972  --  during  the  failed  push  for  health  care  reform  and  was  there  for  her  through  her  husband's  affair  with  White  House  intern  Monica  Lewinsky.She  had  the  first  lady's  ear  on  everything  from  Supreme  Court  nominees  to  relations  with  Capitol  Hill.  During  all  of  these  exchanges,  Blair  took  copious  notes  and  kept  a  sporadic  diary  of  her  interactions  with  the  Clinton  White  House.  Those  documents,  which  were  donated  to  the  University  of  Arkansas  after  Blair's  death  in  2000,  give  an  unguarded  and  detailed  view  into  Clinton's  life.(CNN  reached  out  to  Clinton's  office  for  comment  about  the  documents,  but  a  spokesman  did  not  respond.)Inside  Politics:  Eleanor  Roosevelt's  advice  for  Hillary  ClintonThe  comfort  of  old  friendsThe  documents  also  show  Blair's  relationship  with  Clinton  was  one  of  trust,  love  and  the  comfort  of  old  friends.Blair  was  born  in  Washington  in  1938  and  raised  in  the  District  until  she  went  to  Cornell  University  for  a  political  science  degree.  She  came  back  to  Washington  after  graduation  and  worked  as  a  legislative  secretary  and  speechwriter  for  Sen.  Stuart  Symington  of  Missouri.Aside  from  a  love  of  politics,  both  Clinton  and  Blair  were  Arkansas  transplants,  moving  to  the  state  because  of  the  men  they  married.Clinton  on  critics:  'Don't  get  dragged  down'In  1963,  Blair  married  Hugh  Kincaid,  a  member  of  the  Arkansas  Legislature,  and  the  couple  settled  in  Fayetteville,  where  Blair  taught  political  science  at  the  University  of  Arkansas.Skip  Rutherford,  a  close  friend  of  both  women,  called  Blair  a  "very  welcoming  person."  Rutherford,  who  is  mentioned  throughout  Blair's  documents,  is  now  dean  of  the  University  of  Arkansas  Clinton  School  of  Public  Service  in  Little  Rock."When  you  were  around  her,  you  knew  the  conversation  was  going  to  be  exhilarating,"  he  said.In  "Living  History,"  Clinton's  2003  memoir,  the  former  first  lady  described  Blair  as  the  "closest  friend"  she  had  during  those  early  years  in  northwest  Arkansas."We  played  tennis  and  traded  favorite  books,"  Clinton  wrote.  "Diane  regularly  met  for  lunch  in  the  Student  Union"  to  "share  stories  and  gossip."The  fact  that  Blair  and  Clinton  had  arrived  in  Fayetteville  by  fate  led  her  to  call  it  "Fate-ville"  in  notes  to  Clinton.The  Clintons  and  Blairs  shared  many  of  their  most  important  moments  together.  After  Diane  and  her  first  husband  divorced,  she  married  James  Blair,  a  lawyer  at  Tysons  Food,  in  1979.  Then-Gov.  Bill  Clinton  performed  their  marriage  and  Hillary  was  the  "best  person,"  as  Clinton  described  in  her  book.Jim  and  Diane  Blair  stayed  at  the  White  House  on  the  Clintons'  first  night  there  in  1993.  And  when  the  Democratic  Party  renominated  Clinton  in  1996,  Blair  was  in  the  skybox  with  Hillary  Clinton's  family  and  closest  friends.An  unguarded  look  into  the  ClintonsBlair's  documents  give  an  unguarded  look  into  the  lives  of  Hillary  and  Bill  Clinton,  from  Bill  Clinton's  days  as  Arkansas  governor  and  rising  Democratic  star  to  the  couple's  time  in  the  White  House,  warts  and  all.Blair  wrote  in  her  diary  that  Hillary  Clinton  called  Monica  Lewinsky,  the  White  House  intern  who  nearly  brought  down  her  husband's  presidency,  a  "narcissistic  loony  toon."  Hillary  Clinton  defended  her  husband's  adultery  by  saying  it  was  caused,  partly,  because  "the  ugly  forces  started  making  up  hateful  things  about  them,  pounding  on  them."Blair  also  noted  a  1994  conversation  in  which  the  first  lady  asked  her  for  advice  on  "how  best  to  preserve  her  general  memories  of  the  administration  and  of  health  care  in  particular."  When  asked  why  she  wanted  to  keep  the  documents,  Clinton  replied,  "Revenge."Confidante's  diary:  Hillary  wanted  to  preserve  records  for  'revenge'During  all  of  these  times,  Blair  used  her  background  as  a  historian  and  a  researcher  to  document  her  interactions  with  Clinton.  She  kept  fastidious  notes,  and  her  journal  entries  were  incredibly  detailed.  Her  boxes  of  documents  are  chock-full  of  White  House  letterhead,  invites  to  Washington  parties  and  internal  campaign  memos.Blair  worked  on  both  of  Bill  Clinton's  presidential  campaigns,  and  throughout  much  of  it,  the  historian  would  document  the  ups  and  downs  in  polls,  the  stories  that  critiqued  him  and  the  positive  moments  the  campaign  experienced.After  the  1992  race,  Blair  received  permission  to  interview  most  of  the  campaign  staff  for  a  possible  book,  and  now  historians  at  the  University  of  Arkansas  are  cataloging  the  interviews  for  an  oral  history  collection.An  inside  view  of  a  presidential  campaign"What  you  really  do  get  is  this  inside  view  of  a  political  campaign,"  said  Andrew  Dowdle,  the  political  science  professor  overseeing  the  oral  history  project.  "It  is  one  of  those  really  interesting  situations  where  you  have  somebody  that  is  an  academic  who  is  obviously  thinking  about  the  historical  record  about  what  is  happening  and  at  the  same  time  is  Hillary  Clinton's  best  friend."Blair  papers  offer  insight  into  Hillary  ClintonIn  a  sign  of  the  times,  Blair  clipped  magazine  and  newspaper  stories  about  the  Clintons.  In  the  16  boxes  of  documents  housed  at  the  University  of  Arkansas,  dozens  of  folders  were  filled  with  newspaper  clippings  from  Bill  Clinton's  time  as  governor  and  president.  A  Time  magazine  cover  story  was  folded  among  those  from  Arkansas  newspapers.These  clippings  also  regularly  made  their  way  to  the  White  House,  where  Blair's  letters  were  expedited  to  go  right  to  the  Clintons  and  not  to  the  White  House  correspondence  office.After  news  of  what  Blair's  notes  revealed  emerged  last  week,  some  columnists  questioned  her  motivation  for  allowing  the  notes  to  be  released."One  might  at  least  wonder  whether  Blair  told  Hillary  she  was  taking  notes  that  she  would  release  posthumously,"  The  Washington  Post's  Kathleen  Parker  wrote.  "That's  certainly  one  form  of  life  insurance.  But  wouldn't  it  have  been  more  close-friendish  to  wait  until  all  parties  concerned  were  enjoying  the  hereafter  before  publishing  notes  that  could  damage  the  living?"Friends  in  Arkansas  close  to  both  Clinton  and  Blair  reject  that  notion,  with  one  saying  there  was  nothing  "sinister  or  Machiavellian  about  the  notes  that  everyone  are  interested  in.""I  don't  buy  it.  Knowing  them  both,  I  don't  buy  it,"  said  Rutherford,  the  dean  at  the  Clinton  School  of  Public  Service.  "I  think  her  motive  was  history  and  political  science."He  added,  "These  are  just  two  ordinary  human  beings,  both  brilliant,  both  smart,  but  who  are  above  all  personal  buddies."Hillary  Clinton  was  a  supporter  of  making  the  Blair  records  public  in  2010.Blair's  "contributions  will  grow  and  live  on,  enlarging  our  understanding  of  history,  politics  and  culture,"  Clinton  said  then."I  hope  also  that  some  young  scholar  will  come  along  and  write  the  story  of  Diane,"  she  said.  "We  miss  her  still  but  this,  along  with  so  many  of  her  contributions  to  us,  lives  on."In  May  2000,  Blair  was  diagnosed  with  lung  cancer.  That  year,  the  University  of  Arkansas  awarded  her  an  honorary  doctor  of  laws  degree,  and  she  spoke  at  the  commencement.Blair  died  a  little  more  than  a  month  after  learning  of  her  illness.  She  left  behind  her  husband  and  two  children."The  tragic  part  in  all  this  is  that  she  got  sick  and  she  died,  and  the  process  was  left  unfulfilled,"  Rutherford  said.  "It  is  tragedy  for  history,  for  Arkansas,  and  it  is  a  personal  tragedy  for  her  friends."</TEXT></DOC>

Forty  years  ago,  Diane  von  Furstenberg  created  a  superior,  yet  remarkably  democratic,  dress.Though  von  Furstenberg  was  only  in  her  20s,  an  awkward  time  for  many  young  women,  she  proved  to  have  perfect  timing  when  she  unleashed  her  little  dress  onto  the  American  fashion  landscape.  And  little  did  she  know  that  it,  and  she,  would  become  the  timeless  icons  of  glamorous  practicality  they  are  today.The  1970s  were  a  time  when  many  women  were  entering  the  white-collar  work  force  and  also  declaring  their  sexual  independence.  This  was  a  radical  combination  of  recognizing  newfound  professional  power  and  redefining  old  sexual  restrictions.Diane  von  Furstenberg  gave  this  new  woman  something  new  to  wear  for  her  new  career  and  new  sex  life.  The  wrap  literally  dressed  the  movement.  It  liberated  women  from  the  stuffy  and  stiff  male-imagined  "working  gal"  get-ups;  it  was  easy  to  put  on  and  take  off;  it  was  smart,  affordable  and  traveled  well.The  fabric  was  clingy  but  not  cumbersome;  it  celebrated  a  woman's  silhouette  instead  of  trying  to  control  it.  The  wrap  dress  would  sway  with  a  woman  to  her  first  big  job,  then  seamlessly  swing  with  her  to  her  first  hot  date.  DVF  designed  a  dress  for  the  new  American  woman  on  the  move.Rarely  have  we  seen  such  a  democratic  design.  The  DVF  wrap  dress  embraces  diversity  like  no  other  before  it  or  since.  It  can  be  worn  well  by  women  aged  20  to  70  and  sizes  0  to  20.  It  comes  in  classic  solids  and  a  plethora  of  prints,  can  be  layered  with  everything  from  denim  jackets  to  floor-length  furs.  Piles  of  jewels  can  fill  the  open  front  V-neckline  or  an  elegant  collarbone  can  be  the  sole  accessory.The  DVF  wrap  dress  is  often  the  symbol  that  one  has  gotten  her  first  "real"  job,  yet  it  is  equally  appropriate  if  you  occupy  the  corner  office.  As  many  women  abandon  early  adult  outfits,  the  wrap  dress  endures.  Most  clothing  designs  are  intended  to  date  you,  socioeconomically  place  you,  locate  and  lock  you  in  some  position  or  lack  thereof.  But  not  this  power  piece,  it  has  the  flexibility  to  grow  with  you,  as  you  become  the  fully  self-determined,  self-defined  woman  you  want  to  be.  A  woman  gets  to  fill  the  wrap  with  her  possibility,  and  that's  its  genius.The  DVF  wrap  is  the  American  dream  dress.Using  herself  as  muse,  Diane  von  Furstenberg  had  a  vision  for  who  the  American  woman  would  become.  She  has  been  known  to  say  she  wasn't  sure  what  she  wanted  to  do,  but  she  knew  the  woman  she  wanted  to  become.  And  even  before  she  became  the  DVF  we  know  and  revere,  she  gave  that  woman  and  millions  of  others  something  wonderful  to  wear.The  classic  sweater  ballerinas  wear  in  rehearsals,  paired  with  a  fluid  skirt,  von  Furstenberg  revealed,  inspired  the  wrap  dress.  Perhaps  she  foresaw  herself  and  other  American  women  making  graceful  global  moves.  Aside  from  being  a  sharp  businesswoman  whose  goods  can  be  purchased  in  more  than  55  countries,  in  2006  she  became  president  of  the  Council  of  Fashion  Designers  of  America  (the  industry's  most  influential  organization).In  2012,  Forbes  Magazine  named  her  one  of  the  20  most  powerful  women  in  business.  She  has  put  herself  in  the  center  of  several  humanitarian  and  philanthropic  efforts,  including  BORNFREE,  a  campaign  to  eradicate  the  spread  of  HIV  from  mother  to  child  by  2015.Yet  at  the  core  of  her  busy  (at  67,  she  says  she's  never  worked  so  hard)  multiplatform  life  is  her  focus  on  women.  In  a  recent  New  York  Times  interview,  von  Furstenberg  stated:  "Everything  I  do  now  is  for  the  empowerment  of  women."And  it  is  certain  she  has  secured  her  legacy.  Like  the  Declaration  of  Independence,  a  Diane  von  Furstenberg  dress  has  been  housed  in  a  prestigious  institution  in  Washington,  the  Smithsonian.In  2009,  first  lady  Michelle  Obama  wore  a  chainlink-print  wrap  dress  on  the  Obamas'  first  official  White  House  Christmas  card.  The  same  year,  former  Vogue  contributing  editor  André  Leon  Talley  curated  the  retrospective  "Diane  Von  Furstenberg:  Journey  of  a  Dress,"  which  opened  in  Moscow.In  2010,  the  show  went  to  São  Paulo,  Brazil,  and  in  2011  to  the  Pace  Gallery  in  Beijing.  It  has  since  been  re-imagined  and  expanded  for  its  American  debut  at  the  historic  Wilshire  May  Building  in  Los  Angeles.  The  show  of  dresses,  photos  and  original  art  opened  to  the  public  on  January  11  and  will  run  through  April  1,  2014.The  40th  birthday  party  of  the  dress  that  made  the  career  that  made  the  icon  will  go  on  year-round,  with  limited-edition  collaborations  with  the  Andy  Warhol  Foundation  and  a  book,  "The  Woman  I  Wanted  To  Be,"  coming  in  the  fall.With  America  facing  the  very  real  possibility  of  a  woman  winning  the  White  House  in  2016,  Diane  von  Furstenberg's  40-year-old  business  model  of  investing  in  independent  women,  "celebrating  freedom  and  selling  confidence"  appears  to  be  more  timely  than  ever.</TEXT></DOC>

Although  Kickstarter  has  been  around  for  almost  five  years,  it  said  more  than  half  of  the  money  was  pledged  in  the  past  12  months."$1  billion  means  that  people  care  about  new  ideas,"  said  the  company  in  a  special  page  announcing  the  milestone.  The  money  helped  bankroll  57,000  creative  projects,  from  films  and  comic  books  to  tech  gadgets  and  video  games.Pledges  came  from  5.7  million  people  in  224  countries,  most  commonly  the  United  States  ($663  million),  the  UK  ($54  million)  and  Canada  ($45  million).That's  a  far  cry  from  Kickstarter's  first  day  --  April  28,  2009  --  when  a  grand  total  of  40  people  pledged  $1,084  to  seven  projects.Kickstarter's  top  50  projects:  When  they  shippedThe  site  requires  project  creators  to  choose  a  deadline  and  a  target  funding  goal,  with  financial  backers  typically  receiving  preferential  access  to  their  product.  Kickstarter  takes  5%  of  all  successfully  funded  projects.  Investors  are  only  charged  if  the  project  reaches  its  stated  goal  within  the  alloted  time  for  fundraising  --  otherwise  no  money  changes  hands.If  you're  wondering,  Wednesday  is  the  day  of  the  week  when  backers  have  pledged  the  most  money,  while  pledges  usually  drop  off  on  weekends.Kickstarter  is  part  of  a  growing  number  of  crowdfunding  sites  that  include  Indiegogo,  RocketHub  and  Crowdrise.

She  is  a  nationally  syndicated  columnist,  an  adjunct  professor  at  Georgetown  University  and  author  of  "Cooking  With  Grease:  Stirring  the  Pots  in  America."  She  was  manager  for  the  Gore-Lieberman  presidential  campaign  in  2000.(CNN)  --  One  year  ago,  the  Republican  National  Committee  completed  a  four-month  period  of  "self-reflection"  and  "evaluation"  after  losing  its  second  straight  presidential  election  and  the  popular  vote  in  five  of  the  past  six  presidential  elections.The  result  of  that  process  became  popularly  known  as  the  GOP  "Autopsy  Report"  --  an  analysis  of  all  of  the  Republican  Party's  ailments  and  prescriptions  for  how  to  cure  them.But,  after  a  year,  it  doesn't  look  like  they  have  really  learned  a  thing.And  their  naval-gazing,  introspection  moment  wasn't  all  that  new  or  particularly  self-aware,  as  more  than  a  decade  of  RNC  chairmen  --  yes,  they  have  all  been  men  --  before  Reince  Priebus  have  all  tried  the  same  thing.Why  the  RNC  built  a  year-round  ground  gameIn  2003,  Marc  Racicot  proclaimed  that  "expanding  our  base  by  recruiting  new  Republican  activists  from  traditionally  strong  and  Democratic  constituencies  is  our  No.  1  priority."  Then,  crickets.In  2005,  Ken  Mehlman's  "Conversations  with  the  Community"  targeted  African-Americans.  That  didn't  go  so  well.And  in  2009,  Michael  Steele's  failed  "50  State  Strategy"  spent  a  lot  of  money  but  did  little  else.Year  after  year,  Republican  leaders  have  admitted  that  their  party  is  alienating  huge  swaths  of  voters.  In  last  year's  report,  for  nearly  100  pages,  they  tried  to  convey  the  message:  "We  get  it."But  here  we  are,  another  year  later,  and  all  the  Republican  Party  has  gotten  is  a  year  older,  with  little  else  to  show  for  it.What  the  GOP  has  offered  over  the  past  12  months  to  solve  its  problems  is  simply  a  change  in  tactics.The  party  hired  "outreach  staff"  and  placed  them  in  communities  they've  never  been  in  before.  But  one  must  question  whether  it  is  effective  outreach  when  your  agenda  keeps  alienating  the  very  people  you  are  trying  to  include.The  party  is  conducting  "candidate  trainings"  to  teach  them  how  to  talk  to  (and  about)  women,  hoping  to  stave  off  any  more  "legitimate  rape"  moments,  among  other  things.It's  worked  to  shorten  the  primary  calendar  and  limit  debates  --  though  ensuring  that  fewer  people  hear  your  agenda  doesn't  seem  a  good  tactic  to  achieve  your  goals  on  expansion.The  attempted  change  in  tactics  hasn't  helped  the  party's  leaders,  officials,  or  endorsed  candidates  with  their  chronic  foot-in-mouth  syndrome.In  this  past  year,  we've  heard  Republican  leaders  and  operatives  call  a  female  candidate  an  "empty  dress,"  talk  about  women's  libidos,  and  --  once  again  --  try  to  downplay  abuse.We've  heard  them  use  derogatory  terms  to  describe  Latino  immigrants,  comparing  them  to  drug  mules.They  have  used  insulting  stereotypes  for  African-Americans,  including  just  last  week  when  former  vice  presidential  candidate  Paul  Ryan  used  thinly  veiled  language  to  talk  about  the  "culture"  of  laziness  among  "inner-city  men."And  gay  Americans  have  faced  outright  discrimination  from  Republicans  at  all  levels  --  from  state  party  chairmen  to  candidates  to  elected  officials.The  Republican  Party's  failure  to  rebrand  hasn't  been  limited  to  the  disrespectful  and  insulting  language.  It  continues  to  push  an  agenda  that  divides  Americans,  limits  equally  and  denies  to  many  the  "pursuit  of  happiness"  --  i.e.,  access  to  economic  opportunity.In  other  words,  the  GOP's  philosophy  hasn't  changed.The  leaders  may  have  set  out  to  become  a  party  that  is  more  "inclusive  and  welcoming,"  but  in  reality  the  GOP  has  moved  in  the  opposite  direction.  It  continues  to  alienate  large  communities  of  Americans,  embracing  a  rhetoric  that  emphasizes  fear  of  others  and,  ironically,  entitlement  for  themselves.The  biggest  problem  for  the  Republican  Party  has  never  been  its  primary  calendar,  its  campaign  tactics  or  a  lack  of  trainings.

That  was  when  Marotta  noticed  an  advertisement  from  the  Topeka  couple,  seeking  donated  sperm."Intrigued"  by  the  ad,  he  says,  he  delivered  three  cupfuls  of  his  sperm  --  gratis  --  to  the  women.One  of  the  women  gave  birth  to  a  daughter  in  December  2009,  according  to  court  documents."I  donated  genetic  material,  and  that  was  it  for  me,"  he  told  CNN  affiliate  WIBW.Or  so  he  thought.  That  changed  when  the  parents  separated  and  one  of  the  women  stopped  working  because  of  illness  and  applied  to  the  state  for  help,  he  said.  The  state  contacted  Marotta  for  child  support.Kansas  officials  were  not  persuaded  by  what  Marotta  says  were  agreements  he  signed,  before  making  his  donations,  that  he  would  assume  no  financial  responsibility  for  the  child,  who  is  now  4  years  old.The  Kansas  Department  for  Children  and  Families  said  any  agreement  would  not  apply  because  a  physician  did  not  perform  the  insemination.Marotta  said  that  was  news  to  him."I  didn't  know  that  there  was  no  doctor  involved,"  he  said.Lawyer  blames  political  motivationsHis  lawyer,  Ben  Swinnen,  accused  the  state,  where  same-sex  marriage  is  not  legal,  of  being  politically  motivated  in  its  pursuit  of  his  client."The  cost  to  the  state  to  bring  this  case  far  outweighs  any  benefit  the  state  would  get,"  said  Swinnen,  adding  his  client  has  no  other  children.Swinnen  said  the  state  is  asking  for  $4,000  to  recoup  the  money  it  has  spent.  It  is  also  asking  Marotta  to  pay  child  support,  which  could  run  into  tens  of  thousands  of  dollars,  he  said.Swinnen  said  the  Kansas  court  has  failed  to  address  many  of  the  challenges  brought  forward  by  Marotta,  under  the  guise  of  statutory  interpretation  of  the  law  requiring  the  donor  sperm  to  be  provided  to  a  licensed  physician."From  a  very  narrowly  crafted  statute,  the  court  has  made  a  very  broad  rule  --  that  is  the  issue,"  Swinnen  said.Swinnen  said  he  planned  to  appeal  the  decision.Marotta:  "I'm  not  her  parent"Marotta  said  he  met  the  child  once  --  a  few  months  ago  --  when  he  and  his  wife  by  chance  crossed  paths  with  one  of  the  girl's  parents  at  an  area  carnival.He  said  he  had  no  intention  of  assuming  a  paternal  role.  "I'm  not  her  parent,"  he  said.But  under  Kansas  law,  he  is  her  father.  Had  a  physician  carried  out  the  insemination,  that  would  not  be  the  case,  because  Marotta  would  be  able  to  document  that  he  was  a  sperm  donor  and  not  the  lover  of  the  girl's  mother,  CNN  senior  medical  correspondent  Elizabeth  Cohen  said."For  all  they  know,  they  were  lovers,"  she  said.  "They  need  that  documentation.  He's  the  dad;  he  ought  to  be  paying  up."Though  a  physician  would  have  tested  the  sperm  for  sexually  transmitted  diseases  and  certain  genetic  disorders,  there  are  disincentives  associated  with  going  through  a  physician.A  single  attempt  at  artificial  insemination  costs  about  $3,000,  and  sometimes  several  tries  are  needed.  "It's  a  lot  cheaper  to  get  someone  to  come  on  over  with  their  donation,  and  then  do  it  yourself  at  home,"  Cohen  said.Meanwhile,  Marotta  owes  legal  fees  and  has  taken  his  story  to  the  news  media.  "If  enough  noise  gets  made  about  it,  at  this  point,  maybe  things  will  change  for  the  better,"  he  said.Asked  whether,  knowing  what  he  now  knows,  he  would  answer  the  advertisement  again,  Marotta  said,  "Probably  not."A  different  kind  of  fatherhoodCNN's  Justin  Lear  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Well,  that's  what  I'm  doing  right  now,"  said  John  Berlin,  staring  into  the  camera  with  moist,  red-rimmed  eyes."I'm  calling  out  to  Mark  Zuckerberg  and  Facebook,"  he  continued.  "You've  been  putting  out  these  new  movies,  these  one-minute  movies  that  everyone's  been  sharing.  Well,  my  son  passed  away  ...  and  we  can't  access  his  Facebook  account.  I've  tried  e-mailing,  and  different  things,  but  it  ain't  working.  All  we  want  to  do  is  see  his  movie."I  know  it's  a  shot  in  the  dark,  but  I  don't  care,"  he  said,  his  voice  breaking.  "I  want  to  see  my  son's  video.  His  name's  Jesse  Berlin.  So  please  help  me."The  Arnold,  Missouri,  man  shot  the  emotionally  raw,  84-second  clip  on  his  phone  and  posted  it  Wednesday  morning  to  YouTube  and  Facebook.  By  late  afternoon  it  had  hundreds  of  thousands  of  views  and  he  was  deluged  with  Facebook  messages.Then,  that  night,  Facebook  called.As  Berlin  listened,  stunned,  they  told  him  would  indeed  make  a  personalized  "A  Look  Back"  video  for  Jesse,  using  posts  he  had  made  public  on  Facebook  before  his  death  in  2012  at  age  21.  Now  Berlin  is  planning  to  share  it  online  as  a  tribute  to  his  late  son."I  just  wanted  a  piece  of  him,"  he  told  CNN  in  a  phone  interview.  "These  (Facebook)  videos  really  touched  me.  And  every  time  Jesse  would  pop  up  (in  one  of  them),  I  was  choking  back  tears.  I  just  wanted  so  desperately  to  see  how  his  video  would  turn  out."Facebook  created  the  customized  videos  for  most  of  its  active  users  Tuesday  to  celebrate  its  10th  anniversary.  The  62-second  clips  note  the  year  the  user  joined  Facebook,  then  show  a  handful  of  their  most-liked  posts  and  a  seemingly  random  selection  of  their  photos  --  all  set  to  instrumental  music.A  Facebook  spokesperson  said  Berlin's  video  came  to  the  attention  of  a  staffer  Wednesday,  who  shared  it  on  an  internal  network."With  the  number  of  people  using  our  service,  it's  often  very  difficult  to  act  on  behalf  of  one.  But  John's  story  and  emotion  moved  us  to  take  action  --  so  we  did,"  the  spokesperson  said.Facebook  realizes  that  by  granting  Berlin's  wish,  they  risk  being  deluged  with  similar  requests  from  other  users  wanting  to  see  video  highlights  of  their  deceased  loved  ones.  Honoring  all  the  requests  would  be  difficult,  but  where  do  you  draw  the  line?  It's  a  thorny  question.The  Facebook  spokesperson  would  not  address  this  issue  directly.  But  he  said  Facebook,  which  introduced  "memorial"  pages  for  deceased  users  in  2009,  wants  to  give  users  better  ways  to  honor  their  loved  ones  on  the  site."This  experience  reinforced  to  us  that  there's  more  Facebook  can  do  to  help  people  celebrate  and  commemorate  the  lives  of  people  they  have  lost,"  he  said.  "We'll  have  more  to  share  in  the  coming  weeks  and  months."John  Berlin  said  his  son  Jesse  died  of  natural  causes  in  his  sleep  on  the  morning  of  January  28,  2012.  Doctors  could  not  pinpoint  the  cause  of  death,  although  he  was  told  a  viral  infection  may  have  impacted  Jesse's  heart,  he  said.Jesse  Berlin  was  a  musician  and  played  rhythm  guitar  in  Fivefold,  a  popular  Missouri  rock  band."Jesse  was  all  about  having  fun,"  his  father  said.  "We'd  always  say  our  hobby  was  laughing.  We  would  just  cut  up  about  everything."He  is  also  survived  by  his  mother,  Lisa,  sister  Nicole,  26,  and  brother  Jared,  21.John  Berlin  still  can't  believe  his  unassuming  video  appeal,  which  now  has  more  than  1.2  million  views  and  4,500  comments,  got  Facebook's  attention  from  a  small  town  in  the  Midwest.But  he  hopes  that  his  story  will  inspire  Facebook  to  help  others  like  him  and  ease  their  access  to  the  accounts  of  late  loved  ones."I'm  glad  that  we're  finding  purpose  in  Jesse's  death,"  he  said.

Follow  the  "Sassy  Six"  on  Twitter  and  Facebook  as  they  train  to  race  the  Nautica  Malibu  Triathlon  with  Dr.  Sanjay  Gupta  on  September  14.(CNN)  --  I  was  diagnosed  with  diabetes  12  years  ago.At  the  time,  I  was  caring  for  my  mother,  who  was  on  dialysis  and  had  had  her  leg  amputated.  As  a  family,  we  knew  very  little  about  diabetes  --  only  that  once  you  got  it,  you  deteriorated  and  died.Like  our  father,  who  suffered  a  stroke  and  then  died  years  later  of  a  massive  heart  attack  brought  on  by  complications  of  diabetes.Both  my  parents,  in  fact,  died  from  complications  of  diabetes.  They  were  strong  pillars  of  our  family  and  community,  taken  way  too  soon  by  a  disease  that  is  the  leading  cause  of  death  among  Pacific  Islanders.Before  seeing  the  doctor,  I  had  been  experiencing  extreme  thirst,  especially  at  night.  The  tips  of  my  toes  felt  like  bees  lived  there  and  were  desperate  to  burst  out  of  my  skin.  My  vision  became  blurred  after  each  meal.It  was  2  p.m.  and  I  hadn't  eaten  anything  when  the  doctor  tested  my  blood  sugar  level.  It  was  in  the  high  200s.  Normal  is  between  110  and  125.You  have  diabetes,  Ms.  Figiel,  the  doctor  said.  He  prescribed  metformin  and  directed  me  to  a  dietitian.  She  further  reiterated  what  the  doctor  had  told  me:  how  food  was  related  to  high  blood  glucose  levels  and  how  consistently  high  blood  glucose  levels  will  eventually  lead  to  amputations,  blindness,  kidney  failure,  stroke  and  other  complications.Fit  Nation:  Why  I  gave  up  sodaI  followed  the  dietician's  plan  for  the  next  few  months.  I  took  up  walking  and  noticed  that  my  vision  had  become  clearer.  But  it  didn't  take  me  long  to  fall  back  to  my  old  eating  habits.  A  colleague's  birthday  celebration,  a  brother's  graduation  party,  a  friend's  wedding,  a  cousin's  funeral  --  these  were  all  occasions  where  food  was  at  the  center.  And  in  our  culture,  you  show  appreciation  and  respect  for  those  who  prepared  the  food  by  eating  it.I  soon  found  myself  hovering  around  400  pounds.After  six  years  of  oral  medication,  I  was  switched  to  insulin  injections.  My  blood  sugar  levels  were  too  high,  and  I  was  not  managing  them  well.Insulin  was  scary  at  first.  But  then  I  realized  it  gave  me  the  freedom  to  eat  all  my  favorite  foods!  I  would  just  inject  100  units,  and  my  blood  sugar  would  be  normal  in  a  matter  of  minutes.  Soon,  I  was  injecting  as  much  as  300  units  of  insulin  a  day.It  was  at  this  time  that  I  began  experiencing  extreme  pain  in  my  teeth  and  gums.  One  of  my  front  teeth  became  longer  than  the  rest,  and  I  found  that  I  couldn't  bite  into  certain  foods,  such  as  apples.  This  front  tooth  was  eventually  pulled.  The  dentist  didn't  have  to  do  much;  it  pretty  much  fell  out  on  its  own.Injecting  large  amounts  of  insulin  meant  I  was  prone  to  low  blood  sugar.  I  would  wake  up  in  a  sweat  as  energy  quickly  left  my  body.  My  8-year-old  son  saved  my  life  continuously  during  this  time;  he  knew  exactly  what  to  do  and  how  to  inject  insulin.  The  fact  that  my  life  was  being  saved  by  a  child  shamed  me.Eighteen  months  ago,  my  sister  and  I  moved  our  family  from  American  Samoa  to  Utah.  I  saw  the  move  as  an  opportunity  for  me  not  only  to  change  my  own  life  but,  most  important,  to  give  my  son  his  childhood.Fit  Nation:  Celebrate  small  victoriesThe  first  thing  we  did  as  a  family  was  to  enroll  at  a  recreation  center.  We  were  all  exercising  together.  The  kids  had  fun  in  the  pool,  and  I  found  myself  walking  again.I  also  decided  to  educate  myself  about  diabetes.  I  had  read  about  people  reversing  diabetes  by  eating  a  plant-based  diet.  It  was  an  easy  plan  to  follow  because  I  love  fruit  and  vegetables,  and  they  are  in  abundance  here.Yet  I  found  that  I  couldn't  chew  much  without  feeling  extreme  pain.  I  bought  a  Vitamix  blender  and  started  throwing  all  my  vegetables  and  fruits  into  it.  By  Christmas,  I  had  dropped  80  pounds.Then,  three  days  before  Christmas,  my  dentist  told  me  that  I  had  advanced  periodontal  disease  and  all  my  teeth  had  to  be  removed.  Not  effectively  controlling  my  diabetes  had  proven  too  much  for  my  gums.I  was  actually  relieved.  I  welcomed  anything  to  remove  the  pain  I  was  experiencing.  I  decided  to  ask  my  friends  to  film  the  surgery.  The  filmmaker  kept  asking  me,  "Girl,  are  you  sure  about  this?  Aren't  you  afraid  people  are  going  to  talk  about  you?"You  can  watch  the  film  on  YouTube.  It's  called  "Sia  at  the  Dentist."Since  then,  my  son  hasn't  had  to  worry  about  waking  up  at  3  or  4  a.m.  to  revive  me.  In  fact,  since  I  began  training  for  the  Nautica  Malibu  Triathlon  three  weeks  ago,  we  are  all  sleeping  soundly  through  the  night.With  the  demands  of  training,  I  realize  that  my  body  needs  more  fuel.  While  I  enjoy  green  smoothies,  I  also  need  protein  and  carbohydrates.  Our  choice  of  animal  protein  comes  from  turkey,  salmon,  chicken,  canned  tuna  and  eggs.  I  buy  whole-grain  pasta,  quinoa  and  brown  rice.  We  eat  only  wheat  bread  and  do  not  eat  white  flour  or  sugar.My  boys  love  saimin,  a  form  of  ramen  noodles  popular  on  the  islands.  When  I  make  it  now,  I  add  broccoli,  peas  and  green  onions  and  throw  out  the  spice  packet,  which  contains  a  ton  of  sodium.  They  complain  and  ask,  "Then  what's  the  use  of  eating  saimin?"That's  when  I  show  them  my  dentures,  and  there's  sudden  silence.I  still  don't  know  all  the  answers  to  diabetes  and  obesity.  All  I  know  is  that  we  have  to  look  hard  at  our  reasons  for  change.  I'll  be  damned  if  I  lose  any  other  body  part  to  this  disease.Did  I  mention  that  I  ran  my  first  mile  this  morning  nonstop?How  the  'Sassy  Six'  came  to  be</TEXT></DOC>

Reversing  that  trend  is  the  goal  of  a  new  generation  of  sensory  engineers  who  are  going  beyond  sight  and  sound  to  produce  devices  that  use  our  untapped  faculties.  Perhaps  the  most  exciting  breakthroughs  right  now  are  arriving  in  the  form  of  smell-centered  communication."Our  motto  is  'aroma  tells  a  thousand  pictures'",  says  Dr.  David  Edwards,  biomedical  engineer  at  Harvard  and  founder  of  Le  Laboratoire,  known  for  producing  radical  sensory  devices  such  as  calorie-free  chocolate  spray.  Every  human  has  thousands  of  distinct  smell  sensors,  Edwards  explains,  a  resource  he  taps  with  his  newest  invention  the  oPhone.Read  more:  Wireless  electricity?  It's  hereSet  for  a  beta  launch  in  July,  this  phone  offers  the  most  sophisticated  smell  messaging  yet  created.  In  collaboration  with  Paris  perfumers  Givaudan  and  baristas  Café  Coutume,  Edwards  has  created  a  menu  of  scents,  contained  in  'Ochips'.  MIT  electrical  engineer  Eyal  Shahar  designed  containers  for  them  that  release  when  heated  by  the  touch  of  a  button,  but  cool  quickly  to  keep  smells  distinct  and  localized,  a  historic  difficulty  with  the  much-mocked  smell-o-vision  experiments  in  cinema.Mix  and  matchThe  oPhone  user  can  mix  and  match  aromas  and  then  send  their  composition  as  a  message,  which  will  be  recreated  on  a  fellow  user's  device.  Up  to  356  combinations  will  be  possible  in  the  first  wave,  rising  to  several  thousand  in  the  next  year,  and  the  dream  is  an  exhaustive  base  --  the  'universal  chip'."Biologically  we  respond  powerfully  to  aroma,  so  if  we  become  familiar  with  the  design  of  aromatic  communication  we  might  be  able  to  say  things  we  couldn't  before",  says  Edwards.  He  sees  the  limited  aromas  of  the  oPhone  as  the  first  letters  of  a  rich  new  language,  that  may  be  used  as  a  basis  for  novels  and  symphonies.

But  the  launch  on  July  10  will  be  accompanied  by  a  more  inclusive  product:  the  first  olfactory  social  network.A  free  app  will  allow  anyone  to  compose  and  send  a  smell  note  by  text  or  email,  based  on  a  set  menu  of  aromas  and  variations.  The  message  can  be  received  by  any  normal  phone  as  a  text.  The  recipient  can  then  download  the  composition  from  hotspots  which  will  be  set  up  in  the  launch  city  of  Boston."We're  expecting  an  interest  in  self-expression  and  we're  ready  to  learn  with  the  public",  says  Edwards.

Beyond  the  city,  the  network  will  include  a  public  interface  for  people  to  trade  tips  and  recipes,  and  store  them  in  cloud  software.  Edwards  plans  to  feature  'smell  emoticons'  and  viral  stunts,  and  may  offer  a  mixing  deck  that  allows  overlap  with  music  production  software.The  concept  can  benefit  from  saturation  of  the  current  communication  market,  says  trend  analyst  and  editor  of  'Green  Futures'  Anna  Simpson.  "We're  reaching  a  limit  with  what  we  can  do  with  text  data,  and  there  is  the  potential  to  connect  more  deeply  and  personally  through  smell."Simpson  also  believes  a  consumer  shift  toward  experience  could  drive  adoption.  "There  is  growing  interest  from  brands  in  resources  for  creating  richer  experiences.Smelly  start-upsGiants  such  as  Olympus  are  publishing  research,  but  for  now  start-ups  are  taking  the  initiative.  Singapore's  Mixed  Reality  Lab  has  been  prolific  in  this  space,  engineering  Japanese  device  Scentee  that  allows  users  to  send  a  single  fragrance  between  them.  The  company  released  an  app  worldwide  in  February,  and  has  lucrative  partnerships  such  as  with  Mugaritz  restaurant  in  Spain,  that  allows  for  online  cooking  tutorials  with  leading  chefs  to  give  students  a  whiff  of  the  smell  they  are  aiming  for.Read  more:  'The  night  I  invented  3D  printing'"Right  now  it's  the  equivalent  of  music  before  mp3s,  when  you  had  to  record  a  song  on  a  tape  and  physically  give  it  someone",  says  Dr.  Adrian  Cheok,  founder  of  the  Mixed  Reality  Lab  and  professor  of  pervasive  technology  at  City  University,  London.  "We  can  send  a  basic  scent  through  a  device  like  Scentee,  but  we  need  the  framework  to  make  millions  of  them  available  through  digitization."Cheok  is  testing  a  device  that  would  connect  us  directly  to  the  Internet,  inspired  by  the  successful  connection  of  optical  fibres  to  neurons  of  mice.  His  lab  experiments  involve  subjects  wearing  a  mouthguard-like  device  containing  magnetic  coils,  from  which  electric  signals  are  directed  into  the  olfactory  bowl  to  simulate  the  effect  of  smell.  The  wearer's  brains  are  scanned  before  and  after  to  pinpoint  the  effect,  and  the  results  have  encouraged  Cheok  enough  to  believe  a  prototype  could  be  available  in  two  years.A  similar  technique  has  already  born  fruit  with  a  similar  design  simulating  the  effects  of  taste.  But  taste  has  just  four  primary  forms  --  bitter,  sweet,  salty,  sour--  whereas  smell  involves  identifying  individual  molecules  with  no  primary  form."The  most  basic  smell  still  has  hundreds  of  molecules  and  you  need  analytical  chemistry  to  see  what's  there",  says  Dr.  Joel  Mainland  of  the  Monell  Chemical  Senses  Center.  "Perhaps  only  5%  would  have  an  impact  on  smell,  so  it's  difficult  to  pick  them  out.  It's  more  trial  and  error  than  quantitative  science."Healthy  aromaMonell  are  also  pursuing  the  goal  of  digitizing  olfaction,  with  healthcare  applications  high  on  the  agenda.  One  of  their  research  areas  is  seeking  smell  biomarkers  in  cancer  patients,  using  an  'e-nose'  to  hunt  chemicals  in  the  blood  to  deliver  early  diagnosis.  The  process  was  inspired  by  the  ability  of  dogs  to  sense  sickness,  although  their  smelling  ability  is  multiples  higher.Although  this  research  is  still  young  in  the  lab,  similar  technology  is  already  being  smartphone-enabled.  A  NASA-developed  chemical  sensor  has  been  released  to  a  commercial  partner  as  the  basis  for  mobile  applications  that  could  breath-test  users.  UK  Nanotechnology  company  Owlstone  are  raising  several  million  dollars  in  venture  capital  for  a  handheld  sensor  that  that  could  detect  a  wider  range  of  diseases.Medical  uses  are  high  on  the  agenda  for  the  burgeoning  Digital  Olfaction  Society,  whose  upcoming  conference  will  discuss  olfaction  technology  for  identifying  dangerous  gases,  guidance  for  the  blind  and  cognitive  aid  for  Alzheimer's  sufferers.  But  industries  as  varied  as  military,  travel,  jewellery,  food  and  entertainment  will  also  be  represented.Dr.  Cheok  believes  the  ultimate  direction  of  goal  is  a  multi-sensory  device  unifying  all  five  senses  to  create  an  immersive  virtual  reality,  and  could  be  usable  within  five  years.  The  neglected  senses  are  making  up  for  lost  time.More  from  Make,  Create,  Innovate:New  technology  can  detect  your  moodPossibly  the  world's  most  impressive  paper  plane</TEXT></DOC>

He  is  the  author  of  eight  books,  including  a  new  novel,  "Patriots,"  and  a  post-election  e-book,  "Why  Romney  Lost."  Frum  was  a  special  assistant  to  President  George  W.  Bush  from  2001  to  2002.(CNN)  --  Would  the  "first  conservative"  recognize  modern  conservatism?The  conservatism  of  recent  days  has  been  a  conservatism  of  radical  individualism:  a  politics  that  sees  its  job  as  protecting  society's  "makers"  from  society's  "takers."Yet  the  man  most  often  credited  as  the  founder  of  modern  conservatism,  the  18th-century  British  thinker-politician  Edmund  Burke,  saw  things  very  differently.  Against  the  politics  of  "I  want,  I  want,  I  want,"  he  emphasized  continuity,  responsibility  and  community.  That  was  a  tough  teaching  200  years  ago,  and  it  remains  a  tough  teaching  today.  It's  not  a  surprise  that  it  often  goes  unheard.  This  year,  however,  Burke's  tough  teaching  is  again  getting  the  articulation  it  deserves,  thanks  to  two  distinguished  books  by  two  rising  conservative  thinkers,  one  British,  one  American.Jesse  Norman  is  a  British  member  of  Parliament  who  strongly  identified  with  Prime  Minister  David  Cameron's  modernizing  conservatism.  His  book  was  first  published  in  Great  Britain  under  the  title  "Edmund  Burke:  Philosopher,  Politician,  Prophet"  but  then  rereleased  in  the  United  States  under  the  pithier  "Edmund  Burke:  The  First  Conservative."As  Norman  tells  it,  Burke  was  a  thinker  and  politician  who  rejected  the  demands  of  "I  want"  in  favor  of  the  duties  of  "you  should."  In  Burke's  words:"[T]he  state  ought  not  to  be  considered  as  nothing  better  than  a  partnership  agreement  in  a  trade  of  pepper  and  coffee,  calico  or  tobacco,  or  some  other  such  low  concern,  to  be  taken  up  for  a  little  temporary  interest,  and  to  be  dissolved  by  the  fancy  of  the  parties."Burke  rejected  both  the  "I  want,  I  want"  of  people  who  expect  ever  more  generous  social  programs  from  government  --  and  the  "I  want,  I  want"  of  bankers  and  brokers  who  wish  to  be  allowed  to  stake  huge  gambles  with  other  people's  money."Except  in  reaction  to  the  most  extreme  necessity,  [Burke's]  politics  is  one  of  moderation.  He  was  an  early  supporter  of  free  markets,  but  only  within  a  strong  context  of  personal  probity,  law,  market  norms  and  trust."Norman's  Burke  forcefully  critiques  the  disintegration  of  society  into  personal  atoms,  each  seeking  only  its  own  personal  economic  betterment.  "[T]he  individual  is  not  simply  a  compendium  of  wants,  human  happiness  is  not  simply  a  matter  of  satisfying  individual  wants,  and  the  purpose  of  politics  is  not  to  satisfy  the  interests  of  people  living  here  and  now:  it  is  to  preserve  an  evolving  social  order  which  meets  the  needs  of  generations  past,  present,  and  future."Make  no  mistake:  Norman's  Burkean  politics  is  conservative  politics.  Burke  defended  free  enterprise  and  private  property  rights.  Burke's  contemporary  Adam  Smith,  author  of  "The  Wealth  of  Nations"  and  founder  of  modern  economics,  saluted  Burke  as  the  only  person  whose  ideas  had  corresponded  with  his  own  without  any  prior  communication  between  the  two.  Burke  favorably  reviewed  Smith's  books,  and  the  two  men  became  friends.Yet  Burke  could  also  forcefully  denounce  the  abuse  of  economic  power  and  the  corruptions  of  wealth.  Norman  again:  "[H]e  regarded  as  his  greatest  achievement  his  campaign  to  restrain  the  influence,  greed  and  self-dealing  of  the  East  India  Company,  and  to  insist  on  the  accountability  of  private  power  to  legitimate  public  authority."Here  is  a  conservative  who  has  much  to  say  in  the  era  of  predatory  finance  and  selective  bailouts.A  politician  himself,  Norman  shrewdly  appreciates  that  Burke's  contributions  emerged  from  an  active  career.  Burke  understood  the  limits  of  the  possible  because  he  himself  had  often  bumped  up  against  them  --  hard.Burke  spent  only  a  few  months  of  his  long  political  career  in  office;  he  passed  most  of  his  parliamentary  career  estranged  from  the  government  of  the  day  and  exerted  almost  all  of  his  influence  in  writings  and  speeches  from  the  back  benches.  Norman  bumped  up  one  of  those  limits  himself.  In  September,  he  voted  against  his  own  party  leadership  on  a  proposed  intervention  in  the  Syrian  civil  war  and  was  stripped  of  his  party  leadership  position.  In  politics,  yet  separated  from  it  --  that  is  the  place  and  role  to  stimulate  fresh  political  thought.The  author  of  this  year's  second  great  work  on  Burke,  Yuval  Levin,  is  located  both  closer  to  --  and  simultaneously  further  from  --  political  power  even  than  Norman.  A  former  domestic  policy  adviser  to  President  George  W.  Bush,  Levin  now  edits  the  flagship  conservative  policy  magazine,  National  Affairs.  At  the  same  time,  he  is  one  of  the  most  influential  advisers  of  Rep.  Paul  Ryan,  the  former  GOP  vice  presidential  nominee;  you  might  say  that  Levin  now  holds  the  Irving  Kristol  chair  as  a  one-man  Republican  brain  trust.Levin  presents  his  new  work  on  Burke  as  a  study  of  a  fierce  debate  that  erupted  in  the  1790s  between  Burke  and  his  one-time  friendly  acquaintance,  Thomas  Paine.  Both  men  were  migrants:  Burke,  Irish-born,  had  moved  to  England;  Paine,  English-born,  moved  to  the  American  Colonies.  Paine  had  given  words  to  the  American  Revolution  in  his  pamphlet  "Common  Sense,"  which  became,  after  the  Bible,  probably  the  most  widely  read  book  in  the  America  of  the  1770s.  Burke  had  urged  compromise  with  the  Americans  in  speeches  in  Parliament  and  then,  after  it  was  too  late  for  reconciliation,  urged  peace  and  acceptance  of  independence.Fifteen  years  later,  however,  those  two  former  allies  bitterly  quarreled.  Burke's  1790  book,  "Reflections  on  the  Revolution  in  France,"  eloquently  and  prophetically  warned  that  revolution  would  end  in  blood  and  tyranny.Paine  wrote  a  rebuttal  to  Burke,  "The  Rights  of  Man,"  published  in  1791.  He  transplanted  himself  to  France  to  lend  personal  support  to  the  new  regime  and  was  elected  to  the  French  National  Assembly.To  his  surprise  --  but  probably  not  to  Burke's  --  Paine  ended  up  in  a  French  prison  cell  when  his  preferred  faction  lost  power  in  late  1793.  But  he  was  not  guillotined,  and  he  lived  and  kept  writing,  becoming  probably  the  first  writer  in  English  to  propose  something  prophetically  like  the  modern  welfare  state.In  "The  Great  Debate:  Edmund  Burke,  Thomas  Paine,  and  the  Birth  of  Left  and  Right,"  published  in  December,  Levin  argues  that  Paine  deserves  equal  billing  with  Burke  as  a  founder  of  our  modern  political  debates.  Levin  sets  each  thinker  as  a  standard  and  corrective  for  their  modern  descendants.Yet  as  Levin  himself  seems  well  aware,  it  is  the  conservatives  who  have  drifted  further  --  and  who  need  correction  more.  Levin's  Burke  often  seems  to  be  debating  --  not  against  his  contemporary  Paine  --  but  against  our  contemporaries  of  the  libertarian  right."Burke  essentially  denies  the  relevance  (though  not  necessarily  the  existence)  of  abstract,  individual,  natural  rights.  He  defines  instead  some  practical  rights  to  the  benefit  of  society.  And  those  benefits  do  not  amount  to  freedom  or  power.  In  fact,  some  of  the  benefits  of  society  to  which  men  have  a  right  involve  restraints  on  their  freedom  and  their  passions."And  again:"Human  beings  cannot  live  in  society  if  they  follow  their  wants  and  passions  unrestrained,  and  so  one  of  the  rights  of  citizens  is  to  have  their  passions  brought  under  some  control.  Thus  society  guarantees  some  liberties  and  some  restraints,  and  precisely  how  these  are  balanced  is  in  normal  times  a  matter  of  prudence,  not  absolute  principle."And  once  more,  this  time  maybe  most  tellingly:"Where  Paine  imposes  on  government  the  obligation  to  respect  the  freedom  of  action  of  each  of  its  citizens,  Burke  imposes  on  government  a  much  less  exacting  (if  somewhat  more  demanding)  obligation  to  meet  the  wants  of  the  people  and  advance  the  interests  of  the  complex  social  whole."It  is  Paine,  Levin's  non-hero,  who  speaks  the  language  of  the  tea  party  --  and  Burke,  Levin's  hero,  who  rejects  maximum  individual  rights  in  favor  of  a  theory  of  social  obligation.  Burke  sees,  and  Levin  sees  with  him,  that  a  politics  of  egoism  and  individualism  leads  to  the  dissolution  of  the  institutions  a  conservative  will  want  to  protect.As  Levin  concludes:  "Today's  conservatives  are  thus  too  rhetorically  strident  and  far  too  open  to  the  siren  song  of  hyper  individualism.  ...  They  could  benefit  by  adopting  Burke's  focus  on  the  social  character  of  man  [and]  from  Burke's  thoroughgoing  gradualism."These  are  wise  and  needed  cautions  --  and  phrased  with  the  cautious  wisdom  necessary  to  make  them  acceptable  to  conservatives  who  do  not  wish  to  hear  what  they  most  need  to  know.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  David  Frum.</TEXT></DOC>

In  the  last  couple  of  years,  she  traveled  the  world  with  her  husband,  Josh  Bearden,  in  an  epic  22-month  trek  that  she  extensively  documented  in  a  blog.  They  climbed  Mount  Kilamanjaro,  swam  in  the  Dead  Sea,  attended  an  Indian  wedding  and  much,  much  more.Then,  in  December,  the  couple  returned  to  the  United  States.That  included  a  brief  stop  in  Georgia,  then  onto  to  Texas  to  visit  Josh's  family.  From  there,  the  two  were  working  on  finding  jobs  in  Denver,  where  the  couple  was  married  and  had  settled.Her  brother,  Michael  Hecht,  said  upon  returning  to  the  United  States,  the  couple  had  spent  a  short  time  in  Georgia,  then  went  to  Texas  for  a  few  weeks  to  visit  Josh's  family.  He  said  they  were  working  to  find  jobs  in  Denver,  where  the  couple  was  married  and  had  settled.Coming  back  to  her  native  country  wasn't  necessarily  easy,  her  family  suggested."The  pressure  of  transitioning  from  her  two-year  trip  back  into  what  we  consider  'normal'  life  seems  to  have  left  her  very  anxious  and  stressed,"  they  said.On  January  17,  Bearden  told  her  family  she'd  be  back  in  about  an  hour  after  setting  out  on  a  walk  from  her  in-laws'  residence  where  she  and  husband  were  staying.Josh  Bearden  told  CNN  affiliate  KENS-TV,  "She  left  on  her  own  free  will.  That  is  what  she  did.  That  is  absolutely  true,  but  what  happened  after  she  left  the  house  on  her  own  free  will  I  don't  know."He  and  other  relatives  and  friends  worked  intently  to  spread  the  word  after  she  didn't  return,  as  the  search  for  her  expanded.Her  brother  told  CNN  two  helicopters  searched  for  nearly  three  hours  six  days  after  she  was  last  seen,  and  that  followed  ground  searches  the  previous  two  days."It's  baffling  right  now  about  what  happened.  Maybe  she  fell  and  hurt  herself.  You  start  thinking  about  things.  I  don't  think  she  had  any  enemies.  She  is  loved  very  much,"  Hecht  said  then.The  biggest  such  search  --  covering  23  square  miles,  by  air  and  land  --  was  last  Saturday.The  Garden  Ridge  police  noted  their  serious  concern  about  Bearden  last  week,  while  adding  "there  is  no  indication  at  this  time  that  (her  disappearance)  is  criminal  in  nature."They  and  other  authorities  talked  to  relatives  and  friends,  combed  through  e-mails  and  text  messages,  checked  out  phone  records  and  contacts  --  all  in  addition  to  looking  for  physical  signs  of  her.But  none  of  these  efforts  have  revealed  any  "evidence  ...  of  her  presence,"  according  to  her  family."If  Leanne  has  indeed  fled  the  area,  she  is  extremely  vulnerable,"  they  said.  "She  left  with  only  a  few  assets  and  is  traveling  very  light."The  family  added  that  while  Bearden  is  athletic,  "she  is  small  in  stature.""Her  mental  and  physical  status  is  uncertain,"  the  said.  "We  fear  for  her  greatly."The  Facebook  page  devoted  to  finding  her  continued  pleading  Thursday  night  --  shortly  after  the  family's  statement  came  out  --  for  the  public's  help,  asking  people  to  print  and  post  fliers  with  her  picture  and  share  her  story  through  social  media."Continue  to  send  your  positive  thoughts  and  prayers  to  the  family  and  friends  of  Leanne  who  are  really  in  need  of  them  now,"  the  post  said.CNN's  Ana  Cabrera  and  Michael  Martinez  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

And  "never  mind,"  is  what  Speaker  Boehner  might  just  as  well  have  said  Thursday  when  he  all  but  declared  the  immigration  reform  legislative  debate  dead  for  2014."Listen,  there's  widespread  doubt  about  whether  this  administration  can  be  trusted  to  enforce  our  laws,"  Boehner  told  reporters,  suggesting  White  House  executive  actions  to  change  provisions  of  the  health  care  law  had  many  conservatives  worried  the  administration  wouldn't  feel  bound  by  any  immigration  legislation  passed  by  Congress.Citing  that  trust  deficit,  the  Speaker  added:  "It's  going  to  be  difficult  to  move  any  immigration  legislation  until  that  changes."There  is  without  a  doubt  deep  mistrust  of  the  Obama  White  House  in  the  Republican  congressional  ranks.But  is  that  mistrust  any  greater  than  just  a  week  ago?  Of  course  not,  and  it  was  just  a  week  ago  that  the  same  Speaker  Boehner  said  this  of  the  same  immigration  debate:"This  problem  has  been  around  for  at  least  the  last  15  years,  it's  been  turned  into  a  political  football.  I  think  it's  unfair,  so  I  think  it's  time  to  deal  with  it."To  be  fair,  the  Speaker  a  week  ago  was  candid  about  the  disagreements  and  skepticism  within  the  Republican  ranks  --  and  among  Republican  base  voters  critical  to  2014  midterm  success."That's  why,"  he  said  a  week  ago,  "doing  immigration  reform  in  a  common  sense,  step  by  step  manner  helps  our  members  understand  the  bite  size  pieces  and  helps  our  constituents  build  more  confidence  that  what  we're  doing  makes  sense."But  to  that  point,  again  just  a  week  ago,  the  word  from  House  GOP  leadership  aides  was  that  Boehner  wanted  to  try  to  see  if  the  House  could  act  this  year.And  President  Obama  tried  to  create  some  space  for  compromise,  angering  some  liberals  by  telling  CNN's  Jake  Tapper  he  would  not  prejudge  the  final  product  --  opening  the  door  to  accepting  a  measure  that  provided  legal  status,  but  not  a  fast  track,  to  citizenship  for  the  estimated  11½  million  undocumented  immigrants  in  the  United  States.Now,  it  appears  testing  that  spirit  of  compromise  will  have  to  wait  until  2015  or  beyond.What  changed  in  a  week?Nothing,  say  key  Boehner  lieutenants.  They  insist  people,  primarily  immigration  activists  and  the  media,  read  too  much  into  what  the  Speaker  said  a  week  ago."Nothing  'happened'  per  se,"  a  top  Boehner  aide  said  in  an  e-mail  exchange.  "We  just  got  started  and  getting  started  requires  taking  a  sober  view  at  the  challenges  that  we  face.  All  he  did  today  was  outline  the  challenges  we  need  to  overcome."Those  challenges  --  the  trust  deficit  as  outlined  by  the  Speaker  --  are  most  unlikely  to  be  overcome  in  a  heated  election  year.Veteran  GOP  strategist  Alex  Castellanos,  who  for  years  has  been  urging  the  GOP  to  act  on  immigration,  said  the  politics  behind  Boehner's  shift  were  easy  to  understand."Nothing  the  House  would  do  would  ever  become  law,"  Castellanos  said  --  meaning  that  even  if  the  House  passed  something,  it  was  unlikely  that  differences  with  the  Senate  could  be  worked  out  this  year.So  a  House  debate  now,  Castellanos  said,  "would  divide  Republicans  and  become  a  political  weapon  Democrats  could  use  against  Republicans  in  2014."There  is  no  doubt  a  vocal  slice  of  the  House  GOP  conference  was  against  acting  on  immigration  this  year  --  arguing  their  biggest  priority  is  turning  out  conservative  base  voters,  many  of  whom  view  even  legal  status  as  amnesty.And  on  the  Senate  side,  GOP  leader  Mitch  McConnell  had  already  served  notice  he  had  little  appetite  for  revisiting  the  issue  in  that  chamber  before  the  election.Not  only  does  McConnell  face  a  tea  party  primary  challenge  but,  as  we  illustrated  last  Sunday  on  "Inside  Politics,"  most  GOP  strategists  see  action  on  immigration  this  year  --  whatever  the  long-term  good  it  might  do  Republicans  --  as  potentially  harmful  to  GOP  prospects  this  year.The  raw  politics  behind  that  view:  In  the  11  states  where  Senate  seats  now  held  by  Democrats  that  are  top  GOP  2014  targets,  conservative  turnout  is  critical  and  the  Latino  population  tiny  to  small.  (West  Virginia  is  lowest  with  just  a  1%  Latino  population;  North  Carolina  is  the  highest  at  9%.)"McConnell  saying  it  wasn't  going  to  get  done  --  burst  the  balloon,"  said  GOP  strategist  Ana  Navarro,  another  voice  who  consistently  stresses  the  urgency  of  acting  on  the  immigration  issue,  yet  sees  the  short-term  political  rationale  of  waiting.So  does  Castellanos,  again  despite  his  longer-term  worries  about  the  GOP  and  the  Latino  vote."Right  now,  the  spotlight  is  center  stage  on  the  Democrats,  the  President  and  Obamacare,"  said  Castellanos.  "And  the  GOP  wants  to  do  nothing  to  distract  from  that,  certainly  not  start  a  food  fight  on  immigration."</TEXT></DOC>

Here  are  some  of  the  best  from  the  show:1.  Rita  Moreno  sings!The  famed  actress  --  one  of  a  handful  of  people  to  have  won  what's  called  the  "EGOT"  (Emmy,  Grammy,  Oscar,  Tony)  --  accepted  the  Life  Achievement  Award  at  the  SAG  Awards  with  all  aspects  of  her  forceful  personality.  She  started  with  a  curse,  joked  with  presenter  (and  old  "Electric  Company"  friend)  Morgan  Freeman  and  concluded  with  a  touching  rendition  of  "This  Is  All  I  Ask."  Now  82,  and  more  than  50  years  removed  from  her  "West  Side  Story"  Oscar,  she  promised  that  she's  "early  in  the  third  act  of  my  life."Relive  all  the  action  with  our  live  blog2.  Bryan  Cranston  sings!Well,  not  much.  But  following  Moreno,  the  "Breaking  Bad"  actor  --  who  won  for  lead  actor  in  a  TV  drama  --  launched  into  an  impromptu  rendition  of  "I  Won  a  SAG  Award."  Then  he  turned  modest,  noting  with  some  surprise  how  impressed  he  was  when  Emma  Thompson  came  up  to  him.  "I  lost  it,"  he  said.  "I've  had  so  many  crappy  jobs  in  my  life  ...  and  the  only  thing  that  got  me  through  was  dreaming,  one  day,  I  could  actually  make  a  living  as  an  actor."SAG  Awards  winners  list3.  Lupita  Nyong'o's  acceptance.Nyong'o,  who  won  a  supporting  actress  award  for  her  performance  in  "12  Years  a  Slave,"  was  positively  giddy.  "I'm  ...  "  she  giggled  at  one  point,  and  had  to  take  a  breath  and  start  the  sentence  again.  She  thanked  Solomon  Northup,  who  wrote  the  slave  narrative  on  which  the  film  was  based,  and  director  Steve  McQueen,  "for  taking  a  flashlight  and  shining  it  underneath  the  floorboards  of  this  nation  and  reminding  us  what  it  is  we  stand  on."  She  said  when  she  told  her  father  she'd  gotten  in  a  movie  with  Brad  Pitt,  he  responded  that  he  didn't  "know  him  personally,  but  I'm  glad  you  got  a  job."  She  was  glad,  too.2014  Oscar  nominations  announced4.  Sofia  Vergara's  assets.The  "Modern  Family"  star  was  directed  to  accept  because  "America  loves  her  and  her  boobs."  The  Colombian-born  actress  said  the  award  meant  so  much  partly  because  she  can  barely  speak  English.  As  fellow  cast  members  chuckled  behind  her,  she  thanked  the  show's  creators  and  writers,  the  crew,  the  network  and,  of  course,  "my  boobs."  "Thank  you  so  much,  SAG,  we're  going  to  party  now!"  she  concluded.5.  Cuba  Gooding's  closing.Gooding  wasn't  supposed  to  close  the  show  --  that  was  going  to  be  done  by  presenter  Ben  Affleck  --  but  as  the  credits  started  rolling,  Gooding  ran  up  in  a  Kanye  West-style  moment,  pushed  Affleck  aside,  and  said,  "Happy  MLK!  Happy  MLK  weekend!"  He'll  have  Monday's  holiday  to  enjoy  all  the  Vines  being  made  of  his  moment.</TEXT></DOC>

CNN  is  not  identifying  the  mother  or  her  son  because  they  are  juveniles."He's  a  smart  little  boy.  All  that  cussing  that  he  did,  he  doesn't  do  that,"  the  mother  said.  "Somebody  told  him  to  do  that.  My  son  doesn't  do  that.  I  don't  allow  it."She  said  a  friend  of  her  brother  filmed  the  video  while  she  was  in  another  room."He  was  wrong  for  doing  that  ...  posting  the  video  up  and  getting  us  into  this  situation,"  she  said.  "Everybody  that  thinks  I'm  a  bad  mother,  I'm  not.  I'm  a  good  mother  to  my  son.  I  teach  him  a  lot.  He's  very  smart."The  police  union  in  Omaha  posted  the  clip  on  its  website  to  highlight  what  it  called  the  "cycle  of  violence  and  thuggery"  the  community  faces.Afterward,  the  Omaha  Police  Officers  Association  came  under  fire  from  the  city's  police  chief,  the  American  Civil  Liberties  Union  of  Nebraska  and  at  least  one  community  leader.  They  say  posting  the  video  needlessly  antagonized  minority  communities,  which  make  up  about  a  quarter  of  Omaha's  409,000  residents.The  ACLU  said  the  union's  use  of  "racially  charged  language"  was  "very  disconcerting."Sgt.  John  Wells,  the  union's  president,  said  the  video  was  "disturbing"  and  "offensive.""The  focus  here  isn't  on  any  particular  ethnic  group.  The  focus  here  is  on  the  troubling  behavior  toward  this  child,"  Wells  said.  "This  behavior  is  going  to  potentially  lead  this  child  down  a  path  that  is  completely  unhealthy."Members  of  the  police  union  turned  the  video  over  to  the  department's  child  victim  unit,  Wells  said.CNN's  Matt  Smith,  Faith  Karimi,  Casey  Wian  and  Jack  Hannah  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Despite  lackluster  reviews,  audiences  turned  out  in  droves  to  watch  Eva  Green's  Atremisia  and  the  rest  of  the  scantily  clad  warriors  take  to  the  sea  for  battle  in  the  $108  million  pic.  Smart  People  director  Noam  Murro  took  the  helm  from  Zack  Snyder  this  time  around  —  though  Snyder  produced  and  wrote  the  film.  Audiences  (62  percent  male)  slapped  the  epic  with  a  B  Cinema  Score.The  lure  of  IMAX  helped.  The  342  IMAX  screens  brought  in  $6.8  million  (or  15  percent)  of  the  film's  weekend  earnings,  while  3-D  showings  accounted  for  63  percent  of  the  grosses.  300:  Rise  of  an  Empire  is  also  performing  quite  well  internationally  with  $87.8  million  from  58  markets.  Still,  it  doesn't  even  come  close  to  Zack  Snyder's  $70  million  March  2007  opening  for  300.  Nevertheless,  the  sequel  should  enjoy  a  healthy  box  office  life.DreamWorks  Animation's  Mr.  Peabody  and  Sherman  (Cinema  Score:  A)  opened  in  the  No.  2  spot  this  weekend  with  an  estimated  $32.5  million  from  3,934  theaters,  exceeding  studio  and  analyst  expectations  for  the  $145  million  movie.  Audiences  were  slightly  more  female  (54  percent)  and  52  percent  were  over  25.  Despite  the  stellar  A  Cinema  Score,  it  seems  younger  audiences  were  even  more  enthusiastic:  The  25  and  under  crowd  gave  it  an  A+.  The  brilliant  dog  and  his  eager  young  companion  will  likely  enjoy  at  least  one  more  good  weekend  at  the  box  office  before  Muppets  Most  Wanted  screams  into  theaters  on  March  21.Liam  Neeson's  tense  thriller  Non-Stop  snagged  the  third  place  spot  with  $15.4  million  —  a  46.7  percent  drop  from  its  debut.  The  Jaume  Collet-Serra  pic  now  boasts  a  $52.1  million  domestic  total.  Meanwhile,  The  Lego  Movie  dropped  47  percent  and  claimed  the  No.  4  spot  with  $11.1  million.  The  animated  building  blocks  have  made  about  $225  million  domestically  in  five  weeks  in  theaters.  Finally,  in  fifth  place,  Mark  Burnett  and  Roma  Downey's  biblical  epic  Son  of  God  fell  60  percent  and  took  in  an  estimated  $10  million  in  its  second  weekend  in  theaters,  bringing  its  domestic  total  to  $41.5  million.Here's  the  top  five:1.  300:  Rise  of  an  Empire  --  $45.05  million2.  Mr.  Peabody  and  Sherman  --  $32.5  million3.  Non-Stop  --  $15.4  million4.  The  Lego  Movie  --  $11.1  million5.  Son  of  God  --  $10  millionIn  the  speciality  box  office  world,  Wes  Anderson's  art  caper  The  Grand  Budapest  Hotel  earned  an  estimated  $800K  from  four  theaters.  Its  $200K  per-screen  average  is  the  highest  ever  for  a  live-action  film.  According  to  Fox  Searchlight,  sell-out  crowds  even  caused  extra  showings  to  be  added  on  the  spot.  For  those  not  in  New  York  or  Los  Angeles,  the  film  will  open  in  17  new  markets  this  weekend.Paul  Thomas  Anderson's  The  Master  was  the  previous  record-holder  with  $147K  per  theater.  Budapest's  debut  also  pushes  Wes  Anderson's  Moonrise  Kingdom  (opened  to  $130k  per  theater  average)  to  the  No.  3  spot.Best  Picture  winner  12  Years  a  Slave  also  expanded  into  1,000  theaters  this  weekend,  earning  $2.2  million  and  a  spot  in  the  top  10.See  the  original  story  at  EW.com.CLICK  HERE  to  Try  2  RISK  FREE  issues  of  Entertainment  Weekly©  2011  Entertainment  Weekly  and  Time  Inc.

Chris  Christie  stood  contrite  and  humiliated  as  he  told  reporters  on  Thursday  that  he  knew  nothing  about  an  unfolding  political  scandal  that  has  upended  his  administration  and  could  mean  bigger  problems  if  he  runs  for  President.Dressed  in  a  conservative  pinstriped  suit  with  a  red  tie  and  a  New  Jersey  pin  affixed  to  his  lapel,  Christie  addressed  a  packed  room  off  his  Trenton  office  for  nearly  two  hours.  He  issued  a  statement  and  answered  questions  --  checking  all  the  boxes,  more  than  one  political  analyst  noted."He  stood  there  and  took  it,"  said  John  King,  CNN's  chief  national  correspondent,  who  noted  that  Christie  was  uncharacteristically  low  key  as  he  appeared  to  understand  the  gravity  of  the  moment.  "It  was  a  very  different  Chris  Christie."Hailed  as  a  star  within  the  Republican  Party  for  his  direct  style  that  resonates  with  voters  and  considered  someone  with  potential  White  House  timber,  the  no-nonsense  Christie  is  embroiled  in  an  episode  worthy  of  a  bad  Hollywood  script.  Top  aides  captured  in  e-mails  swearing  and  talking  tough  about  a  small  town  mayor  who  didn't  endorse  the  boss  for  reelection.Their  response:  use  the  authority  of  a  transportation  agency  to  alter  traffic  patterns  at  the  head  of  the  George  Washington  Bridge,  creating  days  of  gridlock  in  Fort  Lee.  It  might've  been  shaken  off  as  an  embarrassing  political  stunt,  but  officials  say  the  tie-ups  impacted  public  safety.Read  the  e-mailsChristie's  tone  and  message  represented  a  valiant  attempt  to  disconnect  himself  from  the  embarrassing  events  that  have  attracted  the  attention  of  federal  prosecutors,  simultaneously  pleading  ignorance  and  accepting  responsibility.He  said  the  buck  stops  with  him  but  emphatically  intoned  that  he  had  no  knowledge  of  any  aspect  of  the  bridge  controversy."I  am  stunned  by  the  abject  stupidity  that  was  shown  here  regardless  of  what  the  facts  ultimately  uncover.  This  was  handled  in  a  callous  and  indifferent  way,"  he  said."I  knew  nothing  about  this,"  he  added,  noting  as  well  that  he  has  "nothing  to  hide."He  said  he  was  "digging  in"  and  asking  questions  to  find  out  what  occurred.Prosecutors  investigatingChristie  said  he  was  "blindsided"  by  the  release  of  the  e-mails  and  text  messages  on  Wednesday  that  bolstered  claims  by  Democrats  that  the  traffic  jams  between  September  9-13  were  meant  to  punish  Fort  Lee  Mayor  Mark  Sokolich.Christie  and  his  staff  originally  blamed  the  closures  and  the  traffic  delays  on  a  mishandled  traffic  study,  something  he  reiterated  at  his  news  conference.He  said  he  didn't  know  if  it  was  "a  traffic  study  that  morphed  into  a  political  vendetta  or  a  political  vendetta  that  morphed  into  a  traffic  study."On  the  bridge:  'Those  days...  like  a  disaster'The  incident  inconvenienced  motorists  but  also  affected  public  safety,  Fort  Lee  officials  said.The  emergency  services  chief  in  the  town  referred  to  one  case  in  a  letter  to  the  mayor  obtained  by  CNN  involving  paramedics  who  were  delayed  in  reaching  an  elderly  woman  who  had  suffered  a  heart  attack  and  died.  She  was,  however,  reached  by  an  ambulance.Traffic  snarl  delayed  EMS,  official  saysFurther  details  of  the  woman's  death  haven't  been  released  and  the  mayor  told  CNN  he  hopes  the  traffic  tie-ups  weren't  ultimately  a  factor.'Time  for  some  traffic  problems'The  correspondence  subpoenaed  by  Democrats  investigating  the  matter  is  the  most  damaging  evidence  so  far  supporting  their  assertions  that  the  move  was  orchestrated  because  Sokolich  didn't  endorse  Christie's  candidacy  in  November.The  exchanges  began  three  weeks  before  access  lanes  to  the  bridge  were  closed,  two  months  before  Election  Day."Time  for  some  traffic  problems  in  Fort  Lee,"  Bridget  Anne  Kelly,  Christie's  deputy  chief  of  staff  for  legislative  and  intergovernmental  affairs,  said  in  an  e-mail  to  David  Wildstein,  then  the  highest-level  appointee  representing  the  state  at  the  Port  Authority,  which  operates  the  bridge  connecting  the  two  states."Got  it,"  Wildstein  replied.In  another  message  about  school  buses  with  students  on  board  caught  in  the  traffic  jams,  Wildstein  writes,  "they  are  the  children  of  Buono  voters,"  apparently  referring  to  Barbara  Buono,  Christie's  Democratic  opponent  in  the  election  that  he  won  handily.Those  cited  in  the  series  of  e-mails  and  text  messages  did  not  respond  to  requests  for  comment  or  to  verify  the  communications.Christie  said  he  found  out  for  the  first  time  Wednesday  that  a  member  of  his  staff  had  been  connected  to  the  scandal  and  immediately  fired  Kelly.Wildstein,  who  left  his  job  in  December  as  the  Christie  administration's  top  appointee  on  the  Port  Authority  of  New  York  and  New  Jersey,  refused  to  answer  questions  about  the  matter  before  a  New  Jersey  Assembly  committee  that  later  held  in  him  contempt.Christie  said  Sokolich  "was  never  on  my  radar  screen"  as  someone  whose  endorsement  he  was  seeking  and  expressed  dismay  at  why  anyone  would  try  to  retaliate  against  him."This  can't  have  anything  to  do  with  politics.  I  don't  even  know  this  guy,"  Christie  said,  adding  that  he  would  not  be  able  to  pick  him  out  if  he  walked  in  the  room.Sokolich,  who  met  with  Christie  in  Fort  Lee  later  in  the  day  and  called  it  a  productive  discussion,  said  he  welcomed  the  apology  and  took  no  satisfaction  from  the  fallout  now  pummeling  Christie  and  his  administration.Sokolich  told  CNN's  "The  Situation  Room"  that  Christie  was  "gracious  and  apologetic"  in  their  meeting  though  the  mayor  noted  that  "we're  concerned  there  is  more  stuff  and  more  issues  to  deal  with"  regarding  the  scandal."I  take  him  for  his  word,"  Sokolich  said.Furious  in  Fort  LeeIn  Fort  Lee,  Debbie  Minuto  watched  Christie's  apology  and  said  the  disruption  hurt  a  lot  of  people."You  can't  play  with  our  bridge,"  she  said.Jose  Perez  said  the  controversy  illustrates  the  usual  state  of  politics  in  the  Garden  State."In  the  end,  who  pays?  he  asked  "The  people.  We're  the  ones  who  pay  for  the  political  gains."Christie  political  woesBridge  firestorm  could  have  bigger  impact  on  ChristieS.E  Cupp,  a  Republican  political  strategist  and  CNN  "Crossfire"  host,  said  that  Christie  was  "very  believable"  and  "humble  and  contrite"  during  his  lengthy  appearance  that  she  noted  would  satisfy  some  people."He's  not  completely  out  of  the  woods,"  Cupp  said,  noting  that  there  are  more  questions  to  be  asked.CNN  Chief  Political  Analyst  Gloria  Borger  said  that  Christie  did  well,  expressing  humiliation  and  apologizing.  But  she  said  he  did  not  answer  why  one  of  his  top  aides  thought  apparent  retribution  was  a  good  thing  to  do."The  reasoning  behind  this  still  remains  an  issue,"  she  said.Rep.  Bill  Pascrell,  a  Democrat  whose  congressional  district  includes  Fort  Lee,  said  the  scandal  goes  beyond  e-mails."We  went  from  joking  about  cones  in  the  road  to  a  very  sad  day,"  he  said.  "I  can  assure  you  that  this  is  only  the  beginning  on  what's  going  to  be  a  long  investigation  into  behavior  that's  reprehensible,"  Pascrell  told  CNN  in  an  interview.As  criticisms  of  Christie's  management  style  of  being  heavy  handed  and  petty  come  to  the  forefront,  Christie  said,  "I  am  not  a  bully."  But  he  added  that  he  is  "soul  searching"  about  why  he  created  an  environment  in  which  his  staff  felt  they  had  to  lie  to  him.Ron  Brownstein,  CNN's  senior  political  analyst  and  the  editorial  director  for  the  National  Journal,  said  the  scandal  doesn't  necessarily  disqualify  Christie  from  running  for  President.  But,  he  said  "this  is  something  that's  going  to  go  on."Potential  legal  caseCNN  Senior  Legal  Analyst  Jeffrey  Toobin  said  there  was  a  lot  still  to  unravel  regarding  communications  between  the  parties  and  how  the  decision  to  disrupt  traffic  was  made."That  question  will  be  very  important  for  Paul  Fishman,"  Toobin  said  of  the  U.S.  Attorney  for  New  Jersey.But  Paul  Callan,  a  CNN  Legal  Analyst,  said  he'd  bet  a  criminal  case  wouldn't  materialize  from  the  basic  facts  of  the  incident.  But,  one  could  be  brought,  if  there's  any  attempt  at  a  cover-up,  he  said.Fishman's  office  is  working  with  the  FBI's  public  corruption  unit  to  see  if  any  federal  laws  were  broken,  a  law  enforcement  source  told  CNN.Does  this  mean  Christie's  presidential  ambitions  are  dashed?"Not  necessarily,"  Oxford  University  historian  Timothy  Stanley  wrote  in  an  opinion  piece  for  CNN.com.  "He's  a  resourceful  politician  and  it's  still  many  months  before  campaigning  starts  in  earnest.  But  now,  his  opponents  have  a  stick  to  beat  him  with.Democrats  swarmChristie  is  now  campaigning  for  fellow  GOP  governors  as  chairman  of  the  Republican  Governors  Association  and  is  seen  as  a  prime  political  target  for  national  Democrats.  Christie  said  the  scandal  would  not  impact  his  role  with  the  group.While  Christie  blamed  his  staff  and  accepted  responsibility,  he  also  praised  his  own  response  to  the  fallout,  noting  that  he  asked  Bill  Stepien,  a  sharp-elbowed  strategist  who  managed  Christie's  two  gubernatorial  campaigns,  to  leave  his  organization  and  that  he  fired  Kelly.In  exchanges  with  Wildstein  in  the  notorious  e-mail  chain,  Stepien  described  the  Fort  Lee  mayor  as  an  "idiot."  The  e-mails  also  suggested  that  Stepien  was  aware  of  the  maneuvering  by  that  led  to  the  lane  closures."This  is  a  huge,  huge  deal,"  said  one  Trenton  insider.  "This  was  the  governor's  guy."When  asked  about  possible  White  House  aspirations,  Christie  said  that  is  the  last  thing  on  his  mind."I  am  not  preoccupied  with  that  job,"  he  said.Other  documents  raise  questions,  tooOpinion:  Controversy  tarnishes  Christie's  imageCNN's  Paul  Steinhauser,  Peter  Hamby,  Adam  Aigner-Treworgy  and  Ray  Sanchez  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Zegas  also  didn't  disclose  the  evidence.CNN  Senior  Legal  Analyst  Jeffrey  Toobin  said  Zegas'  letter  is  just  that.  "It's  not  sworn  testimony.  It's  not  proof,"  he  said.Read  letter  from  Wildstein's  lawyerChristie  said  at  the  January  news  conference  in  Trenton  about  the  traffic  mess  that  he  "had  no  knowledge  of  this  --  of  the  planning,  the  execution  or  anything  about  it  --  and  that  I  first  found  out  about  it  after  it  was  over."He  also  said  he  had  fired  a  close  aide,  Bridget  Anne  Kelly,  who  e-mails  suggest  was  linked  to  the  closures.  In  addition  to  Wildstein,  two  other  top  Christie  advisers  left  their  jobs,  including  the  man  who  ran  his  two  gubernatorial  campaigns.All  have  been  subpoenaed  by  a  state  legislative  committee  investigating  the  matter  that  has  called  into  question  Christie's  swaggering  governing  style,  which  has  resonated  with  Garden  State  voters  and  has  him  as  a  leading  potential  candidate  for  the  Republican  presidential  nomination  in  2016.The  U.S.  Attorney's  Office  in  New  Jersey  is  also  investigating  the  bridge  scandal  as  well  as  allegations  from  the  mayor  of  Hoboken  that  Christie  administration  officials  last  year  conditioned  Superstorm  Sandy  relief  funds  on  her  support  for  a  redevelopment  project  backed  by  the  governor.  The  officials,  including  Lt.  Gov.  Kim  Guadagno,  deny  the  assertion.Governor's  office  statementA  statement  released  by  the  Christie  administration  said  the  letter  written  by  Zegas  "confirms  what  the  governor  has  said  all  along  -  he  had  absolutely  no  prior  knowledge  of  the  lane  closures  before  they  happened  and  whatever  Mr.  Wildstein's  motivations  were  for  closing  them  to  begin  with."But  the  statement  doesn't  say  whether  or  not  he  knew  during  the  week  of  the  lane  closures  from  September  9-13  that  they  had  been  shut  down.And  a  source  in  Christie's  office  told  CNN's  Jake  Tapper  that  his  advisers  hadn't  yet  pinpointed  when  exactly  he  learned  about  the  closures  --  but  stressed  that  it  was  after  press  reports  surfaced  and  it  was  not  before  they  occurred.For  his  part,  Christie  has  given  different  accounts  of  when  he  first  learned  specifically  about  the  traffic  jams,  but  consistently  has  said  that  it  was  after  the  lanes  were  reopened  and  only  after  media  reports  appeared."I  think  that  was  the  first  I  heard  of  it,"  Christie  said  at  a  December  news  conference  about  an  October  1  Wall  Street  Journal  article.  "But  it  was  certainly  well  after  the  whole  thing  was  over  before  I  heard  about  it."The  Christie  administration  initially  said  the  lane  closures  were  part  of  a  traffic  study,  which  has  since  been  called  into  question  by  e-mails  suggesting  key  advisers  carried  them  out.Fort  Lee  Mayor  Mark  Sokolich  told  CNN  he  would  love  to  know  "what  they  mean"  specifically  about  the  lane  closures,  which  ended  when  Port  Authority's  Executive  Director  Patrick  Foye  fired  off  an  e-mail  on  September  13  ordered  the  lanes  reopened."If  it's  Monday,  that's  one  thing.  If  it's  Friday  late  morning,  that's  another,"  Sokolich  told  CNN  on  Friday.Panel  chair  not  seen  documentsNew  Jersey  Assemblyman  John  Wisniewski,  who  chairs  the  legislative  panel  leading  the  investigation  of  the  bridge  scandal,  told  CNN  that  it  has  not  yet  received  any  documents  supporting  Wildstein's  claim  about  the  timing  of  when  the  governor  knew  about  the  lane  closures."I  am  concerned  as  committee  co-chair  that  Mr.  [Alan]  Zegas  is  now  identifying  documents  that  he  has  not  provided  to  us,"  Wisniewski  said.  "I'd  like  an  explanation  as  to  why  they  weren't  provided  before  he  wrote  this  letter  (that  first  appeared  in)  the  New  York  Times,"  Wisniewski  said.Wildstein  invoked  his  Constitutional  right  to  not  testify  before  the  state  legislators  on  the  matter  earlier  this  month.Wisniewski,  a  Democrat,  said  what  he  read  in  the  Wildstein  letter  "validates  the  skepticism  that  many  people  have  had  about  the  governor's  statements  on  (January  9th).A  source  with  knowledge  of  the  investigation  said  Zegas  is  a  well-respected  attorney  in  New  Jersey  who  would  not  likely  risk  his  own  credibility  on  a  client  like  Wildstein  if  he  didn't  have  documents  to  back  up  his  carefully  worded  suggestion.Zegas'  letter  also  challenged  the  Port  Authority's  decision  to  not  pay  Wildstein's  legal  expenses  related  to  the  legislative  investigation."I  would  request  that  you  kindly  reconsider  the  Port  Authority's  decision,"  he  asked.CNN's  Ashley  Killough,  Chris  Frates  and  Dana  Bash  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

And  the  result  also  illustrates  a  few  things  about  how  the  midterm  election  season  may  play  out.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Here's  something  shocking.Democrats  and  Republicans  totally  disagree  about  the  significance  of  the  GOP's  victory  in  the  first  major  competitive  congressional  ballot  box  test  of  2014.Republican  candidate  David  Jolly  narrowly  edged  out  Democrat  Alex  Sink  to  win  Tuesday's  special  election  in  Florida's  13th  Congressional  District.  Jolly  will  fill  out  the  term  of  his  former  boss,  longtime  Republican  Rep.  Bill  Young,  who  died  in  October.Republicans  win  first  election  showdown  of  the  yearThe  race  was  consistently  in  the  spotlight  with  national  Republicans  framing  the  election  as  a  referendum  on  Obamacare.  They  injected  a  massive  infusion  of  outside  ad  money  into  the  race  and  some  pundits  cast  the  election  as  a  possible  bellwether  for  November's  midterms."I  think  this  was  a  referendum  on  (President  Barack  Obama's)  policies  and  on  Obamacare,  that  played  out  significantly  to  the  disadvantage  of  (House  Democratic  Leader)  Nancy  Pelosi.  And  I  think  it  sets  the  tone  for  what's  coming  in  the  fall,"  Rep.  Greg  Walden  of  Oregon,  the  chairman  of  the  National  Republican  Congressional  Committee,  told  CNN  Wednesday."We've  been  trying  to  tell  people  this  is  a  referendum  election,  Obamacare  is  not  helping  people  the  way  it  was  promised,  and  Democrats  are  going  to  have  a  lot  of  answering  to  do,"  Walden  added.But  his  counterpart  at  the  Democratic  Congressional  Campaign  Committee  sees  very  little  predictive  value  in  the  results."Special  elections  are  not  indicators  of  the  future.  They  never  have  been.  They  never  will  be.  And  certainly  this  is  not  an  indicator  of  the  future,"  Rep.  Steve  Israel,  the  DCCC  chairman,  told  reporters.Special  coverage:  2014  Midterm  ElectionsWhile  a  contest  this  far  out  from  Election  Day  rarely  offers  a  preview  of  what  will  actually  happen  in  November,  Jolly's  victory  gives  the  GOP  instant  bragging  rights.And  the  results  also  illustrate  a  few  things  about  how  the  midterm  election  season  may  play  out.GOP's  convinced  Obamacare's  bad  medicine  for  Democrats:  While  the  candidates  and  local  matters  weighed  heavily  in  the  race,  Obamacare  was  also  a  key  issue.  And  Jolly's  victory  will  only  embolden  Republican  attempts  top  repeal  the  Affordable  Care  Act."His  (Jolly's)  victory  shows  that  voters  are  looking  for  representatives  who  will  fight  to  end  the  disaster  of  Obamacare,"  Republican  National  Committee  Chairman  Reince  Priebus  and  co-chair  Sharon  Day  said  in  an  email  blast  to  reporters.Many  of  the  ads  attacking  Sink  focused  on  health  care."Canceled  health  plans.  Higher  premiums.  Medicare  cuts.  People  losing  their  doctors.  A  disaster  for  families  and  seniors.  For  Alex  Sink,  the  priority  is  Obamacare.  Not  us,"  said  the  narrator  in  a  TV  commercial  by  the  Chamber  of  Commerce,  which  backed  Jolly.That  was  a  potent  message  in  a  district  that's  one  of  the  grayest  in  the  nation.  Nearly  a  quarter  of  all  residents  in  Florida-13  are  65  or  older.Jolly  said  he  was  committed  to  getting  rid  of  Obamacare  entirely.  Sink  recognized  that  Obamacare  was  a  major  issue.  While  she  highlighted  how  the  Affordable  Care  Act  has  helped  people,  she  also  noted  that  the  law  has  flaws  and  said  she  was  open  to  GOP  proposals  to  amend  some  of  the  measure's  requirements.The  Democratic  National  Committee  claimed  the  issue  of  health  care  actually  kept  the  contest  close.The  most  important  poll  number  of  2014"Republicans  fell  short  of  their  normal  margin  in  this  district  because  the  agenda  they  are  offering  voters  has  a  singular  focus  -  that  a  majority  of  voters  oppose  -  repealing  the  Affordable  Care  Act  that  would  return  us  to  the  same  old  broken  health  care  system,"  said  Rep.  Debbie  Wasserman  Schultz  of  Florida,  the  DNC  chair.Democratic  pollster  Geoff  Garin  told  reporters  that  "based  on  polling  we  did  up  until  the  election,  Alex  Sink  basically  neutralized  the  issue  of  the  Affordable  Care  Act."But  Garin  noted  that  Obamacare  energized  the  GOP  electorate."We  have  to  acknowledge  that  the  Affordable  Care  Act  was  a  motivating  issue  for  Republicans  to  come  out  and  vote,  and  less  so  for  Democrats,"  he  said.Last  autumn's  flawed  rollout  of  the  health  care  law  and  the  controversy  over  canceled  policies  because  of  Obamacare  played  into  Republican  hands.And  the  President's  inaccurate  pledge  that  "If  you  like  your  insurance,  you  can  keep  it"  under  the  new  health  care  law  is  a  line  that  dominated  GOP  attack  ads  the  past  few  months.Even  before  Tuesday's  GOP  victory,  Republicans  pledged  to  keep  the  campaign  focus  on  the  health  care  law,  even  if  it  starts  to  gain  traction  with  the  public.A  number  of  Republican  strategists  CNN  reached  out  to  on  Wednesday  said  that  while  the  focus  won't  be  100%  on  Obamacare,  they  admit  it  will  remain  a  huge  part  of  how  they  frame  the  midterms.Non-partisan  analysts  agree.Republicans  hit  Landrieu  over  climate  change  all-nighter"The  one  thing  Republicans  will  take  away  from  this  race  is  that  the  Obamacare  assault  worked.  We're  going  to  see  more  and  more  and  more,"  said  CNN  Chief  National  Correspondent  John  King."Regardless  of  whether  or  not  the  election  will  tell  us  anything  about  November,  the  two  political  parties  will  learn  lessons  from  this  contest  and  apply  them  to  future  races,"  said  Stuart  Rothenberg,  editor  of  the  nonpartisan  Rothenberg  Political  Report.  "Jolly's  win  means  it's  all  about  Obamacare  for  the  GOP."Outside  money  really  mattered:  In  Sink,  national  Democrats  landed  the  high-profile  and  well-known  candidate  they  wanted  in  this  race,  and  she  faced  nominal  opposition  in  January's  Democratic  primary.Jolly  was  far  from  the  GOP's  dream  candidate,  and  he  had  to  battle  to  win  his  party's  nomination.  The  past  two  months,  he  faced  a  barrage  of  attacks  by  Democrats  on  his  days  as  a  lobbyist  and  his  work  for  groups  pushing  to  privatize  Social  Security.  Sink,  meanwhile,  greatly  out-raised,  and  outspent  Jolly.But  support  from  outside  groups  gave  Jolly  a  major  boost.Since  it's  one  of  a  dwindling  number  of  competitive  districts  and  since  it  was  the  only  game  in  town,  outside  money  poured  into  the  race.  It  was  the  most  expensive  contest  so  far  this  cycle,  topping  even  last  year's  special  U.S.  Senate  election  in  Massachusetts.In  addition  to  the  approximate  $2.5  million  spent  by  the  two  campaigns,  the  party  committees  and  outside  groups  dished  out  more  than  $9  million  to  run  TV  and  radio  ads,  other  paid  media  and  direct  mail,  according  to  the  Center  for  Responsive  Politics,  which  monitors  outside  spending.The  pro-Republican  group  American  Crossroads,  which  said  it  spent  $500,000  on  the  contest,  said  that  Florida-13  was  just  an  appetizer"A  lot  of  us  rolled  up  our  sleeves  after  2012,  studied  the  Obama  playbook  and  invested  in  targeted  voter  turnout  and  more  effective  messaging.  The  Florida  CD-13  special  was  an  important  test  market  and  there  was  unprecedented  cooperation  among  outside  groups.  We  intend  to  keep  refining  these  lessons  as  we  prepare  for  the  fall  elections,"  said  Crossroads  CEO  Stephen  Law.Turnout  mattered:  Florida-13,  which  is  a  swing  district  in  a  swing  state,  covers  most  of  Pinellas  County  between  Tampa  Bay  and  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  including  parts  of  St.  Petersburg.  While  Young  captured  58%  of  the  vote  in  his  2012  re-election,  President  Barack  Obama  narrowly  carried  the  district  in  his  2008  and  2012  victories.So  what  happened  Tuesday?Jolly  won  by  around  3,500  votes  out  of  some  180,000  cast.  A  libertarian  candidate  grabbed  just  under  5%  of  the  vote.The  plain  and  simple  truth  is  that  Sink  lost  because  Democratic  voters  didn't  vote.  Turnout  in  the  2012  election  was  nearly  double  what  it  was  in  the  special  election.Democratic  officials  Wednesday  said  by  their  calculations,  the  GOP  had  a  plus-13  advantage  in  the  voting  electorate  in  Tuesday's  special  election,  compared  to  a  plus-five  advantage  for  the  Republicans  in  the  district  in  2012."The  reality  is  Alex  Sink  was  able  to  narrow  a  very  large  Republican  advantage  in  turnout.  She  did  very  well  with  independent  voters,"  said  Garin.And  Israel  vowed  to  win  the  district  come  November,  when  he  says  the  electorate  will  be  more  slightly  more  favorable  to  the  Democrats."If  this  election  were  in  November  instead  of  March,  I  think  Alex  Sink  would  have  won,"  Israel  added.A  veteran  Democratic  strategist  says  his  party  has  some  hard  work  ahead."While  it  is  true  that  a  special  election  often  has  lower  turnout  (and  thus  is  more  likely  to  be  won  by  a  Republican),  I  think  Democrats  spin  this  loss  at  their  own  peril.  We  lost,  period,"  said  CNN  contributor  Paul  Begala."It  means  we  have  to  redouble  our  efforts  to  register  and  turn  out  the  Rising  American  Electorate:  people  of  color,  unmarried  women,  young  people.  We  will  never  be  able  to  match  the  right  wing  dollar-for-dollar,  so  we  have  to  beat  them  voter-to-voter,"  he  said.Steep  road  got  steeper:  The  Democrats  odds  of  winning  back  the  House  in  November  just  got  a  little  bit  slimmer.With  Jolly's  win  keeping  the  congressional  seat  in  GOP  hands,  the  Democrats  still  need  win  17  seats  in  the  midterms  to  regain  control  of  the  chamber.Political  handicappers  consider  that  a  tall  order,  considering  the  shrinking  number  of  competitive  congressional  districts  nationwide.</TEXT></DOC>

The  woman's  husband,  arrested  as  he  tried  to  flee  to  Mexico,  now  faces  charges  of  first-degree  murder.And  a  group  that  has  a  lawsuit  pending  against  the  city  on  behalf  of  six  other  Latina  women  says  the  case  of  Deisy  Garcia  and  her  young  daughters  is  far  from  unique  in  New  York.The  paper  trail  that  ends  with  the  January  deaths  of  Garcia  and  daughters  Daniela,  2,  and  Yoselin,  1,  stretches  back  to  last  May.On  May  30,  Garcia  filed  a  police  report  saying  she  feared  her  husband  would  kill  her  and  their  two  daughters.  Garcia  spoke  Spanish,  and  it  was  in  Spanish  that  she  filed  the  report.  According  to  the  NYPD,  that  report  was  never  translated  into  English  for  further  review.On  January  18,  according  to  authorities,  Garcia  and  her  daughters  were  stabbed  to  death  in  their  Queens  apartment,  allegedly  by  Garcia's  ex-husband  and  the  girls'  father,  Miguel  Mejia-Ramos.Police  say  officers  at  the  murder  scene  filed  their  own  report,  but  the  department  has  no  explanation  for  what  happened  to  Garcia's  report  from  months  earlier  or  to  another  report  from  Garcia,  again  written  in  Spanish,  after  a  November  incident."I  knew  about  the  police  report,  and  I  knew  about  the  police  showing  up  at  the  house  previously  on  one  of  the  times  where  Deisy  had  called  the  police  because  she  had  been  the  victim  of  domestic  violence,"  says  Roger  Asmar,  an  attorney  hired  by  Garcia's  family.  "But  we  did  not  know  that  every  time  Deisy  filled  out  a  report  --  every  time  she  went  to  the  precinct  or  the  cops  came  to  the  house  --  no  one  actually  translated  the  text  into  English,  so,  apparently  no  one  looked  into  it."No  one  translated  it  and  they  just  put  it  away  or  placed  it  into  the  system  ...  three  complaints  were  filed  by  Deisy,  and  none  of  the  times  she  filed  a  complaint  did  police  actually  arrest  Mr.  Mejia,  her  ex-husband."Police  have  confirmed  the  May  30  report,  and  CNN  has  obtained  copies  of  reports  dated  November  27  and  28  from  Garcia's  family,  who  found  them  among  Deisy  Garcia's  belongings  after  she  died.On  November  27,  cops  responded  to  a  call  from  Garcia."She  said  when  her  husband  came  home,  he  threatened  to  kill  her.  She  was  crying  so  she  called  the  police  and  told  them  that  her  husband  had  threatened  to  kill  her,"  said  Sara  Alvarado,  Garcia's  aunt,  who  was  present  during  the  police  visit  that  time.As  she  had  in  May,  Garcia  once  again  filed  a  domestic  incident  report  and  wrote  in  Spanish,  "at  about  2:40  am  my  husband  came  home  and  assaulted  me,  he  pulled  my  hair  and  kicked  me  twice,  then  grabbed  my  phone.  After  he  did  that,  I  called  the  police,  but  he  changed  and  ran  out  taking  a  phone  that  is  not  mine  with  him.  Today  in  the  morning,  he  was  threatening  me  that  he  would  take  away  my  daughters."Police  are  unable  to  say  whether  that  report  was  ever  translated,  either.On  November  28,  Garcia  made  a  follow-up  visit  to  the  precinct,  filling  out  another  complaint,  but  her  claims  did  not  lead  to  an  arrest.In  statements  to  police  following  the  slayings,  Mejia-Ramos  allegedly  said  he'd  been  drinking  when  he  got  home  on  the  night  of  January  18,  according  to  the  Queens  district  attorney's  office.  He  went  through  his  wife's  phone  and  Facebook  account  and  saw  a  photo  of  her  with  another  man,  he  told  prosecutors.According  to  the  Queens  district  attorney's  office,  Mejia-Ramos  said  he  grabbed  a  knife  and  stood  over  Garcia  and  allegedly  stabbed  his  wife  multiple  times  before  entering  his  daughters'  bedroom  where  he  gave  each  of  them  a  hug  and  a  kiss,  and  stabbed  them  as  he  asked  for  their  forgiveness.The  three  bodies  were  discovered  by  Garcia's  uncle  and  a  12-year-old  cousin  the  next  day.Afterward,  Mejia-Ramos  tried  to  flee  to  Mexico,  according  to  police,  but  was  arrested  January  21  in  Schulenburg,  Texas  --  a  town  near  the  Mexican  border  --  and  brought  back  to  New  York.  He  was  indicted  on  February  14  and  will  be  arraigned  in  early  March,  the  Queens  district  attorney's  office  said.He  is  charged  with  first-degree  murder,  second-degree  murder  and  fourth-degree  criminal  possession  of  a  weapon.  Mejia-Ramos  faces  life  in  prison  without  the  possibility  of  parole  if  convicted  on  the  murder  charge,  the  district  attorney's  office  said.Garcia's  family  believes  that  had  the  police  taken  action,  she  may  still  be  alive."If  they  would  have  given  it  more  importance,  would  have  translated  it  to  English,  then  maybe  they  (police)  would  have  figured  out  what  to  do,  they  would  have  investigated  him,  been  more  on  top  of  the  case,  what  was  happening  with  them,"  said  Luzmina  Alvarado,  Garcia's  mother."If  the  police  had  done  something,  this  tragedy  could  have  been  avoided  --  my  daughter  would  be  alive."Some  two  months  before  Garcia  filed  her  written-in-Spanish  domestic-abuse  report  in  May,  an  organization  that  serves  "limited  English  proficient"  domestic-violence  victims  filed  a  lawsuit  against  the  city  on  behalf  of  six  other  Latina  women,  alleging  the  NYPD  denies  interpreters  to  limited-English  speakers,  depriving  "them  of  access  to  NYPD  services."That  lawsuit  filed  by  the  Violence  Intervention  Program  is  still  pending.The  group  says  Garcia  is  but  one  of  many  women  who  are  ignored  by  police  because  they  cannot  file  complaints  in  English.  The  group  alleges  that  the  NYPD's  denial  of  interpreter  services  has  deprived  limited-English-proficient  women  of  their  right  to  report  crimes,  to  protect  themselves  from  dangerous  abusers,  and  to  communicate  effectively  with  the  police  in  a  wide  range  of  circumstances."Not  only  does  the  NYPD  fail  to  provide  language  assistance,  it  also  degrades,  ridicules  and  otherwise  mistreats  limited  English  proficient  individuals  who  request  interpreter  services,  actively  demeaning  them  for  their  lack  of  English  proficiency,"  according  to  the  lawsuit.The  NYPD  directed  all  inquiries  on  the  lawsuit  to  the  New  York  City  Law  Department,  which  handles  legal  issues  for  the  city."The  NYPD  has  more  foreign-language-speaking  officers  than  any  police  department  in  the  country,  including  thousands  of  Spanish-speaking  officers,"  said  Nicholas  Paolucci,  spokesman  for  the  New  York  City  Law  Department."Also,  the  NYPD  has  a  corps  of  19,000  members  of  the  service  who  can  provide  interpretation  services  in  over  70  languages."But  the  Garcia  family,  the  Violence  Intervention  Program  and  the  women  the  group  represents  say  that  it  doesn't  matter  how  many  officers  can  speak  multiple  languages  if  non-English  statements  provided  by  complaint  victims  are  ignored.As  a  result  of  an  internal  review  into  the  failure  of  officers  to  translate  domestic  incident  reports,  the  NYPD  is  verbally  instructing  officers  on  how  to  translate  and  store  domestic  incident  reports  that  are  prepared  in  texts  other  than  the  English  language,  according  to  NYPD  Detective  Cheryl  Crispin."A  memo  will  be  transmitted  to  all  commands  informing  domestic  violence  officers  to  immediately  locate  a  member  of  the  command  who  possesses  the  necessary  language  skills  to  translate  a  victim's  written  statement  to  English,"  she  said  in  a  prepared  statement.For  Garcia's  family,  that  may  be  too  little,  and  it  is  definitely  too  late."We're  thinking  maybe  we  sue  the  police  because  this  wasn't  just  his  (Mejia-Ramos')  fault,  the  authorities  are  also  at  fault,"  said  Garcia's  mother."My  daughter  may  be  dead  and  can't  do  anything  in  this  case,  but  I  want  justice."</TEXT></DOC>

The  former  French  first  lady  Valerie  Trierweiler  --  whom  Obama  said  in  November  he  was  looking  forward  to  hosting  --  will  not  come  to  the  White  House  now  that  Hollande  has  announced  their  split.France's  President  says  his  private  life  is  private,  but  he's  not  denying  the  affair.  Now  he  will  come  to  America  solo  for  one  of  Washington's  most  tradition-bound  events,  where  protocol  dictates  nearly  everything  and  a  slip-up  could  wind  up  offending  a  top  ally."The  protocol  that  dictates  how  state  visits  are  handled  is  something  that's  steeped  in  hundreds  of  years  of  history,"  said  Anita  McBride,  a  former  chief  of  staff  to  Laura  Bush  who  helped  plan  state  dinners.It's  not  the  first  time  a  French  president  has  come  to  Washington  alone.  Hollande's  predecessor,  Nicolas  Sarkozy,  attended  a  formal  dinner  at  the  White  House  shortly  after  announcing  his  split  from  his  wife.  And  at  least  Hollande  is  showing  up;  when  Brazil's  President  Dilma  Rousseff  caught  wind  of  National  Security  Agency  spying,  she  canceled  altogether.But  questions  such  as  who  will  sit  next  to  Obama  are  still  up  in  the  air.  Typically  the  partner  of  the  visiting  head  of  state  gets  the  chair  next  to  America's  president.  When  that  position  is  vacant,  U.S.  officials  must  consult  their  counterparts  and  even  have  the  president  himself  weigh  in.It's  not  necessarily  a  hard  task,  said  McBride,  because  plenty  of  people  would  jump  at  the  chance  to  sit  next  to  Obama.  The  designee  doesn't  have  to  be  French,  though  it  wouldn't  be  unexpected  if  he  or  she  is.It's  just  another  piece  of  planning  that  requires  painstaking  attention  to  detail."The  White  House  is  a  place  where  they  can  adapt  to  changes  quickly,  and  you're  always  nimble  and  always  flexible.  And  you  always  are  careful  in  issues  of  protocol,"  she  said.It  may  seem  antiquated  to  treat  a  guest  so  gingerly,  but  state  dinners  have  always  been  about  formality  and  gentle  manners.  They've  grown  so  much  that  they  no  longer  fit  in  the  State  Dining  Room.  Instead  a  sturdy  white  tent  on  the  South  Lawn  holds  the  hundreds  of  invited  guests,  who  usually  include  some  top  donors  and  key  allies  in  Congress.It's  a  much-sought-after  invitation  --  so  much  so  that  a  Virginia  couple  faked  one  to  attend  Obama's  event  honoring  the  Indian  prime  minister,  Monmohan  Singh,  in  2009.  Michaele  Salahi's  red-and-gold  sari  is  likely  forever  imprinted  in  the  mind  of  Desiree  Rogers,  the  former  White  House  social  secretary  who  stepped  down  shortly  after  the  incident.That  kind  of  glaring  fissure  in  the  evening's  decorum  isn't  typical,  said  McBride,  who  did  recall  an  incident  during  a  visit  by  the  Chinese  premier  she  said  was  marred  when  a  journalist  shouted  a  question  at  the  formal  arrival  ceremony.And  while  the  details  still  matter  for  staunch  allies  like  France,  Obama  isn't  likely  to  face  any  major  shocks  when  it  comes  to  the  policy  matters  at  hand.France,  to  the  Obama  administration's  pleasure,  has  taken  a  more  interventionist  stance  in  global  conflicts.  It's  a  far  cry  from  a  decade  ago,  when  the  country's  opposition  to  invading  Iraq  prompted  the  emergence  of  "Freedom  fries."In  Libya  France  took  a  leading  role  in  the  mission  that  ended  with  Moammar  Gadhafi's  death.  And  in  Mali,  French  troops  are  working  to  prevent  Islamists  from  taking  over  in  the  northern  part  of  the  country.France  was  ready  in  September  to  launch  air  strikes  in  Syria  as  Obama  was  trying  to  rally  support,  making  the  country  one  of  a  few  foreign  allies  to  back  the  U.S.  plan  after  Britain's  parliament  voted  against  it.  Obama  eventually  went  to  Congress  for  approval,  but  the  issue  never  came  to  a  vote.While  Hollande,  like  most  other  European  leaders,  has  expressed  outrage  at  allegations  of  NSA  spying,  the  dust-up  isn't  likely  to  make  any  big  dent  in  French-American  relations.  The  same  can  be  said  for  what  Hollande  calls  "tax  evasion"  by  U.S.-based  tech  firms  (after  Washington,  the  French  President  heads  to  Silicon  Valley.)Hollande,  a  socialist  elected  in  2012,  is  more  closely  aligned  in  policy  with  Obama  than  the  center-right  Sarkozy.  His  fluency  in  English  might  make  him  an  easier  dinner  companion  than  his  predecessor,  as  well  as  a  more  conversant  travel  buddy  when  he  and  Obama  fly  to  Thomas  Jefferson's  Monticello  on  Monday.Just  don't  ask  him  about  his  love  life.READ:  Opinion:  Why  the  French  president  needs  Michelle  ObamaREAD:  French  president  says  it's  over;  first  lady  leaves  residenceREAD:  French  President  Francois  Hollande  meets  with  Pope  Francis  amid  scandal</TEXT></DOC>

The  McMath  family  fought  in  court  to  keep  the  teen  on  a  ventilator,  and  announced  Sunday  night  that  they  are  moving  the  girl  to  another  care  facility.While  family  attorney  Christopher  Dolan  told  reporters  that  for  her  safety,  Jahi's  destination  won't  be  announced,  a  New  York  facility  said  Sunday  it  was  ready  to  accept  her."We  are  aware  of  Jahi  McMath's  dire  situation,  and  we  are  willing  to  open  our  outpatient  facility  to  provide  24-hour  care,"  said  Allyson  Scerri,  founder  of  New  Beginnings  Community  Center  in  Medford,  New  York.  "Her  brain  needs  time  to  heal.""This  child  has  been  defined  as  a  deceased  person  yet  she  has  all  the  functional  attributes  of  a  living  person  despite  her  brain  injury,"  the  center  said  on  its  website.When  routine  surgeries  go  wrongHowever,  barring  a  misdiagnosis,  medical  experts  say  the  teen  will  not  recover  if  she  is  truly  "brain  dead."While  laymen  tend  to  use  the  words  "coma"  and  "brain  dead"  interchangeably,  in  medicine  they  mean  very  different  things."Coma"  is  the  broader  term  used  to  describe  a  prolonged  state  of  unconsciousness,  according  to  the  Mayo  Clinic.Outwardly,  it  resembles  sleep.  Doctors  may  sometimes  purposefully  put  a  patient  into  a  coma  to  give  the  brain  time  to  heal.  Comas  rarely  last  longer  than  a  couple  of  weeks,  according  to  the  clinic;  patients  can  fully  regain  consciousness  or  may  transition  from  a  coma  into  a  persistent  vegetative  state.Someone  in  a  persistent  vegetative  state  has  lost  most  higher  cognitive  function,  but  his  or  her  brain  shows  some  activity.  The  patient  may  open  their  eyes  or  exhibit  small  movements,  but  cannot  speak  or  respond  to  commands,  according  to  the  National  Institutes  of  Health.  Some  patients  can  recover  from  this  state,  according  to  the  NIH.Both  these  situations  are  different  from  brain  death:  According  to  the  Uniform  Determination  of  Death  Act,  an  individual  is  dead  when  he  or  she  "has  sustained  either  (1)  irreversible  cessation  of  circulatory  and  respiratory  functions,  or  (2)  irreversible  cessation  of  all  functions  of  the  entire  brain,  including  the  brain  stem."What  that  essentially  means  is  that  the  brain,  an  extremely  complex  organ,  no  longer  helps  the  patient  function.The  human  brain  is  divided  into  what  doctors  call  the  Lower  Brain  and  the  Upper  Brain.The  Lower  Brain  --  where  the  top  of  the  spinal  cord  goes  up  through  our  necks  and  into  our  brains  --  regulates  body  functions  such  as  spontaneous  breath,  reflexes,  our  heartbeat,  body  temperature  and  sleep/wake  cycles.The  Upper  Brain  is  behind  all  the  "higher"  functions  in  a  person's  nervous  system.  This  gives  us  the  ability  to  use  our  senses  --  to  see,  taste,  smell,  hear  and  feel."Brain  death"  means  both  the  upper  and  lower  part  of  the  brain  are  not  functioning.  That  command  center  of  the  body  that  regulates  the  central  nervous  system  is  unable  to  perform.  However,  some  function,  such  as  a  heartbeat,  may  linger."It's  a  little  difficult  for  a  layperson  to  understand  how  a  person  is  dead  if  the  heart  is  still  beating,"  said  Dr.  Panayiotis  Varelas,  director  of  the  neurosciences  intensive  care  service  at  Detroit's  Henry  Ford  Hospital.But  without  brain  function,  the  body  eventually  shuts  down,  unless  there  is  medical  intervention.  Someone  on  a  ventilator  may  appear  to  be  breathing,  but  cannot  breathe  on  their  own.While  the  heart  usually  stops  within  72  hours,  it  could  continue  beating  for  "a  week  or  so,"  Varelas  said.Jahi's  mother,  Nailah  Winkfield,  has  said,  "I  would  probably  need  for  my  child's  heart  to  stop  to  show  me  that  she  was  dead.  Her  heart  is  still  beating,  so  there's  still  life  there."The  term  "brain  dead"  can  be  misleading,  said  Cynda  Hylton  Rushton,  professor  of  clinical  ethics  at  Johns  Hopkins  University,  because  it  sounds  like  a  person  really  isn't  dead.  If  someone  dies  of  a  heart  attack,  doctors  don't  say  they're  "cardiovascular  dead,"  for  example.Doctors  should  be  more  transparent  about  the  finality  of  brain  death,  said  Arthur  Caplan,  director  of  the  Division  of  Medical  Ethics  at  NYU  Langone  Medical  Center.Terms  such  as  "mechanical  support"  or  "artificial  machine  support"  should  be  used  to  refer  to  sustaining  the  functioning  of  a  brain  dead  person,  he  said.  "No  one  wants  to  take  away  'life  support.'""Dead  is  dead,"  agreed  neurologist  Dr.  Richard  Senelick  in  The  Atlantic.  "Brain  death  isn't  a  different  type  of  death,  and  patients  who  meet  the  criteria  of  brain  death  are  legally  dead."The  American  Academy  of  Neurology  updated  its  brain  death  guidelines  for  adults  in  2010,  asking  doctors  to  follow  a  step-by-step  checklist  of  some  25  tests.All  criteria  in  the  guidelines  must  be  met  before  a  person  can  be  considered  brain  dead;  however,  the  legal  definition  of  brain  death  can  vary  from  state  to  state.The  American  Academy  of  Pediatrics  added  to  those  guidelines  for  children.  These  childrens'  guidelines  advise  there  should  be  two  attending  physicians  involved  in  the  care  of  the  child,  and  they  should  make  separate  examinations  separated  by  an  observation  period.Both  must  determine  the  child  is  brain  dead.  In  making  that  ruling,  the  doctors  use  the  currently  established  criteria;  there  must  not  be  a  conflict  of  interest."No  one  who  has  met  the  criteria  for  brain  death  has  ever  survived,"  Senelick  said.  "No  one."CNN's  Elizabeth  Landau  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Share  your  personal  story  with  iReport  in  honor  of  World  Rare  Disease  Day  and  you  could  be  featured  on  CNN.(CNN)  --  Laura  Kassem  had  tripped  before.  But  this  time,  she  fell  hard.  She  couldn't  seem  to  control  her  body  as  she  went  down,  even  to  protect  her  face  from  hitting  the  concrete  sidewalk.It  happened  again  the  next  day  as  she  stepped  off  an  escalator.  Then  again  in  the  parking  garage  on  Monday  when  she  went  to  work."I  had  no  idea  what  was  going  on,"  the  33-year-old  remembers.  "I  had  no  idea  why  I  would  just  drop  all  of  a  sudden."The  third  time,  she  went  to  the  emergency  room,  where  a  neurologist  ordered  an  MRI  and  a  cardiologist  performed  a  tilt  test  --  normally  done  on  patients  who  faint  because  of  a  sudden  drop  in  blood  pressure.The  tests  revealed  nothing.  Doctors  sent  Kassem  home  with  instructions  to  drink  more  water.Kassem  continued  to  trip  over  nothing.  So  she  went  to  the  Cleveland  Clinic,  where  she  says  her  symptoms  "baffled"  doctors  in  the  rheumatology,  cardiology  and  neurology  departments.Back  home  in  Sylvania,  Ohio,  a  suburb  of  Toledo,  Kassem  made  an  appointment  with  an  orthopedic  surgeon  to  address  the  extreme  pain  in  her  hips  and  lower  back.  He  sent  her  to  a  neurosurgeon,  who  in  turn  sent  her  to  see  a  neurologist  who  specialized  in  neuromuscular  disorders.Meanwhile,  Kassem  tried  to  avoid  open  spaces.  She  hugged  walls  so  that  if  her  body  froze  up,  she  wouldn't  fall  flat  on  her  face.  She  already  had  a  few  loose  teeth,  and  her  nose  was  a  mix  of  blue  and  purple.One  night,  Kassem  and  her  sister  were  watching  "20/20"  when  the  woman  being  interviewed  began  describing  Kassem's  symptoms.  The  woman  had  been  diagnosed  with  Stiff  Person  Syndrome,  or  SPS,  a  rare  neurological  disorder  characterized  by  painful  muscle  spasms  and  progressive  stiffness  in  the  lower  back  and  limbs.Could  that  be  it?  the  Kassems  asked  themselves.  They  had  never  heard  of  SPS.  But  Kassem's  latest  neurologist  thought  they  could  be  right.  While  waiting  for  the  test  results,  he  put  Kassem  on  benzodiazepine,  a  medication  that  is  known  to  lessen  the  symptoms  of  SPS.It  worked.  For  the  first  time  in  nearly  a  year,  Kassem  was  able  to  walk  without  assistance.Read  more  of  Laura's  story  on  iReportThe  exact  prevalence  of  Stiff  Person  Syndrome  is  unknown,  according  to  the  National  Organization  for  Rare  Disorders,  but  one  estimate  places  it  at  one  in  every  1  million  people.  That  means  about  316  people  in  the  United  States  have  it.The  exact  cause  of  SPS  is  also  unknown.  Doctors  believe  it  has  something  to  do  with  a  deficiency  of  glutamic  acid  decarboxylase,  or  GAD.  GAD  is  involved  in  the  body's  production  of  gamma-aminobutyric  acid,  which  helps  control  muscle  movement.  In  patients  with  SPS,  antibodies  mistakenly  attack  certain  neurons  that  produce  GAD,  leaving  the  body  without  the  protein  it  needs.The  symptoms  of  SPS  generally  start  to  appear  in  patients  after  age  30.  People  with  SPS  initially  experience  muscle  stiffness  or  discomfort.  As  the  disease  progresses,  muscle  spasms  and  rigidity  become  more  pronounced.  These  muscle  spasms  can  last  anywhere  from  a  few  minutes  to  several  hours,  and  are  triggered  by  unexpected  noises,  physical  contact,  stress  and/or  emotional  anxiety."I've  fallen  on  the  streets  and  prayed  to  God  that  someone  wouldn't  run  over  me,"  says  Ingrid  Steppan,  who  was  diagnosed  with  SPS  five  years  ago.  "My  husband  can't  touch  my  arm.  My  kids  can't  give  me  hugs."Steppan  compares  the  muscle  spasms  to  childbirth.  Imagine  contractions  felt  in  the  uterus  happening  from  your  neck  down  to  your  toes,  she  says.  The  whole  body  goes  stiff  --  hence  the  syndrome's  name.When  she  first  began  experiencing  symptoms,  Steppan  couldn't  dress  herself.  Her  9-year-old  son  had  to  help  her  put  on  her  underwear,  because  his  older  siblings  had  all  moved  out  and  her  husband  went  to  work  early."It  was  embarrassing  for  him  and  it  was  embarrassing  for  me,"  she  remembers.  "We  both  cried."Treatment  has  helped.  While  there  is  no  cure  yet  for  SPS,  patients  are  often  put  on  benzodiazepines  to  treat  muscle  stiffness  and  calm  the  spasms.  Anti-seizure  medications  and  painkillers  are  sometimes  prescribed  as  well  to  lessen  symptoms.Yet  after  years  of  freezing  and  falling  unexpectedly  because  of  stress  or  sudden  sounds,  many  patients  with  SPS  develop  agoraphobia,  an  irrational  fear  of  certain  places  and/or  situations.  They  become  housebound,  unable  to  venture  outside  their  comfort  zone."My  mind  knows  I'm  OK,  but  my  body  won't  cooperate,"  Steppan  says.  "If  I  try  to  go  outside,  my  body  completely  stiffens  up,  and  I  will  fall  over  flat.  You  can  put  a  sticker  on  my  head  and  put  me  up  for  sale.  I'm  a  statue  for  your  lawn."A  few  years  ago,  Steppan  underwent  intravenous  immunoglobulin  therapy,  or  IVIg,  a  common  treatment  for  patients  with  SPS.With  IVIg,  a  concentrated  solution  of  sterilized  antibodies  is  given  to  the  patient  through  one  of  their  veins.  IVIg  is  most  commonly  used  to  help  people  with  autoimmune  disorders.  Although  SPS  is  a  neurological  disorder,  it  has  "features"  of  an  autoimmune  disease,  according  to  the  National  Institutes  of  Health.Those  features  could  eventually  lead  scientists  to  a  cure.Dr.  Harry  Atkins,  medical  director  of  regenerative  medicine  at  Ottawa  Hospital  Research  Institute  in  Ontario,  Canada,  has  been  studying  the  effects  of  stem  cell  transplantation  on  autoimmune  diseases  for  close  to  a  decade.Five  years  ago,  a  patient  with  SPS  approached  him  with  her  medical  history.  She  had  done  her  research,  Atkins  says,  and  told  him  that  a  stem  cell  transplant  could  restore  her  immune  system  --  ridding  it  of  the  antibodies  fighting  against  GAD  production."She  made  a  very  compelling  case  that  this  was  worth  trying,"  Atkins  remembers.  "That's  how  I  learned  about  Stiff  Person  Syndrome."During  a  stem  cell  transplant,  doctors  use  strong  doses  of  chemotherapy  to  wipe  out  the  patient's  immune  system.  They  then  return  purified  bone  marrow  stem  cells  to  the  body."It  appears  that  as  the  immune  system  regrows,  it's  like  a  baby's  immune  system,"  Atkins  says.  "It  recognizes  what's  part  of  the  body,  and  is  able  to  fight  against  germs  and  pathogens."It's  a  dangerous  procedure.  When  their  immune  system  is  wiped  out,  patients  are  prone  to  infection  and  organ  damage.  As  such,  it  is  reserved  for  those  with  only  the  most  severe  autoimmune  diseases.Atkins  decided  SPS  fit  that  bill  and  performed  the  stem  cell  transplant.  His  first  SPS  patient  is  now  symptom-free,  he  says,  and  off  all  medications  typically  used  for  treating  the  rare  disorder.  He  performed  another  transplant  on  a  second  SPS  patient  two  years  ago.  That  patient  is  symptom-free  as  well,  he  says,  though  she  still  relies  on  a  few  medications."I  didn't  believe  the  procedure  would  work  so  well,"  Atkins  says.  "It's  like  a  miracle  to  see  what  she  was  like  before,  and  to  see  her  now  --  it's  quite  dramatic."Steppan  will  be  Atkins'  third  SPS  patient.Last  week,  doctors  harvested  her  stem  cells  for  sterilization.  She  hopes  to  receive  her  last  dose  of  chemotherapy  soon,  so  they  can  then  start  rebuilding  her  immune  system.Atkins  is  cautious  about  saying  stem  cell  transplantation  is  the  definitive  treatment  for  Stiff  Person  Syndrome.  The  results  have  been  encouraging,  but  the  procedure  has  only  been  done  in  two  patients.  The  rarity  of  the  disease  makes  it  difficult  to  find  research  funding  --  not  to  mention  participants.  All  three  procedures  were  performed  in  Canada  under  the  country's  universal  health  care  system.Doctors  at  Fred  Hutchinson  Cancer  Research  Center  in  Seattle  have  an  open  clinical  trial  protocol  for  doing  stem  cell  transplants  on  patients  with  Stiff  Person  Syndrome,  says  Dr.  George  Georges.  Unfortunately,  most  insurance  carriers  in  the  United  States  will  not  cover  the  cost  of  the  transplant.Kassem  is  trying  to  raise  $400,000  as  a  deposit.The  Ohio  resident  has  been  bedridden  since  October.  She  has  spasms  that  cause  her  whole  body  to  stretch  out  and  shake.  Her  brother  is  the  only  one  strong  enough  to  bend  her  legs  when  they  go  stiff.  She  lives  with  her  parents,  and  someone  has  to  be  home  24/7.Kassem  has  made  many  new  friends  through  rare  disease  support  groups  online.  They're  so  few  and  far  between  it's  often  the  only  way  patients  with  SPS  can  find  each  other.  She  and  Steppan  have  communicated  through  Facebook."It's  a  very  lonely  life,"  Steppan  says.  "I  talk  to  them  every  day  and  they  talk  to  me.  ...  These  people  need  to  believe  that  there's  hope."See  more  stories  from  people  living  with  Stiff  Person  Syndrome</TEXT></DOC>

"It's  more  an  issue  with  gay  marriage  than  with  the  relationship."The  question  also  comes  up  in  relation  to  vendors,  since  29  states  don't  recognize  sexual  orientation  in  their  anti-discrimination  laws,  meaning  that  it's  perfectly  legal  for  a  florist  or  country  club  in  Texas  to  tell  an  LGBT  couple  that  they  refuse  to  plan  the  wedding  because  they're  gay  or  transgendered."There's  also  more  subtle  discrimination:  Not  returning  phone  calls  or  emails,  or  all  of  a  sudden  becoming  booked  once  they  realize  it's  a  same-sex  wedding,"  Coveney  Smith  added.So  unless  they  hire  a  wedding  planner  to  do  it  for  them,  the  couple  must  come  out  to  every  vendor,  venue,  and  photographer  they  contact.  "Many  of  the  vendors  I  refer  my  clients  to  are  also  gay-owned  businesses,  so  they  speak  the  language,  they  understand  the  culture,  and  they're  obviously  more  than  happy  to  work  on  a  same-sex  wedding,"  Coveney  Smith  said.Business  Insider:  Zach  Braff  Accidentally  Photobombs  Couple's  Wedding  Photo  In  Times  SquareThinking  beyond  the  traditional  'Bride  and  Groom'The  wedding  industry  is  very  bride-focused:  Forms  and  contracts  refer  to  the  "bride  and  groom,"  vendors  say  "bridal  party,"  people  sit  on  either  the  "bride's  side"  or  "groom's  side."  And  most  traditional  "bridal"  magazines  portray  the  norm  as  one  woman  and  one  man.It's  up  to  the  couple  how  they  decide  to  break  those  traditions.  Choosing  what  to  wear  can  be  a  very  personal  choice,  for  instance.  Do  two  lesbian  brides  want  to  wear  two  suits,  a  suit  and  a  dress,  or  two  dresses?  Do  two  grooms  want  to  wear  the  same  tux,  or  one  white  and  one  black?  Or  does  the  couple  simply  want  to  wear  whatever  they  like?Tradition  also  dictates  the  bride  walks  down  the  aisle,  but  for  couples  with  two  brides  or  two  grooms,  the  answer  isn't  as  obvious.  "We  often  will  have  the  couple  walking  in  holding  hands,  or  if  the  space  works,  we'll  use  two  aisles  and  eliminate  the  question  of  'Who's  the  bride?'  all  together,"  Coveney  Smith  explained.And  even  though  most  gay  weddings  are  not  in  a  place  of  worship,  that  doesn't  mean  certain  religious  traditions  aren't  included  in  the  ceremony  that  need  to  be  updated  for  a  same-sex  marriage.  If  a  gay  Jewish  couple  is  getting  married  for  example,  the  tradition  of  the  man  breaking  the  glass  might  evolve  into  the  couple  breaking  two  glasses  or  taking  turns  breaking  the  glass  together.Business  Insider:  The  31  Most  Important  LGBT  People  In  TechDecisions  after  the  wedding  may  be  complicated,  tooSince  same-sex  marriage  is  still  illegal  in  certain  states  and  countries  around  the  world,  deciding  where  to  go  on  the  honeymoon  can  be  a  challenge."If  they  travel  together  internationally  or  throughout  the  country,  that  marriage  is  mostly  invalid.  So  they  basically  have  to  carry  around  this  extra  paperwork  [proving  their  relationship  in  the  case  of  a  medical  emergency],  which  costs  thousands  of  dollars  in  attorney  fees,"  Coveney  Smith  explained.This  also  affects  couples  taking  one  another's  name,  or  creating  a  new  name  together.  Said  Coveney  Smith:  "If  they  get  a  legal  marriage  in  New  York  and  then  go  back  to  Texas  —  that  name  change  wouldn't  apply  just  by  presenting  the  marriage  license.  They'd  have  to  actually  go  through  the  court  system  to  change  their  name."And  the  issue  only  gets  more  complicated  when  children  are  involved,  leading  to  more  paperwork,  attorney  fees,  and  issues  to  address  such  as  second  parent  adoption.Same-sex  couples  find  their  stride  on  wedding  dayStay  true  to  who  you  areEven  though  all  of  these  issues  pose  a  serious  challenge  to  same-sex  couples  when  they're  planning  their  wedding,  Coveney  Smith  encouraged  them  to  remain  optimistic  and  stay  true  to  who  they  are."Don't  have  a  boring  wedding  if  you're  not  a  boring  couple.  If  you  really  like  drag  queens  (like  some  of  my  clients  do)  then  have  a  drag  queen.  If  you  really  like  go-go  dancers,  have  go-go  dancers  at  your  wedding,"  she  said."Your  wedding  should  be  an  expression  of  who  you  are,  and  it  should  be  really  fun."Same-sex  couples  take  long  road  to  the  altarHave  you  run  into  any  particular  challenges  around  a  same-sex  ceremony?

Prosecutors  say  he  killed  an  unarmed  teen.  Who  will  jurors  believe?</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  The  jury  weighing  the  fate  of  a  white  Florida  man  accused  of  killing  a  black  teen  during  an  argument  over  loud  music  concluded  its  second  day  of  deliberations  Thursday  after  asking  a  judge  for  details  about  a  letter  written  in  the  months  after  the  shooting.The  jury  was  scheduled  to  resume  deliberations  Friday  at  9  a.m.  ET.The  question  was  the  latest  posed  by  the  jury  considering  the  evidence  in  the  case  against  Michael  Dunn,  who  says  he  acted  in  self-defense  when  he  opened  fire  on  four  teenagers  in  an  SUV  in  Jacksonville  in  November  2012.Prosecutors  contend  it  was  an  act  of  murder.  Dunn  has  been  charged  with  first-degree  murder  in  the  killing  of  17-year-old  Jordan  Davis.  He  also  has  been  charged  with  three  counts  of  attempted  murder.  If  Dunn  is  found  guilty,  he  faces  up  to  life  in  prison.The  questions  came  during  the  second  day  of  deliberations  in  a  case  that  has  drawn  parallels  to  the  trial  of  George  Zimmerman  in  the  killing  of  teenager  Trayvon  Martin,  which  also  had  racial  overtones  and  claims  of  self-defense.Jury  questionsAmong  the  requests  from  the  jury  was  to  see  surveillance  video  from  the  gas  station  where  Dunn  shot  Davis.The  video  contains  20  minutes  of  footage  from  multiple  angles,  though  a  shorter  version  showing  only  one  angle  was  slated  to  be  shown  in  court.The  jurors  posed  another  question  later  in  the  day:  "Can  we  get  that  dummy  with  the  sticks?"  --  a  reference  to  a  flexible  mannequin  and  three  dowels  used  to  demonstrate  the  angles  of  the  bullets  as  they  entered  Davis'  body.Judge  Russell  Healey  said  he'd  grant  the  request  if  both  the  prosecution  and  defense  agreed,  but  after  examining  the  dummy,  defense  attorney  Cory  Strolla  said  he  felt  the  dowels  in  the  body  had  been  repositioned  and  objected  to  the  jury  seeing  it  again.Then  the  jury  asked  the  judge  when  the  letter  was  written.  The  answer:  June  2013.In  closing  arguments  Wednesday,  prosecutors  said  inconsistencies  between  Dunn's  words  and  actions  undermined  his  assertion  he  acted  in  self-defense  when  he  fatally  shot  the  teen.His  attorney  countered  the  state  failed  to  prove  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  his  client  was  guilty.  He  pleaded  with  jurors  to  find  Dunn  not  guilty.In  testimony  Tuesday,  Dunn  said  he  fired  in  self-defense  after  the  teen  threatened  him  with  a  gun."My  intent  was  to  stop  the  attack,  not  necessarily  end  a  life,"  he  said.  "It  just  worked  out  that  way."Defendant  says  he  was  'crazy  with  grief''There  was  no  gun'But  Assistant  State  Attorney  Erin  Wolfson  said  Wednesday  that  Dunn's  claims  don't  add  up.She  noted  that  Dunn  fired  10  shots  at  the  SUV,  three  of  them  while  the  car  was  fleeing.He  never  took  cover  --  but  instead  opened  his  car  door  --  even  though  he  would  later  tell  detectives  he  had  seen  a  weapon,  she  said."There  was  no  gun,"  Wolfson  told  jurors.In  addition,  she  said,  he  did  not  tell  his  fiancee,  Rhonda  Rouer,  that  he  had  seen  a  weapon  until  more  than  a  month  later.Dunn  also  left  the  scene  of  the  shooting,  went  back  to  a  hotel  where  they  were  staying  and  walked  his  dog,  she  said.And  he  returned  the  next  day  to  his  house  --  more  than  two  hours  away  --  all  without  calling  911,  Wolfson  said."This  defendant  didn't  tell  anyone  because  he  thought  he  had  gotten  away  with  murder,"  she  said,  adding  that  Dunn  had  no  idea  a  witness  had  taken  down  his  tag  number.Opinion:  Did  Florida  shooter  make  his  case  on  the  stand?'Rap  crap'Dunn  has  testified  he  described  the  music  to  his  fiancee  as  "rap  crap."In  the  parking  lot,  as  the  music  blared,  "his  blood  started  to  boil;  he  didn't  like  the  music  that  was  coming  out  of  the  car  next  to  him;  he  got  angrier  and  angrier,"  Wolfson  said.Dunn  rolled  down  his  window  and  asked  the  youths  to  turn  it  down,  which  they  did,  but  then  turned  it  back  up,  Wolfson  said."He  got  angry  at  the  fact  that  a  17-year-old  kid  decided  not  to  listen  to  him,"  she  said,  adding  that  Dunn  then  pulled  a  9  mm  gun  out  of  his  glove  box  and  shot  "systematically  and  methodically"  at  the  SUV.  "Nobody  denied  that  Jordan  was  talking  back.  But  this  defendant  took  it  upon  himself  to  silence  Jordan  Davis  forever."Dunn  testified  Tuesday  that  he  saw  Davis  reach  down  and  pick  something  up,  and  that  he  saw  about  "4  inches  of  a  barrel"  from  a  12-  or  20-gauge  shotgun  above  the  window.Opinion:  Florida  shooter  saw  black,  thought  'threat''You're  not  going  to  kill  me'He  muttered  aloud  to  himself,  "  'You're  not  going  to  kill  me,  you  son  of  a  bitch,'  "  as  he  opened  the  glove  compartment,  grabbed  his  pistol,  dropped  the  holster  at  his  feet,  chambered  a  round  and  began  firing,  he  said.Nine  of  the  10  rounds  hit  the  car,  and  three  of  them  struck  Davis,  one  of  them  cutting  through  his  liver,  his  lung  and  his  aorta.Wolfson  rejected  Dunn's  assertion  he  had  been  trying  to  de-escalate  the  situation  and  he  feared  for  his  life.Strolla,  the  defense  attorney,  noted  that  no  witnesses  had  accused  Dunn  of  using  any  hate  words  and  testified  that  his  client  had  just  come  from  a  wedding,  where  his  ex-wife  said  he  had  appeared  to  be  in  a  good  mood.Strolla  noted  that  the  SUV  departed  the  gas  station  after  the  shooting  and  was  gone  for  three  minutes  before  it  returned,  enough  time  for  the  youths  to  have  dumped  a  gun.Detectives  did  not  search  the  area  for  days  after  the  shooting,  he  said.Strolla  cited  testimony  from  another  passenger  in  the  car  with  Davis  who  acknowledged  he  may  not  have  heard  all  the  conversation  between  the  two  men.'You  have  reasonable  doubt'Witnesses  testified  that  child  locks  on  the  SUV  were  engaged,  and  that  Davis  --  who  was  seated  in  the  rear  --  could  not  have  gotten  out  of  the  back  seat  to  threaten  Dunn.  But  Strolla  said  the  teen  could  simply  have  opened  the  door  by  putting  his  hand  out  the  window,  which  was  open."You  have  lack  of  evidence,  conflicts  of  evidence  and  reasonable  doubt,"  he  told  the  jurors.On  rebuttal,  Assistant  State  Attorney  John  Guy  appealed  to  the  jurors'  "common  sense.""That  defendant  didn't  shoot  into  a  car  full  of  kids  to  save  his  life,"  he  said.  "He  shot  into  it  to  preserve  his  pride.  Period.  That's  why  we're  here."Though  Davis  may  have  had  a  big  mouth,  he  had  no  weapon,  Guy  said.  Though  he  acknowledged  minor  inconsistencies  in  witness  accounts,  he  said  that  was  to  be  expected.  "It's  not  like  television,"  he  said.  "In  real  life,  there  are  inconsistencies."The  court  has  decided  not  to  release  the  identifications  of  the  jurors,  fearing  they  could  be  the  subject  of  threats,  but  a  document  obtained  by  CNN  affiliate  WTLV-TV  in  Jacksonville  showed  the  makeup  of  the  jury.It  has  four  white  females,  two  black  females,  four  white  males,  an  Asian  female  and  a  Hispanic  male,  plus  four  alternates.CNN's  Tom  Watkins  and  John  Couwels  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

And  since  the  inception  of  the  tea  party  in  2009,  it  seemed  like  that  wing  had  the  upper  hand.  It  slowly  made  effective  inroads  into  a  party  many  members  of  the  vocal  new  group  thought  had  lost  its  way.They  elected  a  new  breed  of  Republican  into  office,  including  Texas  Sen.  Ted  Cruz  and  Kentucky  Sen.  Rand  Paul,  who  surprised  the  political  world  by  defeating  establishment-backed  candidates  in  their  respective  primaries.But  those  two  successes  haven't  been  the  norm,  especially  in  the  Senate,  as  many  inexperienced  but  ideologically  more  pure  candidates  have  been  unable  to  seal  the  deal.In  2010,  Sharron  Angle  won  the  Senate  primary  in  Nevada  and  Christine  O'Donnell  won  in  Delaware.  Two  years  later,  Richard  Mourdock  and  Todd  Akin  won  in  Indiana  and  Missouri  respectively.All  four  went  on  to  lose  against  the  Democrat.In  a  year  in  which  Republicans  have  their  best  shot  in  several  elections  of  regaining  control  of  the  Senate,  party  leaders  are  hoping  to  avoid  general  election  stumbles.The  Republican  establishment  is  off  to  a  good  start  this  primary  season,  but  it  had  an  easy  opener.Texas  Sen.  John  Cornyn  easily  won  his  primary  against  tea  party  backed  challenger  Rep.  Steve  Stockman,  who  was  largely  persona-non-grata  during  his  campaign.  Still  he  spent  $2.6  million  in  the  final  weeks  leading  up  to  the  early  March  primary.Brian  Walsh,  a  former  Cornyn  spokesman  and  former  communications  director  for  the  National  Republican  Senatorial  Committee  (NRSC),  which  works  to  get  Republicans  elected  to  the  Senate,  said  Cornyn  did  the  work  necessary  to  beat  a  challenger,  including  researching  possible  opponents  and  raising  money."It's  not  a  coincidence  that  John  Cornyn  won,"  he  said.Republican  incumbents  fight  backSenate  Republicans  want  to  make  sure  that  what  happened  in  Texas  happens  elsewhere.Senate  Republican  Leader  Mitch  McConnell,  who  is  facing  a  primary  challenge  from  Matt  Bevin,  has  taken  the  unusual  step  of  publicly  criticizing  at  least  one  group  working  to  defeat  some  GOP  incumbents,  including  McConnell  -  the  Senate  Conservative  Fund."I  think  we  are  going  to  crush  them  everywhere,"  referring  to  SCF-backed  candidates.  "I  don't  think  they  are  going  to  have  a  single  nominee  anywhere  in  the  country,"  he  said  in  a  recent  interview  with  The  New  York  Times.And  in  an  interview  with  The  Weekly  Standard,  McConnell  said  the  organization  is  giving  conservatism  "a  bad  name.""We  know  their  business  model  is  only  to  criticize  Republicans,"  he  said.SCF  Executive  Director  Matt  Hoskins  said  in  a  statement  to  CNN  that  its  members  know  that  beating  McConnell  "won't  be  easy."  But  they're  working  to  elect  Matt  Bevin  "because  they  know  things  won't  change  in  Washington  unless  we  change  the  people  we  send  there."While  McConnell's  press  office  said  he  was  talking  specifically  about  the  SCF,  tea  party  groups  took  offense."He  must  not  want  the  tea  party  vote  in  the  general  election  and  that  is  why  he  should  be  removed,"  Amy  Kremer,  the  Tea  Party  Express  chair,  told  CNN  previously.And  the  local  Louisville  Tea  Party  group  endorsed  Bevin  last  week.McConnell  is  expected  to  win  his  primary,  but  he's  not  making  many  friends  among  groups  aligned  with  the  tea  party.Evangelical  Latinos  say  they  could  be  force  in  midterm  electionsIncumbents  at  riskThe  SCF  is  not  the  only  thorn  in  Republican  incumbents'  side.In  addition  to  the  local  and  national  tea  party  groups,  Washington-based  operations  like  Club  for  Growth  and  FreedomWorks  have  vowed  to  make  sure  that  Republicans  in  name  only  (RINOs)  --  those  viewed  as  not  committed  to  their  description  of  a  limited  government  --  have  to  empty  out  their  Washington  offices  after  November.Other  Senate  incumbents  facing  primaries  include  Kansas  Sen.  Pat  Roberts  and  Mississippi's  Thad  Cochran.In  Cochran's  race,  the  conservative  Club  for  Growth  published  an  op-ed  this  week  in  SunHerald.com  in  Mississippi  calling  him  a  "liberal"  because,  among  other  things,  he  voted  to  create  the  Department  of  Education  in  the  1970s."Why  would  his  seventh  term  be  any  different  from  the  last  six?"  Club  for  Growth  President  Chris  Chocola,  a  former  member  of  Congress  who  voted  for  the  budget-busting  expansion  of  Medicare  Part  D  in  2003,  wrote  in  the  opinion  piece.Republican  strategist  John  Feehery  said  that  claim  is  ridiculous."These  guys  are  desperate  and  they  are  losing,  so  they  are  going  to  be  using  more  and  more  language  that  is  less  and  less  rational,"  he  said.But  Stuart  Rothernberg,  editor  of  the  Rothenberg  Political  Report,  said  Cochran  could  have  problems  against  State  Sen.  Chris  McDaniel,  who  will  benefit  from  money  and  resources  of  the  Club  for  Growth  and  the  SCF."If  there's  going  to  be  an  incumbent  whose  defeated,  Cochran  is  the  first  name  on  the  list,"  Rothenberg  said.Perhaps  because  Cochran,  who  has  served  in  the  Senate  for  42  years  and  won  his  last  election  with  61%  of  the  vote,  doesn't  yet  understand  the  strength  of  his  opponent."The  tea  party  is  something  I  don't  really  know  a  lot  about,"  he  said  on  local  station  WLOX.But  the  Republican  establishment  isn't  sitting  on  its  hands  and  is  even  active  in  states  like  Mississippi  and  Kansas  where  any  Republican  would  most  likely  to  win."In  the  past,  if  it's  a  red  state,  we'd  say  'we  don't  need  to  pay  attention  to  that,'"  said  Walsh,  adding  that  incumbents  are  prepared  this  year.Primary  involvementAnd  in  primaries  where  there  is  no  incumbent,  the  establishment  is  taking  the  calculated  and  unorthodox  step  of  coalescing  around  favored  candidates.While  individual  senators  often  endorse  candidates,  Walsh  said  the  organization  took  "a  hands  off"  approach  during  the  last  two  election  cycles.This  year,  the  organization  is  more  engaged.  What's  unclear,  however,  is  exactly  what  resources  the  NRSC  is  providing  to  preferred  candidates.In  North  Carolina,  candidate  Thom  Tillis  is  the  establishment  favorite  against  tea  party  and  FreedomWorks-backed  candidates.He  held  a  fundraiser  at  NRSC  headquarters  in  Washington  on  Monday.  McConnell  attended  as  did  a  number  of  the  17  GOP  senators  who  have  endorsed  him.Tillis  spokesman  Jordan  Shaw  said  he  can't  speak  about  the  role  the  NRSC  is  playing  in  the  race."I  don't  work  for  them  and  can't  speak  for"  the  NRSC,  Shaw  said.  "Until  we  clear  the  primary,  we've  got  to  be  respectful  of  the  process."Asked  if  the  NRSC  was  getting  involved  in  any  primaries  this  year  and  if  it  could  identify  specific  ways  the  group  was  helping,  spokeswoman  Brook  Hougesen  said,  "As  we  have  said  time  and  again,  any  Republican  candidate  running  for  Senate  is  free  to  use  our  building  as  a  location  for  their  fundraiser,"  Hougesen  wrote  in  an  email.  "This  is  all  information  that  has  been  repeatedly  reported."If  Tillis'  doesn't  beat  his  opponents,  OB-GYN  Greg  Brannon  and  pastor  Mark  Harris,  in  the  May  6  primary,  Democrat  Kay  Hagan's  path  to  reelection  is  thought  to  get  a  lot  easier.A  similar  scenario  is  playing  out  in  Louisiana  where  Democratic  Sen.  Mary  Landrieu  is  in  danger  of  losing  her  seat  in  the  state  that  President  Barack  Obama  lost  by  12  points  in  2012.Conservative  groups,  including  the  SCF,  endorsed  Rob  Maness,  a  candidate  who  announced  that  he  would  not  support  McConnell  as  Republican  leader,  over  well-funded,  establishment-preferred  Republican  Bill  Cassidy.What  changedRepublican  strategist  John  Feehery  said  Republican  incumbents  have  learned  their  lesson  from  difficult  losses  in  the  past  two  election  cycles."I  think  Republicans  have  recruited  better  candidates  and  incumbents  are  taking  this  seriously,"  he  said.The  government  shutdown  over  Obamacare  funding  was  also  a  pivotal  moment  for  the  Republican  Party  as  many  in  the  GOP  thought  it  was  a  pointless  endeavor.After  the  shutdown  ended,  House  Speaker  John  Boehner  said  conservative  groups  like  FreedomWorks,  which  advocated  the  shutdown  strategy,  have  "lost  all  credibility."  And  he  said  in  January  the  shutdown  strategy  was  a  "predictable  disaster."The  shutdown  "hurt  their  standing  and  degraded  some  of  the  leverage  they  had,"  Republican  strategist  and  former  Boehner  spokesman  Kevin  Madden  said.  "That  leverage  has  now  swung  back  toward  McConnell  and  Boehner."Lessons  from  Florida's  special  electionSome  establishment  candidates  are  receiving  an  added  boost.  The  Chamber  of  Commerce,  which  usually  does  not  get  involved  in  primaries,  decided  that  this  year  would  be  different."Our  goal  for  2014  is  to  protect  and  expand  a  pro-business  majority  in  the  House  and  advance  our  position  in  the  Senate.  How  do  we  accomplish  that?  We're  going  early,  often,  and  local,"  the  chamber  wrote  on  its  website.The  chamber  has  backed  McConnell  and  a  series  of  other  races  that  are  seeing  opposition  from  conservative  groups.Feehery  said  McConnell  has  nothing  to  lose  by  going  after  groups  like  the  SCF  who,  he  said,  make  their  money  by  being  "professionally  unhappy.""These  people  have  no  desire  to  find  common  ground.  Nothing  that  Mitch  McConnell  will  do  will  make  these  groups  happy,"  Feehery  said.</TEXT></DOC>

"That  is  politically  and  substantively  a  much  harder  sell  than  the  one  we've  got  --  a  much  harder  sell."Health  care  wars  of  oldWe  now  know  that  the  Clinton  plan  for  employers  to  provide  health  coverage  for  workers  failed  to  pass  back  then,  and  the  individual  mandate  --  requiring  people  to  obtain  health  insurance  --  is  the  foundation  of  the  2010  Obamacare  reforms  passed  by  the  Democratic-controlled  Congress  with  zero  Republican  votes.From  the  same  meeting  with  congressional  Democrats,  Clinton  wrote  that  "it  may  be  an  unpleasant  fact  for  some  of  us  Democrats  to  face,  but  the  argument  is  not  going  to  (be)  won  on  bringing  in  the  uninsured."President  Barack  Obama  and  Democrats  now  face  relentless  criticism  from  Republicans  over  changes  in  policies  and  costs  forced  on  some  consumers  by  the  2010  reforms,  rather  than  the  requirement  that  the  previously  uninsured  get  coverage.  Clinton's  words  from  two  decades  ago  now  sound  prescient."The  argument  is  going  to  be  won,"  she  wrote,  on  keeping  coverage  "for  everybody,  including  those  who  are  insured,  but  may  not  be  next  year  or  the  year  after."In  another  memo  from  1994,  an  aide  to  President  Bill  Clinton  warned  against  using  a  line  in  the  upcoming  State  of  the  Union  address  about  his  administration's  health  care  proposal  that  said:  "You'll  pick  the  health  plan  and  the  doctor  of  your  choice.""This  sounds  great  and  I  know  that  it's  just  what  people  want  to  hear,  but  can  we  get  away  with  it?"  wrote  White  House  Staff  Secretary  Todd  Stern.Noting  that  the  thrust  of  the  Clinton  reforms  was  to  steer  people  toward  "cheaper,  HMO-style  providers,"  Stern  added  that  he  worried  about  "getting  skewered  for  overpromising  here  on  something  we  know  full  well  we  won't  deliver."Today,  Obama  gets  skewered  for  similar  claims  he  made  during  the  health  care  debate  15  years  later  that  turned  out  to  be  exaggerated  or  plain  wrong,  such  as  his  "if  you  like  your  health  care  plan,  you  can  keep  it"  statement  that  earned  him  "Lie  of  the  Year"  by  the  fact-checking  website  PolitiFact.Clinton  OK  with  Obamacare  fixesHillary  Clinton,  the  overwhelming  favorite  for  the  Democratic  presidential  nomination  in  2016,  faces  no  apparent  bombshells  from  the  3,546  pages  of  archival  documents  made  public  Friday.Can  Clinton  tap  Obama's  magic  in  South  Carolina?It  was  the  first  batch  of  more  than  30,000  pages  eligible  for  release  after  a  12-year  waiting  period  under  the  Presidential  Records  Act,  with  more  to  be  made  public  in  March.First  digital  age  presidential  candidate"So  far,  and  underlining  so  far  because  we're  still  going  through  the  documents,  absolutely  nothing"  amounting  to  a  game-changer  for  Clinton,  said  CNN  Chief  National  Correspondent  John  King.  At  the  same  time,  he  noted  Clinton  would  be  the  first  presidential  candidate  of  the  digital  age  with  still  unpublicized  documentation  dating  back  to  her  eight  years  in  the  White  House  as  first  lady."There's  never  been  a  candidate  that  we  think  we  know  so  well,  but  yet  there's  this  huge  resource  of  information  where  we  still  might  learn  things,"  King  said.The  new  documents  showed  a  first  lady  pushed  by  her  aides  to  be  more  open  and  accessible  to  the  public.In  the  1995  memo  by  Press  Secretary  Lisa  Caputo,  suggestions  included  a  guest  appearance  on  the  ABC  TV  show  "Home  Improvement"  and  using  the  then-young  Internet  to  connect  to  young  women,  noting  that  "Internet  has  become  a  very  popular  mode  of  communication."Four  years  later,  adviser  Mandy  Grunwald  offered  "style  pointers"  in  a  memo  for  listening  tour  Clinton  did  after  creating  an  exploratory  committee  for  her  Senate  campaign  in  New  York."Don't  be  defensive.  Look  like  you  want  the  questions.  The  press  is  obviously  watching  to  see  if  they  can  make  you  uncomfortable  or  testy.  Even  on  the  annoying  questions,  give  relaxed  answers,"  Grunwald  wrote.She  also  added  that  Clinton  should  "look  for  opportunities  for  humor"  because  "it's  important  that  people  see  more  sides  of  you,  and  they  often  see  you  only  in  very  stern  situations."Adviser  in  1999:  Try  to  be  funnyGrunwald  also  advised  Clinton  to  avoid  laying  claim  on  the  record  of  her  husband's  administration,  saying  "this  trip  is  about  you,  and  you  are  not  an  incumbent."One  more  tip  from  Grunwald:  be  prepared  to  be  asked  if  she  ever  used  drugs.With  the  potential  for  politically  volatile  details  in  the  documents,  groups  trying  to  bolster  or  harm  Clinton's  possible  presidential  ambitions  made  clear  they  would  be  having  a  look.America  Rising,  a  pro-Republican  opposition  research  shop,  told  CNN  that  "we'll  be  poring  through  them,"  with  a  person  on  ground  in  Arkansas  for  that  purpose.Rubio  on  2016:  Clinton  would  'struggle'Correct  the  Record,  a  pro-Democratic  group  with  deep  ties  to  the  Clinton  family,  also  told  CNN  it  would  have  a  team  going  over  the  new  information.Dem  groups  already  at  work  for  2016Heavy  demand  appeared  to  disable  the  website  of  the  William  J.  Clinton  Presidential  Library  for  some  users  in  the  first  minutes  after  the  documents  were  released  on  Friday  afternoon.In  total,  approximately  25,000  pages  of  new  documents,  including  confidential  communications  between  President  Bill  Clinton  and  his  top  advisers,  will  be  released  over  the  next  two  weeks.  Under  the  Presidential  Records  Act  of  1978,  they  became  eligible  for  release  in  January  2013,  12  years  after  Clinton's  presidency  ended."When  those  restrictions  expired,  (the  National  Archives  and  Records  Administration)  then  provided  notification  of  our  intent  to  disclose  these  Presidential  records  to  the  representatives  of  President  Obama  and  former  President  Clinton  in  accordance  with  Executive  Order  13489,  so  that  they  may  conduct  a  privilege  review  of  the  records,"  the  National  Archives  said  in  a  written  statement.  "As  they  complete  their  review,  NARA  is  able  to  make  the  records  available."More  documents  comingAn  additional  8,000  pages  are  undergoing  a  further  month-long  review  per  a  directive  from  the  White  House  and  will  not  be  available  for  release  prior  to  March  26.The  documents  in  question  were  part  of  files  that  had  been  requested  for  public  release  over  the  years  under  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act,  but  were  withheld  due  to  their  sensitive  nature.While  the  Presidential  Records  Act  established  public  ownership  of  White  House  documents  as  far  back  as  the  Reagan  Administration,  it  defined  six  categories  of  records  that  could  be  withheld  for  the  12-year  period.  They  include  classified  national  security  information,  confidential  business  information  and  trade  secrets,  and  unwarranted  invasions  of  personal  privacy.Documents  pertaining  to  federal  appointments  and  confidential  communications,  so-called  "P2"  and  "P5"  exemptions,  also  fall  under  the  12-year  protection  of  the  act.After  the  12-year  mark  from  the  end  of  a  presidential  administration,  the  records  are  subject  to  the  same  restrictions  as  spelled  out  in  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act,  with  one  key  exception.  Congress  excluded  presidential  records  from  exemptions  based  on  executive  privilege.However,  since  the  passage  of  the  law,  Presidents  Reagan,  George  W.  Bush  and  Barack  Obama  have  each  issued  executive  orders  clarifying  the  process  under  which  an  incumbent  president  or  former  president  could  assert  executive  privilege  to  prevent  the  release  of  documents.The  new  releases  will  not  be  the  first  from  the  Clinton  archives.  The  library  routinely  releases  records  in  response  to  FOIA  requests,  although  a  sizable  backlog  exists.Freedom  of  Information  Act  requestsRecords  were  also  released  during  the  Supreme  Court  nomination  of  Elena  Kagan,  who  worked  as  a  White  House  lawyer  during  the  Clinton  administration,  and  also  as  a  result  of  ongoing  legal  action  from  the  conservative  group  Judicial  Watch.Interest  in  the  often  unglamorous  world  of  archival  research  has  spiked  due  to  the  possible  presidential  candidacy  of  Hillary  Clinton,  a  former  U.S.  senator  from  New  York  and  secretary  of  state  in  Obama's  first  term.Earlier  this  month,  CNN  reviewed  papers  from  a  former  confidante  of  the  Clintons,  Diane  Blair,  that  offered  some  revealing  personal  glimpses  of  Hillary  Clinton  during  her  years  as  first  lady.Blair  was  counselor,  friend  for  Hillary  ClintonCNN  document  reader:  Read  from  the  Blair  papersCNN's  Erin  McPike,Todd  Sperry,  Bill  Mears,  Rachel  Streitfeld,  Zachary  Wolff,  Emily  Rust,  Dan  Merica  and  Paul  Steinhauser  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

With  the  exception  of  husbands  and  wives,  and  parents  and  their  children  younger  than  13,  airlines  flying  into  the  United  States  from  certain  countries  have  to  screen  travelers  individually  under  TSA  rules.That  appears  to  be  changing.  The  TSA  is  updating  its  language,  an  agency  spokesman  confirmed  Thursday.Because  they  were  not  a  heterosexual  married  couple,  American  Airlines  agents  refused  to  screen  Zapata  and  Carter  together  before  issuing  their  boarding  passes,  Carter  said.  One  rudely  ordered  Zapata  back  in  line,  Carter  said."We  knew  this  had  happened  to  another  couple  but  didn't  believe  it  could  happen  to  us,"  said  Carter,  a  partner  at  the  New  York  law  office  of  Arent  Fox.American  Airlines  confirmed  the  two  men  were  screened  separately.  Employees  were  following  TSA  security  rules,  said  Bob  Witeck,  president  of  Witeck  Communications,  who  consults  with  American  on  LGBT  issues.Within  hours  of  the  incident,  the  couple  took  to  Twitter  and  Facebook  to  report  the  incident.  Carter  also  contacted  the  White  House  LGBT  liaison  and  two  members  of  Congress  to  ask  the  TSA  to  update  its  airline  screening  questions."TSA  is  working  to  make  clear  any  confusion  in  language  included  in  the  Aircraft  Operator  Standard  Security  Program  document,"  wrote  a  TSA  spokesman,  via  e-mail.  "TSA  policy  is  for  every  attempt  to  be  made  to  accommodate  all  families  traveling  together."  The  agency  declined  to  discuss  any  more  specifics  of  its  security  procedures."I'm  thrilled  how  quickly  people  decided  this  is  wrong,"  said  Carter.  "It's  a  sign  of  the  times  that  American  executives  at  the  corporate  level  wanted  to  stamp  this  out  fast."The  change  appears  to  be  immediate  at  American  Airlines,  Carter  said,  citing  an  e-mail  he  received  from  an  airline  lawyer:  "TSA  has  communicated  to  our  Corporate  Security  folks  that  they  are  working  on  a  technical  change  to  its  directive,  and  that,  pending  that  change,  we  can  immediately  begin  screening  same-sex  spouses  together.  We  are  working  on  communicating  this  change  in  procedures  to  our  stations  ASAP."American  is  happy  to  implement  the  TSA  change,  said  Witeck."For  two  decades,  American  Airlines  has  been  a  leader  in  LGBT  equality,  and  now  with  DOMA's  repeal,  outdated  rules  that  treat  married  couples  differently  can  come  tumbling  down,"  said  Witeck.  "A  seemingly  small  but  crucial  equality  milestone  for  all  travelers."It  won't  be  too  long  before  Carter  and  Zapata  will  test  the  change.  They  have  a  second  home  in  Colombia,  and  they're  flying  back  in  March  for  a  wedding."I  expect  us  to  be  treated  like  every  other  legally  married  couple,"  said  Carter.  "When  they  ask,  'Why  are  you  together?'  I  will  say,  'We're  legally  married.'  We  expect  them  to  give  us  our  boarding  passes,  and  we'll  move  on."</TEXT></DOC>

"This  was  a  team  effort  on  the  part  of  the  attorneys  currently  representing  Michelle,  and  we  believe  that  the  court  reached  a  just  and  fair  result  under  the  facts  presented  in  this  case."Byrom  has  been  on  death  row  since  her  2000  conviction  for  capital  murder.  The  57-year-old  woman  was  convicted  of  being  the  mastermind  of  a  murder-for-hire  plot  to  kill  her  allegedly  abusive  husband,  a  killing  her  son  had  admitted  to  committing  in  several  jailhouse  letters  and,  according  to  court  documents,  in  an  interview  with  a  court-appointed  psychologist.He  recanted  when  he  was  put  on  the  stand,  according  to  court  records.Attorney  General  Jim  Hood,  who  had  requested  Byrom's  execution,  said  Monday  his  office  would  seek  the  court's  reasoning  for  the  reversal."While  we  respect  the  Mississippi  Supreme  Court's  decision,  it  is  important  that  the  trial  court  know  and  understand  the  specific  errors  that  were  found  by  the  justices  so  that  the  lower  court  knows  the  best  way  to  proceed,"  he  said.  "Our  citizens  can  once  again  take  comfort  in  the  fact  that  we  have  a  legal  system  that  works  for  all  parties  involved."The  Supreme  Court  opinion  noted  that  the  decision  "is  extraordinary  and  extremely  rare  in  the  context  of  a  petition  for  leave  to  pursue  post-conviction  relief."Oliver  Diaz,  the  former  presiding  justice  of  the  Supreme  Court,  called  the  opinion  "actually  kinda  amazing,"  from  the  order  for  a  new  trial  to  the  ruling's  release  on  a  Monday  instead  of  a  Thursday,  as  usual."The  lawyers  filed  a  last  ditch  motion  for  additional  post  conviction  relief.  These  are  almost  never  granted.  Defendants  are  limited  to  a  single  post  conviction  motion,"  he  wrote  in  an  e-mail  to  CNN.  "It  is  extremely  rare  to  grant  and  send  back  for  a  new  trial."The  court  further  instructed  that  a  different  judge  should  be  assigned  to  Byrom's  new  trial.Circuit  Judge  Thomas  J.  Gardner,  who  imposed  the  death  sentence  on  Byrom  after  her  conviction,  declined  to  comment  to  CNN,  saying,  "The  matter  is  ongoing."Diaz  also  said  the  order  for  a  new  judge  was  extraordinary."Also,  taking  the  step  of  removing  the  original  trial  judge  is  very  unusual  as  well,"  he  wrote.Hood,  the  attorney  general,  had  requested  that  Byrom  be  executed  "on  or  before  (the  date  of)  March  27,"  but  the  Mississippi  Supreme  Court,  which  has  the  final  say  on  execution  dates,  denied  Hood's  request.During  Michelle  Byrom's  original  trial,  prosecutors  said  she  plotted  to  kill  her  husband,  who  was  fatally  shot  in  his  home  in  Iuka,  Mississippi,  in  1999  while  Michelle  was  in  the  hospital  receiving  treatment  for  double  pneumonia.  A  jury  convicted  her  based  on  evidence  and  testimony  alleging  that  she  was  the  mastermind  of  the  plot.Byrom  Jr.  admitted  in  jailhouse  letters  that  he  had  committed  the  crime  on  his  own  after  growing  tired  of  his  father's  physical  and  verbal  abuse,  and  a  court-appointed  psychologist  has  said  that  Byrom  Jr.  told  him  a  similar  story.On  the  stand,  Byrom  Jr.  pinned  the  slaying  on  one  of  his  friends,  whom  he  said  his  mother  had  hired  for  $15,000.Following  her  attorney's  advice,  Michelle  Byrom  waived  her  right  to  a  jury  sentencing,  allowing  the  judge  to  decide  her  fate.  He  sentenced  her  to  death.Prior  to  Monday's  ruling,  Michelle  Byrom's  defense  attorneys  had  filed  a  motion  asking  the  court  for  additional  discovery  so  the  alleged  confession  to  the  court-appointed  psychologist  could  be  fully  explored.The  defense  attorneys  also  want  to  depose  the  prosecutor  from  her  trial,  Arch  Bullard,  regarding  his  knowledge  of  Byrom  Jr.'s  alleged  confession  to  the  psychologist.Bullard  has  told  CNN  that  he  firmly  believes  Michelle  Byrom  was  the  mastermind  of  the  murder-for-hire  plot.</TEXT></DOC>

The  ride  is  over  in  just  four  minutes,  at  which  point  visitors  can  make  their  way  out  to  marvel  at  how  tiny  the  mighty  Mississippi  River  and  all  of  those  cars  below  appear.How  to  ride:  Skip  long  lines  by  buying  tickets  online  or  over  the  phone.  11  North  4th  St.,  877/982-1410,  stlouisarch.com,  $10  for  adults,  $5  for  children  ages  3-15.Ferris  wheels  you  have  to  see  to  believeThe  Falkirk  Wheel,  Falkirk,  ScotlandImagine  boarding  an  elevator...in  a  boat.  It's  not  as  crazy  as  it  sounds.  The  Falkirk  Wheel  is  exactly  that  --  a  lift  for  boats  --  and  it  serves  a  very  practical  purpose.  It  opened  in  2002,  the  long-awaited  answer  to  the  question  of  how  to  link  two  canals  whose  inconvenient,  lock-ridden  connection  had  been  severed  nearly  70  years  earlier.Not  surprisingly,  the  lift  has  become  a  popular  attraction,  with  50-minute  gondola  tours  that  traverse  both  canals  and  include  two  rides,  up  and  down,  on  the  elevator.  At  the  zenith  of  the  Wheel's  rotation,  visitors  can  see  as  far  as  two  miles  outside  of  Falkirk  proper  and  marvel  at  both  the  bucolic  countryside  and  the  115-foot  tall  contraption  swooping  them  gently  through  the  air.How  to  ride:  Due  to  the  popularity  of  the  Wheel,  pre-booking  tickets  online  or  over  the  phone  is  recommended.  Check  the  weather  beforehand  --  clear  days  will  yield  the  best  views  of  these  pastoral  scenes.  Lime  Rd.,  Tamfourhill,  011-44/8700-500208,  www.thefalkirkwheel.co.uk,  $12.25  for  adults,  $7.75  for  children  3-15.7  beautiful  cable  car  rides  around  the  worldAquaDom,  Berlin,  GermanyIt  resides  in  the  lobby  of  Berlin's  Radisson  Blu  Hotel,  but  the  AquaDom  goes  where  few  hotel  elevators  have  ever  dared  venture:  the  middle  of  the  sea  (or  close  enough,  anyway).  A  lift  rising  through  the  hollow  center  of  a  cylindrical,  82-foot  tall  aquarium  transports  visitors  through  a  full  panorama  of  tropical  sea  life.Fish  festooned  with  vibrant  colors  nibble  at  the  aquarium  wall  inches  from  their  human  admirers.  Almost  a  hundred  different  species,  including  blow  fish,  silver  moonfish  and  humphead  wrasse,  are  represented  in  the  tank,  which  holds  over  a  million  liters  of  water  and  is  the  largest  cylindrical  tank  aquarium  in  the  world.  The  ride  is  decidedly  leisurely  --  perfect  for  reveling  in  the  sensation  of  floating  in  an  underwater  wonderland.Beach  photos  that'll  make  you  droolHow  to  ride:  The  AquaDom  is  one  attraction  in  Sea  Life,  an  aquarium  complex  within  the  same  property  as  the  hotel.

The  elevator  opened  in  1905  as  an  addition  to  the  Bürgenstock  Resort  and  its  birds-eye  views  of  the  rugged  Alps  and  Lucerne's  blue  waters  have  been  wowing  visitors  ever  since.The  years  have  done  nothing  to  diminish  its  impact  --  the  499-foot,  48-second  ride  is  still  the  tallest  outdoor  lift  in  Europe.  And  while  the  structure's  spiderweb  latticework  might  seem  precarious,  the  engineers  behind  the  project  clearly  knew  what  they  were  doing  because  the  lift  has  stood  the  test  of  time.  Today,  modern  cars  traverse  the  distance  at  a  brisk  speed  of  10  feet  per  second,  making  this  hotel  elevator  a  legitimate  thrill  ride.  Ready  for  liftoff?How  to  ride:  The  lift  shuts  down  for  the  winter  months,  so  plan  your  visit  between  mid-May  and  mid-October.  It  stays  open  late  on  Saturdays  in  summer,  making  it  the  perfect  venue  for  enjoying  a  sunset.  Bürgenstock  Resort,  Obbürgen,  011-41/612-9090,  buergenstock.ch,  tickets  are  $14  for  adults,  $7  for  children  6-16.10  best  budget  destinations  for  2014SkyView,  Stockholm,  SwedenThere  is  no  better  way  to  take  in  the  sights  of  Stockholm  than  a  ride  along  the  Ericsson  Globe.  Gondolas  attached  to  a  track  run  along  to  the  exterior  of  this  spherical  structure  (361  feet  in  diameter).  The  glass  lifts  trace  a  twenty-minute  curve  to  the  very  top  of  the  orb  and  back  down,  giving  visitors  a  constantly  evolving  panorama  of  the  city's  skyline.  The  only  downside  is  that  it  doesn't  give  you  a  view  of  the  Globe  itself;  the  clean,  white  structure  dotted  with  porthole  windows  is  one  of  Stockholm's  most  striking  landmarks.How  to  ride:  There  are  only  two  gondolas  for  the  popular  ride,  so  reserve  your  spot  online  in  advance  to  ensure  a  seat.  2  Globentorget,  011-46/771-811-000,  globearenas.se,  tickets  are  $22  for  adults,  $15  for  children  3-12.Lloyd's  Building,  London,  EnglandThe  Lloyd's  of  London  building  on  Lime  Street  was  designed  inside  out,  thrilling  passersby  with  massive  piping  curving  around  the  exterior.  The  twelve  glass  elevators  are  outside  as  well,  gliding  smoothly  up  the  side  of  the  building.  They  might  not  be  the  fastest  or  the  tallest,  but  for  these  lifts,  it's  all  about  the  view.The  Thames  River  is  only  a  quarter  mile  away  and  some  of  London's  other  eminent  sights  --  including  the  spire  at  St.  Paul's  from  one  side  of  the  building,  and  the  celebrated  Gherkin  from  another  --  are  even  closer,  making  a  30-second  trip  up  those  crystal  pods  one  of  the  best  ways  to  savor  the  city.How  to  ride:  This  one  will  be  the  hardest  to  check  off  the  list:  Lloyd's  lifts  are  only  open  to  employees  and  official  visitors  and  security  is  tight.  But  don't  give  up  hope.  The  building  is  usually  included  in  London's  annual  Open  House,  when  the  public  gets  free  access  and  tours  to  places  normally  off-limits.  One  Lime  St.,  011-44/20-7327-1000,  lloyds.com,  free  during  London's  Open  House,  September  20  and  21,  2014.Taipei  101,  Taipei,  TaiwanTearing  along  at  almost  forty  miles  per  hour,  the  tower's  lifts  reach  the  89th-floor  observatory  in  just  37  seconds,  leaving  riders  well  over  a  thousand  feet  above  the  city.  From  this  viewpoint,  every  corner  of  the  sprawling  metropolis  is  tiny  by  sheer  distance.  Parks,  temples,  and  even  other  skyscrapers  and  distant  mountains  are  practically  Lilliputian.  And  the  journey  is  only  half  over  --  the  stomach-dropping  return  trip  is  just  as  thrilling.How  to  ride:  The  ticket  office  is  found  on  the  tower's  fifth  floor.  Tickets  are  only  sold  on-site,  so  be  prepared  to  wait  in  line.  7  Hsin  Yi  Rd.,  Sec.  5,  011-866/2-8101-8899,  www.taipei-101.com.tw,  tickets  are  $13  for  adults,  $12.35  for  children  under  12.Luxor  Inclinator,  Las  Vegas,  NevadaDon't  call  it  an  elevator.  The  Luxor's  "inclinators"  transport  guests  up  the  side  of  the  hotel's  iconic  pyramid  at  a  sharp  39-degree  angle.  Unlike  others  on  this  list,  the  cars  lack  observation  windows,  and  they  can't  compete  with  other  famed  elevators  in  height  (they  only  span  30  floors).But  like  so  much  of  Las  Vegas,  the  inclinators  are  all  about  standing  apart  from  the  crowd.  There  are  also  great  views  from  the  top  floors  of  the  faux  Egyptian  universe  below,  especially  at  night,  when  the  decadent  lights  of  the  lobby  flash  to  life.How  to  ride:  Access  to  the  Luxor's  higher  floors  via  the  inclinators  is  restricted  to  guests,  so  the  best  way  to  take  a  ride  is  to  spend  the  night  at  the  4,400-room  hotel.  3900  Las  Vegas  Blvd.  South,  702/262-4444,  luxor.com,  from  $89  per  night.Long  Island  City  Business  Center,  Queens,  New  YorkFor  most  of  the  lifts  on  this  list,  the  thrill  comes  from  the  view  outside  the  walls.  But  for  this  elevator,  it's  all  about  the  view  inside.  Don't  be  fooled  by  the  building's  businesslike  façade  or  its  no-nonsense  entryway.  A  psychedelic  scene  awaits  behind  the  deceptively  unadorned  doors  of  the  elevator  near  a  small  entrance  on  31st  Street.The  one-of-a-kind  interior  is  painted  with  the  massive,  twisted  visage  of  a  grinning  dragon  with  grotesque  3-D  beasts  bursting  from  its  eye  sockets.  The  effects  are  striking  (made  even  more  disorienting  by  the  small  fish-eye  mirror  on  the  back  wall).  The  journey  up  the  building's  six  floors  is  quite  a  trip,  indeed.How  to  ride:  Anyone  who  works  in  the  building  should  be  able  to  point  the  way.  30-30  47th  Ave.,  Long  Island  City,  free,  if  you  can  get  to  it.Mercedes-Benz  Museum,  Stuttgart,  GermanyWith  their  stark,  curving  metallic  exteriors  and  glowing  visor-shaped  windows,  the  elevators  at  the  Mercedes-Benz  Museum  in  Stuttgart  are  as  much  fun  to  watch  rise  and  fall  along  tracks  in  the  museum's  atrium  as  they  are  to  ride.  The  trip  only  takes  about  30  seconds  so  feel  free  to  ride  multiple  times.  You  might  want  to  pop  off  every  once  in  a  while  to  see  the  exhibits  covering  125  years  of  motoring  landmarks  --  and  to  see  the  inspiration  behind  the  elevators'  uber-modern  look.How  to  ride:  The  museum  itself  is  worth  a  visit,  but  if  you  are  really  just  there  for  the  elevators  (and  we  wouldn't  blame  you),  tickets  are  half  price  between  4:30  p.m.  and  when  the  ticket  booth  closes  at  5  p.m.  (the  museum  is  open  until  6  p.m.).  100  Mercedesstrasse,  011-49/711-17-30-000,  mercedes-benz-classic.com,  half  price  tickets  are  $5.15  for  adults,  $2.60  for  teens  15  to  17  after  4:30  p.m.Sky  Tower,  Auckland,  New  ZealandThe  view  from  this  tower's  observation  level  (610  feet  in  the  air)  is  impressive  for  sure,  but  watching  it  unfold  in  front  of  you  on  the  40-second  ride  up  is  even  more  magical.  The  glass-fronted  elevators  have  views  of  the  harbor  and  Auckland's  modest  cityscape,  as  well  as  the  green  countryside  unfurling  like  a  quilt  in  the  far  distance.If  you  can  tear  your  eyes  away  from  the  view  out  the  sides,  look  down  through  the  glass  floor  for  the  extra  thrill  of  seeing  the  ground  speed  away  from  you  --  and  come  rushing  back  towards  you  on  the  descent.How  to  ride:  There  is  a  free  SkyCity  shuttle  bus  to  the  Sky  Tower  that  picks  up  at  several  points  around  central  Auckland,  including  the  Maritime  Museum  and  the  Waterloo  Quadrant.  Corner  of  Victoria  and  Federal  Sts.,  011-64/800-759-2489,  skycityauckland.co.nz,  tickets  are  $23.50  for  adults,  $9  for  children  6-14.Get  the  best  travel  deals  and  tips  emailed  to  you  FREE  -  CLICK  HERE!Copyright  ©  2011  Newsweek  Budget  Travel,  Inc.,  all  rights  reserved.</TEXT></DOC>

Follow  her  on  Twitter  @sallykohn.  The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  the  author.(CNN)  --  On  Wednesday,  April  2,  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  ruled  that  any  cap  on  the  overall  amount  a  person  can  spend  to  influence  an  election  is  unconstitutional.  Following  on  the  heels  of  the  court's  previous  decision  in  Citizens  United,  the  McCutcheon  ruling  will  allow  unlimited  spending  to  influence  our  nation's  political  process.In  the  words  of  Justice  Stephen  Breyer,  who  wrote  the  dissent  in  the  McCutcheon  case,  the  ruling  "eviscerates  our  nation's  campaign  finance  laws,  leaving  a  remnant  incapable  of  dealing  with  the  grave  problems  of  democratic  legitimacy  that  those  laws  were  intended  to  resolve."You  shouldn't  need  money  or  connections  to  get  a  fair  shake  in  our  justice  system.  That's  the  very  essence  of  our  American  creed.  And  yet  we  know  that  even  with  previous  restrictions,  money  had  a  corrupting  influence  on  our  democracy.  A  Federal  Election  Survey  found  that  82%  of  Americans  were  worried  about  special  interests  buying  elections.  Three  in  five  Americans  thought  Congress  was  already  more  likely  to  vote  in  ways  that  please  their  financial  supporters,  while  only  one  in  five  Americans  thought  Congress  votes  in  the  best  interest  of  constituents.Several  studies  find  money  gives  you  access  to  members  of  Congress  and  their  staff:  Contributors  have  disproportionately  better  access.  And  these  studies  were  conducted  before  the  McCutcheon  decision,  when  the  total  donations  to  candidates,  parties  or  PACs  within  an  election  cycle  were  still  limited  at  a  whopping  $123,000.This  decision  benefits  those  who  have  that  kind  of  money,  not  the  everyday  campaign  contributor.  The  court  upheld  the  law  that  puts  a  $5,200  cap  on  conventional  individual  contributions  to  a  single  candidate.But  without  the  $123,000  overall  limit,  imagine  how  much  worse  it  will  be  when  a  single  wealthy  donor  can  contribute  $3.5  million  to  a  political  party  and  its  candidates.  What  we  have  politely  called  "influence"  up  until  now  will  become  nothing  short  of  bribery.It's  hard  enough  to  get  the  people's  will  through  Congress  as  is.  As  is,  90%  of  Americans  want  stronger  gun  safety  laws  and  yet  gun-industry  political  contributions  hobble  legislative  momentum.And  72%  of  voters  want  to  raise  the  minimum  wage  --  including  a  majority  of  Republicans  --  but  campaign  spending  and  lobbying  by  the  low-wage  fast  food  and  retail  industry  is  stymieing  progress  in  Congress  there  as  well.More  than  half  of  Americans  want  the  federal  government  to  limit  power  plant  emissions  and  take  other  steps  to  curb  climate  change,  moves  opposed  by  the  wealthy  —  and  politically  generous  —  oil  and  gas  industry.  On  issue  after  issue  after  issue,  the  will  of  the  American  people  is  already  up  against  the  often-insurmountable  obstacles  created  by  well-heeled  corporations  armed  with  campaign  contributions.  And  now  it's  just  going  to  get  worse.  An  analysis  by  the  organization  Demos  found  that  the  McCutcheon  ruling  could  release  more  than  $1  billion  in  additional  election  spending  from  wealthy  donors  through  2020.The  community  activist  group  CREDO  Action  has  launched  a  campaign  to  send  NASCAR-like  judge  robes  covered  in  corporate  sponsorship  logos  to  the  five  Supreme  Court  justices  who  voted  for  Citizens  United  and  now  the  McCutcheon  decision.  Instead  of  protecting  the  marginalized  and  disenfranchised  in  America,  the  five  conservative  justices  have  manipulated  our  Constitution  to  create  new  rights  and  give  even  more  power  to  our  nation's  wealthiest  individuals  and  corporations.In  1816,  Thomas  Jefferson  wrote,  "I  hope  that  we  shall  crush  in  its  birth  the  aristocracy  of  our  monied  corporations,  which  dare  already  to  challenge  our  government  to  a  trial  of  strength,  and  bid  defiance  to  the  laws  of  our  country."  But  rather,  thanks  in  part  to  the  Supreme  Court  ruling  in  McCutcheon,  it  is  now  we  the  people  who  have  been  definitively  crushed.  As  has  our  democracy.Follow  @CNNOpinion  on  TwitterJoin  us  at  Facebook/CNNOpinion</TEXT></DOC>

The  pop  star  has  been  under  investigation  for  alleged  involvement  in  a  January  9  egg  attack  on  a  neighbor's  home  --  one  that  caused  an  estimated  $20,000  in  damages  --  but  you  wouldn't  know  it  from  his  tweets.After  police  raided  his  Calabasas,  California,  home  and  seized  his  security  footage  and  iPhone,  Bieber  was  on  Instagram  sharing  photos  of  a  snowy  vacation  with  friends.His  carefree  attitude  was  emphasized  in  an  Instagram  post  he  captioned,  "worried  about  nothing.'"While  the  media  has  been  running  in  circles  over  allegations  ranging  from  drug  abuse  to  public  urination,  Bieber's  social  life  --  at  least  as  depicted  on  his  social  media  accounts  --  never  faltered.Here's  a  breakdown  of  how  Bieber's  been  spending  his  free  time  in  the  days  leading  up  to  his  arrest:Getting  new  inkBiebs  has  gotten  so  many  tattoos  that  they  can  make  up  their  own  guide.  On  January  12  he  shared  a  photo  of  a  freshly  inked  compass  --  maybe  he  was  feeling  a  little  lost.SnowboardingFor  the  past  week,  we've  heard  little  from  Bieber  that  didn't  include  him  hanging  out  with  friends.  Word  has  it  that  the  star  has  been  thoroughly  enjoying  his  break  from  concerts  and  work  commitments.Lounging  (sometimes  shirtless,  because  why  not?)Nothing  says  wealth  like  a  near-empty  chest  of  drawers  and  a  selfie  taken  in  slippers  --  at  least,  that's  how  we're  interpreting  this  Instagram  post  from  five  days  ago.  Or  maybe  he's  trying  to  signal  that  his  shorts  were  hanging  a  little  low  because  of  all  the  cash  in  his  pockets?  The  prior  shirtless  snapshot  is  a  little  easier  to  figure  out  --  the  kid  is  always  thinking  of  his  fans.Pranking  friendsNo  one  knows  whether  it's  Bieber's  butt  that's  mooning  a  snoozing  Lil  Za  --  one  of  Bieb's  regular  pals  --  or  someone  else's,  but  he  did  feel  comfortable  sharing  the  bro  prank  with  the  world.Smoking  Cuban  cigars  and  shooting  hoopsWe  know  that  Bieber  flew  down  to  Miami  on  a  Monday,  and  the  reports  of  what  he's  being  doing  there  --  aside  from  his  recent  arrest  --  include  spending  $75,000  in  a  strip  club.  Bieber  hasn't  confirmed  that  bit  of  gossip,  but  we  do  know  he's  recently  lit  up  at  least  one  Cuban  cigar  and  been  to  Lil  Wayne's  Miami-area  skate  park.TaggingJustin  Bieber's  love  for  graffiti  art  has  only  increased  in  recent  years  --  and  sometimes  it  gets  him  into  trouble.  Yet  it  wasn't  tagging  his  initials  that  got  him  popped  by  the  cops  in  Miami  ...Cruising  in  a  LamborghiniWe  all  know  how  this  turned  out.  But  before  the  police  arrived,  Bieber  and  his  car  companion  --  who's  been  identified  as  model  Chantel  Jeffries  --  were  captured  enjoying  a  night  drive,  an  image  shared  on  Bieber's  friend  Khalil's  Instagram  account.All  of  which  leads  up  to  the  early  hours  of  January  23,  when  Bieber  was  arrested  on  charges  of  drunken  driving,  resisting  arrest  and  driving  without  a  valid  license.Obviously,  given  the  circumstances,  we  can  imagine  that  the  star  won't  be  sharing  any  Twitter  updates  for  a  while.</TEXT></DOC>

No,  he  hadn't  pinned  her  down,  or  threatened  violence.  But  Espinosa  insists  that  he  coerced  her,  psychologically  and  physically,  into  having  sex  against  her  will  for  most  of  their  three-year  relationship.  She  resisted,  told  him  no,  pushed  him  away.  More  often  than  not,  he  persisted  and  she  gave  in  "just  to  get  it  over  with,"  she  says."I  knew  that  it  was  sexual  assault,  but  at  the  time,  I  felt  extreme  shame  and  was  not  ready  nor  willing  to  fully  accept  what  was  happening,"  said  Espinosa,  24.  "Like  most  unpleasant  truths,  I  buried  it  until  the  end  of  my  relationship,  when  I  realized  I  was  holding  onto  a  relationship  with  a  man  who  was  abusive."The  relationship  came  to  an  end  in  February  2013.  The  next  month,  Espinosa  filed  a  sexual  harassment  claim  against  her  former  boyfriend  with  her  school,  the  University  of  Texas-Pan  American,  where  some  of  the  incidents  occurred.She  says  she  went  to  the  school  first  because  she  thought  that  without  concrete  evidence  law  enforcement  would  not  take  her  seriously  --  a  common  experience  among  people  who  report  rape  to  law  enforcement,  experts  say.  Besides,  she  knew  that  colleges  and  universities  are  federally  mandated  to  investigate  sexual  violence  under  Title  IX,  a  federal  civil  rights  law  that  guarantees  students  the  right  to  an  education  free  of  sexual  violence,  which  is  considered  a  form  of  discrimination.Indeed,  when  she  went  to  the  city  of  Edinburg  Police  Department  a  few  days  later,  she  says  they  told  her  that  her  case  would  be  difficult  to  prove  and  took  her  phone  number.  She  never  heard  back  from  them,  she  says.Her  experience  with  UTPA  administrators  was  no  better,  she  says.  At  various  stages  of  the  investigation,  they  questioned  why  she  did  not  come  forward  sooner  with  the  abuse  claims,  suggesting  she  was  acting  out  as  a  spiteful  ex-girlfriend.  In  one  meeting,  she  says,  administrators  asked  whether  their  relationship  was  "Facebook  official"  or  whether  there  was  a  "promise  of  marriage."It  took  five  months  for  school  administrators  to  reach  the  conclusion  that  Espinosa's  complaint  was  "unsubstantiated."  They  did,  however,  conclude  her  ex-boyfriend  abused  his  access  to  university  facilities,  and  placed  him  on  disciplinary  probation  for  the  remainder  of  his  academic  career,  according  to  documents  provided  by  Espinosa.Espinosa's  voice  quivers  as  she  recalls  the  ordeal,  which  led  her  in  2013  to  drop  one  class  in  the  first  summer  session  and  request  an  incomplete  in  the  second.It  was  a  punch  in  the  gut  after  sleepless  nights  and  constant  self-doubt,  she  said.  She  believes  the  school  violated  her  civil  rights  by  mishandling  the  complaint  and  creating  a  sexually  hostile  environment.This  week,  Espinosa  filed  a  complaint  with  the  Department  of  Education's  Office  of  Civil  Rights  alleging  violations  of  Title  IX.A  UTPA  spokeswoman  said  the  school  had  not  seen  Espinosa's  complaint,  but  noted  the  school  does  not  comment  on  pending  investigations.Espinosa's  complaint  makes  UTPA  the  latest  school  to  face  criticism  for  its  handling  of  a  sexual  assault  report.  So  far  in  fiscal  year  2014,  the  Department  of  Education's  Office  of  Civil  Rights  says  it  has  received  16  complaints  that  included  Title  IX  allegations  specifically  related  to  sexual  violence.Those  numbers  come  on  the  heels  of  a  marked  year-to-year  increase  in  complaints  the  department  received,  from  17  in  2012  to  30  in  2013.The  U.S.  Department  of  Education  laid  out  minimal  requirements  in  a  2011  "Dear  Colleague"  letter  for  schools  to  follow  in  responding  to  reports  of  sexual  harassment,  or  risk  loss  of  federal  funding.The  19-page  letter  reminded  schools  that  under  Title  IX,  which  prohibits  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  sex,  colleges  and  universities  must  apply  a  "preponderance  of  evidence"  standard  to  reviewing  rape  cases,  which  means  they  must  operate  under  the  assumption  that  "more  likely  than  not  that  sexual  violence  occurred."Now,  many  are  under  scrutiny  from  the  federal  government.  The  U.S.  Department  of  Education's  Office  of  Civil  Rights  has  35  pending  Title  IX  investigations  involving  allegations  of  sexual  violence  at  schools  such  as  the  University  of  North  Carolina,  Princeton,  Harvard,  Swarthmore,  the  University  of  Southern  California,  Dartmouth  and  Occidental,  a  Department  of  Education  spokesman  told  CNN.Rape  is  a  longstanding  issue  on  college  campuses,  but  the  latest  movement,  led  by  student  activists,  survivors  and  faculty,  recasts  sexual  violence  as  a  cultural  problem  on  campuses  nationwide  --  not  just  a  series  of  isolated  incidents.Students  are  taking  matters  into  their  own  hands,  filing  complaints  en  masse  and  speaking  out  publicly.They've  flocked  to  advocacy  groups  such  as  End  Rape  on  Campus  and  Know  Your  IX,  which  sprang  from  grassroots  activism  around  university  handling  --  or  mishandling  --  of  sexual  violence.President  Barack  Obama  recently  called  the  nationwide,  student-led  movement  a  catalyst  for  a  federal  task  force  to  protect  college  students  from  sexual  violence  on  campus.The  bravery  of  students  who've  spoken  out  --  and  their  ability  to  connect  to  each  other  through  social  media  --  has  sparked  a  paradigm  shift  on  campuses,  said  Gina  Smith,  an  attorney  who  has  consulted  with  schools  around  the  country  on  sexual  assault  policy."What  we're  seeing  is  a  demand  that  schools  treat  complainants  with  compassion,"  Smith  said.  "Schools  are  stepping  up  and  taking  notice."From  one  campus  to  the  next,  the  concerns  are  mostly  the  same,  said  sexual  assault  policy  consultant  Leslie  Gomez:  lack  of  clarity,  students  being  mistreated,  complex  procedures  and  insufficient  training  among  those  leading  the  processes.When  evidence  goes  viralAt  the  UTPA,  Espinosa  appealed  the  decision  in  her  case,  but  the  administration  upheld  it.  She  reached  out  to  advocacy  group  End  Rape  on  Campus,  and  a  member  of  the  group  helped  her  file  a  complaint  with  the  federal  Office  of  Civil  Rights."I'm  not  sure  I  would've  come  forward  if  all  these  people  hadn't  done  it  before  me,"  Espinosa  said.  "I  needed  the  validation.  I  needed  someone  to  confirm,  'You're  right  you're  not  blowing  things  out  of  proportion."It  was  a  relief  to  hear  someone  tell  me,  'You  have  a  case,  and  they  shouldn't  treat  you  this  way.'"Here  are  just  some  of  the  students  and  activists  trying  to  change  the  way  their  schools  handle  sexual  violence  --  for  good.  CNN  does  not  name  survivors  of  sexual  assault,  but  is  doing  so  in  this  case  because  these  people,  including  Espinosa,  chose  to  come  forward  in  the  hopes  of  holding  their  schools  accountable  and  encouraging  others  to  speak  up.Sarah  O'Brien,  Vanderbilt  UniversityDespite  an  ongoing,  high-profile  rape  case  involving  four  football  players,  Nashville's  Vanderbilt  University  community  hasn't  exactly  rallied  to  change  campus  culture,  alumna  Sarah  O'Brien,  22,  said.  But  that  hasn't  stopped  O'Brien  and  others  from  working  with  administrators  to  clarify  the  school's  policies  around  sexual  violence,  and  raise  awareness  of  how  the  school  can  help."Our  campus  is  not  liberal  and  it's  not  activist,  so  when  a  group  of  students  come  together  around  an  issue  it  stands  out,"  says  O'Brien,  who  graduated  from  Vanderbilt  in  December.In  2010,  an  acquaintance  raped  her  while  she  was  drunk,  she  said.  A  series  of  frustrating  encounters  with  school  administrators  led  O'Brien  to  come  out  publicly  as  a  rape  survivor  in  fall  2012.One  administrator  attributed  her  PTSD  to  the  stress  of  being  a  student  athlete;  another  told  her  a  statute  of  limitations  prevented  her  from  reporting  the  rape.She  later  found  that  Title  IX  gave  her  the  option  of  seeking  academic  leniencies  due  to  her  PTSD  diagnosis,  but  such  provisions  were  not  laid  out  Vanderbilt's  policy,  she  said."I  just  felt  that  university  failed  me  in  a  lot  of  ways,"  O'Brien  said.  "As  I  started  talking  to  other  women  [at  Vanderbilt],  it  became  a  common  complaint."After  going  public,  she  organized  a  Take  Back  the  Night  event  and  began  working  with  student  athletes  and  survivors.  She  reached  out  to  Know  Your  IX's  founders,  culminating  in  a  complaint  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Education  accusing  Vanderbilt  of  violating  of  Title  IX  and  the  Clery  Act,  a  federal  law  that  requires  public  disclosure  of  crimes  on  campus.The  same  month,  campus  group  Vanderbilt  Students  of  Nonviolence  delivered  an  11-page  list  of  demands.  Students  asked  the  school  for  a  single  office  focused  on  sexual  assault  prevention  and  treatment;  a  website  that  pulls  together  all  campus  resources  and  protections  afforded  under  Title  IX;  posters  around  campus  discouraging  sexual  violence;  inclusion  of  students  on  boards  related  to  campus  life  and  sexual  assault  policies;  and  more  training  in  sexual  assault  prevention  for  people  on  those  committees.It's  what  O'Brien  looked  for  and  couldn't  find  after  her  alleged  assault,  she  said."The  last  thing  you  want  to  is  dig  through  a  bunch  of  websites  and  contact  administrators  who  don't  know  even  know  the  policy  when  you're  dealing  with  a  sexual  assault,"  she  said.Already,  changes  are  under  way.  The  campus  hosted  an  open  forum  on  sexual  violence  led  by  a  lawyer.In  an  e-mailed  statement,  Beth  Fortune,  Vanderbilt's  vice  chancellor  for  public  affairs,  said  posters  are  up  that  say,  "Sex  without  consent  is  sexual  assault."  The  Project  Safe  website  is  live  and  the  office  is  underway,  among  other  efforts."We  want  to  make  it  as  easy  as  possible  for  victims  of  sexual  misconduct  to  get  the  services  they  need,"  Fortune  said.Since  graduating,  O'Brien  is  still  involved  with  Vanderbilt  Students  of  Nonviolence.  She's  also  working  to  build  a  shelter  for  survivors  of  sexual  violence  in  Nashville."I  think  change  will  be  a  slow  process,"  she  said,  "but  we're  starting  to  see  it."John  Kelly,  Tufts  UniversityRape  is  something  anyone  can  experience,  regardless  of  gender  or  sexual  orientation.  It's  something  John  Kelly  knows  firsthand,  and  wants  others  to  remember.In  just  18  months,  the  20-year-old  Tufts  University  student  has  gone  from  admitting  to  himself  he  had  experienced  partner  rape  to  becoming  a  leading  LGBTQ  voice  on  education  policy  about  sexual  assault.Like  many  survivors  who  go  public,  he  did  so  out  of  frustration  with  his  school's  adjudication  process.  Kelly  believes  the  Massachusetts  university  let  his  attacker  off  easy  --  he  was  suspended,  rather  than  expelled  --  because  the  school  didn't  consider  oral  sex  to  be  rape."It  was  really  traumatic,  trying  and  poorly  executed,"  Kelly  said  of  Tufts'  adjudication  process.But  other  parts  of  the  process  revealed  where  Tufts  "did  a  fantastic  job."  The  Title  IX  office  performed  a  thorough  investigation  and  advocated  on  his  behalf  when  he  was  hospitalized  after  a  suicide  attempt,  Kelly  said.  It  facilitated  a  no-contact  order  for  his  attacker,  arranged  therapy  and  made  sure  he  could  return  to  classes."I  saw  the  potential  for  Tufts  to  have  a  really  strong  policy,"  he  said.  "We  were  halfway  there;  the  problem  was  in  the  punishment  phase."Kelly  ran  for  student  senate  and  got  involved  with  the  campus  group  Action  for  Sexual  Assault  Prevention.  It  teamed  up  with  another  group,  Consent  Culture  Network,  on  an  April  2013  letter  to  Tufts  officials,  calling  for  eight  major  policy  changes.A  Tufts  University  spokeswoman  said  the  school  began  to  "take  a  deep  look  at  all  of  its  policies  and  procedures  regarding  sexual  misconduct,"  after  the  2011  U.S.  Department  of  Education  letter,  and  continued  those  efforts  in  2013,  when  the  university  president  convened  the  Task  Force  on  Sexual  Misconduct  Prevention.School  officials  would  not  comment  on  Kelly's  case,  and  he  has  not  filed  a  Title  IX  complaint  against  the  school.  He  says  he  is  trying  to  make  headway  by  working  on  a  task  force  subcommittee  addressing  prevention  through  policy  and  campus  culture.He's  also  working  with  the  national  organization  Ed  Act  Now,  which  drew  more  than  175,000  signatures  on  a  petition  urging  Education  Secretary  Arne  Duncan  to  hold  schools  accountable  for  failing  to  comply  with  Title  IX  and  Clery  laws.Kelly  and  others  met  with  Duncan  and  others  from  the  Obama  administration  and  Department  of  Justice.  He  now  serves  on  the  Department  of  Education's  Negotiated  Rulemaking  Committee  on  the  Violence  Against  Women  Act,  helping  to  shape  the  regulations  surrounding  recent  changes  to  the  law."We  want  to  make  things  more  survivor-centered,  make  sure  support  systems  are  in  place  to  increase  students'  mental,  emotional  and  physical  safety,"  he  said.Sofie  Karasek,  University  of  California,  BerkeleyThe  University  of  California,  Berkeley  was  Sofie  Karasek's  dream  school,  a  progressive  campus,  perfect  for  an  activist  like  herself.  She  never  imagined  she'd  be  advocating  for  herself.Karasek  said  her  path  took  a  detour  one  night  in  her  first  year,  when  she  was  sexually  assaulted  at  an  off-campus  event.  Ashamed,  she  told  just  a  few  others,  and  buried  the  incident  --  until  she  learned  the  same  person  had  assaulted  three  other  students.  In  April  2012,  they  met  with  administrators  to  tell  their  story.  The  following  month,  Karasek  and  two  others  filed  a  report  against  him  with  the  school,  and  waited  to  hear  back.Six  months  later,  Karasek  said  she  heard  through  a  mutual  friend  about  the  resolution:  He  would  be  graduating  early.  No  investigation  had  been  conducted  as  far  as  she  knew;  at  least  none  involving  her  or  the  other  women."I  gave  them  the  benefit  of  doubt,"  she  said.  It  turned  out  they  weren't  talking  to  anyone  except  him,  she  said,  "to  resolve  it  on  his  terms."The  school  responded  to  Karasek's  request  for  an  update  two  days  before  his  December  2012  graduation,  saying  that  he  had  been  found  in  violation  of  the  student  code  of  conduct  and  that  the  case  was  solved  through  an  early  resolution  process,  she  said.  The  school  only  confirmed  in  September  2013  that  he  had  graduated  in  December,  she  said.UC  Berkeley  did  not  respond  to  requests  for  comment.Karasek  was  emboldened  to  speak  out  about  her  experience.  With  the  help  of  students  from  other  universities,  she  and  eight  other  students  filed  a  Clery  complaint  against  UC  Berkeley  in  May.  But  instead  of  filing  the  complaint  silently,  she  and  another  student  issued  a  press  release  while  attorney  Gloria  Allred  held  a  press  conference  to  announce  that  complaints  had  been  filed  against  Berkeley,  Dartmouth,  Swarthmore  and  the  University  of  Southern  California.The  experience  has  launched  Karasek  into  the  activist  spotlight.  She  testified  at  a  joint  legislative  committee  hearing  in  August  2013,  leading  the  state  legislature  to  order  an  audit  of  sexual  assault  policies  at  UC  Berkeley  and  three  other  state  schools.  The  results  are  expected  in  April.In  December,  an  aide  from  California  Assemblyman  Mike  Gatto's  office  reached  out,  asking  whether  she  would  testify  on  behalf  of  a  bill  requiring  universities  to  report  all  sexual  assaults  and  violent  crimes  to  local  law  enforcement.  Karasek  suggested  modifying  the  bill  to  require  that  that  all  violent  crimes  be  reported  except  in  cases  where  survivors  request  otherwise.  He  listened  and  introduced  the  amended  bill  to  the  state  education  code  with  her  suggested  caveat.But  progress  at  UC  Berkeley  has  been  "lackluster,"  Karasek  said.  In  September,  the  school  introduced  an  interim  policy  that  allows  survivors  to  appeal  their  cases,  among  other  changes.  But  Karasek  wishes  more  meaningful  improvements  would  come,  including  more  staff  dedicated  to  the  issue,  as  well  as  Title  IX  coordinators,  and  for  the  "preponderance  of  evidence"  standard  written  into  UC  Berkeley's  policy.Really,  what  Karasek  wants  is  the  school  to  implement  a  process  for  formal  hearings  and  investigations  in  sexual  assault  reports  --  something  that  was  missing  from  her  experience  with  the  reporting  process,  she  said.But  a  Title  IX  advisory  committee  convened  by  the  school  chancellor  to  review  policies  that  she  sits  on  has  only  met  once,  she  said.  Otherwise,  nothing  much  changed,  she  said."The  people  who  are  dedicated  to  changing  policy  are  students,"  she  said.  "We're  recognizing  the  snowball  effect  that  comes  from  speaking  out."Caroline  Heldman,  Occidental  CollegeCaroline  Heldman  remembers  how  it  feels  to  go  to  bed  hungry  or  cold.  She  grew  up  poor  in  rural  Washington  state,  and  remembers  the  "pain  of  people  looking  down  on  you,"  of  being  the  first  person  accused  when  something  went  missing,  and  being  shunned  and  teased.  Still,  her  father's  Pentecostal  leanings  ingrained  in  her  a  duty  to  serve  others  and  the  view  that  "someone  else's  suffering  is  my  own  suffering,"  she  said.Heldman,  an  Occidental  College  professor,  has  become  one  of  the  leading  faculty  figures  helping  students  file  federal  complaints  involving  the  handling  of  sexual  assault  cases."There's  not  a  single  school  that  isn't  thinking  about  this,"  Heldman  said.Heldman  and  colleague  Danielle  Dirks  helped  37  students  and  alumna  file  a  Title  IX  complaint  in  2013.  She  served  as  a  faculty  advisor  to  End  Rape  on  Campus,  which  connects  survivors  with  resources  for  treatment  and  options  for  holding  schools  accountable.This  past  week,  in  a  Google  Hangout,  she  walked  Espinosa,  the  University  of  Texas-Pan  American  student,  through  the  process  to  file  her  complaint."My  work  is  very  much  driven  by  the  fact  that  we  don't  live  in  a  meritorious  society  and  some  people  are  more  likely  to  experience  pain  and  suffering  than  others,"  she  said.  "A  lot  of  us  are  very  comfortable  acknowledging  that  given  certain  circumstances,  we  could  be  in  the  same  bad  situation  as  someone  else.  But  it's  more  than  that  --  it's  about  seeing  yourself  in  others."As  a  young  idealist,  Heldman  thought  she  could  fix  everything  that  was  wrong  in  the  world  --  from  the  headlight  ordinances  she  argued  for  as  a  child  in  Washington  to  the  social  justice  causes  she  took  up  as  an  undergrad.As  a  full-time  professor  with  tenure  at  Occidental,  Heldman  feels  a  responsibility  to  speak  up  about  how  schools  treat  victims  of  sexual  violence.  Many  educators  have  less  freedom  to  speak  out  about  controversial  topics,  she  said,  which  puts  her  in  a  unique  position  to  help."Power  in  colleges  has  shifted  dramatically  in  recent  years  to  the  administrative  side,"  she  said."Those  of  us  who  are  tenured  need  to  use  our  academic  freedom  because  we're  the  only  ones  at  institutions  who  have  power  to  speak  out  when  administrations  mistreat  students."Anusha  Ravi,  Emory  UniversityAs  far  as  Anusha  Ravi  is  concerned,  how  a  school  deals  with  sexual  assault  is  a  reflection  of  the  entire  campus  community  --  and  it's  everyone's  job.As  more  schools  made  national  headlines  with  students'  allegations  of  mishandling  of  sexual  assault  reports,  Ravi  began  to  wonder,  how  are  handling  these  kinds  of  things  at  handled  at  her  school,  Emory  University  in  Atlanta?That's  why  the  20-year-old  political  science  student  joined  the  student  group  Sexual  Assault  Peer  Advocates.  The  group  provides  training  to  undergraduate  and  graduate  students  about  how  to  talk  to  sexual  assault  survivors.It's  a  skill  most  college  students  will  need  at  some  point,  Ravi  said.  She  has  not  personally  experienced  sexual  assault,  but  she  knows  people  who  have.  Understanding  how  to  talk  about  sexual  assault  fosters  a  climate  of  openness  within  the  school  community,  she  said.Because  sexual  assault  affects  women  more  often  than  men,  she  said,  a  school's  mishandling  of  sexual  assaults  projects  a  sexist  image,  and  for  better  or  worse,  so  much  has  to  do  with  image."It  doesn't  look  good  for  higher  education  in  general  and  doesn't  make  an  institution  look  good,"  she  said.  "As  a  college  student,  I  do  believe  that  when  people  are  evaluating  their  own  education,  they're  not  only  looking  at  classes,  but  campus  culture  and  safety."So  far,  Ravi  is  satisfied  with  Emory's  approach.After  the  2011  Department  of  Education  letter,  Emory  created  a  university-wide  sexual  misconduct  policy  and  adjudication  process  in  2013,  a  university  spokeswoman  said  in  an  e-mail.The  school  now  has  Title  IX  coordinators  for  each  college  and  supports  groups  such  as  Sexual  Assault  Peer  Advocates  in  its  efforts  to  improve  campus  culture.The  group  has  trained  more  than  1,000  people,  from  fraternity  groups  to  residence  advisers,  Ravi  said."Nobody  wants  to  be  the  school  that  treats  people  poorly,  especially  sexual  assault  survivors,"  she  said.  "We  all  have  a  role  to  play."Teens  trained  to  spot  drama  before  it  turns  dangerousCNN's  Jamie  Gumbrecht  and  Toby  Lyles  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

The  law  required  the  federal  government  to  deny  recognition  of  same-sex  marriages.That  decision,  which  came  at  a  time  when  the  President  said  he  was  still  "evolving"  on  whether  to  support  such  marriages,  eventually  led  to  the  Supreme  Court's  ruling  last  year  that  overturned  the  law.And  it  led  to  Holder's  announcement  in  recent  weeks  to  extend  spousal  benefits  to  same-sex  married  couples  in  all  federal  legal  matters.Is  same-sex  marriage  no  longer  a  political  issue?For  Holder,  63,  it's  a  way  to  carve  out  a  modern  civil  rights  legacy.In  discussing  his  gay-rights  efforts,  he  often  mentions  his  sister-in-law,  who  in  1963  made  history  as  one  of  the  two  black  students  who  integrated  the  University  of  Alabama  under  federal  armed  guard.A  portrait  of  a  Justice  Department  prosecutor  who  stood  watch  on  the  university  steps  that  day  hangs  in  Holder's  personal  office  in  a  fifth-floor  corner  of  the  Justice  Department  headquarters  named  for  Robert  F.  Kennedy.Holder  and  his  supporters  have  eagerly  embraced  the  RFK  legacy  as  a  comparison."When  you  look  at  his  entire  record,  Eric  Holder  will  have  done  more  to  expand  justice  in  the  United  States  than  any  attorney  general  since  Bobby  Kennedy,"  says  Matthew  Miller,  a  former  aide  to  Holder  who  remains  close  to  the  attorney  general.It's  not  the  way  his  critics  have  portrayed  him,  particularly  during  some  of  the  rocky  periods  of  his  tenure.For  a  time,  he  was  involved  in  fights  with  Republicans  and  White  House  rivals  over  a  variety  of  national  security  issues.And  he  survived  a  bruising  battle  with  House  Republicans  over  the  "Fast  and  Furious"  gun  trafficking  controversy,  including  becoming  the  first  sitting  Cabinet  member  to  be  held  in  contempt  of  Congress."I've  had  some  days  that  have  been  better  than  others,"  Holder  told  CNN  in  a  November  interview.  But  added  that  now,  "There's  the  ability  to  focus  on  issues  now  that  really  matter  to  me."Among  those  issues  is  working  to  change  sentencing  guidelines  to  give  prosecutors  more  flexibility  in  certain  non-violent  criminal  cases,  pushing  for  rehabilitation  instead  of  warehousing  of  prisoners,  and  getting  rid  of  the  disparity  in  the  way  the  justice  system  deals  with  defendants  charged  in  cocaine  and  crack  cocaine  crimes.Holder  also  recently  made  a  public  push  for  states  to  more  quickly  restore  voting  rights  to  felons  after  they've  completed  their  sentences  and  probation.He  is  joined  in  that  effort  by  Sen.  Rand  Paul  and  other  conservatives  who've  similarly  view  it  in  line  with  their  views  on  expanded  individual  rights.Rand  Paul  fights  for  felon  voting  rightsFollowing  Holder's  plea,  Alabama's  Republican  governor  said  he  could  support  such  an  idea,  and  a  modified  proposal  in  Paul's  home  state  of  Kentucky  has  begun  moving  through  the  legislature.But  Holder's  moves  to  use  administrative  memos  to  make  effective  changes  before  Congress  passes  new  laws  have  also  generated  criticism.Former  Attorney  General  Michael  Mukasey  told  CNN's  Jake  Tapper  in  an  August  interview  that  "I  generally  agree  with  the  goal  of  getting  rid  of  mandatory  minimums.  ...  But  the  way  to  do  that  is  to  pass  a  law,  not  to  say  you're  going  to  disregard  the  law."Sen.  Charles  Grassley  similarly  has  criticized  Holder  and  the  Obama  administration  for  taking  action  without  waiting  for  Congress.But  the  department's  decision  to  not  defend  the  federal  ban  on  same-sex  marriage  has  since  become  emulated  in  states,  including  Virginia  and  Oregon.  Those  moves  could  propel  the  issue  back  to  the  Supreme  Court  in  the  next  two  years.Holder's  most  aggressive  moves  have  come  in  recent  weeks  with  an  aggressive  interpretation  of  last  year's  Supreme  Court  ruling  on  same-sex  marriage.After  much  internal  debate,  Holder  decided  the  department  would  give  full  equal  treatment  to  same-sex  married  couples,  going  so  far  as  extending  the  right  to  refuse  to  provide  incriminating  testimony  against  a  spouse,  a  bedrock  right  for  married  couples.Earlier  this  month,  Holder  basked  in  applause  in  a  New  York  City  hotel  ballroom  where  he  announced  the  department's  latest  decision  on  same-same  marriage  legal  rights.The  Human  Rights  Campaign,  which  held  the  event,  praised  him,  by  saying  the  decision  "cements  his  place  in  history  alongside  Robert  F.  Kennedy,  another  attorney  general  who  crusaded  for  civil  rights."</TEXT></DOC>

But  is  a  voice  enough  for  love?</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  "You  had  me  at  'hello'"  --  or  did  you?In  the  new  movie,  "Her,"  director  Spike  Jonze  incorporates  society's  increasing  infatuation  with  smartphones  into  the  plotline  of  this  love-at-first-sound  movie  --  a  futuristic  "Sleepless  in  Seattle"  of  sorts.Joaquin  Phoenix  plays  Theodore  Twombly,  an  introverted  and  subdued  writer  who  ends  up  falling  for  "Samantha,"  his  phone's  artificially  intelligent  operating  system.  ("Her"  opens  nationwide  on  January  10.)Samantha,  akin  but  undoubtedly  more  advanced  than  modern-day  iOS  assistant  Siri,  is  huskily  voiced  by  Scarlett  Johansson.  (Just  don't  ask  Siri  about  her.)There  is  no  physical  component  to  Samantha;  she's  merely  an  interactive  screen  with  a  warm,  responsive  voice  and  custom-made  personality  picked  for  the  solitary  Twombly.The  buzzed-about  film  is  packed  with  hypotheticals,  but  the  fact  that  Twombly  falls  for  a  voice  alone  has  raised  questions  about  vocal  attraction,  the  power  of  sound  and  our  desire  to  truly  connect  in  a  hyper-connected  yet  physically  removed  world.While  the  movie's  level  of  artificial  intelligence  is  still  speculative,  the  scenario  certainly  isn't  too  far  off  base  in  the  realm  of  digital  dating.  New  York  magazine's  film  critic  David  Edelstein  not  only  called  it  one  of  the  best  films  of  the  year,  he  also  asked  in  his  review:  "Do  we  even  need  our  bodies?  Or  is  it  all  in  our  brains?"Six  odd  and  crazy  technologies  at  CESOnline  dating  correspondence  via  e-mail,  private  messages  and/or  chat  rooms  are  a  contemporary  extension  of  verbal,  non-face-to-face  contact.  Not  to  mention  the  countless  hotlines  people  can  call  just  to  have  someone  to  talk  to  --  whether  to  discuss  personal  problems  or  for  sexual  pleasure.Jody  Kreiman  is  a  professor  at  UCLA  and  co-author  of  "Foundation  of  Voice  Studies,"  a  textbook  that  explores  voice  science,  vocal  physiology  and  vocal  perception.  She  says  that  while  humans  are  vision-dominant,  voice  plays  a  "critical  role"  in  our  biology."Voices  are  the  first  stimuli  babies  recognize,"  she  says.  "We're  social  animals.  Interaction  is  crucial."However,  recognizing  a  voice  also  involves  activating  a  slew  of  associations  with  that  particular  tone  --  "things  like  when  you  heard  it,  the  person's  appearance,  their  tastes  and  preferences,  what  you  ate  when  you  were  together,  their  siblings'  names,  all  the  minutiae  that  make  up  knowing  someone,"  she  says.Voice,  Kreiman  notes,  is  part  of  a  package.Why  computer  voices  are  mostly  femaleUnlike  the  fictional  Samantha,  no  one's  personality  is  crafted  to  complement  another  person's  --  relationships  are  messy  and  complicated  by  design.  (In  the  film,  Twombly's  ex-wife  says  he  is  in  this  relationship  because  he  can't  handle  a  real  one.)"Knowing  a  person  only  by  voice,  independent  of  the  kinds  of  physical  details  that  go  into  building  up  a  representation  of  a  whole  person,  seems  an  impoverished  kind  of  knowing,  both  of  the  person  and  of  the  voice,"  she  says.While  Kreiman  says  there's  no  definitive  guide  to  an  attractive  voice,  listeners  generally  agree  about  what  is  attractive  and  what  isn't."On  average,  most  people  prefer  voices  that  are  moderate  in  pitch  and  speaking  rate,  not  nasal,  not  shrill  and  with  good  articulation,"  she  says.The  movie  might  have  a  very  different  outcome  if  Samantha  were  voiced  by  the  shrill  actress  Fran  Drescher  instead  of  Johansson,  whose  breathiness  is  a  vocal  turn-on,  according  to  research  by  David  R.  Feinberg,  founder  of  the  Voice  Research  Laboratory  at  McMaster  University  in  Ontario,  Canada.  (Imagine  the  iconic  "Happy  Birthday,  Mr.  President"  sung  by  Roseanne  Barr  instead  of  Marilyn  Monroe,  and  you'll  get  the  picture.)A  recent  study  out  of  Albright  College  in  Pennsylvania  also  indicated  both  men  and  women  lowered  the  pitch  of  their  voices  when  they  were  attracted  to  the  person  they  were  conversing  with.Diana  Sidtis,  a  professor  in  the  Department  of  Communicative  Sciences  and  Disorders  at  New  York  University,  says  a  high-pitched  male  voice  is  rated  as  less  attractive,  as  is  a  babyish  female  voice.  Sidtis  co-authored  "Foundation  of  Voice  Studies"  with  Kreiman.She  also  points  out  that  vocal  identity  is  a  "potent  stimulus,"  and  voice  patterns  --  like  those  of  an  operating  system  --  can  become  familiar  very  quickly.Blogger  shows  how  to  take  travel  photos  with  an  imaginary  girlfriend"We  respond  with  the  entire  brain  to  a  personally  familiar  voice,"  Sidtis  wrote  in  an  e-mail.Think  about  your  response  on  the  telephone  to  the  mere  "hello"  of  a  close  friend  or  family  member  versus  your  response  to  an  unfamiliar  telemarketer:  "In  this  way,  processing  a  personally  familiar  voice  is  essentially  different  (in  neurological  and  psychological  studies)  from  hearing  (or  discriminating)  an  unfamiliar  voice,"  she  adds.Mark  Waldman,  co-author  of  "Words  Can  Change  Your  Brain,"  says  facial  expressions  --  like  a  wry  Mona  Lisa  smile  and  gentle  eye  contact  --  are  undoubtedly  key  indicators  to  compassionate  communication.  Next  on  the  list:  a  warm  tone  of  voice  --  which  brings  to  mind  the  old  saying,  "It's  not  what  you  say,  but  how  you  say  it."Ultimately,  though,  Waldman  says  vocal  attraction  is  a  fantasy  --  just  like  in  the  movies.  You'll  start  fantasizing  about  the  whole  package;  the  same  way  some  would  with  their  favorite  Hollywood  star."We  meet  someone;  suspend  our  suspicions  and  fantasize  what  the  ideal  scenario  will  be,"  Waldman  says.At  one  point  in  the  movie  (spoiler  alert!),  the  screen  fades  to  black  and  the  viewer  is  left  to  his  or  her  own  devices  to  picture  Theodore  and  Samantha  as  they  consummate  their  relationship.Essentially,  Twombly  is  envisioning  every  other  aspect  of  "her"  that  doesn't  exist  --  as  is  the  viewer.</TEXT></DOC>

Xoxo  Amanda,"  Bynes  posted  along  with  a  sketch  that  appears  to  be  of  herself.The  27-year-old's  Twitter  account  was  once  the  place  where  headlines  were  made,  as  she  would  post  questionable  and  at  times  disturbing  messages  occasionally  involving  other  celebrities.  But  since  her  release  from  an  in-patient  treatment  facility  in  December,  where  she  spent  four  months  under  involuntary  psychiatric  hold,  Bynes  has  cleaned  house.All  of  the  old  tweets  have  been  banished,  and  in  their  place  are  brief,  run-of-the-mill  updates  along  with  a  smattering  of  older  photos."Hi  everyone!

She  also  encourages  her  neighbors  to  vote.Her  activism  is  persistent  despite  feeling  like  she  is  an  ignored  component  of  the  American  electorate."I  feel  like  they're  not  talking  to  me,"  Gaines-Turner  said  of  politicians.That's  because  she  is  poor.  Her  life  is  not  unlike  millions  of  Americans  who  rely  on  a  patchwork  of  government  assistance  and  near-minimum  wage  jobs.CNNMoney:  Minimum  wage  to  rise  in  13  states  on  Jan.  1Unemployment  benefits  expire,  Dems  vow  to  fight  onThe  mother  of  a  9-year-old  and  6-year-old  twins,  who  was  once  homeless,  finds  herself  unemployed  again  because  her  temporary  job  at  a  day  care  ended  December  2.Her  husband  makes  $8.50  per  hour  working  behind  the  food  counter  at  a  deli;  they  struggle  to  feed  their  family  even  with  $160  per  month  in  food  stamp  benefits.Opinion:  Out  of  jobs,  out  of  benefits,  out  of  luckEven  though  she  feels  disconnected,  Gaines-Turner  is  politically  motivated.

But  he's  far  from  achieving  it.The  year  Obama  made  the  pledge,  a  record  31.8  million  people  received  supplemental  food  benefits.  That  record  has  been  broken  each  year  since,  with  more  than  47  million  people  now  on  the  food  stamp  program.He  recently  launched  a  campaign  to  address  income  inequality,  but  other  than  giving  speeches  pledging  to  raise  the  federal  minimum  wage  and  urging  Congress  to  extend  expired  unemployment  benefits,  activists  said  Obama  has  done  little  that  is  substantive.But  the  issue  has  been  around  long  before  Obama  took  office  in  2008.Nearly  50  years  after  President  Lyndon  Johnson  launched  the  War  on  Poverty,  which  was  a  central  component  of  his  1964  campaign,  poverty  still  impacts  millions  of  Americans.And  the  gap  between  wealthy  and  poor  has  grown  steadily.The  top  5%  of  households  possessed  22.3%  of  income  in  2012  compared  to  16.3%  in  1968,  according  to  the  Census  Bureau.Moreover,  a  2011  report  by  the  Congressional  Budget  Office  found  the  top  1%  of  households  saw  after-tax  income  grow  by  275%  since  1979  compared  with  18%  for  the  bottom  20%.  Those  at  the  low  end  did  not  keep  up  with  inflation.The  nonpartisan  Congressional  analysts  credited  unequal  wage  distribution  and  "less  redistributive"  government  benefits  and  taxes  for  increased  income  inequality.Obama:  Wage,  income  gap  eroding  American  dreamJust  as  problematic  to  hunger  and  poverty  activists  --  and  to  people  like  Gaines-Turner  --  there  is  almost  no  real  discussion  around  issues  important  to  them  in  Washington  except  when  they  surface  in  periodic  budget  wrangling.Dr.  Mariana  Chilton,  an  associate  professor  at  Drexel  University's  School  of  Public  Health  and  founder  of  the  Witnesses  to  Hunger  project  focusing  on  "mothers  who  know  poverty  first  hand,"  said  the  lack  of  discussion  is  detrimental  to  the  poor  because  winning  candidates  can't  be  held  accountable  for  promises  they  never  make."We've  seen  a  complete  falling  away  of  people  in  positions  of  leadership,"  she  said.Entitlements  in  the  spotlightMedicare  and  Social  Security  receive  widespread  attention  on  the  campaign  trail.

Politicians  covet  senior  voters.Welfare,  unemployment  benefits,  food  stamps  --  government  programs  intended  to  benefit  those  most  in  need  --  are  spread  throughout  the  population  and  don't  get  as  much  political  exposure.While  an  expansion  of  government  programs  could  be  risky  rhetoric  in  some  political  circles,  especially  Republican,  innovative  approaches  to  address  the  often-talked  about  gap  between  rich  and  poor  and  the  shrinking  middle  class  are  also  absent.The  only  major  party  candidate  recently  to  make  poverty  a  central  theme  was  Democrat  John  Edwards.The  former  Senator  fell  short  in  the  2008  presidential  primaries  against  Obama,  who  spoke  in  generic  broad  sweeps  about  a  more  just  and  prosperous  citizenship  that  could  simultaneously  be  appealing  to  the  wealthiest  and  poorest.Instead,  poverty  becomes  an  issue  only  when  a  candidate's  dismissal  of  the  poor  become  public.Sutter:  The  most  unequal  place  in  AmericaRomney's  campaign  faced  a  backlash  when  he  said  he  was  "not  concerned"  with  the  very  poor.  His  comment  that  47%  of  Americans  were  "dependent  upon  the  government"  also  became  a  political  liability.But  is  political  ignorance  of  poverty  calculated?The  middle  class  supplies  the  greatest  percentage  of  votes.  And  if  people  truly  vote  their  interest,  the  middle  class  wants  to  hear  how  it  would  benefit.One  voter  who  was  squarely  in  the  middle  class,  said  during  Edwards'  campaign  that  she  couldn't  relate  to  what  he  was  talking  about.Chris  Lehane,  a  Democratic  strategist  who  worked  for  former  President  Bill  Clinton  and  presidential  candidate  Al  Gore,  said  the  poor  don't  vote,  "which  means  their  voices  are  not  as  loud  in  the  political  process  as  they  should  be  --  especially  given  the  number  of  children  near,  at,  or  below  the  poverty  line."Statistics  do  show  lower-income  people  are  less  likely  to  vote.  According  to  CNN  exit  polls,  those  who  made  less  than  $15,000  per  year  comprised  6%  of  voters  in  2008.  More  than  13  percent  of  the  overall  population  fell  below  the  poverty  line  that  year.Progressive  candidatesLiberals  hope  2016  will  be  different  as  they  push  people  like  Massachusetts  Sen.  Elizabeth  Warren  to  run  for  president.  A  neophyte  politician,  Warren  is  a  champion  of  liberal  economic  policies.And  progressives  believe  the  election  of  Democrat  Bill  De  Blasio  as  Mayor  of  New  York,  the  world's  financial  capital,  is  a  promising  sign  the  nation  may  be  more  ready  to  discuss  issues  pertaining  to  poor  people.A  populist,  De  Blasio  has  stressed  a  tale  of  "two  cities"  theme  that  illustrated  a  division  of  rich  and  poor.De  Blasio  sworn  in  by  Bill  Clinton"The  increasing  interest  on  giving  everyone  in  society  a  fair  shake  ...  could  foreshadow  the  fact  that  we  may  be  on  the  cusp  of  entering  a  new  progressive  era,"  Lehane  said.Conservatives,  tooBut  another  focus  on  poverty  might  come  from  an  unexpected  corner  of  American  politics  --  the  conservative  wing  of  the  Republican  Party.Possible  2016  contender  Rep.  Paul  Ryan  of  Wisconsin  has  embarked  on  a  listening  and  learning  tour  of  poor  communities  across  the  United  States,  according  to  several  people  who  have  either  accompanied  him  or  discussed  it  with  him.Arthur  Books,  president  of  the  American  Enterprise  Institute  conservative  think  tank,  said  Ryan  "represents  a  movement  and  a  recognition  that  in  the  past  five  years,  people  in  the  bottom  half  have  gone  backwards."Brooks  said  he  has  spoken  with  Ryan,  the  2012  Republican  vice  presidential  nominee,  about  poverty  and  the  issue  is  something  that  he  wants  to  tackle.It  started  less  than  a  month  before  Romney  and  Ryan  lost  the  election.While  the  standard  bearer  was  largely  seen  as  an  aloof  elitist,  Ryan  met  with  a  group  of  low-income  people  at  Cleveland  State  University.Bob  Woodson,  an  acquaintance  of  Ryan  who  runs  the  Center  for  Neighborhood  Enterprise,  a  national  organization  working  with  low  income  people,  said  the  lawmaker  reached  out  to  him  after  the  election  and  wanted  to  learn  more.Ryan  meets  with  Woodson  one  day  a  month  in  a  different  city  and  spends  time  with  poor  people,  Woodson  said."It's  been  an  eye-opener"  for  Ryan,  Woodson  said.  "I've  taken  him  to  places  that  few  other  representative  have  been."Woodson  thinks  Ryan  will  eventually  form  a  poverty  agenda,  "but  before  he  does  so,  he  needs  to  understand  what  the  needs  are."While  Ryan  is  exploring  the  issue  quietly,  another  potential  2016  candidate  is  also  highlighting  the  issue.Sen.  Rand  Paul  of  Kentucky  delivered  a  speech  on  poverty  in  Detroit  in  recent  weeks.Evidence  that  he  might  be  looking  to  elevate  the  issue  politically  is  that  he  chose  the  Motor  City  --  which  is  bankrupt  despite  a  resurgence  in  auto  manufacturing.  Michigan  is  also  a  traditional  presidential  battleground.Rand  Paul:  Extending  jobless  benefits  a  'disservice'The  Republican  Party  is  considered  unsympathetic  to  the  poor.  Current  efforts  in  Congress  to  sharply  cut  food  stamps  and  statewide  efforts  to  drug-test  welfare  recipients  exacerbate  the  perception.If  candidates  make  poverty  a  central  --  or  at  least  one  --  component  of  national  campaigns,  it  would  be  a  significant  departure  from  its  modern-day  politicking.Deep  philosophical  divides  on  the  best  way  to  address  the  issue  are  likely  --  even  if  Republicans  take  it  on.Democrats  tend  to  support  policies  that  involve  more  government  and  equitable  wealth  distribution  while  Republicans  tend  to  back  a  "trickle-down"  approach  in  which  stronger  upper  and  middle  class  economies  benefit  the  poor.Acknowledging  the  issue  is  the  first  step,  Woodson  said."That's  the  kind  of  dialogue  that  I'm  trying  to  get  going,"  he  said.  "I'm  trying  to  get  both  conservatives  and  liberals  to  debate  which  interventions  improve  the  lives  of  poor  people."Hillary  Clinton  urges  extending  benefits  for  joblessCNNMoney:  $15  minimum  wage  supporters  vow  to  fight  on</TEXT></DOC>

Gen.  Jeffrey  Sinclair  --  once  one  of  the  U.S.  Army's  top  commanders  in  Afghanistan  --  pleaded  guilty  Thursday  to  several  charges  related  to  sexual  relationships  with  female  troops,  but  not  the  most  serious  one  against  him.According  to  the  public  affairs  office  for  Fort  Bragg,  in  North  Carolina,  Sinclair  pleaded  guilty  to  committing  adultery,  engaging  in  inappropriate  relationships  with  three  women,  conduct  unbecoming  an  officer  and  a  gentleman  and  obstruction  of  justice.Col.  James  L.  Pohl,  the  judge  overseeing  his  court  martial,  accepted  these  pleas  after  being  convinced  they  were  factual  and  made  voluntarily.The  government's  lawyers  dropped  two  counts  --  one  of  conduct  unbecoming  an  officer  and  a  gentleman  and  the  other  for  cruelty  and  maltreatment.Sinclair  still  stands  accused  of  "sodomy  ...  by  force  and  without  the  consent"  of  his  alleged  victim,  an  Army  captain.  Charges  also  loom  for  alleged  cruel  and  maltreatment  of  subordinates  and  defrauding  the  government,  according  to  Fort  Bragg.The  brigadier  general  pleaded  not  guilty  to  those  charges  Thursday.  His  court  martial  is  expected  to  resume  Friday  morning  with  opening  statements  and  the  prosecution  presenting  its  case,  according  to  the  Fort  Bragg  press  office.Army  general  faces  sexual  conduct,  other  chargesHis  defense  lawyer,  Richard  Scheff,  expressed  confidence  in  his  client's  prospects  in  comments  to  CNN  affiliate  WTVD.  He  said  that  the  case  now  boils  down  to  the  brigadier  general's  story  against  that  of  his  main  accuser,  suggesting  that  what  she  wrote  in  a  diary  differs  markedly  from  the  allegations  against  Sinclair."Where  this  case  is  rests  on  the  accuser's  word,  which  is  worth  nothing,"  said  Scheff.Once  the  deputy  commander  of  the  Army's  82nd  Airborne  Division,  Sinclair  was  moved  to  the  North  Carolina  post  from  Afghanistan  in  2012,  the  same  year  the  last  alleged  incidents  occurred  and  when  he  was  originally  charged.Prosecutors  said  he  broke  military  law  through  sexual  relationships  --  including  threats  to  some  women  involved,  who  had  lower  ranks  --  between  2009  and  2012,  overseas  in  Iraq,  Afghanistan  and  Germany,  as  well  as  Fort  Bragg  and  Fort  Hood,  Texas.The  charge  sheet  claims  Sinclair  had  pornographic  images  and  videos,  misled  investigators  and  defrauded  the  government  "by  wrongfully  using  his  government  travel  charge  for  personal  purposes."In  comments  Thursday,  Scheff  said  that  his  client  "has  consistently  admitted  his  shortcomings  and  taken  responsibility  for  them."Report:  Troops  filing  sexual  trauma  claims  less  likely  to  get  PTSD  benefitsCongress  passes  reform  on  how  military  handles  sexual  assault  casesCNN's  Suzanne  Presto  and  Tristan  Smith  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

The  image  that  appears  will  include  a  Getty  photo  credit  and  will  be  linked  to  the  company's  website,  where  viewers  can  have  the  opportunity  to  license  the  photo."This  will  provide  people  with  a  simple  and  legal  way  to  utilize  content  that  respects  creators'  rights,  including  the  opportunity  to  generate  licensing  revenue,"  Getty  said  in  a  statement  announcing  the  move.  The  decision  "opens  one  of  the  largest,  deepest  and  most  comprehensive  image  collections  in  the  world  for  easy  sharing,  thereby  making  the  world  an  even  more  visual  place."Craig  Peters,  Getty's  senior  vice  president  for  business  development,  said  Getty  saw  its  content  being  copied  online,  and  that  "spoke  to  an  opportunity.""The  use  of  our  content  in  these  venues  points  to  really  the  fact  that  people  are  excited  to  be  sharing  their  ideas,  their  interests,  their  passions  with  our  content,"  he  said.  By  giving  users  limited  access  to  its  imagery,  he  said,  "We're  generating  new  brand  awareness  in  this  market."It  also  clarifies  Getty's  insistence  that  any  commercial  use  of  the  company's  images  requires  a  paid  license,  possibly  bringing  in  paying  customers,  Peters  said.  And  it  opens  up  the  door  to  using  the  embed  code  to  post  advertising  --  a  prospect  already  covered  in  Getty's  terms  of  use  for  the  new  venture."I  think  it's  a  little  premature  to  talk  to  a  specific  business  model,  but  I  think  we  can  talk  to  specific  benefits  out  of  the  gate,"  Peters  said.Users  will  be  able  up  pick  from  a  universe  of  35  million  images  out  of  the  150  million  Getty  has  available  for  licensing  to  a  wide  variety  of  organizations,  from  advertising  agencies  to  news  outlets  like  CNN.  Embedded  content  must  be  used  for  "editorial  purposes"  --  meaning  events  that  are  "newsworthy  or  of  public  interest"  --  and  can't  be  used  for  advertising,  the  terms  state.Joshua  Benton,  director  of  the  Nieman  Journalism  Lab  at  Harvard  University,  said  Getty  is  trying  to  establish  "an  alternative  for  people  who  otherwise  would  just  copy  and  paste  photos,"  much  as  Apple's  iTunes  created  a  way  to  legitimize  music  sharing.But  the  trick  for  Getty  will  be  to  allow  those  users  to  access  its  images  without  making  it  so  easy  that  its  paying  customers  start  using  the  embed  service  themselves,  he  said."Getty  makes  a  lot  of  money  off  folks  like  The  New  York  Times  and  CNN  and  professional  publishers.  They  do  not  in  any  way  want  to  endanger  that,"  Benton  said.  "They're  trying  to  walk  that  thin  line  to  protect  that  while  at  the  same  time  enabling  that  different  kind  of  business."Peters  said  that  commercial  users  have  more  rights  to  the  images  than  bloggers  who  embed  them.  They're  able  to  use  the  images  on  multiple  platforms,  edit  them  and  keep  them  on  their  own  servers,  he  said."It's  a  completely  different  work  product  than  what  any  of  our  major  media  companies  are  looking  for,"  he  said.So  far,  news  photos  are  harder  to  find  in  embeddable  form  "than  a  stock  photo  of  a  man  in  a  classroom,"  Benton  said.  But  if  Getty  starts  using  the  embedded  image  to  post  ads  --  a  possibility  included  in  its  terms  of  use  --  "then  you  have  a  question  about  how  photographers  get  compensated,"  Benton  said.Yvonne  Boyd,  a  photographer  in  Atlanta,  said  the  market  for  stock  imagery  has  already  declined  sharply  in  recent  years,  and  many  photo  agencies  now  expect  photographers  to  pick  up  a  larger  share  of  their  expenses."I  can't  help  but  think  that  somehow  Getty  will  gain  something  from  this,  but  not  their  photographers,"  Boyd  said.  She  and  other  photographers  who  commented  on  Getty's  Facebook  page  also  questioned  whether  an  ad-supported  website  counted  as  a  noncommercial  venture."When  you're  potentially  making  money,  even  if  it's  not  a  service  or  a  product,  that's  commercial,"  she  said.  "You  then  are  benefiting  from  another's  work,  and  they  are  not  being  compensated."But  Peters  said  the  feedback  he's  received  from  photographers  is  "largely  positive.""We  have  over  200,000  photographers  whose  work  we  represent  on  a  global  basis.  In  that  world,  not  everyone's  going  to  always  agree  with  the  things  we  do,"  he  said.  But  he  said  he  met  with  a  group  of  photographers  Wednesday  night,  "and  they  were  incredibly  excited  about  it."</TEXT></DOC>

He  is  the  author  of  eight  books,  including  a  new  novel,  "Patriots,"  and  a  post-election  e-book,  "Why  Romney  Lost."  Frum  was  a  special  assistant  to  President  George  W.  Bush  from  2001  to  2002.(CNN)  --  "Viewers  don't  want  to  be  informed.  Viewers  want  to  feel  informed."Those  are  the  words  of  Chet  Collier,  one  of  the  founders  of  Fox  News,  as  quoted  in  Gabriel  Sherman's  new  biography  of  Roger  Ailes,  the  network's  chief.Mission  apparently  accomplished:  Fox  is  the  most-watched  cable  news  network,  and  yet,  some  surveys  suggest  that  people  who  rely  on  Fox  as  their  primary  information  source  know  less  about  current  events  than  people  who  watch  no  news  at  all.But  to  jab  at  Fox  for  inaccuracy  is  to  miss  Fox's  purpose.  Fox  has  created  an  information  community.  We  used  to  say,  "Everybody's  entitled  to  his  own  opinion,  but  not  his  own  facts."  In  a  mass  media  age,  what  counted  as  "fact"  was  defined  by  a  few  great  national  institutions:  a  small  group  of  prestigious  newspapers,  a  pair  of  leading  news  magazines,  a  trio  of  television  broadcasters.Dissenters  had  a  difficult  time  reaching  any  kind  of  large  audience  --  or  even  identifying  who  their  audience  might  be.Advancing  technology  opened  new  possibilities,  and  Sherman's  biography  deftly  tells  the  story  of  how  it  happened.The  launch  of  CNN  inspired  NBC  to  create  a  cable  news  channel  of  its  own,  CNBC.  Roger  Ailes  --  a  former  TV  producer  who  had  emerged  as  the  most  successful  Republican  campaign  consultant  of  the  1980s  --  was  hired  to  run  CNBC.  After  he  lost  an  internal  power  struggle,  Ailes  joined  Rupert  Murdoch's  Fox  network.And  the  rest,  as  they  say,  is  history.Before  Fox,  news  programmers  had  struggled  with  the  question  of  what  their  product  was.  Did  it  include  health  information,  and  if  so,  how  much?  Weather?  Financial  information?  Human  interest?  Political  opinion?  Ailes  built  his  new  channel  upon  a  very  different  question:  who  is  my  product  for?The  largest  generation  in  American  history,  the  baby  boomers,  were  reaching  deep  middle  age  by  the  mid-1990s.  They  were  beginning  to  share  an  experience  familiar  to  all  who  pass  age  50:  living  in  a  country  very  different  from  the  one  they  had  been  born  into.Fox  offered  them  a  new  virtual  environment  in  which  they  could  feel  more  at  home  than  they  did  in  the  outside  world.  Fox  was  carefully  designed  to  look  like  a  TV  show  from  the  1970s:  no  holograms,  no  urban  hipster  studios,  lots  of  primary  colors.In  other  respects  too,  Fox  offered  a  path  back  to  a  vanishing  past.  Here  was  a  place  in  which  men  were  firmly  in  charge,  and  in  which  women  were  valued  most  for  their  physical  attractiveness.  Here  was  a  place  in  which  ethnic  minorities  appeared  only  in  secondary  roles  --  and  then,  with  brave  exceptions,  only  to  affirm  the  rightness  of  the  opinions  of  the  white  males  in  the  primary  roles.Back  in  the  1970s,  students  of  public  opinion  had  noticed  a  strange  anomaly:  in  the  very  years,  1967-1973,  when  trust  in  government,  business,  the  military  and  organized  religion  most  sharply  declined,  trust  in  television  rose.  Some  speculated  that  TV  as  an  institution  had  an  inherently  adversarial  relationship  to  other  institutions:  TV  enhanced  its  own  credibility  by  denigrating  the  credibility  of  everything  and  everyone  that  wasn't  TV.That  theory  was  coded  into  the  DNA  of  Fox.  Here,  on  this  station,  the  chosen  market  segment  could  enjoy  security  and  validation.  Out  there  was  depicted  a  hostile  world  of  threats,  danger,  crime,  and  decaying  values.In  the  nearly  two  decades  since  the  launch  of  Fox,  the  average  age  of  the  viewers  has  increased  --  and  so  has  their  alienation  from  a  country  that  twice  elected  Barack  Obama  to  the  presidency.Economic  prospects  have  narrowed  and  darkened  for  middle-income  people.  First  the  stock  market,  then  the  housing  market,  then  the  gold  market  bubbled  and  burst  --  taking  the  savings  of  the  unwary  with  them.  Americans  in  their  60s  have  reason  to  worry  about  the  stability  of  Social  Security  and  Medicare.New  claims  on  government  assistance  --  unemployment  insurance,  health  care  spending  on  under-65s  --  can  be  seen  as  drains  on  resources  that  would  otherwise  flow  to  the  over-65s.The  question  famously  associated  with  Fox  News'  Bill  O'Reilly,  "Who's  looking  out  for  you?"  resonates  especially  powerfully  in  the  ears  of  the  economically  anxious  elderly  in  a  rapidly  changing  country.Gabriel  Sherman  tells  eyebrow-raising  stories  about  Roger  Ailes.  Always  a  man  who  kept  enemies'  lists,  Ailes  has  --  in  Sherman's  account  --  succumbed  to  increasing  apprehension  as  he  has  gained  increasing  power.  His  office  is  secured  with  a  double  set  of  locked  and  coded  doors.  His  country  home  features  a  panic  room.  Former  employees  report  being  followed  and  suspect  their  e-mail  has  been  read.  The  anxiety  that  permeates  Fox  News'  broadcasts  emanates  authentically  from  the  man  at  the  top.  Yet  it  speaks  also  to  something  pervasive  in  Fox's  audience  too.Like  talk  radio  before  it,  but  even  more  intensely,  Fox  offered  information  programmed  not  as  a  stream  of  randomly  connected  facts,  but  as  a  means  of  self-definition  and  a  refuge  from  a  hostile  external  reality.  Fox  is  a  news  medium  that  functions  as  a  social  medium.How  this  new  kind  of  TV  news  was  built,  and  at  what  price,  is  the  story  painstakingly  narrated  by  Gabriel  Sherman  in  his  indispensable  book.

The  reviews  are  in,  and  they  range  from  "meh"  to  middling.The  Daily  Beast,  which  thought  Meyers  got  "off  to  a  rocky  start  on  'Late  Night,'"  noted  that  the  newcomer  "had  a  few  missions  to  accomplish  when  we  ran  into  him  on  Monday  night."From  'Saturday  Night'  to  'Late  Night'"He  had  to  prove  that  Fallon's  reign  isn't  a  fluke,  that  late  night  really  can  be  a  home  for  the  affable  and  good-natured,"  the  Daily  Beast's  Kevin  Fallon  wrote.  "And,  most  importantly,  he  had  to  show  that  the  acute  and  observant  brand  of  humor  he  displayed  for  12  and  a  half  years  on  'Saturday  Night  Live,'  many  of  those  years  spent  as  head  writer  and  host  of  'Weekend  Update,'  translates  to  the  late-night  talk  show  format."Fallon  (we  are  assuming  no  relation  to  Jimmy)  said  it  was  "mission  only  sort  of  accomplished."Jimmy  Fallon's  debut  on  "The  Tonight  Show"  last  week  was  as  big  as  his  personality.  It  featured  a  performance  by  the  band  U2  and  plenty  of  laughs  with  guest  Will  Smith  and  some  of  Fallon's  famous  friends,  including  Stephen  Colbert  and  Tina  Fey.  Meyers  also  got  a  little  help  from  his  friend  Amy  Poehler,  who  was  one  of  his  first  guests  along  with  Vice  President  Joe  Biden.  Poehler,  and  Meyer's  former  "SNL"  castmate,  Fred  Armisen  was  also  part  of  the  show  as  the  leader  of  "Late  Night's"  band.Meyers  even  paid  homage  to  Fallon  in  the  form  of  a  letter  he  wrote  to  his  predecessor,  and  which  he  read  during  the  opening  of  the  show.  So  many  nods  to  his  "SNL"  past  seemed  to  make  sense  to  The  Los  Angeles  Times,  which  observed  that  Meyers'  "monologue  was  reminiscent  in  style  and  cadence  to  his  'Weekend  Update'  segments,  full  of  rapid-fire  one-liners  about  the  day's  headlines.""Though  he  lacked  the  giddy  enthusiasm  that  marked  Fallon's  first  'Tonight'  outing  last  week,  Meyers  frequently  acknowledged  the  show  as  a  work  in  progress,  noting  that  a  monologue  joke  about  UPS  had  bombed  with  the  studio  audience  and  making  fun  of  his  low-budget  graphics,"  the  L.A.  Times'  Meredith  Blake  wrote.Entertainment  Weekly's  Darren  Franich  gave  the  debut  a  grade  of  "B.""I  laughed  at  the  premiere  of  'Late  Night  with  Seth  Meyers'  less  than  I  laughed  at  'The  Tonight  Show  starring  Jimmy  Fallon,'"  Franich  wrote.  "But  I  laughed  more  at  Seth  Meyers  than  I  did  at  Jimmy  Fallon."Music  critic  Ken  Tucker  was  impressed,  tweeting,  "Jeez,  @sethmeyers  @LateNightSeth  makes  eye  contact,  subtly  refers  to  cards,  responds  to  what  guests  say  ...  he's,  like,  an  actual  TALK  show  host!"  Others,  too,  seem  willing  to  give  Meyers  some  time  to  find  his  footing.Michael  Starr  of  the  New  York  Post  wrote  that  Meyers  "eventually  found  his  sea  legs  and  drove  his  new  12:35  p.m.  show  to  a  solid,  if  unspectacular,  debut.  ...  He's  charming  with  a  certain  'aw  shucks'  demeanor  that  doesn't  seem  forced  or  contrived,  and  he'll  have  plenty  of  time  to  grow  into  his  new  role  as  a  late-night  host,"  Starr  said.</TEXT></DOC>

The  straightforward  question  has  anything  but  a  simple  answer,  especially  for  the  government  of  a  nation  founded  on  inalienable  rights  to  life,  liberty  and  the  pursuit  of  happiness.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Washington  (CNN)  --  When  can  a  government  kill  its  own  people?The  straightforward  question  has  anything  but  a  simple  answer,  especially  for  the  government  of  a  nation  founded  on  inalienable  rights  to  life,  liberty  and  the  pursuit  of  happiness.Monday's  news  that  the  Obama  administration  is  considering  a  military  hit  on  an  American  terrorist  raises  anew  the  issue  of  what  justifies  such  a  step,  according  to  both  the  law  and  the  public  conscience  in  an  era  of  political,  social  and  technological  evolution."America's  legitimate  claim  of  self-defense  cannot  be  the  end  of  the  discussion,"  President  Barack  Obama  said  last  year  when  he  announced  new  guidelines  on  drone  strikes  that  target  enemies  for  killing.  "To  say  a  military  tactic  is  legal,  or  even  effective,  is  not  to  say  it  is  wise  or  moral  in  every  instance.  For  the  same  human  progress  that  gives  us  the  technology  to  strike  half  a  world  away  also  demands  the  discipline  to  constrain  that  power  --  or  risk  abusing  it."The  American  Civil  Liberties  Union  contends  the  administration  abuses  its  power,  particularly  when  it  comes  to  drone  strikes  that  have  targeted  foreigners  and  in  some  cases,  American  citizens."Even  in  the  context  of  an  armed  conflict  against  an  armed  group,  the  government  may  use  lethal  force  only  against  individuals  who  are  directly  participating  in  hostilities  against  the  United  States,"  the  group  says  on  its  website.  "Regardless  of  the  context,  whenever  the  government  uses  lethal  force,  it  must  take  all  possible  steps  to  avoid  harming  civilian  bystanders.  But  these  are  not  the  standards  that  the  executive  branch  is  using."Here  are  questions  about  what  the  government  is  doing,  with  explanation  of  why  and  arguments  against:1)  What  does  targeted  killing  mean,  and  how  widespread  is  it?After  the  September  11,  2001,  terrorist  attacks  on  the  United  States,  a  traumatized  nation  responded  with  new  laws  that  greatly  expanded  the  government's  power  to  fight  terrorism.Wars  were  launched  in  Afghanistan  and  then  Iraq,  and  the  national  intelligence  system  expanded  to  new  capacity  disclosed  in  last  year's  classified  leaks  by  former  National  Security  Agency  contractor  Edward  Snowden.Part  of  the  expanded  powers  included  legal  authorization  to  target  terrorists  defined  as  enemies  of  the  state  --  people  determined  to  be  fighting  a  war  against  America.The  CIA  and  the  military  have  used  drones  and  covert  missions  to  take  out  such  targets,  including  drone  strikes  that  killed  U.S.  citizen  Anwar  al-Awlaki,  a  wanted  terrorist,  and  three  other  Americans.Unofficial  estimates  based  on  reports  by  human  rights  groups  and  media  accounts  indicate  the  Obama  administration  has  carried  out  hundreds  of  drone  strikes  that  have  killed  hundreds  and  perhaps  thousands  of  people,  including  terrorists  and  civilians,  in  an  escalation  of  the  practice  started  by  the  Bush  administration.Most  have  occurred  in  Afghanistan,  but  others  have  taken  place  in  countries  where  no  ground  war  was  occurring  including  Yemen,  where  al-Awlaki  and  the  two  other  Americans  died  in  2011.2)  Is  it  legal  for  the  government  to  target  and  kill  people?In  his  May  2013  speech  at  the  National  Defense  University,  Obama  proclaimed  the  practice  completely  legal."Under  domestic  law,  and  international  law,  the  United  States  is  at  war  with  al  Qaeda,  the  Taliban,  and  their  associated  forces,"  he  said.  "We  are  at  war  with  an  organization  that  right  now  would  kill  as  many  Americans  as  they  could  if  we  did  not  stop  them  first.  So  this  is  a  just  war  --  a  war  waged  proportionally,  in  last  resort,  and  in  self-defense."Critics,  however,  say  the  government  oversteps  the  legal  boundaries  of  the  Constitution  and  international  law,  particularly  by  making  decisions  on  targeted  killings  in  secret  without  going  before  any  court."The  result  is  that  the  public  remains  in  the  dark  about  how  exactly  U.S.  policy  governing  targeted  killings  is  operating,  under  which  legal  authorities,  and  who  exactly  are  its  victims,"  said  a  letter  to  Obama  in  December  from  nine  rights  groups.Hina  Shamsi,  who  directs  the  ACLU's  National  Security  Project,  told  CNN  that  the  Obama  administration  was  "fighting  hard"  to  prevent  a  judicial  review  of  the  strikes  that  killed  al-Awlaki  and  the  other  Americans,  including  the  terrorist's  16-year-old  son.Until  allegations  in  classified  documents  can  be  assessed  in  court,  she  said,  the  question  of  whether  they  amount  to  real  evidence  remains  unanswered.Shamsi  called  the  U.S.  actions  "one  of  the  most  extreme  and  dangerous  forms  of  authority  that  the  executive  branch  can  claim  --  the  power  to  kill  people  based  on  vague  and  shifting  legal  standards,  secret  evidence  and  no  judicial  review  even  after  the  fact."In  2010,  a  federal  judge  in  Washington  noted  the  government  would  need  permission  from  a  federal  court  to  wiretap  al-Awlaki,  but  that  no  such  court  process  existed  in  order  to  kill  him.Rejecting  an  effort  by  al-Awlaki's  father  to  block  his  son's  possible  extrajudicial  killing,  U.S.  District  Judge  John  Bates  called  it  "somewhat  unsettling"  that  a  president  could  --  for  national  security  reasons  --  make  a  unilateral  decision  to  kill  a  U.S.  citizen  overseas  and  the  decision  would  be  "judicially  unreviewable."3)  Even  if  it  is  legal  by  the  letter  of  the  law,  is  it  morally  or  politically  right?Obama  has  insisted  his  responsibility  as  commander  in  chief  to  protect  Americans  from  attack  justified  targeted  killings  like  the  drone  strike  on  al-Awlaki.In  his  speech  last  May,  he  rejected  targeting  an  American  citizen  without  what  he  called  "due  process,"  meaning  adherence  to  full  legal  procedures.  Then  he  explained  the  reasoning  for  the  al-Awlaki  hit  two  years  earlier,  before  the  expanded  policy  guidelines  he  was  announcing."When  a  U.S.  citizen  goes  abroad  to  wage  war  against  America  and  is  actively  plotting  to  kill  U.S.  citizens,  and  when  neither  the  United  States,  nor  our  partners  are  in  a  position  to  capture  him  before  he  carries  out  a  plot,  his  citizenship  should  no  more  serve  as  a  shield  than  a  sniper  shooting  down  on  an  innocent  crowd  should  be  protected  from  a  SWAT  team,"  Obama  said,  citing  al-Awlaki  by  name."I  would  have  detained  and  prosecuted  Awlaki  if  we  captured  him  before  he  carried  out  a  plot,  but  we  couldn't,"  Obama  continued.  "And  as  President,  I  would  have  been  derelict  in  my  duty  had  I  not  authorized  the  strike  that  took  him  out."Shamsi,  who  argued  the  ACLU's  federal  court  case  seeking  judicial  review  of  the  strikes  on  al-Awlaki  and  two  other  Americans,  contended  that  the  government  has  failed  to  adhere  to  the  oversight  it  set  up  for  targeted  killings."Policy  restrictions  are  well  and  good,  but  the  administration  appears  to  have  gone  well  beyond  them  based  on  the  investigate  reports  of  human  rights  organizations  and  media  accounts,"  she  said  Monday.4)  Does  it  work?Ever  the  politician,  Obama  argued  forcefully  last  year  that  targeted  killings  were  a  necessary  tool  in  the  expanding  battle  against  international  terrorism."Dozens  of  highly  skilled  al  Qaeda  commanders,  trainers,  bomb  makers  and  operatives  have  been  taken  off  the  battlefield,"  he  said.  "Plots  have  been  disrupted  that  would  have  targeted  international  aviation,  U.S.  transit  systems,  European  cities  and  our  troops  in  Afghanistan.  Simply  put,  these  strikes  have  saved  lives."Critics,  including  congressional  Republicans,  argue  the  President's  anti-terrorism  strategy,  which  in  many  ways  extended  programs  and  practices  started  after  the  9/11  attacks  under  the  Bush  administration,  have  failed  to  effectively  curtail  al  Qaeda.Asked  last  week  at  a  congressional  hearing  if  al  Qaeda  was  stronger  or  weaker  today  than  before  the  9/11  attacks,  Director  of  National  Intelligence  James  Clapper  struggled  to  find  an  answer  before  conceding  the  terrorist  network  now  was  more  widespread  and  therefore  more  difficult  to  combat.At  the  same  hearing,  House  Intelligence  Committee  Chairman  Mike  Rogers  argued  that  tighter  restrictions  on  targeted  killings  announced  by  Obama  in  last  year's  policy  speech  had  weakened  the  government's  fight  against  terrorism."Today,  individuals  who  would  have  been  previously  removed  from  the  battlefield  by  U.S.  counter-terrorism  operations  for  attacking  or  plotting  to  attack  against  U.S.  interests  remain  free  because  of  self-imposed  red  tape,"  the  Michigan  Republican  said,  adding  that  "the  President's  May  2013  policy  changes  for  the  U.S.  targeted  strikes  are  an  utter  and  complete  failure,  and  they  leave  Americans'  lives  at  risk."However,  the  criticism  by  Rogers  differs  from  Shamsi's  accusation  that  the  administration  fails  to  adhere  to  the  stated  policies  of  increased  oversight  and  following  due  process.  Rogers  complained  that  the  problem  involved  confusion  over  the  U.S.  policies.5)  Is  it  worth  it?To  Obama,  the  need  to  take  out  war  enemies  supersedes  the  potential  political  fallout  at  home  and  abroad  over  drone  strikes  and  other  targeted  killings.He  argued  last  year  that  doing  nothing  would  invite  "far  more  civilian  casualties"  by  terrorists  targeting  U.S.  cities  as  well  as  foreign  strongholds  in  Yemen,  Afghanistan,  Somalia  and  elsewhere."Remember  that  the  terrorists  we  are  after  target  civilians,  and  the  death  toll  from  their  acts  of  terrorism  against  Muslims  dwarfs  any  estimate  of  civilian  casualties  from  drone  strikes,"  he  argued,  saying  that  "doing  nothing  is  not  an  option."Obama  also  contended  the  drone  strikes  were  less  risky  than  conventional  weapons  or  "boots  on  the  ground"  in  terms  of  collateral  damage  and  broader  political  repercussions."It  is  false  to  assert  that  putting  boots  on  the  ground  is  less  likely  to  result  in  civilian  deaths  or  less  likely  to  create  enemies  in  the  Muslim  world,"  he  said,  referring  to  unpopular  U.S.  military  incidents  of  recent  decades.  "The  results  would  be  more  U.S.  deaths,  more  Black  Hawks  down,  more  confrontations  with  local  populations,  and  an  inevitable  mission  creep  in  support  of  such  raids  that  could  easily  escalate  into  new  wars."On  the  ground,  though,  drone  strikes  that  kill  civilians  evoke  rage  and  resentment  against  the  United  States  that  can  breed  more  anti-American  activism.  To  Shamsi,  the  threat  also  is  to  core  American  values  back  home."There's  enough  credible  reporting  about  tragic  wrongful  killings  and  mistakes  having  been  made,"  she  told  CNN.  "It  helps  neither  the  security  of  the  United  States  nor  the  victims  of  its  policies,  because  in  the  end,  long-term  national  security  depends  on  our  real  commitment  to  our  laws  and  our  values."CNN's  Evan  Perez  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Woodley  wore  Alexander  McQueen;  James,  an  affable  Brit,  signed  autographs.  Both  answered  questions.  The  fans  ate  it  up.And  why  not?  "Divergent"  is  being  touted  as  the  new  "Hunger  Games."  That's  no  surprise,  given  its  action-oriented  female  heroine,  youthful  cast  and  post-apocalyptic  setting.  The  film  is  based  on  the  first  book  in  a  best-selling  trilogy  by  Veronica  Roth,  a  series  that  also  earned  comparisons  to  Suzanne  Collins'  "Hunger  Games"  works.If  "Divergent"  does  half  as  well  as  the  "Hunger  Games"  films  --  the  most  recent  of  which,  "Catching  Fire,"  topped  the  2013  box  office  and  made  $865  million  worldwide  --  its  backers  will  be  very  happy.Which  is  why  Woodley  --  perhaps  best  known  for  performances  in  the  film  "The  Descendants"  and  the  TV  series  "The  Secret  Life  of  the  American  Teenager"  --  is  receiving  Jennifer  Lawrence-type  attention.She's  on  the  current  cover  of  Marie  Claire,  has  been  the  subject  of  press  releases  noting  her  choice  of  designer  clothing,  and  is  being  mentioned  in  gossip-style  headlines  mentioning  the  age  of  her  first  kiss  (15,  incidentally)  and  her  love  of  "Descendants"  co-star  George  Clooney.Woodley,  22,  says  she's  a  little  surprised  by  the  response."I  don't  know  much  about  that  world.  None  of  us  really  engage  in  social  media,"  she  said  at  a  CNN  Center  interview  the  day  after  the  Atlanta  screening.  "So  last  night  was  sort  of  a  shock.  'Oh,  other  people  know  about  this  movie,  too.'  "James,  29,  hasn't  escaped  the  microscope.  The  actor  is  also  the  subject  of  publicists'  e-mail  blasts  and  has  been  romantically  linked  to  Woodley  in  British  tabloid  headlines.  Though  Woodley  told  Teen  Vogue  that  she  hasn't  had  a  boyfriend  in  five  years,  the  two  do  have  an  easy  rapport.James  said  he  welcomes  the  fans'  passion."It's  good  to  be  involved  in  something  that  has  a  bunch  of  people  invested  in  the  material  already,"  he  said.'You  have  to  make  bold  decisions'Ah,  passion.  It  certainly  doesn't  hurt  ticket  sales  --  and  neither  does  the  tittle-tattle."Divergent"  has  been  a  hot  property  ever  since  author  Roth  sold  the  rights  to  the  trilogy  before  she  even  graduated  college.  The  story  is  set  in  a  post-apocalyptic  Chicago  in  which  the  culture  has  been  divided  into  five  factions:  Abnegation,  who  believe  in  altruism;  Amity,  the  peaceful  ones;  Erudite,  the  intellectuals;  Candor,  the  bluntly  honest;  and  Dauntless,  the  fearless  warrior  class.Beatrice  "Tris"  Prior  --  the  character  played  by  Woodley  --  is  the  daughter  of  two  Abnegation  parents.  At  16,  like  everyone  else,  she  takes  an  aptitude  test  to  find  the  most  appropriate  faction  for  her  personality.  She  finds  out  she's  "Divergent,"  with  equal  aptitude  for  more  than  one  faction.  However,  since  such  a  classification  is  considered  threatening  to  society,  she's  told  to  keep  the  information  to  herself.  She  ends  up  joining  Dauntless,  much  to  the  disappointment  of  her  parents  --  "faction  before  blood,"  goes  one  of  the  culture's  mottoes  --  and  undergoes  a  boot  camp  at  which  she  meets  Four  (James),  one  of  the  camp  leaders.From  there  the  plot  concerns  Tris'  attempts  to  fit  in  --  or  not  --  Four's  secrets  (there's  a  connection  with  a  political  leader)  and  run-ins  with  the  Erudite  chief,  Jeanine  Matthews,  played  by  a  chilling  Kate  Winslet.The  book  series,  which  also  includes  the  sequels  "Insurgent"  and  "Allegiant,"  has  sold  more  than  10  million  copies.  More  importantly,  it's  got  that  powerful  fan  base.  There  are  several  fan  sites  devoted  to  the  series  on  the  Internet,  and  Roth  has  more  than  200,000  Twitter  followers.Such  a  following  can  both  help  and  hurt  a  movie.  Certainly  there  will  be  huge  crowds  awaiting  "Divergent's"  midnight  showing,  but  if  Tris  and  Four  (and  the  ruins  of  Chicago,  which  are  their  own  character  in  the  movie)  don't  live  up  to  their  vision,  the  backlash  could  be  fierce.James,  however,  says  that  comes  with  the  territory."You  have  to  make  your  own  decisions  based  on  what  you  perceive  the  character  to  be,"  said  James.  "You  have  to  make  bold  decisions,  stick  with  them,  and  whatever  will  be,  will  be."Your  guide  to  film  adaptations  in  2014'Everyone  is  multi-dimensional'The  two  had  plenty  of  help  getting  into  character.  They  had  their  own  boot  camp  to  get  into  physical  shape,  and  did  some  of  their  own  stunts  --  though  stuntpeople  stood  in  for  the  big  falls,  and  special  effects  helped  with  certain  details,  like  a  zip-line  run  off  Chicago's  John  Hancock  Center.They  did  go  up  in  the  big  Ferris  wheel  on  the  Navy  Pier,  which  Woodley  remembers  as  a  special  night."It  was  a  full  moon,  so  we  got  to  watch  the  moon  go  across  the  sky  and  go  up  and  down  this  crazy  75-foot  ladder.  It  was  just  magic,"  she  said.  "It's  one  of  those  moments  where  you  wonder  how  you  got  this  life."Indeed,  Woodley  continues  enjoying  "this  life."  She  says  she's  had  good  mentors  in  actors  such  as  Clooney,  Laura  Dern  and  Winslet,  people  who  "show  up  early,  show  up  prepared.""They  all  have  in  common  the  fact  that  they  love  the  art  of  acting,  still.  They  love  being  on  a  movie  set,"  she  said.As  "Divergent's"  release  nears,  the  two  --  along  with  youthful  co-stars  including  Miles  Teller,  Jai  Courtney  and  Ansel  Elgort  --  will  see  if  they  can  hold  on  to  their  love  of  acting  in  the  midst  of  a  celebrity  culture  that  would  like  to  reduce  them  to  gossip  fodder  as  superficial  as  members  of  "Divergent's"  single-minded  factions.  History  offers  mixed  lessons:  The  shrewd  and  award-winning  Lawrence  and  the  "Harry  Potter"  kids  have  apparently  succeeded.  Other  young  actors  burn  out  as  quickly  as  they  rise.James  --  a  veteran  of  several  British  TV  series,  including  an  episode  of  "Downton  Abbey"  --  seems  intent  on  making  the  most  of  the  opportunity  to  widen  his  horizons.  As  pre-production  begins  on  "Insurgent"  and  "Allegiant,"  he's  already  done  two  other  films:  A  version  of  Martin  Amis'  novel  "London  Fields"  and  a  film  called  "Franny"  from  indie  director  Andrew  Renzi.  He  may  be  living  by  one  of  the  lessons  of  the  film."One  of  the  key  messages  of  the  film  is  that  no  one  can  be  categorized,"  he  said.  "Everyone  is  multidimensional."And  Woodley?  She's  taking  it  easy  for  now.  But,  like  the  quietly  astute  Tris,  she  understands  that  you  don't  present  all  that  you  are."I  think  it's  important  to  have  your  own  secrets,  preserve  your  own  personal  space,"  she  said.  "You  don't  give  all  of  yourself  away."Young  adult  books  from  page  to  screen</TEXT></DOC>

That's  the  question  historians  are  trying  to  answer  after  a  collection  surfaced  of  some  450  photo  booth  portraits,  taken  of  the  same  man  over  what  appears  to  be  decades.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  He  smiles.  He  stares.  He  sits  without  apparent  expression.Who  is  he?That's  the  question  historians  are  trying  to  answer  after  a  collection  surfaced  of  some  450  photo  booth  portraits,  taken  of  the  same  man  over  what  appears  to  be  decades.No  one  knows  who  he  is  or  why  he  made,  and  kept,  the  photographs."Not  knowing  is  very  mysterious.  It's  like  an  abstract  painting.  You're  going  to  fill  in  the  blanks  yourself.  You  bring  to  it  what  you  know,  and  if  we  don't  know  anything,  we  sort  of  make  up  a  story,"  said  Donald  Lokuta,  a  photography  historian  and  owner  of  the  collection.The  photographs  are  being  shown  as  part  of  "Striking  Resemblance:  The  Changing  Art  of  Portraiture,"  an  exhibition  on  display  through  July  at  Zimmerli  Art  Museum  at  Rutgers  University  in  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey.Lokuta  bought  the  prints  a  year  or  two  ago  at  an  antiques  show  in  New  York.  He  was  immediately  drawn  to  the  images  and  to  the  mystery  behind  them.The  photographs  were  taken  in  a  Photomatic  photo  booth.  They  are  small.  Most  have  metal  frames,  though  some  of  the  later  ones  have  either  cardboard  or  plastic  frames.Lokuta  guesses  the  photographs  were  made  over  a  roughly  30-year  period,  starting  in  the  1930s.  He  speculates  on  why  the  man  made  so  many  and  talks  about  the  prints'  appeal."He  was  either  hooked  on  self-portraits  and  kind  of  wanted  to  see  himself  in  a  photograph  constantly,  or  he  worked  for  the  company  maintaining  the  machine,"  said  Lokuta.The  theory  that  he  worked  in  maintenance  for  the  photo  booth  company  mirrors  the  plot  of  the  French  film  "Amelie,"  as  CNN.com  readers  have  noted."It's  the  same  guy,  and  he's  getting  a  little  older,  and  a  little  older  and  a  little  older.  Then  his  hair  is  messed  up,  then  his  hair  is  neat.  Then  he's  smiling  a  little  bit,  then  he's  not  smiling.  Then  he's  wearing  a  winter  jacket,  then  he's  wearing  a  sports  jacket,"  Lokuta  said."It's  just  so  familiar.  It's  like  looking  at  yourself  in  the  mirror  every  morning."A  potential  leadAfter  purchasing  the  photographs,  Lokuta  got  curious  about  where  they  might  have  come  from.He  got  in  touch  with  Nakki  Goranin,  author  of  "American  Photobooth."Besides  being  a  wealth  of  knowledge  about  that  particular  chapter  of  U.S.  history,  Goranin  owns  some  images  of  the  same  man.Turns  out,  the  people  who  sold  Lokuta  the  collection  had  previously  sold  a  few  of  the  photographs  on  eBay.Goranin  bought  those  prints,  which  stand  out  because  unlike  the  445  that  Lokuta  has,  Goranin's  photographs  show  the  man  with  children.She  tracked  down  the  sellers,  who  told  her  the  photographs  came  from  an  auction  in  Michigan."I  have  a  strong  suspicion  who  the  gentleman  is,"  said  Goranin,  "but  I'm  not  100%  sure."She  declined  to  give  the  name  of  the  man  she  thinks  appears  in  the  photographs  until  she  can  do  more  research.Selfies  show  'ongoing  portrait'Zimmerli  curator  Donna  Gustafson  believes  that  having  a  story  to  go  along  with  the  man's  face  would  be  interesting."Having  a  name  to  attach  to  the  face  would  maybe  in  a  way  close  the  book  on  it,  but  on  the  other  hand,  might  open  a  new  book  or  a  new  chapter,"  she  said.Gustafson  and  Lokuta  are  friends.  She  knew  as  soon  as  he  showed  her  the  photographs  she  wanted  them  for  her  portraiture  exhibition.Gustafson  says  she  doesn't  really  have  a  favorite  from  the  collection."What  I  love  the  most  is  how  all  of  them  sort  of  blend  into  an  ongoing  portrait  of  someone  over  time,"  she  said.Gustafson  also  loves  the  mystery."We  just  really  don't  know  much  about  the  man  except  that  he  seems  to  have  enjoyed  having  his  photo  --  his  selfie  --  done,  and  he  saved  them  all,"  she  said."He  seems  like  such  an  average  guy,  but  this  clearly  sort  of  catapults  him  out  of  average  into  really  interesting  because  why  would  he  do  this?  And  how  is  it  possible  that  we  have  445  pictures  of  a  man  and  we  know  nothing  about  him?"</TEXT></DOC>

You  won't  need  skis  or  skates  --  you  don't  even  have  to  feel  the  cold  wind  against  your  skin  --  to  show  your  appreciation  for  the  athletes  or  to  experience  just  a  bit  of  what  they  must  have  felt  when  competing  at  the  Winter  Olympic  Games.Chamonix,  France  (1924)More  than  10,000  paying  spectators  came  to  watch  11  women  and  247  men  compete  in  ice  hockey,  figure  skating,  speed  skating,  bobsleighing,  curling,  Nordic  (cross-country)  skiing  and  ski  jumping  at  Chamonix  Winter  Sports  Week  90  years  ago.  It  wasn't  until  after  the  event  proved  to  be  such  a  success  that  it  became  known  as  the  "first"  Winter  Olympic  Games.Although  few  reminders  of  those  games  remain,  the  Alpine  Museum  in  Chamonix  houses  some  mementos,  and  the  Catholic  Church  Èglise  Saint-Michel  à  Chamonix  commemorates  the  region's  Olympic  heritage  with  a  stained  glass  window  featuring  skiers  and  a  bobsleigh.  And  this  charming  alpine  village  near  Mont  Blanc  --  the  "roof  of  Europe"  --  still  offers  a  world-class  winter  experience  to  athletes  and  bar-hoppers  alike.Photos:  Remnants  of  glory  in  former  Olympic  citiesSt.  Moritz,  Switzerland  (1928  and  1948)When  15-year-old  Norwegian  figure  skating  sensation  Sonja  Henie  performed  her  gold-medal-winning  routine  on  the  ice  rink  outside  the  Badrutt  family's  Kulm  Hotel  in  1928,  the  location  couldn't  have  been  more  appropriate.  In  1864,  hotelier  Johannes  Badrutt  turned  St.  Moritz  into  a  winter  vacation  destination  by  convincing  his  summertime  guests  that  they'd  enjoy  the  Swiss  Alps  just  as  much  in  winter.Sportsman  Alphonse  Badrutt  supported  construction  of  the  natural  ice  St.  Moritz-Celerina  bobsleigh  run.  And  Johannes'  grandson,  Hans,  was  a  member  of  the  executive  committees  that  brought  the  1928  games  to  St.  Moritz.  The  Kulm  and  Badrutt's  Palace  hotels  are  still  St.  Moritz  landmarks,  as  is  the  St.  Moritz-Celerina  bobsleigh  run,  which  is  open  to  guest  riders  when  it's  not  being  used  by  Olympians-in-training.Sochi  hotels  report  construction  delaysLake  Placid,  New  York  (1932  and  1980)Although  Lake  Placid  hosted  the  games  in  1932,  it  is  most  remembered  for  the  U.S.  athletes'  performances  at  the  1980  Winter  Olympic  Games  --  especially  the  U.S.  men's  ice  hockey  team's  "Miracle  on  Ice"  victory  over  the  heavily  favored  Soviet  team  followed  by  their  gold-medal  win  over  Finland  and  Eric  Heiden's  unprecedented  five  gold  medals  in  speed  skating.That  historic  speed-skating  oval  stands  just  outside  the  Lake  Placid  Olympic  Center,  which  houses  a  small  museum  and  the  hockey  arena  now  dedicated  to  coach  Herb  Brooks.  The  whole  Whiteface  and  Mount  Van  Hoevenberg  area  remains  a  top-level  training  ground  for  future  Olympians;  and  if  you're  feeling  adventurous,  the  Lake  Placid  Bobsled  Experience  lets  you  try  out  the  track  they  still  use  today  for  their  training.Sochi  2014:  Russia's  numbers  gameOslo,  Norway  (1952)It  sometimes  seems  as  if  the  Olympic  Winter  Games  were  created  to  remind  the  world  just  how  many  outstanding  winter  athletes  come  from  Norway.  (No  country  has  won  more  medals  in  the  Winter  Olympic  Games.)So  when  you're  in  Oslo,  it's  no  surprise  that  the  Holmenkollen  ski  jump  is  still  the  biggest  thing  in  town.  Ski  jumping  has  been  part  of  the  action  here  since  1892,  and  the  jump  has  been  redeveloped  more  than  a  dozen  times.  The  latest  structure,  which  opened  in  2010,  is  made  of  steel  and  stretches  nearly  97  meters  (318  feet).The  Ski  Simulator  at  the  top  of  the  hill  is  a  virtual  reality  experience  that  will  leave  you  breathless  and  more  awestruck  by  ski-jumpers  than  ever.  The  arena  next  to  the  ski  jump  was  used  for  cross-country  skiing  and  biathlon  competitions  in  1952,  and  might  be  again  should  Oslo  win  its  bid  to  host  the  2022  Winter  Olympics.Blood  Falls  and  other  natural  odditiesInnsbruck,  Austria  (1964  and  1976)The  Tyrolean  Alps  were  a  picture-perfect  backdrop  for  Olympic  skiing  competition  in  1976  as  Austrian  favorite  Franz  Klammer  seemed  to  gobble  up  the  terrain  on  his  way  to  a  gold  medal  in  the  men's  downhill  and  West  Germany's  Rosi  Mittermaier  took  two  golds  and  a  silver  in  the  women's  downhill  and  slalom  events.You'll  want  more  than  the  1  minute  45  seconds  or  so  that  Klammer  and  Mittermaier  spent  on  the  mountain.  Take  your  time  to  soak  in  the  scenery  on  an  evening  lantern  hike  that  takes  you  past  the  Olympic  ski  slopes  and  ends  with  singing  and  beverages  at  a  friendly  inn.Sapporo,  Japan  (1972)The  double  lift  takes  just  five  minutes  to  carry  you  to  the  top  of  the  Okurayama  90-meter  ski  jump  hill  where,  in  1972,  19-year-old  Wojciech  Fortuna  became  the  first  and  only  Polish  man  to  win  an  Olympic  ski-jumping  gold  medal.  (In  1972,  transport  to  the  top  took  20  minutes;  the  trip  down  for  Fortuna,  less  than  20  seconds.)The  viewing  lounge  at  300  meters  allows  you  to  peer  down  at  the  city  and  at  the  ski  jump  starting  line.  At  the  Sapporo  Winter  Sports  Museum,  simulators  in  the  "Sensation/Experience  Zone"  replicate  the  ski  jump  experience.Calgary,  Canada  (1988)The  Olympic  spirit  has  never  left  Calgary,  where  Katarina  Witt  won  a  gold  medal  in  figure  skating  for  East  Germany  and  curling  resurfaced  as  a  demonstration  sport  after  an  absence  of  more  than  50  years.  In  addition  to  marking  the  Olympic  debut  of  American  speed  skater  Bonnie  Blair,  the  Calgary  Olympics  also  introduced  the  world  to  the  Jamaican  Bobsleigh  Team  (later  immortalized  in  the  1993  film  "Cool  Runnings").Today,  visitors  with  just  slightly  less  bobsleigh  training  than  those  four  gentlemen  can  slide  down  the  very  same  track  at  speeds  of  up  to  75  miles  per  hour  (120  km/h)  in  a  bobsleigh  driven  by  a  professional  pilot.  In  summer,  you  can  do  the  run  in  a  bobsleigh  on  wheels  or  zip-line  down  the  mountain  from  the  90-meter  ski  jump.Albertville,  France  (1992)At  the  Albertville  games,  the  newly  unified  German  team  included  singles  luger  Georg  Hackl  in  his  second  of  what  would  be  five  Olympic  games  winning  his  first  of  three  gold  medals.  Today,  as  a  visitor,  you  can  come  as  close  as  you'll  ever  come  to  his  experience  on  the  speed  luge  at  the  La  Plagne  Olympic  bobsleigh  track  --  a  one-person  luge  that  reaches  speeds  up  to  55  miles  per  hour  (89  kph).Or  rub  elbows  with  an  Olympian  at  a  more  relaxed  pace  at  Le  Chalet  d'Eleonore  in  Les  Saisies,  an  alpine-style  bed  and  breakfast  run  by  former  Olympic  skier  Leila  Piccard.  (Her  brother  Franck,  a  gold  medalist  in  the  Super-G  at  the  Calgary  Games,  works  at  the  Les  Saisies  ski  resort.)Salt  Lake  City,  Utah  (2002)Guided  tours  of  Utah  Olympic  Park  near  Park  City  reveal  some  "backstage"  secrets  about  the  Olympic  events  and  visit  some  memorable  spots,  such  as  the  ski  jump  where  20-year-old  Simon  Ammann  from  Switzerland  was  a  surprise  gold-medal  winner  and  undisputed  crowd-pleaser  in  the  K90  Individual  and  K120  individual  events.At  the  Alf  Engen  Ski  Museum,  you  can  find  out  more  about  the  region's  Olympic  skiing  past,  present  and  future,  including  an  exhibition  on  the  U.S.  women's  ski  jumping  team,  which  will  compete  for  the  first  time  in  Olympic  history  at  Sochi.  After  taking  a  look  at  the  Olympic  medals  in  the  museum's  collection,  head  back  to  Salt  Lake  City  and  Olympic  Cauldron  Park  where  the  medal  ceremonies  took  place.Vancouver,  Canada  (2010)Many  venues  from  the  2010  Olympic  Winter  Games  have  been  smoothly  integrated  or  reintegrated  into  the  Vancouver  landscape.  BC  Place,  site  of  the  opening  and  closing  ceremonies,  is  back  to  being  the  home  of  the  BC  Lions  (CFL)  and  Vancouver  Whitecaps  (MLS)  and  hockey  venue  Rogers  Arena  remains  the  home  of  the  NHL  Vancouver  Canucks.The  Olympic  cauldron  stands  outside  the  Vancouver  Convention  Centre.  The  Richmond  Olympic  Oval,  where  Dutch  speed  skater  Sven  Kramer  set  new  Olympic  records  in  the  5,000  and  10,000  meter  races,  is  now  a  public  skating  rink,  community  center  and  future  site  of  the  interactive  Richmond  Olympic  Experience,  expected  to  open  in  late  2014.While  there  are  Olympic  sites  throughout  the  area,  you  might  find  yourself  closest  to  your  athletic  dreams  if  you  spend  the  night  at  the  HI-Whistler  Hostel,  originally  part  of  the  Athlete's  Village.</TEXT></DOC>

The  answer  isn't  as  simple  as  some  gun  control  advocates  would  want,  she  says,  nor  as  black  and  white  as  many  Second  Amendment  advocates  would  claim  --  especially  for  those  in  the  military.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Dr.  Elspeth  Cameron  Ritchie  is  a  retired  Army  colonel  and  psychiatrist  who  served  as  the  Office  of  the  Army  Surgeon  General's  top  advocate  for  mental  health.  She  is  now  the  chief  clinical  officer  for  the  District  of  Columbia's  Department  of  Behavioral  Health.  The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  the  author.(CNN)  --  A  month  before  Spc.  Ivan  Lopez  opened  fire  at  Fort  Hood's  First  Medical  Brigade  Building,  he  was  under  the  care  of  military  doctors,  having  been  evaluated  and  treated  for  depression,  anxiety  and  sleep  disorders,  according  to  military  officials.Lopez  reportedly  purchased  his  .45  caliber  Smith  &  Wesson  handgun  legally  at  Guns  Galore,  a  gun  store  near  Killeen,  Texas,  on  March  1.  He  had  no  criminal  history  that  would  disqualify  him  from  owning  a  gun  in  Texas.  His  background  check  was  clear.Barely  a  month  later,  that  same  gun  would  be  used  to  end  the  lives  of  three  people  and  wound  16  others  before  being  used  by  Lopez  to  kill  himself.But  should  he  have  been  allowed  to  have  that  gun  in  the  first  place?The  answer  isn't  as  simple  as  some  gun  control  advocates  would  want,  nor  as  black  and  white  as  many  Second  Amendment  advocates  would  claim,  especially  for  those  in  the  military.Latest  Fort  Hood  shooting  revives  broader  gun  debateFirst,  let  me  be  clear:  If  Lopez  had  been  determined  to  have  been  suffering  from  a  severe  enough  form  of  mental  illness  to  have  posed  a  threat  to  himself  or  others  --  or  had  a  history  of  violence  --  he  should  never  have  been  allowed  to  remain  in  the  Army  in  the  first  place,  much  less  allowed  to  own  a  gun.  There  is,  at  best,  conflicting  evidence  in  this  case  whether  that  was  true.But  if  he  was  only  diagnosed  with  one  of  the  more  common,  milder  form  of  mental  illness  --  the  same  kinds  of  ailments  that  afflict  millions  of  nonviolent  Americans  every  day  --  then  there  is  little  evidence  to  support  that  taking  away  his  right  to  own  a  gun  would  be  the  prudent  or  legal  thing  to  do,  even  for  a  soldier  in  the  military.Psychiatric  issues  'fundamental  underlying  causal  factor'Mental  illness,  much  like  physical  illness,  covers  a  whole  spectrum,  from  mild  disorders  like  depression  to  severe  issues  such  as  paranoia  and  schizophrenia.  The  military  already  attempts  to  screen  out  new  recruits  who  have  anything  more  than  a  mild  problem.There  are  screens  as  you  come  into  the  military  --  some  of  which  are  based  on  self-reporting  --  and  there  is  screening  when  you  return  from  a  deployment  or  combat.For  instance,  everybody  coming  back  from  deployment  has  a  post-deployment  health  assessment.  Then,  three  to  six  months  later,  they  get  a  post-deployment  health  re-assessment.  If  primary  care  personnel  see  any  problems  with  a  soldier  and  depression  or  anxiety,  then  he  or  she  is  referred  to  behavioral  health  experts  for  a  deeper  assessment.But  there  lies  the  tricky  part.  Because  much  of  these  issues  rely  on  self-reporting,  if  a  soldier,  sailor,  airman  or  Marine  wants  to  stay  in  the  military,  by  and  large  they'll  just  say  "everything  is  fine."There  are  two  kinds  of  soldiers:  the  one  who  is  trying  to  stay  in  the  military,  who  is  not  going  to  admit  to  anything  that  may  lead  to  being  kicked  out,  and  the  one  who  is  trying  to  leave  the  military,  who  is  more  likely  to  come  clean  and  get  treatment  for  things  like  post-traumatic  stress  disorder.That's  why  their  buddies  play  an  important  role.  In  the  military,  there  is  a  strong  sense  of  the  need  to  watch  out  for  your  fellow  soldier,  but  that  also  means  taking  care  of  fellow  soldiers  if  they  need  treatment  for  difficulties.As  we  have  seen  the  skyrocketing  of  suicides  among  active  duty  military  personnel,  I  helped  to  develop  a  card  called  ACE  --  ASK,  CARE,  ESCORT.  If  you  are  worried  about  a  buddy,  ask  if  they  are  OK,  take  care  of  them  if  they  need  help  and  then  bring  them  to  a  base  chaplain,  mental  health  official  or  their  commanding  officer.But  there  is  still  much  more  to  be  done  to  prevent  military  suicides  and  tragic  incidents  like  what  we  saw  Wednesday  at  Fort  Hood.PTSD:  9  questions,  answeredWe've  seen  the  immediate  "stressers"  that  have  led  to  the  dramatic  increase  in  suicides  in  the  military  tend  to  be  either  problems  in  relationships  --  spouses,  friends,  family  --  or  problems  in  the  workplace.  Often,  they  both  can  be  happening  at  once;  we  call  that  a  psychological  toxin.For  instance,  say  your  girlfriend  tells  you  she's  pregnant  by  another  man,  or  your  boss  or  commanding  officer  is  giving  you  a  hard  time  on  the  job.  If  those  happen  separately,  they  can  be  difficult  to  manage,  particularly  for  someone  with  severe  mental  illness.  But  when  they  happen  at  the  same  time  --  particularly  if  there  are  delusions,  paranoia  and  easy  access  to  weapons  --  it  can  be  a  deadly  spark.So,  we  need  to  be  extra  vigilant  when  looking  for  those  stressers,  and  help  those  in  the  military  who  need  someone  to  talk  to.But  we  also  need  to  take  a  more  complex  approach.  People  tend  to  think  there  are  easy  answers:  either  strict  gun  control  or  throwing  everybody  who  is  mentally  ill  into  the  asylum.  It's  really  a  more  nuanced  conversation.It's  about  how  you  promote  responsible  gun  ownership.  It's  about  trigger  locks  and  gun  safes  and  other  ways  to  at  least  slow  down  someone  in  a  fit  of  rage,  to  make  it  harder  for  them  to  take  their  weapon  into  a  barracks  or  Navy  yard  and  start  shooting.It's  about  how  we  provide  for  jobs  and  opportunities  when  people  leave  the  service.  A  good  job  is  a  very  good  form  of  mental  health  intervention,  as  it  often  comes  with  good  health  benefits  and  a  sense  of  structure  and  purpose.It's  less  about  whether  we  should  be  afraid  of  a  soldier  with  PTSD,  and  instead  more  about  how,  as  a  society,  we  care  for  our  returning  veterans.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.CNN's  Evan  Perez  and  Bryan  Monroe  contributed  to  this  report</TEXT></DOC>

In  another  one  of  his  apartments  in  the  same  Mott  Street  building,  prosecutors  said,  250  small  bags  of  heroin  were  found.In  addition,  prosecutors  said,  detectives  recovered  nearly  $1,300  in  cash  on  Vineberg.Manhattan  Supreme  Court  Judge  Edward  McLaughlin  set  bail  at  $200,000  bond  or  $40,000  cash.  Vineberg  is  due  back  in  court  Tuesday.Vineberg's  attorney,  Edward  Kratt,  asked  for  a  lower  bail,  saying  his  client  has  been  an  "accomplished  musician"  since  the  late  1980s  and  a  "functioning  heroin  addict"  with  a  10-bag-a-day  habit.  The  large  quantity  of  drugs  found  in  the  apartments  were  for  Vineberg's  personal  use,  Kratt  said.The  judge,  however,  appeared  to  doubt  that  assertion,  saying  that  the  amount  of  heroin  in  Vineberg's  possession  was  "off  the  charts."Vineberg  was  found  to  have  the  actor's  phone  number  stored  in  his  cell  phone,  a  law  enforcement  official  told  CNN.  Police  discovered  the  largest  amount  of  what  is  believed  to  be  heroin  in  his  apartment,  the  source  said.Outside  court,  Kratt  said  his  client  hoped  to  raise  bail  money  with  the  help  of  friends.Asked  if  his  client  sold  heroin  to  Hoffman,  Kratt  said:  "I  really  can't  comment  on  that.  I  know  that  he  did  have  a  relationship  with  Mr.  Hoffman  as  a  friend,  how  that  translated  into  other  aspects  of  their  behavior,  I  really  can't  comment."Michael  Holman,  a  friend  of  Vineberg  who  attended  the  hearing,  described  Vineberg  as  "very  talented,  very  generous,  very  smart.""We  are  shocked  and  believe  that  he  is  being  railroaded  for  political  reasons,"  Holman  said  outside  court.  "It's  convenient  that  they  find  someone  to  blame  for  ...  Philip  Seymour  Hoffman's  overdose  and  death  but  I  just  don't  believe  that  Robert  had  anything  to  do  with  it,  and  the  fact  that  he  might  have  been  friends  with  him  is  no  surprise.  Robert  was  friends  with  a  lot  of  people,  a  lot  of  important  people,  a  lot  of  important  artists."Two  other  people  arrested  in  connection  with  Hoffman's  death  --  Juliana  Luchkiw  and  Max  Rosenblum,  both  22  --  were  released  last  week  until  their  next  court  dates.Luchkiw  pleaded  not  guilty  to  a  misdemeanor  charge  of  criminal  possession  of  a  controlled  substance.  Her  attorney,  Stephen  Turano,  told  the  court  his  client  had  no  criminal  record.  He  said  her  father,  who  was  present  in  court,  is  a  lawyer  and  her  mother  a  doctor.  The  prosecution  asked  for  Luchkiw's  bail  to  be  set  at  $1,500,  but  McLaughlin  ordered  her  released  on  her  own  recognizance.Rosenblum,  who  is  to  live  with  his  parents  until  his  next  court  date,  had  bond  set  at  $35,000,  or  $8,500  cash,  which  his  family  posted.Prosecutors  did  not  file  charges  against  a  fourth  person  arrested  in  the  raid.The  New  York  medical  examiner's  office  said  a  determination  of  the  cause  and  manner  of  Hoffman's  death  is  pending  further  study,  including  toxicology  reports.When  police  were  called  to  Hoffman's  fourth-floor  Manhattan  apartment,  they  found  the  46-year-old  actor  lying  on  the  bathroom  floor  with  a  syringe  in  his  left  arm.  He  was  wearing  shorts  and  a  T-shirt,  his  eyeglasses  still  resting  on  his  head,  according  to  law  enforcement  sources  familiar  with  the  inquiry.Investigators  discovered  close  to  50  envelopes  of  what  they  believed  was  heroin  in  the  apartment,  the  law  enforcement  sources  said.  They  also  found  used  syringes,  prescription  drugs  and  empty  plastic  bags  of  a  type  commonly  used  to  hold  drugs,  the  sources  said.Also  found  in  Hoffman's  apartment  was  his  personal  journal,  resting  on  a  living  room  TV  stand,  two  law  enforcement  sources  said.</TEXT></DOC>

"By  the  end  of  the  morning  it  seemed  as  if  we  had  all  known  each  other  for  years."Every  year  CNN  selects  six  iReporters  to  race  in  a  triathlon  with  Dr.  Sanjay  Gupta  and  the  Fit  Nation  team.  We  give  them  a  road  bike  (with  all  the  necessary  accessories),  a  wet  suit  and  a  gym  membership  to  help  them  prepare  for  the  Nautica  Malibu  Triathlon  on  September  14.As  they  train  for  their  first  triathlon  with  support  from  our  fitness  and  nutrition  coaches,  they  blog,  tweet  and  share  their  workouts  online.  CNN  readers  follow  along  as  the  team  gets  ready  to  swim  a  half-mile  in  the  ocean,  bike  18  miles  and  run  4  miles  along  the  Pacific  coast.6  people  who  will  inspire  you  this  yearThat  Friday  morning  was  the  start  of  the  team's  second  day  at  Kick-off  Weekend,  where  they  met  each  other,  their  coaches  and  the  CNN  Medical  Unit  for  the  first  time."After  a  couple  of  sessions  with  April,  our  coach,  any  fear  and  uncertainty  that  I  had  prior  to  arriving  in  Atlanta  had  gone  away,"  Cothran  said.  "That  weekend  solidified  in  my  mind...  the  plan  that  is  being  laid  out  for  me  and  my  team  will  be  more  than  sufficient  to  make  us  successful."Their  confidence  was  evident  as  the  Fit  Nation  team  ordered  breakfast  --  veggie  egg  white  omelets  or  a  protein  smoothie  --  and  headed  down  the  hall  to  a  nutrition  lecture.  As  they  settled  in,  the  friendly  banter  continued.For  the  past  few  years,  the  Fit  Nation  team  has  been  called  the  "6-Pack."  This  year  they're  branding  themselves  a  little  differently."We  came  up  with  the  name  'Sassy  Six'  as  our  team  name  because  we  all  have  a  little  sassiness  inside  of  us,"  says  Sia  Figiel.  "That  compelled  us  to  believe  in  ourselves  enough  to  submit  that  video  --  even  though  we'd  all  been  beaten  by  our  struggles  with  weight  and  health  and  other  emotional  issues  (before)."Figiel  knows  these  struggles  well.  The  Samoan  woman  once  weighed  nearly  400  pounds.  When  she  developed  type  2  diabetes,  she  decided  enough  was  enough  and  has  since  lost  100  pounds.Each  member  of  the  team  has  a  different  story  to  tell.  But  they  all  have  the  same  goal:  to  learn  how  to  live  a  healthier  lifestyle,  and  to  inspire  others  to  do  the  same."A  journey  to  wellness  can  be  long  and  lonely  when  done  individually,"  Connie  Sievers  says.  "I  have  started  the  journey  to  wellness  before,  but  when  I  was  confronted  with  stress  I  reverted  back  to  my  unhealthy  habits.  (Now)  the  power  of  the  entire  CNN  Fit  Nation  team  will  be  there  to  hold  me  accountable,  encourage  me,  pick  me  up  and  put  me  on  the  right  track  again."Sievers  will  find  strength  in  Mike  Wilber,  who  is  taking  advantage  of  this  opportunity  to  no  longer  be  "the  guy  who  wanted  to  do  things  but  physically  couldn't."  Wilber  will  be  inspired  by  Karen  Manns,  who  wants  to  lose  50  pounds  by  the  time  September  rolls  around.  And  all  will  try  to  inspire  friends  and  family  at  home."What  does  Fit  Nation  mean  to  me?  It  means  responsibility  to  my  fellow  'Sassy  Six'  team  members,  friends,  family  and  supporters  all  over  the  world,"  Wilber  says.  "My  story  is  reaching  a  global  audience,  which  is  amazing  to  think  about.  I  cannot  let  the  people  who  are  supporting  me  down.""I  know  now  that  I  am  not  alone,"  Fiegel  adds.  "That  I  am  supported  and  encouraged.  And  I  wish  to  be  that  for  anyone  out  there  who  is  reading  this  and  has  lost  hope  and  is  considering  giving  up."During  Kick-off  Weekend,  the  team  underwent  several  physical  fitness  tests,  spoke  with  Gupta  about  their  goals,  and  climbed  Stone  Mountain  just  outside  of  Atlanta.  They  left  the  city  Sunday  ready  to  start  their  training."We  have  a  long  hard  road  ahead  of  us,  but  the  camaraderie  we  have  is  undeniable  and  confidence  we  have  in  our  abilities  as  a  team  is  growing,"  Jamil  Nathoo  said.  "Together,  we  know  we  can  do  this."</TEXT></DOC>

Annexation  no  longer  the  focus  of  Ukraine  crisis</TITLE><TIME>Mon,  31  Mar  2014  15:18:39  EDT</TIME><ABSTRACT>In  diplomacy,  like  in  sales,  success  often  depends  on  making  your  adversaries  believe  they  proposed  the  result  you  wanted.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Washington  (CNN)  --  In  diplomacy,  like  in  sales,  success  often  depends  on  making  your  adversaries  believe  they  proposed  the  result  you  wanted.By  that  measure,  Russian  President  Vladimir  Putin  appears  to  have  closed  the  sale  on  annexing  Crimea  from  Ukraine.On  Monday,  Russian  Prime  Minister  Dmitry  Medvedev  visited  the  region  that  Moscow  now  claims  over  international  protests,  while  Russia  also  said  it  was  withdrawing  a  battalion  of  infantry  troops  from  the  tens  of  thousands  deployed  near  the  border  with  eastern  Ukraine.Meanwhile,  diplomatic  efforts  focus  on  defusing  the  immediate  threat  of  armed  conflict  and  setting  up  a  negotiating  process,  rather  than  necessarily  reversing  the  Crimean  annexation.Here  are  some  questions  and  answers  on  how  we  got  here  and  what  to  expect:What's  the  story?The  Ukraine  crisis  has  its  roots  in  the  breakup  of  the  Soviet  Union  more  than  two  decades  ago.  A  country  of  deep  ethnic  and  cultural  divisions,  it  comprises  a  more  ethnic  Russian  population  in  the  East  and  a  more  ethnic  Ukrainian  population  in  the  West,  including  Kiev,  the  capital.Months  of  increasingly  violent  political  protests  in  Kiev  over  the  government's  reluctance  to  expanded  relations  with  the  European  Union  culminated  in  a  February  21  agreement  that  called  for  constitutional  changes  and  new  elections.Putin  says  he's  pulling  some  troops  back  from  Ukrainian  borderMoscow  responded  by  sending  forces  into  Ukraine's  formerly  Russian  region  of  Crimea,  which  is  home  to  Russia's  Black  Sea  fleet.  Putin  claimed  ethnic  Russians  in  Crimea  faced  oppression  and  needed  Moscow's  protection,  a  scenario  rejected  as  false  by  Washington  and  its  European  allies.Despite  objections  by  the  Ukrainian  government,  the  United  Nations,  European  nations  and  the  United  States,  Russia  then  engineered  a  Crimean  independence  referendum  that  easily  passed.As  Washington  and  the  European  Union  imposed  sanctions,  Moscow  and  Crimea  took  the  legislative  steps  in  recent  weeks  to  complete  the  annexation.Meanwhile,  Putin  warned  Russia  would  protect  ethnic  Russians  elsewhere  from  alleged  attacks  and  discrimination,  and  tens  of  thousands  of  Russian  troops  gathered  near  Ukraine's  eastern  border  raised  fears  of  an  imminent  invasion.What's  the  latest?As  tension  climbed,  Putin  called  President  Barack  Obama  last  Friday  and  the  two  leaders  agreed  that  their  top  diplomats  would  try  to  find  an  opening  for  negotiations  on  resolving  the  crisis.In  four  hours  of  talks  on  Sunday  in  Paris,  Secretary  of  State  John  Kerry  and  Russian  Foreign  Minister  Sergey  Lavrov  focused  on  easing  the  border  tension  and  working  out  a  formula  for  a  negotiating  process  that  includes  the  Ukraine  government.Afterward,  Kerry  told  reporters  that  both  governments  agreed  on  the  need  for  a  diplomatic  solution,  and  that  the  goal  for  now  was  de-escalating  the  crisis  to  allow  for  further  talks.However,  he  never  directly  mentioned  Crimea  or  its  annexation  and  he  didn't  repeat  an  earlier  U.S.  demand  that  Russian  troops  leave  Crimea."Both  sides  made  suggestions  on  ways  to  de-escalate  the  security  and  political  situation  in  and  around  Ukraine,"  Kerry  said.  "We  also  agreed  to  work  with  the  Ukrainian  government  and  the  people  to  implement  the  steps  that  they  are  taking  to  assure  the  following  priorities:  the  rights  of  national  minorities,  language  rights,  demobilization  and  disarmament  of  the  regular  forces  and  provocateurs,  an  inclusive  constitutional  reform  process,  and  free  and  fair  elections  monitored  by  the  international  community."His  bottom  line?  "No  decisions  about  Ukraine  without  Ukraine."Meanwhile,  Monday's  movement  of  Russian  troops  --  whether  a  real  withdrawal  or  symbolic  shift  --signaled  Moscow's  acceptance  that  the  Kerry-Lavrov  talks  yielded  some  progress."If  reports  that  Russia  is  removing  some  troops  from  the  border  region  are  accurate,  it  would  be  a  welcome  preliminary  step,"  State  Department  spokeswoman  Jen  Psaki  said  Monday.What  does  it  all  mean?Two  weeks  ago,  Ukrainian  President  Oleksandr  Turchynov  declared  that  his  country  was  willing  to  hold  talks  with  Russia,  "but  we  will  never  accept  the  annexing  of  our  territory."While  Kerry  alluded  to  the  Crimea  annexation  on  Sunday,  calling  Russia's  "actions"  illegal  and  illegitimate,  he  also  noted  that  "Russia  obviously  has  long  ties  and  serious  interests"  in  Ukraine.In  tense,  defiant  Ukraine  border  region,  prayers  are  for  peace  --  unless  peace  failsIn  Washington,  Democratic  Sen.  Dianne  Feinstein  of  California  made  a  similar  point  earlier  Sunday  on  CNN,  saying  that  Crimea  is  "dominantly  Russian."She  sounded  resolved  that  the  peninsula  with  a  majority  ethnic  Russian  population  now  had  returned  to  Moscow's  provenance,  as  Putin  wanted  all  along."A  referendum  was  passed.  That,  I  think,  has  been  done,"  said  Feinstein,  who  chairs  the  Senate  Intelligence  Committee.  "But  Ukraine  is  a  different  subject."Her  acknowledgment  clashes  with  Obama  and  the  United  Nations,  who  call  the  military  backed  annexation  of  Crimea  a  violation  of  international  law  and  dismiss  the  Crimean  secession  referendum  as  a  sham.Obama  has  threatened  further  sanctions  targeting  vital  sectors  of  Russia's  economy  such  as  financial  services,  energy,  mining,  defense  and  engineering.However,  it  remains  unclear  if  European  powers  such  as  Germany  and  Britain  would  join  in  such  an  escalation  because  of  their  stronger  economic  links  with  Russia.What  now?More  talks  and  diplomatic  posturing,The  Russian  force  shift  Monday  involved  several  hundred  troops  at  the  most,  which  would  be  only  a  fraction  of  the  40,000  or  more  estimated  to  be  near  the  Ukrainian  border  for  what  Moscow  calls  exercises.That  means  the  next  steps  occur  under  the  shadow  of  the  Russian  forces  that  U.S.  military  officials  say  could  launch  an  incursion  on  short  notice.Obama's  trump  card  is  the  possible  increased  sanctions  targeting  strategic  sectors  of  the  already  struggling  Russian  economy  as  Moscow  assumes  greater  costs  because  of  the  Crimea  annexation.Medvedev  said  Monday  Crimean  state  salaries  and  pensions  should  be  raised  to  Russian  levels,  as  should  the  pay  for  military  personnel,  while  compulsory  social  insurance  would  be  introduced  to  the  region  next  year.He  also  said  Moscow  would  make  Crimea  a  special  economic  zone  and  review  water  supply  projects  for  the  region  that  now  gets  90%  of  its  water,  80%  of  its  electricity  and  roughly  65%  of  its  gas  from  Ukraine.A  variety  of  outcomes  remain  possible,  ranging  from  further  Russian  military  incursions  in  other  ethnic-Russian  strongholds  in  the  region  to  a  negotiated  political  agreement  in  which  Ukraine  adopts  a  new  constitution  and  holds  new  elections  --  almost  certainly  minus  Crimea.CNN's  Elise  Labott,  Jim  Sciutto,  Gena  Somra,  Nick  Paton  Walsh,  Alexander  Felton,  Stefan  Simons,  Victoria  Butenko,  Jason  Hanna,  Marie-Louise  Gumuchian  and  Alla  Eshchenko  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Roosevelt  called  her  "Little  Miss  Miracle."Such  was  the  power  of  Shirley  Temple  during  the  Great  Depression,  a  dark  time  when  millions  were  out  of  work  and  struggling  to  survive.  Into  their  midst  came  a  little  girl  in  curls,  whose  films  --  such  as  "Little  Miss  Marker,"  "Curly  Top,"  "Bright  Eyes"  and  "Captain  January"  --  allowed  them  to  forget,  if  just  for  a  little  while."Shirley  could  make  people  believe,  if  only  for  90  minutes,  that  there  were  no  problems  in  the  world,"  said  a  fellow  child  star,  Dickie  Moore.Shirley  Temple  Black,  perhaps  the  biggest  child  star  in  history,  died  Monday.  She  was  85.There  had  been  child  stars  before  Shirley  Temple  --  Jackie  Cooper  and  Jackie  Coogan,  to  name  two  --  and  there  is  certainly  no  shortage  of  them  now,  with  reality  TV  and  child-targeted  cable  networks  minting  a  perky  new  imp  every  six  months.  But  with  her  sparkling  personality,  song-and-dance  talent  and  sheer  box-office  power,  there  has  likely  been  no  equal  in  history.Photos:  Child  star  transformations"(She)  represented,  for  many,  the  epitome  of  childhood  goodness  and  sentiment,  a  beacon  of  hope  for  the  future  of  America  and  the  physical  embodiment  of  the  perfect  child,"  wrote  a  British  sociologist,  Jane  Catherine  O'Connor,  in  "The  Cultural  Significance  of  the  Child  Star."Share  your  memoriesShirley  Temple  everywhereAt  the  peak  of  her  fame  in  the  mid-1930s  there  were  Shirley  Temple  dolls,  Shirley  Temple  dresses,  Shirley  Temple  china,  Shirley  Temple  notebooks,  Shirley  Temple  soap  and  Shirley  Temple  sheet  music.  There  was  a  nonalcoholic  cocktail  --  ginger  ale  with  a  touch  of  grenadine,  topped  with  a  maraschino  cherry  --  named  for  her.She  was  awarded  an  honorary  Oscar  in  1934.  She  was  the  No.  1  box  office  star  in  the  nation  from  1935  to  1938.  She  almost  single-handedly  led  20th  Century  Fox,  her  studio,  back  to  profitability.She  was  so  well-known,  so  iconic,  that  even  the  number  of  curls  in  her  hair  was  publicized.  (It's  56,  incidentally.)"I  stopped  believing  in  Santa  Claus  when  I  was  6,"  she  once  wrote.  "Mother  took  me  to  see  him  in  a  department  store  and  he  asked  for  my  autograph."Through  it  all,  she  was  barely  touched  by  scandal.  There  were  no  stories  of  abusive  parents  or  predatory  agents  --  though  her  mother,  who  did  help  push  her  daughter  into  show  business,  shaved  a  year  off  young  Shirley's  age  to  make  her  more  marketable.Indeed,  the  mere  suggestion  that  she  was  something  less  than  innocent  was  enough  to  prompt  a  furious  outcry.When  British  author  Graham  Greene,  then  an  editor  and  film  critic,  wrote  in  a  1937  review  that  the  8-year-old  Temple  was  an  "adult  impersonating  a  child"  and  that  her  co-stars  reacted  to  her  "well-shaped  and  desirable  little  body,"  20th  Century  Fox  sued.  The  legal  challenge  ended  up  putting  Greene's  magazine  out  of  business.Adulthood,  however,  did  finally  put  an  end  to  Temple's  film  career.  In  1940,  20th  Century  Fox  decided  not  to  renew  her  contract,  which  was  OK  with  Temple  and  her  family.  She  went  off  to  a  Los  Angeles  school  and,  gradually,  adjusted  to  noncelebrity  life.  She  was  just  about  to  turn  13.Shirley  Temple  Black,  the  ambassadorClass  and  diplomacyShe  did  a  bit  of  acting  while  in  school  and  after  graduating  --  one  film,  1947's  "That  Hagen  Girl"  with  Ronald  Reagan,  made  it  into  the  book  "The  Fifty  Worst  Films  of  All  Time"  --  but  after  marrying  her  second  husband,  Charles  Black,  she  decided  to  retire  in  1950.At  22,  her  movie  career  was  over.  But  her  life  was  just  beginning.Shirley  Temple,  child  star,  became  Shirley  Temple  Black,  diplomat,  who  raised  three  children,  served  as  a  U.N.  representative  and  U.S.  ambassador,  and  generally  kept  a  low  and  genteel  profile.  Only  rarely  did  she  venture  back  into  acting,  most  notably  for  a  late-'50s  television  series.To  younger  generations,  she  soon  became  just  a  well-known  name,  her  films  seen  only  on  late-night  TV,  her  Depression-era  celebrity  all  but  vanished.  Children  of  the  '70s  may  know  her  best  for  an  episode  of  "The  Brady  Bunch"  in  which  Cindy  Brady  becomes  obsessed  with  her.  Children  of  the  21st  century  may  not  know  her  at  all.And  these  days,  when  being  a  child  star  almost  invariably  comes  with  a  24-hour  media  circus  --  followed  by  calculated  moves  to  showcase  adult-like  sex  appeal  --  one  wonders  if  the  fame  of  a  Shirley  Temple  could  last  longer  than  the  duration  of  a  YouTube  video.  (Even  in  her  time  it  was  no  easy  feat,  as  biographies  of  any  number  of  child  stars  indicate.)  No  doubt  she'd  be  analyzed,  objectified  and  vivisected  all  over  the  Internet,  paparazzi  lurking  outside  her  door,  waiting  for  a  swear  word  or  a  blown-up  skirt.Still,  child  stars  of  any  era  could  do  worse  than  model  themselves  on  Shirley  Temple.  When  she  was  a  movie  star,  there  was  nobody  bigger.  When  she  wasn't  a  movie  star,  there  were  few  classier.  Her  philosophy  was  summed  up  in  something  she  once  said  in  an  interview."Some  people  are  stuck  on  this  image  of  the  little  girl.  She  is  not  me,"  she  said.  "We  shouldn't  live  in  the  past.  My  life  is  now."</TEXT></DOC>

Big  maps.Two  studies  released  Wednesday  in  the  journal  Nature  showcase  brain  maps  that  could  have  implications  for  understanding  both  healthy  and  impaired  brains.One  study  reveals  the  most  complete  map  ever  of  how  parts  of  the  brain  are  connected  in  a  mouse.  The  other  illuminates  the  developing  human  brain  in  terms  of  genetic  expression  --  specifically,  which  genes  are  responsible  for  generating  different  types  of  neurons,  and  how  brain  circuits  are  formed.The  leaders  of  both  studies  likened  their  respective  brain  maps  to  "Google  Maps."  The  studies  represent  different,  complementary  ways  of  understanding  the  brain.This  research  was  published  one  year  after  President  Barack  Obama  announced  the  $100  million  BRAIN  Initiative,  which  "aims  to  help  researchers  find  new  ways  to  treat,  cure,  and  even  prevent  brain  disorders,  such  as  Alzheimer's  disease,  epilepsy,  and  traumatic  brain  injury."The  mouse  brain,  as  never  beforeThe  issue  of  brain  connectivity  has  been  an  important  research  topic  for  the  last  century,  said  Hongkui  Zeng,  senior  director  of  research  science  at  the  Allen  Institute  for  Brain  Science  in  Seattle.  But  it  has  been  hard  to  gain  insights  about  the  entire  brain  by  combining  individual  studies,  because  particular  researchers  have  focused  on  different  parts  of  the  brain."Now  is  the  time  for  us  to  generate  a  comprehensive  map  in  a  systematic  way  because  of  the  advancements  of  imaging  technology  and  advancements  of  computing  power,"  she  said.Zeng  and  colleagues  took  on  this  daunting  task.  They  standardized  data  about  connectivity  in  the  whole  brain  of  a  mouse.Full  study  from  NatureResearchers  say  their  map  is  the  first  ever  detailing  the  connectivity  of  neurons  in  a  whole  brain  of  any  mammal.  Scientists  have  made  this  vast  expanse  of  data  --  hundreds  of  terabytes  --  publicly  available."This  kind  of  database  would  facilitate  the  study  of  many,  many  different  researchers  in  almost  any  area  of  brain  research,"  Zeng  said.There  are  several  important  uses  for  this  brain  map.  Scientists  looking  at  disease  models  could  compare  Zeng's  group's  descriptions  of  brain  wiring  to  brains  that  are  impaired  in  various  ways,  to  see  what  effects  different  conditions  have  on  brain  connectivity.  This  could  open  new  avenues  in  the  study  of  Parkinson's,  Alzheimer's,  autism,  schizophrenia  and  other  brain  abnormalities."This  really  sets  the  stage  for  us  now  to  be  able  to  compare  a  normal  animal  versus  a  disease  model,  to  gain  fuller  understanding  of  what  is  going  on  in  the  diseased  brain,"  she  said.Researchers  who  are  interested  in  finding  out  what  functions  specific  brain  regions  have  could  use  this  map  to  see  how  different  areas  are  connected.  Looking  at  the  circuitry  of  the  brain  could  help  guide  their  studies,  Zeng  said.Scientists  building  computational  models  of  the  brain,  seeking  to  understand  how  networks  operate  in  the  brain,  can  also  benefit  from  looking  at  these  maps.It's  important  to  note  that  mouse  and  human  brains  are  similarly  structured,  but  they  are  nowhere  near  the  same  in  size  or  capability.With  about  86  billion  neurons,  the  human  brain  contains  more  than  1,000  times  more  of  these  cells  than  the  mouse  brain.  Our  brains  are  also  2,000  times  bigger  than  a  mouse  brain,  Zeng  said.Fundamental  insights  about  brain  circuitry  and  impairment  often  begin  with  rodent  models  before  being  expanded  to  humans.  But  we  need  to  also  explore  the  human  brain  for  a  fuller  picture  of  behavior  and  disease.Zeng  and  colleagues  are  in  talks  with  the  Human  Brain  Project,  the  European  initiative  that  aims  to  computationally  simulate  the  entire  human  brain.  The  Nature  paper  on  connectivity  will  be  "an  important  foundation  for  them,"  Zeng  said.Human  brain  developmentWhile  the  mouse  brain  study  showed  connections,  a  second  study  from  scientists  at  the  Allen  Institute  explored  genetics  in  the  developing  human  brain.  This  report  unveils  a  map  showing  where  various  genes  are  turned  off  and  on  in  a  fetus  in  the  middle  of  pregnancy,  which  may  help  explore  the  origins  of  brain  problems."We  can  really  use  that  now  to  pinpoint  where  a  set  of  genes  associated  with  a  disease  may  have  a  common  action,"  said  senior  study  author  Ed  Lein.Full  study  from  NatureThis  is  the  first  big  study  incorporating  data  from  the  BrainSpan  Atlas  of  the  Developing  Human  Brain,  an  effort  aiming  to  study  the  role  of  gene  expression  in  the  brain  during  all  of  human  development,  including  adulthood.To  generate  the  genetic  blueprint  of  the  developing  brain  in  this  study,  scientists  used  four  human  fetus  brains,  between  15  and  21  weeks  gestation,  which  had  been  donated.This  is  thought  to  be  a  critical  period  for  the  emergence  of  neurodevelopmental  disorders  such  as  autism,  Lein  said.  Impacts  to  a  brain  region  called  the  neocortex  as  it  is  forming  could  have  long-lasting  effects,  he  said.Researchers  used  information  from  the  maps  to  look  at  genes  that  previously  had  been  linked  to  autism  in  the  developing  brain.  They  found  that  genes  associated  with  autism  tended  to  be  particularly  active  in  newly  generated  excitatory  neurons  of  the  cortex.  These  cells  send  information  from  one  part  of  the  brain  to  another,  he  said."This  provides  a  place  to  focus  more  research,"  Lein  said.  "It  suggests  on  the  one  hand  that  these  genes  may  be  (activated)  prenatally,  and  on  the  other  hand  we  actually  have  a  place  to  look  in  the  brain,  which  is  the  development  and  maturation  of  these  new  neurons."Taking  the  new  maps,  researchers  studying  other  developmental  disorders  can  take  a  similar  approach.This  map  can  also  reveal  ways  in  which  humans  are  genetically  different  from  other  species.  For  one  thing,  it's  important  to  understand  the  differences  between  mice  and  humans,  since  mice  are  used  so  often  in  biomedical  research  and  neuroscience.But  what  about  what  makes  us  genetically  special?  Lein  and  colleagues  found  that  genes  that  appear  unique  to  humans  tend  to  be  expressed  particularly  in  the  frontal  cortex,  which  is  a  part  of  the  neocortex,  and  is  responsible  for  many  higher  cognitive  capabilities.  This  also  may  provide  clues  that  future  research  can  follow.READ:  How  your  brain  makes  moral  judgmentsCNN's  Alex  Mooney  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Find  out  what  diet  the  publication  ranked  No.  1...</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Followers  of  the  Paleo  Diet  may  go  prehistoric  on  U.S.  News  &  World  Report  this  week.  The  publication  has  ranked  the  controversial  diet  last  on  its  "Best  Diets  Overall"  list  for  2014.Each  year,  U.S.  News  &  World  Report  asks  experts  to  rank  various  nutrition  plans  to  help  consumers  make  informed  decisions.  This  year  the  panel  evaluated  32  of  the  most  popular  diets.To  be  top-rated,  a  diet  has  to  be  relatively  easy  to  follow,  nutritious,  safe,  effective  for  weight  loss  and  protective  against  diabetes  and  heart  disease.First  popularized  in  the  1970s,  the  Paleo  Diet  asks  people  to  follow  a  diet  similar  to  those  who  lived  during  the  Paleolithic  era,  between  2.6  million  and  10,000  years  ago.  This  means  eating  like  hunters  and  gathers  --  consuming  lots  of  produce  and  animal  protein,  while  avoiding  sugar,  grains,  legumes  and  dairy  altogether."If  the  cavemen  didn't  eat  it,  you  shouldn't  either,"  U.S.  News  &  World  Report  summarized.The  diet  has  gained  a  significant  following  in  recent  years,  especially  among  the  CrossFit  crowd.  "Paleo  Diet"  was  the  most  searched  diet  term  on  Google  in  2013.Being  last  on  the  Best  Diets  list  doesn't  mean  Paleo  is  the  worst  diet  ever  (the  "Cookie  Diet"  didn't  even  make  the  list).  But  U.S.  News  &  World  Report's  experts  said  the  Paleo  Diet  was  too  restrictive  for  most  people  to  follow  long  term,  and  that  it  limited  some  essential  nutrients.  They  also  cited  a  lack  of  research  proving  the  Paleo  Diet's  cardiovascular  health  and  weight  loss  benefits  in  their  ranking.The  Paleo  Diet  tied  for  last  place  on  the  list  alongside  the  Dukan  diet,  which  is  also  a  high-protein,  low-carbohydrate  approach.For  the  fourth  year  in  a  row,  the  DASH  Diet  Eating  Plan  was  named  the  best  overall  diet.  DASH,  or  Dietary  Approaches  to  Stop  Hypertension,  was  developed  by  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  for  people  with  high  blood  pressure.  But  it  is  also  effective  in  lowering  cholesterol  and  reducing  a  person's  risk  for  heart  disease,  stroke,  kidney  stones  and  diabetes,  its  website  states.Unlike  many  diet  plans,  DASH  doesn't  cut  out  or  extremely  restrict  certain  foods.  Its  focus  is  on  limiting  daily  sodium  intake.  The  meal  plan  includes  three  whole-grain  products  each  day,  four  to  six  servings  of  vegetables,  four  to  six  servings  of  fruit,  two  to  four  servings  of  dairy  products  and  several  servings  each  of  lean  meats  and  nuts/seeds/legumes.The  diet's  only  downfalls,  the  expert  panel  said,  are  that  it  takes  some  "grunt  work"  to  adhere  to,  and  that  it  may  cost  more  than  a  diet  based  on  "processed,  fatty,  sugary  foods."Following  DASH  on  the  best  overall  list  was  the  Therapeutic  Lifestyle  Changes  Diet,  which  also  was  created  by  the  National  Institutes  of  Health.  Next  in  line  were  the  Mayo  Clinic  Diet,  the  Mediterranean  Diet  and  Weight  Watchers  --  all  tied  for  third  place.  This  is  the  same  as  last  year's  ranking.U.S.  News  &  World  Report  also  published  several  other  lists,  including  best  weight-loss  diets,  best  diabetes  diets,  best  commercial  diet  plans  and  easiest  diets  to  follow.Weight  Watchers  topped  the  best  weight-loss,  best  commercial  diet  plan  and  easiest  to  follow  lists.  Also  high  on  several  lists  were  the  Jenny  Craig  plan  and  "The  Biggest  Loser"  plan.For  more,  visit  U.S.  News  &  World  Report's  Best  Diets  Rankings.</TEXT></DOC>

Share  your  photos  and  stories  at  CNN  iReport!(CNN)  --  In  the  ice  skating  community,  Cheryl  Davis  and  Jacqui  White  are  known  as  "the  moms"  because  they  have  been  nearly  inseparable  for  16  years.  That's  when  their  children,  Meryl  Davis  and  Charlie  White,  started  skating  together  as  ice  dancers.The  skating  duo,  Olympic  silver  medalists  in  Vancouver  in  2010  and  world  champions  in  2013,  are  favorites  to  bring  home  the  first  U.S.  ice  dancing  gold  medal  in  the  Winter  Games  in  Sochi,  Russia.Their  moms,  who  fly  to  and  from  every  competition  together,  will  be  seated  side  by  side  at  the  Olympics:  Davis  always  on  the  right,  White  on  her  left."Even  in  an  interview  now,  Jacqui  will  say,  'Wait  a  minute,  she's  on  the  wrong  side,'  "  said  Davis,  a  mother  of  two  from  West  Bloomfield,  Michigan.'Lucky  Uggs'It's  just  one  of  the  many  rituals  these  Olympic  moms  follow  as  they  gear  up  for  what  could  be  a  history-making  weekend  for  their  children.White  always  wears  a  pair  of  "lucky  Uggs,"  and  she  doesn't  change  her  jewelry,  a  habit  that  dates  to  her  years  as  a  hockey  mom.  (Charlie  played  13  years  of  travel  hockey  and  was  part  of  a  state  championship  winning  team.)"The  hockey  moms  used  to  see  me  come  in.  If  I  was  wearing  a  different  pair  of  earrings,  they'd  look  at  me  (and  say),  'Hey,  you  weren't  wearing  those  earrings  the  last  time  we  won,  and  it's  the  first  time  they  scored  on  us.  You  are  taking  them  off,'  "  said  White,  a  mother  of  five,  also  from  Bloomfield  Hills,  Michigan."So  I  am  now  superstitious  ...  and  I  can't  get  over  it,"  she  said,  chuckling.Davis  has  her  own  rituals,  including  writing  down  every  skater's  scores."I  always  take  my  pad  with  me,  and  I  always  write  down  every  score,  and  then  if  I  miss  one,  I'm  like,  'Oh,  darn  ...'  but  it  doesn't  matter,"  Davis  said  with  a  laugh.The  task  is  pointless,  she  admitted,  since  she  never  looks  at  the  scores  again."It  just  keeps  us  thinking  about  something  else,"  she  said.  "It  gives  us  a  little  distraction."'Not  sure  what  we  gave  up'Davis  and  White  are  just  two  of  the  thousands  of  Olympic  moms  around  the  country  and  the  world  who  devoted  hours,  energy  and  money  --  and  a  good  chunk  of  their  own  lives  --  to  make  their  children's  Olympic  dreams  come  true.But  don't  mention  the  "S  word"  to  them:  sacrifice.  They  don't  believe  they've  sacrificed  to  get  here."I  know  that  people  want  to  call  it  a  sacrifice,  and  it  is  in  some  ways,  because  you  do  put  a  lot  of  your  time  and  a  lot  of  your  money  into  it.  But  on  the  other  hand,  a  sacrifice  almost  means  you  are  almost  giving  up  a  lot,"  Davis  said.  "I  am  not  sure  what  we  gave  up."The  early  years  were  harder,  Davis  and  White  admit,  especially  as  both  kids  trained  for  singles'  competitions  in  addition  to  working  together  on  ice  dancing.  Meryl,  who  just  turned  27,  started  skating  at  age  5.  Charlie,  26,  began  when  he  was  3."We  were  there  every  single  day.  We  would  drive  them,  pick  them  up  from  school,  drive  them  to  the  rink,  stay  with  them  ...  rush  over  while  they  were  on  the  ice  and  get  them  a  bagel  with  cream  cheese  or  chocolate  milk  or  whatever  they  wanted,"  White  said."It's  long  enough  ago  so  that  it  gets  kind  of  blurred  into  the  rest  of  the  years,  but  early  on,  it  was  a  lot  of  time.  It  was  a  lot  more  dedication  and  work  for  us,  but  it  was  work  we  really  enjoyed  and  really  loved,  so  it  doesn't  fall  in  the  'sacrifice'  label."'Each  one  is  special'An  additional  challenge  for  any  Olympic  family  is  making  sure  the  other  siblings  don't  feel  shadowed  by  a  24/7  commitment  to  a  sport.  Championship  figure  skating  includes  four  or  five  hours  on  the  ice  every  day,  dance  lessons,  physical  fitness  training,  travel  to  competitions,  research  for  costumes,  appearances  and  interviews.Amy  Hughes  of  Great  Neck,  New  York,  is  a  mom  of  six  whose  daughter  Sarah  won  the  Olympic  gold  in  figure  skating  in  2002  and  whose  daughter  Emily  competed  in  the  2006  Games."I  think  because  there  were  six  of  them,  it  was  much  healthier,"  Amy  Hughes  said.  "People  would  come  in,  (and)  they  said,  'You  don't  have  all  of  Sarah  and  Emily's  stuff  up;  you  have  everybody's.'"I  said,  'Well,  each  one  is  special.'"Hughes  recently  asked  Emily  what  she  did  as  a  mom  to  raise  an  Olympian,  "She  says,  'Oh,  Ma,  you  got  us  everywhere  we  had  to  go,  and  then  you'd  forget  to  pick  us  up.'  And  I  laughed,  and  I  said,  'You  know,  you're  right.'  "'Charlie's  my  boat'Raising  an  Olympian,  especially  in  figure  skating  with  the  cost  of  ice  time,  lessons,  choreography,  costumes  and  travel,  can  take  a  financial  toll  on  a  family.  Hughes,  White  and  Davis  say  they're  thankful  that  wasn't  their  experience."I  have  to  ask  (my  husband),  how  did  we  do  it?  I  can't  answer  that,  because  I  don't  know.  I  just  know  we  kept  going  and  going,"  said  Hughes,  whose  husband  is  a  real  estate  tax  attorney."It  wasn't  like  some  skating  families  (who)  have  to  remortgage  their  house.  We  didn't  have  to  do  that,"  said  Davis,  a  former  teacher."When  you  look  at  what  other  people  sacrifice  --  and  people  we  know,  personally,  are  some  of  those  people  --  it  breaks  my  heart  that  they've  put  so  much  into  it  and  not  all  kids  are  lucky  enough  to  get  where  our  kids  are."White  jokes  that  she  doesn't  know  how  much  she's  spent  on  more  than  20  years  of  ice  skating  because  she  tries  "not  to  look.""We  try  not  to  add  it  up,  because  I'm  sure  if  we  added  it  up,  then  we  would  start  to  feel  like,  'Oh,  my  God,  we've  made  such  a  sacrifice,'  "  White  said."I  always  tell  Meryl  she's  my  cottage,"  said  Davis,  joking  that  money  spent  on  skating  could  have  bought  the  family  a  second  home."And  Charlie's  my  boat,"  White  added.'Thank  you,  Mom'Both  Davis  and  White  are  part  of  Procter  &  Gamble's  "Thank  You,  Mom,"  program,  which  highlights  the  awe-inspiring  contributions  of  Olympic  moms.  The  program  includes  providing  a  "family  home"  in  Sochi,  where  U.S.  athletes  and  their  families  can  get  free  meals  and  beauty  services,  as  well  as  help  for  U.S.  families  to  pay  the  travel  costs  to  Russia.Each  Olympic  Games,  the  company  creates  an  ad  that  seems  to  make  just  about  every  mom  --  this  one  included  --  need  to  grab  the  tissues.In  the  current  ad,  moms  are  seen  picking  up  their  toddlers  after  falls  on  the  ice  and  in  the  snow  and  bucking  them  up  when  things  were  not  going  their  way."When  I  watch  that  commercial,  it  really  grabs  my  heart,"  White  said."I  think  you  sit  there  and  you  wonder,  how  many  times  can  you  fall  and  get  back  up  again?  Your  first  instinct  is  to  go  out  there  and  say  'Stop  hurting  yourself;  let  me  take  you  home  to  something  fun,'  but  you  don't,  because  the  more  loving  thing  is  to  let  them  go,  let  them  pick  themselves  up  sometimes  and  let  them  continue  on  and  get  stronger  because  of  it."'You  can't  help  but  cry'How  much  joy  will  "the  moms"  feel  when  they  watch  Meryl  and  Charlie  compete  for  Olympic  gold  in  Sochi?"Every  time  we  talk  about  the  joy  of  it  and  how  much  we  love  it,  that's  when  we  start  to  cry,"  Davis  said.  "You  are  so  bursting  with  pride  (about)  who  they  are  and  what  they've  accomplished  that  you  always  start  to  cry.  You  can't  help  but  cry."White  says  she's  sometimes  wondered,  does  skating  create  the  person  that  is  so  awesome,  or  does  the  awesomeness  of  the  person  create  the  skater?"Because  I  look  at  Meryl  and  Charlie,  they're  such  an  awesome  couple  as  people,  and  I  just  wonder,  has  the  discipline  and  everything  that  is  involved  in  their  skating  career  helped  to  shape  that  personality?"We  feel  proud  of  the  people  they  are.  I  feel  that  that's  what  we  are  most  proud  of,"  White  said.Hughes  will  be  watching  Meryl  and  Charlie,  and  all  the  other  skaters,  from  her  living  room  in  New  York.  She  knows  exactly  what  it  feels  like  to  watch  not  one,  but  two  children  compete  for  Olympic  gold."Indescribable,"  she  said  with  a  laugh.  "We  didn't  expect  any  of  this.  I  just  feel  like  it's  all  this  tremendous  gift  ...  and  the  whole  family  was  thrilled.  We  were  all  there  for  everybody."What  do  you  think  it  takes  to  raise  an  Olympian?

For  each  challenge,  we  ask  Instagrammers  to  take  a  picture  and  and  tell  a  story  about  it.  Follow  CNN  and  CNN  iReport  on  Instagram  for  the  next  challenge,  and  your  image  might  be  included  in  our  next  feature.(CNN)  --  Perhaps  you  heard  that  Pantone's  2014  color  of  the  year  is  radiant  orchid,  which,  according  to  the  global  color  authority,  "emanates  great  joy,  love  and  health."To  choose  its  color  of  the  year,  Pantone  draws  inspiration  from  global  trends  in  the  arts,  entertainment,  fashion  and  technology,  among  other  sources.  What  about  you?  How  are  you  influenced  by  color?  What  shades  inspire  you,  energize  you  or  reflect  your  personality?We  asked  CNN  Instagram  followers  to  ponder  this  question  and  create  images  that  illustrate  the  answer.  Below  are  just  a  few  highlights.  Take  a  look  at  all  of  the  submissions  by  searching  the  #CNNMyColor  hashtag  in  Instagram.Shawn  Thompson,  Van,  TexasShawn  Thompson  created  this  image  with  the  help  of  his  junior  high  school  theater  teacher,  with  whom  he  still  keeps  in  touch.  "The  color  blue  itself  symbolizes  trust,  loyalty,  wisdom,  confidence,  intelligence,  faith,  and  truth;  all  of  which  are  traits  that  I  strive  for  and  are  meaningful  to  me,"  he  said.  "Although  it  may  be  one  of  the  most  common  and  probably  a  boring  choice  when  it  comes  to  one's  favorite  color  ...  it  brings  me  more  joy  than  any  other  color.  It  represents  life.  I  want  to  live  my  life  in  the  'bluest'  way  possible  if  it  means  that  I  exude  the  qualities  that  it  is  known  for."Karl  Ivan  Jover,  Manila,  PhilippinesKarl  Ivan  Jover  says  red  is  his  favorite  color  because  it  conveys  excitement,  drives  energy  and  epitomizes  love  and  passion.  It  can  also  represent  anger  and  danger,  "so  it's  a  little  bit  of  a  balance,"  he  said.  To  create  this  image,  he  stood  in  front  of  a  silk  red  backdrop,  hung  a  stool  from  the  ceiling  and  set  his  iPhone  to  take  the  picture  using  a  self-timer  app.  Obviously,  he  turned  the  image  upside  down  when  he  uploaded  it.Anne  McIsaac,  MontrealAnne  McIsaac  is  known  among  her  Instagram  followers  for  obsessively  cataloguing  the  color  yellow  with  the  #yellowoclock  tag.  To  her,  yellow  embodies  a  sunny  disposition,  making  anything  look  happy  and  cheerful,  bringing  smiles  to  people.  This  composition  was  created  by  capturing  natural  yellow  color.Kristin  Bowen,  AtlantaBeyond  liking  the  word  "cyan,"  Kristin  Bowen  says  she  chose  this  turquoise-like  shade  because  it  represents  creativity  and  energy.  For  her  composition,  she  positioned  an  origami  crane  from  local  Atlanta  artist  Yoyo  Ferro  against  a  wall  on  the  side  of  a  gallery  in  Atlanta's  West  Midtown  neighborhood.Lauren  Marek,  Bellville,  TexasLauren  Marek  took  this  picture  of  her  brother  in  his  letterman  jacket  at  Bellville  High  School,  where  he  plays  varsity  football  for  the  hometown  team,  the  Bellville  Brahmas.  "High  school  football  in  Texas  is  everything  and  I'm  excited  for  the  upcoming  year  to  document  his  experience,"  she  said.  For  this  reason,  she  chose  red  as  her  color  for  2014,  to  represent  her  hometown.Sarah  Mulligan,  Brooklyn,  New  YorkSarah  Mulligan  chose  the  color  yellow  to  embody  the  personality  of  her  friend  Kate,  pictured,  whom  she  describes  as  an  artistic,  hilarious,  adorable  Beatles  fan  "as  warm  as  the  sun  itself."Jenna  Tamara,  Hong  KongJenna  Tamara  says  red  represents  boldness  and  impulsiveness,  traits  she  sees  in  herself.  "But,  at  the  same  time,  I'm  able  to  blend  into  my  surroundings  easily."Paul  Rudolph,  Portland,  OregonOrange  has  been  Paul  Rudolph's  color  of  choice  since  childhood.  He  recalls  picking  out  bedroom  wallpaper  of  orange  locomotives;  four  decades  later  it's  still  the  color  he  turns  to  the  most.  It  gives  him  inspiration,  comfort,  delight  and  warmth.  This  photo  was  taken  at  Cameron's  Books  and  Magazines  in  downtown  Portland.Jeremy  Veach,  Port  Orchard,  WashingtonJeremy  Veach  is  known  on  Instagram  for  the  many  captures  of  his  pug  Norm,  whom  he  seeks  to  match  to  various  settings  and  colors.  In  this  image,  Veach  dressed  Norm  in  a  purple  "Bieber  fever"  sweater  to  match  the  flora  around  him.  "And,  just  to  clarify,  Norm  doesn't  have  the  fever,"  Veach  said.Want  to  take  part  on  our  next  Instagram  challenge?

Follow  the  "Sassy  Six"  on  Twitter  and  Facebook  as  they  train  to  race  the  Nautica  Malibu  Triathlon  with  Dr.  Sanjay  Gupta  on  September  14.(CNN)  --  There's  not  enough  time.That  is  the  excuse  I  used  for  19  years.  There's  not  enough  time  to  prepare  healthy  meals.  Not  enough  time  to  plan  healthy  snacks.  Not  enough  time  to  exercise.  Not  enough  time  to  get  a  good  night's  rest.  There's  not  enough  time.I  stopped  using  that  excuse  on  September  8,  the  day  I  watched  my  children  complete  in  Iowa's  Best  Dam  Triathlon.  I  decided  then  and  there  that  I  would  stop  making  excuses,  take  control  of  my  health  and  run  a  triathlon  with  my  children  in  2014.Over  time,  I've  realized  that  there  is  enough  time  to  do  whatever  I  want.  It  just  requires  a  tremendous  amount  of  planning.Planning  for  healthy  mealsHealthy  meals  start  with  a  healthy  grocery  list.  I  keep  a  notepad  on  the  counter  with  a  list  in  progress.  My  husband  and  I  share  the  shopping.  Healthy  meals  include  protein  and  plenty  of  vegetables.  The  moment  the  large  salad  bowl  is  empty,  I  make  sure  to  prepare  another  salad.  Turkey  breasts,  tuna,  cheese  sticks  and  Greek  yogurt  are  always  in  the  refrigerator  as  ready-to-eat  protein.Cancer  robbed  me  of  my  health;  now,  I'm  taking  it  backPlanning  for  a  sweet  tooth  attackMy  sweet  tooth  is  very  reliable;  it  vies  for  sugar  the  moment  I  get  home  from  work.  So  I  modified  a  snack  recipe  I  saw  on  Facebook  to  increase  the  protein  content,  and  always  keep  some  of  these  in  the  refrigerator.  My  sweet  tooth  is  satisfied  after  just  one  or  two  bites.  Warning  --  they  do  have  calories,  so  don't  eat  the  entire  batch!No  Bake  Energy  Bites  (with  protein  powder)  I  cup  (dry)  oatmeal  ½  cup  milk  chocolate  chips  ½  cup  chunky  peanut  butter  ⅓  cup  honey  1  teaspoon  vanilla  ½  cup  chocolate  whey  protein  powder  Mix  and  roll  into  15  balls.  I  keep  them  in  an  air-tight  container  in  the  refrigerator.  Per  ball:  130  calories,  15  grams  carb,  6  grams  fat,  5  grams  proteinPlanning  for  early-morning  workoutsI  need  to  work  out  in  the  morning  before  life  gets  in  the  way.  When  I  do,  I  have  additional  motivation  for  making  better  choices  all  day  long.But  4  a.m.  comes  early.  So  after  dinner,  I  plan  and  pack.  I  pack  my  work  clothes  for  the  next  day,  lay  out  my  swimming  suit  or  workout  clothes  for  the  morning,  and  pack  my  work  bag  with  emergency  snacks  and  a  plastic  spoon  for  the  Greek  yogurt  I  eat  in  the  morning.  I  charge  my  Garmin  Heart  Rate  Monitor  and  cell  phone,  set  out  the  dishes  I  need  for  both  my  dog's  and  my  breakfast,  and  set  out  two  water  bottles  to  fill  in  the  morning  (one  for  the  gym,  one  for  the  car).On  Sundays,  I  refill  the  consumables  such  as  shampoo  and  body  wash,  and  I  put  my  new  weekly  workout  plan  into  a  sheet  protector  so  it  will  not  get  wet  at  the  pool.Fit  Nation:  I  am  too  young  not  to  runPlanning  around  bad  weatherDuring  the  winter,  it's  necessary  to  pay  attention  to  the  weather  forecast  when  planning  my  early-morning  trips  to  the  Y.  I  live  about  30  country  miles  from  the  gym.  If  ice  or  snow  is  expected,  I  move  my  workout  schedule  around  so  I  can  train  at  home.  I  have  a  treadmill,  elliptical  and  stationary  bike  at  home,  and  they  have  been  valuable.  If  I  miss  a  swim  workout,  I  do  it  another  day.Planning  for  eight  hours  of  sleepSleep  is  a  huge  priority  for  optimal  health  and  training.  That's  why  I  go  to  bed  around  8  every  night.I  have  always  needed  eight  hours  of  sleep  to  function  well  the  next  day.  I  must  go  to  bed  at  8  p.m.  to  be  able  to  jump  (or  roll)  out  of  bed  at  4  a.m.  and  be  on  the  road  30  minutes  later  for  my  drive  to  the  gym.Six  quick  months  have  passed  since  I  last  used  the  excuse  "not  enough  time,"  and  good  things  are  happening.  I  have  lost  more  than  30  pounds.  I  learned  to  swim.  I  learned  to  jog.  I  am  stronger.  I  have  more  energy.  I  just  feel  better.There  were  a  few  nights  at  the  beginning  of  my  journey  when  I  waited  to  pack  my  gym  bag  until  right  before  bedtime.  I  was  too  tired  then,  so  I  told  myself  I  would  pack  in  the  morning.  Guess  what:  The  alarm  went  off,  and  I  knew  I  was  not  packed,  so  I  reset  my  alarm  and  did  not  go  to  the  Y  that  morning.For  the  entire  day,  I  worried  about  how  and  when  to  fit  in  my  workout.  I  learned  not  planning  ahead  is  not  worth  it.  Not  planning  ahead  is  setting  myself  up  to  fail.Where  will  you  be  in  six  months?  Start  planning  now.More  from  Sievers:  Why  you  should  celebrate  small  victories</TEXT></DOC>

Tell  us  how  you  did  it  and  you  could  be  featured  in  our  weekly  weight-loss  story  on  CNN.com.(CNN)  --  Misty  and  Larry  Shaffer  have  been  together  since  high  school.  She  went  to  his  senior  prom;  he  went  to  her  junior  and  senior  proms.  They  got  married  in  October  2008.He  never  said  anything  about  her  being  overweight.When  Larry,  an  Army  specialist,  was  deployed  to  Afghanistan  for  a  year  in  2012,  Misty  decided  she  wanted  to  get  in  shape.She  weighed  about  260  pounds  when  he  left,  and  less  than  155  pounds  when  he  returned."I  just  sat  in  bed  one  night  and  was  like,  'I  can  do  this,'"  she  said.  "'I  need  to  do  this.'"Shaffer,  now  25  and  living  in  Leland,  North  Carolina,  has  struggled  with  her  weight  her  whole  life,  even  as  a  child.Each  time  she  had  tried  dieting  in  the  past,  she  would  relapse.  Before  she  became  pregnant  with  her  daughter,  Nevaeh,  she  took  diet  pills  and  lost  60  pounds.  But  all  that  --  and  more  --  came  back  after  she  stopped  taking  the  pills.  At  her  heaviest,  she  weighed  around  300  pounds.  She's  5  feet  6  inches  tall."I  would  eat  when  I  was  bored.  I'd  eat  three  huge  meals  a  day,  and  then  snack  in  between.  Sad  or  happy,  I'd  turn  to  food  for  everything."Shaffer  felt  tired  all  the  time.  People  picked  on  her.  She  wanted  to  surprise  her  husband,  and  work  toward  a  better  life  for  herself  and  her  family.Her  primary  mission:  Cut  out  all  the  junk.  She  stopped  drinking  soda,  and  tried  to  limit  her  liquids  to  water  and  coffee.upwave:  Try  it  now!  No  fast  food  for  a  weekThe  first  three  to  four  months  were  the  hardest,  she  said.  Once  she  got  past  that,  she  started  craving  more  healthy  foods  and  water.  It  got  to  the  point  where,  if  she  drank  a  diet  soda,  it  made  her  so  thirsty  that  she  didn't  even  want  it.Shaffer's  job  presented  its  own  challenges;  she's  a  personal  shopper  at  a  supermarket.  At  lunch  time,  the  hot  fried  chicken  "just  smells  so  good,"  she  said.  But  the  supermarket  also  offers  a  large,  well-kept  salad  bar,  as  well  as  warm  vegetables  on  the  hot  bar  and  oven-baked  chicken.A  typical  breakfast  for  Shaffer  is  oatmeal  with  fruit  or  a  cereal  bar.  On  her  days  off,  she'll  cook  up  sausage,  eggs  or  pancakes,  but  she'll  watch  her  portion  size.  Around  10  a.m.  she  has  a  snack,  such  as  fruit  or  carrots.Lunch  is  a  salad  or  half  a  sandwich  with  some  kind  of  vegetable  or  fruit.  An  afternoon  snack  might  be  yogurt.For  dinner,  she  eats  a  lean  meat  (like  ground  turkey  or  a  boneless,  skinless  chicken  breast),  a  vegetable  and  a  very  small  portion  of  starch.The  big  day,  Larry  Shaffer's  return,  was  May  15,  2013.  The  soldier  had  never  seen  his  wife  weigh  less  than  220  pounds,  even  in  high  school.When  she  saw  him  at  the  airport,  Misty  Shaffer  didn't  know  what  to  say  or  do.  She  just  ran  and  jumped  into  his  arms.Her  husband  was  speechless,  uttering  only  one  word:  "Wow."It  was  the  first  time  he  had  ever  picked  her  up.  Before,  he  hadn't  been  able  to  lift  her  off  the  ground  even  a  little,  she  said.That  moment  was  worth  everything."A  lot  of  people  look  at  it  like,  'Why  is  that  such  a  big  deal?'"  she  said.  "But  (when)  you  never  thought  you'd  see  that  moment,  that  somebody  can  pick  you  up  ...  it  is  a  big  deal."The  other  big  part  of  the  surprise:  She  had  bought  a  new  house  while  he  was  away.Since  then,  Shaffer  has  been  able  to  keep  the  weight  off.When  her  husband  left  she  was  a  size  22  to  24;  now  she  can  wear  a  women's  size  6.  She's  especially  loving  how  much  money  she  saves  on  smaller  clothes.  Khakis,  for  example,  used  to  cost  $80,  but  she  found  a  pair  for  her  new  physique  for  only  $7.She  said  her  husband's  eating  habits  haven't  changed  much;  he  likes  her  cooking,  but  he'll  help  himself  to  ice  cream  or  cake  afterward.  Sometimes  she  will  join  him.  But  she's  not  too  tempted  to  go  back  to  her  old  ways  of  eating."I've  seen  how  hard  I  worked,  and  what  I  had  to  go  through  to  get  to  this  point,"  she  said.She's  still  in  disbelief  when  her  husband  picks  her  up.</TEXT></DOC>

On  the  former,  Ukraine  signed  last  Friday  an  agreement  on  closer  economic  and  political  cooperation  with  the  EU.Moreover,  Washington  has  confirmed  that  it  is  providing  Kiev  with  "non-lethal  assistance"  that  could  include  intelligence  and  satellite  imagery,  and/or  key  equipment  such  as  night-vision  goggles.Coordinated  new  waves  of  sanctions  against  Russia  will  also  be  discussed.The  United  States  and  the  28  member  EU  have  already  imposed  travel  bans  and  selective  asset  freezes  against  key  Russian  and  Crimea  officials,  and  a  bank  deemed  to  have  close  ties  with  the  Kremlin.  It  is  recognized,  however,  that  further  escalation  may  be  needed,  and  Obama  will  seek  to  find  consensus  on  this  given  the  differing  bilateral  interests  with  Russia  of  the  G7  countries.Potential  measures  include  widening  the  punitive  measures  against  targeted  Russian  and  Crimean  officials  and  institutions;  an  arms  embargo;  Moscow's  expulsion  from  the  G8;  and  wider,  more  politically  sensitive  economic  sanctions.The  scene  was  set  for  the  latter  last  Thursday  when  Obama  signed  an  executive  order  expanding  the  U.S.  government's  authority  to  take  financial  and  trade  measures  with  the  European  Union  against  key  Russian  industries.In  the  face  of  some  strident  recent  domestic  U.S.  criticism  of  his  foreign  policy,  Obama  will  also  have  platforms  to  showcase  presidential  leadership  at  both  the  EU-U.S.  summit  on  Wednesday,  and  the  NSS  where  he  will  meet  with  more  than  50  national  leaders  including  Chinese  President  Xi.Nuclear  terrorismThe  NSS,  which  will  focus  on  measures  to  enhance  security  of  nuclear  material  stockpiles  and  facilities  across  the  world,  is  the  brainchild  of  Obama  who  believes  that  nuclear  terrorism  represents  "the  most  immediate  and  extreme  threat  to  global  security."The  downturn  in  relations  between  Russia  and  the  West  is  unfortunate  here  given  that  Moscow  is  a  pre-eminent  player  in  attempts  to  counter  the  nuclear  terrorism  threat.  Indeed,  this  issue  first  came  prominently  onto  the  international  radar  screen  following  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union  when  major  concerns  were  raised  about  safeguarding  its  nuclear  weaponry.More  recently,  the  urgency  of  tackling  this  agenda  was  given  impetus  by  the  September  2001  attacks.  This  was  widely  interpreted  as  a  "wake-up  call"  about  the  possibility  that  a  terrorist  group  could  detonate  a  small  nuclear  weapon,  or  a  radiological  dispersal  device  (a  so-called  "dirty  bomb").While  the  conventional  wisdom  is  that  the  probability  of  a  major  nuclear  terrorism  event  is  very  low,  the  consequences  would  be  so  dramatic  that  it  remains  a  major  pre-occupation  of  the  international  community.  Given  the  difficulties  of  terrorist  groups  obtaining  weapons  grade  material,  perhaps  the  bigger  danger  is  a  dirty  bomb  attack.  Here,  conventional  explosives  would  be  used  to  spread  radiation  from  a  radioactive  source.Such  radioactive  sources  are  relatively  widely  available,  including  at  hospitals.Only  last  December,  law  enforcement  authorities  in  Mexico  discovered  a  vehicle  believed  to  have  been  stolen  by  thieves  which  contained  radioactive  medical  materials  that  could  have  been  used  to  power  a  dirty  bomb.Nuclear  Security  Summit  goalsAmongst  the  ambitious  goals  for  the  NSS  include:  ratification  of  the  amended  Convention  on  the  Physical  Protection  of  Nuclear  Material  by  more  countries  to  ensure  that  the  amendment  enters  into  force  as  soon  as  possible;  more  frequent  reviews  of  state  security  structures  by  the  International  Atomic  Energy  Authority;  national  registration  and  protection  of  highly  radioactive  sources  (e.g.  medical  equipment);  and  a  greater  role  for  industry  in  nuclear  security  to  enhance  the  security  culture  and  existing  regulations.Following  up  on  the  summit,  a  significant  body  of  further  work  will  be  needed  to  achieve  Obama's  stated  ambition  to  "secure  all  vulnerable  nuclear  material  around  the  world"  during  his  presidency.  The  next  NSS  will  be  in  Washington  DC  in  2016  and  will  coincide  with  his  last  year  in  the  White  House.Given  recent  criticism  of  his  foreign  policy,  and  conscious  of  his  place  in  history,  Obama  sees  enhancing  global  nuclear  security  as  a  key  part  of  his  presidential  legacy,  especially  following  the  agreement  he  signed  with  Moscow  on  the  New  Strategic  Arms  Reduction  Treaty  (NEW  START)  which  will  see  both  countries  reduce  their  deployed  nuclear  arsenals.Building  upon  this  success,  he  will  now  seek  to  secure  the  strongest  possible  outcomes  from  the  NSS  process,  and  also  push  hard  for  a  comprehensive  nuclear  deal  to  be  reached  with  Iran  to  follow-up  on  last  year's  breakthrough  preliminary  agreement.Read  more:  Obama's  Europe  trip  shifts  focus  to  UkraineRead  more:  How  West  can  respond  to  Russia's  aggressionRead  more:  Sanctions  target  key  aides  from  Putin's  inner  circleThe  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Andrew  Hammond.</TEXT></DOC>

He  is  now  talking  with  scientists  about  the  health  consequences  of  solitary  confinement.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Robert  King  still  remembers  well  the  dimensions  of  his  cell:  6  x  9  x  12  feet.  There  was  a  steel  bed  and  a  sink  that  doubled  as  a  toilet  where  he  would  also  wash  clothes.King  spent  29  years  in  solitary  confinement  in  Louisiana.  He  has  been  free  since  2001,  but  still  has  difficulty  with  geographical  orientation."I  get  confused  as  to  where  I  am,  where  I  should  be,"  he  said.King  joined  researchers  and  legal  experts  at  the  American  Association  for  the  Advancement  of  Science  annual  meeting  in  Chicago  this  month  to  talk  about  the  mental  and  physical  health  consequences  of  solitary  confinement."The  widespread  consensus  among  mental  health  professionals  is  that  solitary  confinement,  for  the  overall  majority  of  mentally  ill  prisoners,  places  them  at  severe  risk  of  additional  harm,"  said  Craig  Haney,  director  of  the  program  in  legal  studies  at  the  University  of  California,  Santa  Cruz.The  talk  was  timely.  This  week,  New  York  state  agreed  to  several  changes  that  would  limit  the  use  of  solitary  confinement  for  disciplining  some  groups  of  inmates,  including  those  under  18  or  pregnant  women.  The  agreement  stemmed  from  a  class-action  lawsuit.The  New  York  State  Department  of  Corrections  provided  to  CNN  a  statement  from  its  acting  commissioner,  which  read  in  part:  "These  are  important  reforms  that  will  make  the  disciplinary  practices  in  New  York's  prisons  more  humane,  and  ultimately,  our  state's  criminal  justice  system  more  fair  and  progressive,  while  maintaining  safety  and  security."A  department  spokesperson  said  no  statement  was  available  on  the  general  use  of  solitary  confinement.A  brief  history  of  solitary  confinementThere  are  about  80,000  people  being  held  in  some  sort  of  solitary-type  confinement  in  the  United  States,  Haney  said.Prisoners  in  solitary  confinement  tend  to  be  restricted  to  cells  of  80  square  feet,  not  much  larger  than  a  king-size  bed,  Haney  said.  Sleeping,  eating  and  defecating  all  take  place  inside  that  space.  For  exercise,  prisoners  in  solitary  confinement  often  get  a  short  time  in  a  cage  rather  than  an  outdoor  yard  --  perhaps  one  hour  per  day.Haney,  who  has  studied  prisons  and  punishment  for  more  than  four  decades,  estimates  that  about  one-third  of  people  in  solitary  confinement  in  this  country  are  mentally  ill,  although  some  prison  systems  do  not  permit  mentally  ill  inmates  to  be  placed  in  solitary  confinement.Solitary  confinement  was  used  broadly  in  the  19th  century,  but  the  punishment  was  then  largely  abandoned  because  of  the  view  that  "it  was  doing  more  harm  than  good,"  Haney  said.Correctional  practice  began  to  reincorporate  solitary  confinement  in  the  late  1970s  and  80s,  as  prisons  began  to  get  overcrowded,  Haney  said.  He  believes  prison  systems  turned  to  solitary  confinement  as  a  short-term  solution  to  controlling  disruptive  or  violent  behavior,  lacking  the  resources  to  provide  positive  incentives  or  programming.But  overcrowding  in  prisons  turned  out  to  be  permanent  and  mostly  increased  each  year.Prison  systems  continued  to  struggle  over  what  to  do  to  resolve  conflicts  or  stop  violence  or  disruption  in  the  institutions.  They  put  more  prisoners  in  solitary  confinement  and  left  them  there  for  longer  periods  of  time,  Haney  said."I  think  the  cost  of  solitary  confinement  is  now  being  critically  examined  and  rethought,  and  prison  systems  are  beginning  to  ask  themselves  whether  this  is  worth  it,  and  whether  or  not  it  does  not  create  more  harm  than  good,"  he  said.  "Courts  are  pushing  them  to  consider  the  inhumanity  of  the  practice,  as  well."'Prison  wasn't  in  me'King  noticed  six  months  into  his  time  in  solitary  confinement  that  his  eyesight  significantly  worsened  --  he  thinks  because  his  eyes  had  become  acclimated  to  such  short  distances  in  his  cell.  Over  time,  he  retrained  his  eyes  so  that  he  would  not  be  so  nearsighted,  he  said.Eye  problems  are  not  uncommon  in  these  circumstances.  In  fact,  Jules  Lobel,  professor  at  the  University  of  Pittsburgh  School  of  Law,  said  there  is  a  swath  of  cataract  surgeries  at  Pelican  Bay  Prison  in  California.Lobel  represents  more  than  1,000  prisoners  at  Pelican  Bay  in  a  lawsuit  alleging  that  keeping  prisoners  in  such  conditions  --  isolated  in  small,  windowless  cells  with  no  physical  contact  or  phone  calls  --  violates  the  Constitution  and  international  law  because  it  is  "cruel  and  inhumane."King,  who  was  freed  when  his  conviction  was  overturned  13  years  ago,  said  his  mental  health  suffered,  too,  but  he  knew  others  were  faring  worse  and  he  was  determined  to  not  let  that  happen  to  himself."I  was  depressed  every  day  I  was  in  prison,"  he  said.  "I  wanted  to  get  out.  I  was  in  prison,  convicted  for  a  crime  I  didn't  commit.  Of  course  I  was  depressed."Initially,  food  was  served  to  him  on  a  tray  under  the  door  to  his  cell;  sometimes  the  tray  was  flung  onto  the  floor  with  its  contents  spilled.  King  said  he  and  other  inmates  filed  a  redress  and  went  on  hunger  strikes  until  they  negotiated  that  holes  would  be  cut  in  bars  to  serve  the  food  in  a  more  sanitary  way.He  said  he  and  others  also  filed  a  lawsuit  so  that  the  prison  would  give  them  the  opportunity  for  outdoor  exercise.  King  could  talk  to  other  prisoners  through  the  walls  or  by  sliding  notes."What  helped  me  weather  the  storm  was:  I  was  in  prison,  but  prison  wasn't  in  me,"  he  said.What  it's  likeSolitary  confinement  has  been  associated  with  many  different  physical  and  psychological  ills."When  isolated  prisoners  are  asked,  they  point  to  anger,  hatred,  bitterness,  boredom,  stress,  loss  of  the  sense  of  reality,  suicidal  thoughts,  trouble  sleeping,  impaired  concentration,  confusion,  depression,  and  hallucinations,"  writes  Peter  Scharff  Smith  of  the  Danish  Institute  for  Human  Rights  in  an  essay  published  by  University  of  Chicago  Press.Several  studies  point  to  headaches,  heart  palpitations,  increased  pulse  and  oversensitivity  to  stimuli  as  symptoms  of  isolated  prisoners,  Scharff  Smith  wrote,  as  well  as  dizziness,  loss  of  appetite  and  weight  loss.Most  studies  on  the  topic  have  found  depression  and  anxiety  among  isolated  inmates,  Scharff  Smith  wrote.A  study  on  the  New  York  City  jail  system  published  this  month  in  the  American  Journal  of  Public  Health  found  that  those  who  had  been  in  solitary  confinement  at  least  once  had  a  higher  likelihood  of  self-harm.Haney  said  identity  disorders  have  also  been  found  among  isolated  prisoners  because  of  the  loss  of  contact  with  the  social  world."People  have  to  structure  their  lives  around  the  absence  of  other  human  beings,"  he  said.  "They  [prisoners  in  solitary  confinement]  go  for  years  on  end  without  touching  anyone  with  affection."Typically  people  released  from  solitary  confinement  don't  get  much  help  transitioning  out  of  it,  he  said.  Some  systems  parole  prisoners  directly  out  of  their  isolated  cells.Lobel  argued  at  the  AAAS  conference  that  social  interaction  and  sensory  stimulation  form  a  basic  human  need,  as  supported  by  science.  Research  has  shown  people  outside  of  prison  who  are  socially  isolated  also  have  a  higher  risk  of  heart  attacks,  hypertension,  concentration  and  memory  problems,  he  said."We're  trying  to  integrate  law  and  science  in  this,"  he  said.Solitary  confinement  and  the  brainThere  aren't  any  direct  brain-imaging  studies  of  people  who  are  in  solitary  confinement  because  of  access  issues,  Huda  Akil,  a  neuroscientist  at  the  University  of  Michigan,  said  at  the  AAAS  conference.  But  available  studies  on  similar  situations  suggest  significant  brain  changes  could  be  occurring.Positive  experiences,  including  social  interaction,  have  positive  impacts  on  the  brain,  such  as  the  activation  of  molecules  called  growth  factors,  which  are  akin  to  fertilizers  for  brain  cells,  helping  them  regrow  and  interact."Depriving  people  of  that  is  physically  depriving  the  brain  from  its  nourishment,"  she  said.Without  any  social  interaction,  some  people  hallucinate  or  become  explosive  in  their  emotions,  she  said.An  absence  of  sunlight  and  being  out  of  sync  with  the  daily  rhythm  could  produce  negative  effects  by  itself,  she  said.  Several  studies  on  shift  workers  have  found  associations  with  various  medical  conditions.Severe  depression  has  profound  impacts  on  the  brain;  autopsies  have  shown  that  "the  orchestration  of  brain  and  activity  of  genes  in  their  brains  is  messed  up"  in  such  patients,  she  said.It's  a  vicious  cycle:  You  feel  bad,  that  produces  stress,  stress  hurts  the  brain,  and  that  makes  you  feel  bad,  Akil  said.Chronic  depression  and  stress  have  been  associated  with  a  shrinking  of  the  hippocampus,  a  seahorse-shaped  brain  area  critical  for  memory,  spatial  recognition  and  controlling  one's  emotions,  Akil  said.  Studies  have  shown  that  the  longer  the  depression  goes  untreated,  the  more  the  hippocampus  shrinks."When  Robert  [King]  tells  you  that  he  gets  disoriented  physically,  I  can  tell  him  that  people  who  are  chronically  depressed  have  a  shrunken  hippocampus,  and  that  that  affects  your  ability  to  orient  in  space,  in  3D,"  she  said.King  told  CNN  after  the  conference  that  this  brain  atrophy  could  be  what  is  happening  to  him."The  brain  somehow  won't  register  things,  and  it  won't  register  exactly  where  I  am,"  he  said.The  Angola  3King  was  one  of  three  inmates  known  as  the  "Angola  3"  who  protested  what  they  said  were  injustices  at  the  Louisiana  State  Penitentiary  at  Angola.  The  three  spent  decades  isolated  in  cells  for  23  hours  a  day.The  other  two,  Herman  Wallace  and  Albert  Woodfox,  were  convicted  in  the  1972  killing  of  a  guard  at  the  Angola  prison.Wallace  died  just  days  after  being  released  from  prison  in  October  2013  at  age  71."His  legacy  will  endure  through  a  civil  lawsuit  that  he  filed  jointly  with  his  fellow  Angola  3  members,  Albert  Woodfox  and  Robert  King,"  Rep.  John  Conyers  Jr.,  D-Michigan,  said  in  October.  "That  lawsuit  seeks  to  define  and  abolish  long-term  solitary  confinement  as  cruel  and  unusual  punishment."Former  'Angola  3'  inmate  dies  days  after  releaseWoodfox  remains  in  prison,  where  he  has  been  in  solitary  confinement  for  more  than  41  years.  Amnesty  International  USA  has  called  for  his  release.King  was  convicted  in  1973  of  killing  a  fellow  inmate,  although  he  believes  he  was  "being  punished  for  being  a  member  of  the  Black  Panther  Party."  He  was  transferred  to  Angola  weeks  after  the  security  guard  was  killed,  but  was  investigated  as  a  possible  conspirator  in  the  slaying.Today,  King  serves  as  an  adviser  to  Solitary  Watch,  an  online  project  devoted  to  news,  firsthand  accounts  and  research  and  reporting  on  solitary  confinement.  He  has  also  campaigned  for  the  release  of  the  other  two  members  of  the  "Angola  3."King  writes  on  his  website:  "I  may  be  free  from  Angola,  but  Angola  will  never  be  free  of  me."CNN's  Phil  Gast  and  Joe  Sutton  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

It  was  not  clear  if  the  killings  were  related  to  the  probe.Moreover,  it  said  that  people  linked  with  various  al  Qaeda-related  groups  in  North  Africa  and  elsewhere  participated  in  the  September  11,  2012,  attack,  but  investigators  haven't  been  able  to  determine  whether  any  one  group  was  in  command.The  report  placed  some  blame  for  the  outcome  on  the  State  Department,  saying  it  should  have  "increased  its  security  posture  more  significantly"  in  Libya's  second-largest  city  because  of  general  warnings  that  U.S.  personnel  were  at  risk.The  intelligence  community  "provided  ample  strategic  warning"  that  Americans  and  U.S.  facilities  were  in  danger,  though  it  didn't  offer  a  single  warning  that  would  have  predicted  the  Benghazi  attack  that  killed  U.S.  Ambassador  to  Libya  Christopher  Stevens  and  three  other  Americans,  the  report  said.But  the  findings  didn't  spare  the  intelligence  community,  saying  it  might  have  flagged  potential  threats  to  the  compound  had  it  done  more  analysis  of  "extremist-affiliated  social  media."It  also  blasted  U.S.  intelligence  for  inaccurately  reporting  --  without  "sufficient  intelligence  to  corroborate  it"  --  that  a  protest  might  have  led  to  the  attack.The  report  said  the  intelligence  community  took  too  long  to  correct  the  erroneous  reports,  "which  caused  confusion  and  influenced  the  public  statements  of  policymakers."The  Obama  administration  initially  believed  the  armed  assault  was  triggered  by  outrage  over  a  U.S.-produced  anti-Muslim  film.  It  has  since  classified  it  as  an  organized  terror  attack.Investigators  haven't  found  evidence  of  pre-planning  and  suggest  at  least  part  of  the  attack  was  "opportunistic."That  suggests  a  vulnerability  for  diplomatic  facilities,  because  attacks  can  happen  with  little  warning,  the  report  said.Questions  around  security  and  intelligence  as  well  as  the  slow-to-evolve  and  changing  explanation  fueled  a  ferocious  response  from  Republicans  in  Congress,  who  have  sharply  criticized  the  administration  and  continue  to  investigate.New  York  Times  report  casts  doubt  on  al  Qaeda  involvement  in  BenghaziA  State  Department  spokeswoman,  Marie  Harf,  said  the  report  largely  affirms  the  findings  of  an  independent  review  of  the  Benghazi  matter  that  recommended  steps  --  since  undertaken  by  the  agency  --  to  improve  security  at  diplomatic  facilities  worldwide.On  the  issue  of  whether  the  attacks  were  preventable,  Harf  noted  that  "we  have  repeatedly  said  there  was  no  specific  threat"  pointing  to  an  attack."Obviously,  we've  talked  at  length  about  the  fact  that  we  knew  there  were  extremists  and  terrorists  operating  in  Libya  and  in  Benghazi.  But,  again,  we  had  no  specific  information  indicating  a  threat  an  attack  was  coming,"  she  said.The  Intelligence  Committee  report  follows  the  release  on  Monday  of  previously  classified  information  by  the  House  Armed  Services  Committee.According  to  the  documents,  senior  military  officials  told  the  panel  there  were  no  discussions  related  to  any  specific  threat  in  Libya  despite  general  warnings  about  the  possibility  of  terror  attacks  around  the  anniversary  of  9/11.  As  a  result,  additional  military  assets  were  not  deployed  to  the  area.On  the  investigation,  the  FBI  was  quoted  in  the  report  as  saying  the  15  deaths  have  severely  hampered  its  probe."The  FBI's  investigation  into  the  individuals  responsible  for  the  Benghazi  attacks  has  been  hampered  by  inadequate  cooperation  and  a  lack  of  capacity  by  foreign  governments  to  hold  these  perpetrators  accountable,  making  the  pursuit  of  justice  for  the  attacks  slow  and  insufficient,"  the  report  said."As  a  result,  key  information  gaps  remain  about  the  potential  foreknowledge  and  complicity  of  Libyan  militia  groups  and  security  forces,  the  level  of  pre-planning  for  the  attacks,  the  perpetrators  and  their  involvement  in  other  terrorist  activities  and  the  motivation  for  the  attacks."Several  Intelligence  Committee  Republicans  issued  a  separate  set  of  conclusions.Committee  Vice  Chairman  Saxby  Chambliss  of  Georgia,  Richard  Burr  of  North  Carolina,  Marco  Rubio  of  Florida,  Tom  Coburn  of  Oklahoma,  and  Dan  Coats  of  Indiana  said  failures  that  led  to  the  attack  could  be  partly  related  to  Obama's  failure,  in  their  words,  to  establish  a  clear  detention  policy  for  terror  suspects  that  gets  the  most  out  of  intelligence  collection.Instead  of  sending  terror  suspects  directly  to  the  military  facility  at  Guantanamo  Bay,  Cuba,  the  administration  has  temporarily  interrogated  suspects  on  Navy  ships,  sometimes  for  weeks  at  a  time,  before  sending  them  to  the  United  States  for  trial."President  Obama  and  his  administration  must  end  their  efforts  to  close  the  detention  facility  at  Guantanamo  Bay  and  must  develop  a  clear,  cogent  policy  for  the  detention  and  interrogation  of  suspected  terrorists,"  the  Senators  wrote.GOP  Rep:  Benghazi  not  a  'complete  cover-up'CNN's  Elise  Labott  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

The  official  start  of  spring  was  March  20,  and  yet  signs  of  winter  abound.There's  snow  on  the  ground  in  the  North,  and  the  South  is  being  tossed  between  40-degree  and  70-degree  weather  like  a  pingpong  ball.Yet  "even  in  the  throes  of  what  feels  like  a  2014  Ice  Age,  millions  of  Americans  have  begun  showing  up  in  doctors'  offices  with  the  tell-tale  signs  of  allergies,"  the  Asthma  and  Allergy  Foundation  of  America  says.Fantastic.Polar  vortex  may  mean  miserable  allergy  seasonIt  may  be  even  worse  for  allergy  sufferers  in  certain  cities  across  the  country.  The  foundation  has  released  its  annual  list  of  the  worst  places  for  spring  allergies.  Topping  the  list  this  year  are  Louisville,  Kentucky;  Memphis,  Tennessee;  and  Baton  Rouge,  Louisiana.These  so-called  allergy  capitals  are  ranked  based  on  pollen  levels,  use  of  allergy  medications  and  the  number  of  board-certified  allergists  in  the  area.Louisville  has  moved  up  the  list  from  No.  5  last  year  because  of  higher-than-average  pollen  counts,  high  use  of  allergy  medications  and  too  few  allergy  specialists,  according  to  the  foundation.New  York;  Columbia,  South  Carolina;  and  San  Antonio  are  new  to  the  top  20.  Only  Los  Angeles  residents  can  breathe  a  sigh  of  relief;  the  city  fell  39  places  from  No.  38  last  year  to  No.  77  this  year.Here  are  the  worst  cities  for  spring  allergies  in  2014:1.

"A  blending  of  the  winter  and  spring  means  these  patients  are  at  risk  of  multiple  symptoms  simultaneously."And  in  case  you  were  keeping  a  close  eye  on  this  type  of  thing,  here  is  last  year's  list  of  spring  "allergy  capitals":1.

While  international  air  travel  features  layers  of  security,  checking  passports  against  an  international  database  of  lost  and  stolen  documents  isn't  a  global  security  standard.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  How  difficult  is  it  to  board  a  plane  with  a  stolen  passport?Not  as  hard  as  you  might  think.In  any  major  international  airport,  it's  not  uncommon  to  have  your  passport  checked  four  times  or  more  between  check-in  and  boarding  the  aircraft.  But  if  passenger  documents  aren't  checked  against  Interpol's  database  of  Stolen  and  Lost  Travel  Documents,  travelers  using  those  documents  can  slip  through  layers  of  security.Reports  that  two  passengers  on  missing  Malaysia  Airlines  Flight  370  were  traveling  on  stolen  Austrian  and  Italian  passports  have  highlighted  security  concerns  that  have  troubled  Interpol  for  years,  the  international  law  enforcement  agency  said  Sunday.  The  flight,  carrying  over  200  passengers,  disappeared  from  radar  on  Saturday  and  hasn't  been  seen  or  heard  from  since."Interpol  is  asking  why  only  a  handful  of  countries  worldwide  are  taking  care  to  make  sure  that  persons  possessing  stolen  passports  are  not  boarding  international  flights,"  said  Interpol  Secretary  General  Ronald  K.  Noble,  in  a  statement.What  happened  to  Flight  370?Before  the  departure  of  Flight  370,  no  country  had  checked  the  stolen  passports  against  Interpol's  list  since  they  were  added  to  the  lost-documents  database  in  2012  and  2013,  Interpol  said.It  is  countries,  not  airlines,  that  have  access  to  Interpol's  data,  and  many  governments  don't  routinely  check  passports  against  the  database.In  2013,  passengers  were  able  to  board  planes  more  than  a  billion  times  without  having  their  travel  documents  checked  against  Interpol's  data,  the  agency  said.  Airlines  carried  more  than  3.1  billion  passengers  globally  in  2013,  according  to  estimates  from  the  International  Air  Transport  Association.Are  stolen  passports  related  to  plane's  disappearance?Investigators  don't  yet  know  if  the  travelers  with  stolen  passports  had  anything  to  do  with  the  plane's  disappearance.  On  any  given  day,  many  people  travel  using  stolen  or  fake  passports  for  reasons  that  have  nothing  to  with  terrorism,  aviation  security  expert  Richard  Bloom  told  CNN.They  might  be  trying  to  immigrate  illegally  to  another  country,  or  they  might  be  smuggling  stolen  goods,  people,  drugs  or  weapons  or  trying  to  import  otherwise  legal  goods  without  paying  taxes,  said  Bloom,  director  of  terrorism,  intelligence  and  security  studies  at  Embry-Riddle  Aeronautical  University."For  all  of  those  reasons,  the  very  notion  that  passports  might  be  important  in  this  particular  situation  may  be  a  red  herring,"  Bloom  said.A  pilot's  take:  Why  so  few  clues  about  missing  Malaysia  flight?While  it's  too  soon  to  speculate  about  any  connection  between  these  stolen  passports  and  the  missing  plane,  Interpol's  Noble  said  the  main  concern  remains  that  any  passenger  was  able  to  board  an  international  flight  using  a  stolen  passport  listed  in  Interpol's  databases."This  is  a  situation  we  had  hoped  never  to  see,"  he  said.  "For  years  Interpol  has  asked  why  should  countries  wait  for  a  tragedy  to  put  prudent  security  measures  in  place  at  borders  and  boarding  gates?"Few  countries  look  up  stolen  passportsInterpol  does  not  charge  countries  for  access  to  its  databases,  but  some  of  the  190  Interpol  member  countries  may  not  have  the  technical  capacity  or  resources  to  access  the  network,  according  to  Tom  Fuentes,  a  former  FBI  assistant  director."It's  just  up  to  the  will  of  the  country  to  set  it  up  and  do  it,"  Fuentes  said.Interpol's  lost-document  database  was  created  in  2002,  following  the  September  11,  2001,  attacks,  to  help  countries  secure  their  borders.  Since  then,  it  has  expanded  from  a  few  thousand  passports  and  searches  to  more  than  40  million  entries  and  more  than  800  million  searches  per  year.About  60,000  of  those  800  million  searches  yield  hits  against  stolen  or  lost  documents,  according  to  Interpol.The  United  States  searches  the  database  more  250  million  times  annually,  the  United  Kingdom  more  than  120  million  times  annually  and  the  United  Arab  Emirates  more  than  50  million  times  annually,  Interpol  said.  (Some  300,000  passports  are  lost  or  stolen  each  year  in  the  United  States,  alone,  according  to  the  U.S.  Department  of  State,  which  collects  reports  of  stolen  passports  and  sends  the  information  to  the  U.S.  Customs  and  Border  Protection  and  Interpol.)The  United  States  routinely  checks  all  inbound  and  outbound  passengers  on  international  flights  against  the  database,  said  Fuentes."If  Malaysia  Airlines  and  all  airlines  worldwide  were  able  to  check  the  passport  details  of  prospective  passengers  against  Interpol's  database,  then  we  would  not  have  to  speculate  whether  stolen  passports  were  used  by  terrorists  to  board  MH  370,"  said  Interpol's  Noble.The  Thailand  connectionThe  Austrian  and  Italian  passports  were  stolen  in  Thailand  in  2012  and  2013,  respectively,  according  to  Interpol.Thailand  is  a  booming  market  for  stolen  passports.  Paul  Quaglia,  who  has  been  working  in  the  region  as  a  security  and  risk  analyst  for  14  years,  said  the  situation  in  Thailand  is  better  than  it  was  5  to  10  years  ago,  "but  still  not  up  to  international  standards.""Unfortunately,  Thailand  remains  a  robust  venue  for  the  sale  of  high-quality  false  passports  (which  includes  altered  stolen  passports)  and  other  supporting  documentation,"  he  said.VIDEO:  Do  stolen  passports  indicate  terrorism?Not  all  "lost"  passports  are  necessarily  "stolen"  passports,  Quaglia  said.  "Some  passports  'lost'  are  actually  sold  by  the  passport  holder.  Some  young  men  and  others  traveling  to  Thailand,  short  on  cash  after  extended  partying  and  high  living,  can  be  approached  to  sell  a  passport,  which  can  be  easily  replaced  at  embassies  upon  presentation  of  a  routine  'lost  passport'  police  report,"  he  said.Searching  for  true  identitiesAn  investigation  has  been  launched  into  the  Flight  370  matter  with  Malaysian  and  aviation  authorities  reviewing  video  and  other  documentation  to  try  to  identify  not  only  who  the  passengers  were  that  used  the  stolen  passports,  but  how  the  illegal  passports  cleared  security.Interpol  has  said  it  is  currently  in  contact  with  its  National  Central  Bureaus  in  the  involved  countries  to  determine  the  true  identities  of  the  passengers  who  used  these  stolen  passports  to  board  the  missing  Malaysia  Airlines  flight.Interpol's  Noble  urged  countries  and  airlines  to  adopt  routine  checks  against  its  lost  and  stolen  document  database."I  sincerely  hope  that  governments  and  airlines  worldwide  will  learn  from  the  tragedy  of  missing  flight  MH  370  and  begin  to  screen  all  passengers'  passports  prior  to  allowing  them  to  board  flights,"  Noble  said."Doing  so  will  indeed  take  us  a  step  closer  to  ensuring  safer  travel."</TEXT></DOC>

She  clutches  her  11-month-old  son,  Sage,  while  trying  to  comprehend  the  situation  unfolding  in  front  of  her.Her  boyfriend  --  Sage's  father,  Aaron  Hillyer  --  is  in  handcuffs."Why  are  you  doing  this?"  she  pleads  with  police  officers  standing  on  the  lawn  outside  her  home."Your  baby  doesn't  need  to  be  subjected  to  marijuana,"  an  officer  replies,  in  an  audio  recording  made  by  Anderson  on  her  cell  phone.But  she  could  explain:  Anderson  and  Hillyer  have  legal  prescriptions  for  the  marijuana  in  their  home.  His  is  prescribed  for  anxiety  and  chronic  pain;  hers  for  depression  and  anxiety."I  told  them  we  had  our  cards,  our  prescriptions,"  said  Anderson,  27.  "They  didn't  want  to  see  them."Not  long  after  that  exchange,  according  to  police  video  of  the  family's  encounter,  a  social  worker  arrived  at  the  home  and  decided  to  place  Sage  in  foster  care."I  was  pleading  with  them,  'Look,  you  guys,  I  understand  your  perception,  but  we  are  wonderful  parents,  hardworking  members  of  our  community,'"  said  Hillyer,  34."They  could  not  conceive  of  the  fact  that  you  can  be  a  wonderful  parent,  a  decent  human  being,  and  medicate  with  marijuana."Dr.  Sanjay  Gupta:  'Doubling  down'  on  medical  marijuanaFor  agencies  enlisted  to  protect  children,  marijuana  in  the  home  has  for  decades  been  an  invitation  for  serious  speculation  about  a  parent's  fitness.But  as  the  narrative  of  medical  marijuana  legalization  unfolds  across  the  country,  so  does  a  complicated  parallel  story  of  patients  whose  children  are  being  removed  to  protective  custody  --  or  worse,  permanently  removed  --  ostensibly  because  of  their  legal  marijuana  use.  Most  medical  marijuana  legislation  does  not  seem  to  account  for  this  possibility."The  judges,  the  police,  CPS  (child  protective  services)  have  been  fighting  this  war  on  drugs  for  so  long,"  said  Maria  Green,  a  medical  marijuana  patient  in  Lansing,  Michigan,  whose  infant  daughter  Bree  was  placed  in  foster  care  last  year."They  just  can't  get  it  out  of  their  minds  that  this  is  an  'evil'  drug  they  have  to  fight  against."To  be  sure,  each  case  has  unique  circumstances,  and  child  welfare  officials  at  both  the  state  and  local  level  do  not  comment  about  specific  cases  while  they  are  in  process,  or  even  once  they  are  closed.Further  complicating  the  picture:  While  medical  marijuana  use  is  legal  in  20  states  and  the  District  of  Columbia,  the  federal  Drug  Enforcement  Administration  classifies  the  drug  as  a  Schedule  I  substance  with  "no  currently  accepted  medical  use  in  the  United  States"  and  high  potential  for  abuse.In  cases  involving  removal  of  children,  medical  marijuana  found  in  the  home  would  seem  to  be  barely  distinguishable  from  other  Schedule  I  substances  --  such  as  heroin  or  ecstasy."CPS  handles  (cases)  the  same  way  regardless  of  what  the  drug  ...  is,"  said  Michael  Weston,  deputy  director  of  public  affairs  and  outreach  programs  at  the  California  Department  of  Social  Services.  "Everything  is  weighed  in  reference  to,  'Is  this  a  danger  to  the  child?  Is  there  a  potential  harm  to  the  child?  Is  this  showing  signs  of  abuse  or  neglect?'"Minister's  daughter:  Cannabis  is  'a  gift  from  God'There  have  been  no  substantive  studies  yet  to  determine  how  medical  marijuana  impacts  parenting.There  is  early  data,  according  to  a  researcher,  suggesting  a  small  increase  in  child  poisonings  among  medical  marijuana  patients  in  states  where  it  is  legal.  And  early  epidemiological  data  draws  a  link  between  medical  cannabis  use  and  increased  corporal  punishment  and  physical  abuse  --  but  not  neglect."We  really  don't  know  what's  going  on,"  said  Bridget  Freisthler,  an  associate  professor  in  the  department  of  social  welfare  at  UCLA,  who  studies  medical  marijuana  use  among  parents."We  don't  know  whether  (medical  marijuana)  affects  parenting  or  whether  caseworkers  need  to  be  concerned  when  they  find  out  this  is  happening  in  the  home."Parents  fighting  to  maintain  custody  of  their  children  say  the  mere  presence  of  medical  marijuana  is  an  almost  reflexive  trigger  for  removal.They  cite  scores  of  anecdotes  concentrated  in  states  where  medical  cannabis  is  legal  --  children  removed  from  homes  where  cannabis  is  used  or  grown;  babies  testing  positive  for  marijuana  at  birth  and  subsequently  removed;  children  removed  because  mothers  breastfed  at  the  same  time  that  they  used  medical  marijuana."Marijuana  use  does  not  make  someone  a  bad  parent,"  said  Sara  Arnold,  co-founder  of  the  Family  Law  and  Cannabis  Alliance.  "It  should  not  be  the  primary  or  sole  basis  for  any  Child  Protective  Services  investigation."But  simply  having  a  medical  marijuana  card  does  not  mean  that  that  patient  is  acting  responsibly  with  the  medication;  nor  does  the  mere  presence  of  marijuana  imply  lack  of  safety,  according  to  experts."Medical  marijuana  as  a  risk  factor  by  itself  doesn't  mean  the  child  isn't  safe,"  said  Michael  Piraino,  chief  executive  officer  of  National  CASA  for  Children,  an  advocacy  group  for  abused  and  neglected  children.  "Most  kids  have  had  risk  factors  but  remain  safe."But  how  do  you  put  together  all  these  pieces  of  information,  of  evidence,  that  a  child  is  or  isn't  safe?"Medical  marijuana  refugees:  'This  was  our  only  hope'The  answers  can  be  as  variable  as  the  homes  where  medical  marijuana  is  used.Piraino  says  issues  related  to  medical  marijuana  use  and  parenthood  have  started  to  come  up  for  his  agency,  but  not  yet  in  a  significant  way.He  notes  that  any  drug  in  the  home  carries  risks,  including  potential  lack  of  attention  to  children's  needs  and  physical  danger  stemming  from  possible  ingestion,  but  that  the  extent  of  those  risks  with  medical  marijuana  is  not  clear.Hillyer  and  Anderson  bristle  at  the  ongoing  debate  about  their  parenting,  and  worse,  the  notion  that  their  use  of  cannabis  could  raise  concerns  about  abuse  or  neglect  of  Sage.  They  say  their  son  is  healthy,  happy  and  nurtured.What  brought  police  officers  to  their  home  in  early  January,  they  say,  was  an  anomaly  --  a  loud  argument.  The  clamor  was  heard  by  a  neighbor,  who  called  the  police.When  officers  later  entered  Hillyer  and  Anderson's  home  to  investigate,  they  discovered  loose  marijuana,  cannabis  oil,  and  marijuana  cigarettes  strewn  on  the  desk  in  the  couple's  living  room.  The  living  room  smelled  like  marijuana.  (Hillyer  says  the  smell  was  lingering  from  the  couple  medicating  the  night  before,  after  Sage  fell  asleep.)"What  I  want  you  to  understand  is  your  baby  doesn't  need  to  be  subject  to  marijuana,"  said  one  officer  in  the  police  video.Anderson  responds,  "What  makes  you  think  he  is?""Because  your  house  really  smelled  bad  of  marijuana,"  said  the  officer.The  smell  of  marijuana,  a  home  in  a  disarray,  medical  cannabis  that  was  visible  --  albeit  out  of  Sage's  reach  --  are  the  roots  of  the  ongoing  case  against  Anderson  and  Hillyer."We  would  never  allow  our  children  to  get  into  our  medical  marijuana,"  said  Hillyer,  adding  that  he  believes  stigma  against  the  plant  is  at  the  heart  of  his  and  other  cases.  "If  (law  enforcement  and  CPS)  had  come  in,  even  if  it  was  a  couple  of  empty  beer  bottles  or  a  wine  bottle,  I  don't  think  anybody  would  have  raised  an  eyebrow."I  had  the  impression  that  we  had  turned  this  corner,"  he  added.  "That  we  had  moved  past  that  stigma.""Is  the  child  happy?  Is  the  child  loved?  Is  the  child  well  cared  for?"  said  Arnold,  who  stressed  that  she  has  no  specific  information  about  Sage's  case,  but  views  it  through  the  lens  of  countless  other  families  she's  counseled.  "Marijuana  on  a  desk  does  not  mean  they're  abusing  or  neglecting  the  child."Nor  does  growing  and  using  marijuana,  said  Green,  the  Michigan  mother  whose  6-month-old  daughter  was  removed  from  her  custody  for  two  months  last  September.According  to  Michigan  law,  both  Green  and  her  husband,  Steve,  are  allowed  to  use  cannabis  medically  --  she  to  treat  multiple  sclerosis,  her  husband  to  treat  epilepsy.  And  she  is  allowed  to  grow  a  certain  number  of  plants  to  supply  to  other  patients.Green  says  the  plants  were  grown  behind  a  locked  door  --  the  children  never  had  access  to  them  --  and  the  couple  never  medicated  in  front  of  the  children.  They  kept  the  marijuana  they  used  locked  up.She  says  a  custody  battle  with  her  ex-husband,  involving  a  son  from  a  previous  marriage,  led  CPS  to  her  door,  and  she  says  despite  the  pains  they  had  taken  to  shield  their  children  from  the  marijuana,  Bree  was  removed  from  the  home  and  assigned  to  protective  custody.A  major  issue  debated  during  the  case:  whether  marijuana  plants  grown  in  the  Green  home  increased  the  danger  of  armed  robbery  and  thus  posed  a  serious  safety  issue  for  children  in  the  home  --  in  other  words,  whether  theoretical  risk  of  harm  to  a  child  constitutes  a  serious  safety  concern.Green  and  other  advocates  say  that  theoretical,  potential  risk  is  not  enough."I  find  it  very  scary  that  parents  can  have  children  taken  away  for  something  that's  a  potential,"  said  Arnold.Video:  Dr.  Sanjay  Gupta  explores  politics  of  potAs  a  consequence  of  Bree's  removal,  Maria  and  Steve  Green  were  ordered  to  stop  using  medical  cannabis.  She  says  she  suffered  some  pain  and  had  to  use  a  walker  at  intervals,  but  Steve  was  worse  off.  He  suffered  nine  or  10  seizures  during  the  two  months  Bree  spent  in  foster  care."You've  got  these  parents  having  to  choose  between  their  medicine  and  their  family,"  said  Arnold.  "That's  an  impossible  choice,  especially  if  your  medicine  makes  you  functional  enough  to  parent."Green  says  that  medical  marijuana  patients  may  not  realize  the  risk  of  a  run-in  with  CPS.  She  advises  patients  not  to  become  too  lax,  and  to  realize  that  not  everyone  --  including  law  enforcement,  CPS,  and  the  judicial  system  --  views  the  marijuana  plant  through  the  same  lens."Think  about  what  are  you  doing  with  the  meds,  where  are  you  smoking,  who  is  watching  your  kids  when  you're  smoking  or  under  the  influence?"  said  Green.  "Have  those  things  in  place.""My  advice  to  parents  is  to  really  go  out  of  your  way  to  make  sure  (your  children)  are  not  exposed  to  it."After  spending  a  few  days  in  jail  --  and  Sage  spending  12  days  in  foster  care  --  Hillyer  and  Anderson  say  they  now  understand.They  are  setting  aside  their  views  about  marijuana  as  a  medical  treatment,  and  view  it  --  at  least  temporarily  --  as  a  potential  barrier  to  maintaining  their  family  unit.That  does  not  ease  their  confusion  about  the  law,  or  their  conviction  that  the  plant  has  medicinal  value."There  are  families  out  there  ...  destroyed  over  a  medicinal  plant,"  said  Hillyer.  "It's  baffling."Watch  Sanjay  Gupta  MD  Saturday  at  4:30pm  and  Sunday  at  7:30am  ET.  For  the  latest  from  Sanjay  Gupta  MD  click  here.</TEXT></DOC>

Some  14%  of  U.S.  travelers  stayed  in  an  all-inclusive  in  2012,  compared  to  8%  in  2010,  according  to  Douglas  Quinby,  PhoCusWright's  vice  president  of  research.We  know  all-inclusive  resorts  aren't  always  the  most  daring  way  to  go  on  vacation.  And  if  you're  dead  set  against  it,  just  skip  it.But  if  you're  on  the  fence  --  curious  but  worried  about  the  stereotypes  --  read  on  as  we  look  at  some  of  the  half-truths  of  this  travel  experience.  There's  as  much  variety  among  all-inclusive  resorts  as  there  is  among  hotels,  and  it's  up  to  you  to  find  the  right  one  for  you.It's  not  all  included"All-inclusive"  generally  means  travelers  are  charged  one  price  for  their  rooms,  all  food  and  drink  (including  certain  alcohol  brands)  and  some  other  activities,  says  Tom  Hall,  the  England-based  director  of  Lonely  Planet's  online  editorial.  Package  prices  can  vary,  depending  on  the  size  and  location  of  your  room.Upscale  alcohol  brands,  motorized  water  sports,  spa  treatments  and  off-site  excursions  are  generally  not  included,  but  they  could  be  at  your  resort.  "What  you  actually  get  for  your  money  differs  from  resort  to  resort,"  Hall  says.Some  resorts  offer  "resort  credits"  that  can  be  used  toward  the  not-included  resort  expenses.It's  not  always  cheapWhile  packaging  may  yield  significant  savings,  you  can  easily  spend  a  bundle  depending  on  your  choice  of  budget  versus  elegant  all-inclusive,  which  country  you  visit,  the  time  of  year  you're  traveling,  room  size  and  room  location  (ocean  versus  garden  view).  And  off-site  excursions  and  spa  treatments  add  to  the  tab.A  week  for  two  at  a  budget  all-inclusive  resort  with  the  typical  buffer  line  could  cost  $1,150  to  $1,600,  while  a  moderate  all-inclusive  with  a  few  more  food  choices  could  cost  $1,650  to  $3,500,  says  Sara  Butruff,  a  Travel  Leaders  travel  agent  in  Apple  Valley,  Minnesota.  A  premium  all-inclusive  resort  could  cost  from  $3,600  to  $10,000  or  more—and  lots  of  amenities  could  be  included  in  that  high-end  choice.But  there's  value  in  knowing  the  final  price  up  front.With  everything  paid  for  ahead  of  time,  "you  know  exactly  how  much  your  room  and  meals  will  be,  and  if  you  don't  want  to,  you  don't  have  to  spend  another  dime,"  says  Debby  Simonton,  a  stay-at-home  mom  in  Coplay,  Pennsylvania,  who  loves  to  take  her  family  to  all-inclusive  resorts  every  couple  of  years.To  Disney  or  not  to  Disney?It's  not  all  bland  buffet  foodSimonton  knows  how  to  work  the  food  options  at  all-inclusive  resorts.  Her  favorite  spot,  Hilton  Rose  Hall  Resort  &  Spa  in  Jamaica,  offers  six  restaurant  options  (some  with  reservations  required),  two  bars  and  room  service.Simonton  loves  to  try  dishes  that  might  be  too  expensive  at  home  if  it  turns  out  she  doesn't  like  them.  But  she's  also  happy  for  the  resorts  to  have  food  she  knows  everyone  in  her  family  will  like.And  what  about  that  buffet  line?  "Learning  how  to  'work'  a  buffet  comes  with  a  little  practice,"  she  says.  "Want  your  omelet  to  have  better  cheese  than  the  shredded  cheddar  the  omelet  chef  has?  Go  to  the  cheese  bar,  grab  some  and  take  it  to  the  chef."Basic  all-inclusives  offer  buffets  and  local  brand  alcohol,  while  the  moderate  all-inclusives  may  offer  lobster  or  other  fancier  fare  for  a  surcharge,  says  Butruff,  the  Minnesota  travel  agent.  Premium  resorts  often  have  more  restaurants,  a  la  carte  restaurants  and  premium  spirits—all  included.Camping:  Horror  or  bliss?Resorts  owned  by  the  same  company  may  offer  reciprocal  dining  privileges  to  give  you  diverse  dining  options.  "Let's  say  you  are  staying  at  the  Sandals  Royal  Caribbean  in  Jamaica,"  says  American  Express  travel  agent  Linda  D'Arcy,  based  in  Oak  Brook,  Illinois.  "You  can  grab  the  complimentary  transfer  over  to  the  Sandals  Montego  Bay  resort  and  eat  (complimentary)  at  the  Japanese  restaurant  on  site  at  the  Sandals  Mo  Bay,  which  they  do  not  have  at  the  Sandals  Royal  Caribbean  property."Some  resorts  include  dining  coupons  in  resort  packages,  which  guests  can  use  in  town  for  dinner  at  no  extra  cost.For  a  fixed  additional  fee,  you  can  often  add  specialty  courses  to  your  stay.  Karisma's  El  Dorado  Royale  resort  in  the  Riviera  Maya,  Mexico,  charges  an  additional  $260  for  its  weeklong  wine  experience,  which  includes  tastings,  cooking  courses,  pairings  and  a  special  dinner.A  variation  on  the  all-inclusiveThere  also  are  resorts  that  offer  flexible  --  and  often  elegant--  food  packages.  The  cost  is  set  so  you're  not  surprised,  but  you  can  opt  out  of  some  daily  meals  to  allow  for  exploration  of  local  dining  spots.Beverly  Ross  recently  returned  from  the  Spa  Retreat  Boutique  Hotel  in  Negril,  where  she  chose  a  meal  plan  that  was  incorporated  into  the  total  cost  of  her  stay.  Ross  researched  all-inclusive  vacations  in  Jamaica  before  choosing  the  Spa  Retreat,  which  offers  partially  inclusive  and  all-inclusive  meal  plans."The  menu  was  designed  around  local  fresh  fish  and  produced  with  healthy  eating  in  mind.  It  was  not  a  buffet  and  the  chef  would  prepare  what  you  requested,"  said  Ross,  a  sociologist  who  teaches  at  California  University  of  Pennsylvania.Is  your  cruise  ship  safe?Not  thinking  is  not  an  optionFail  to  do  your  research  about  what's  included  (or  not)  at  a  particular  resort  and  you're  more  likely  to  get  stuck  with  food  that  doesn't  satisfy,  too-cheap  alcohol,  cheesy  staff  entertainment  or  high  prices  for  off-site  excursions.  You  might  even  show  up  during  hurricane  season  or  the  colder  time  of  year.Some  resorts  have  local  brews  as  part  of  their  included  alcohol  but  charge  extra  for  top-shelf  brands,  if  they  carry  them  at  all.  Resort  restaurants--and  the  number  and  quality  varies  from  resort  to  resort--may  have  restrictions  on  how  many  nights  you  can  reserve  a  table  at  their  swankier  spots.  The  fancier  the  resort,  the  more  likely  it  is  to  carry  higher-end  brands  and  serve  higher-end  food,  and  include  them  in  the  price.Minnesota-based  Butruff  sends  lots  of  cold-weather  clients  to  warm-weather  resorts.  Couples  often  come  into  her  office  with  completely  different  ideas  about  what  they  want  on  vacation,  so  she  quizzes  them."What  do  you  want  to  do  on  vacation?"  she  says.  "What  types  of  hotels  have  you  already  stayed  in?  What  types  of  adventures  have  you  had?""Often  what  they  want  is  not  what  they've  said  they  want."It's  not  all  drunken  parties  (unless  you  want  it  to  be)All-inclusive  alcoholic  drinks  are  part  of  the  appeal.  But  you  can  choose  a  resort  that  focuses  on  lots  of  drinking  way  into  the  night  or  one  that  shuts  down  the  bars  at  8  p.m.  Some  resorts  keeps  the  intensive  drinking  segregated  to  the  resort  bar  or  elsewhere.The  more  upscale  resorts  will  be  a  little  quieter,  says  D'Arcy,  although  their  clientele  aren't  necessarily  limiting  their  drinking.  "I  have  seen  people  who  are  very  drunk  but  expertly  handled  by  the  staff."The  drinking  doesn't  bother  Melissa  McCloud."As  far  as  the  sometimes  crazy  party  scene,  if  that  is  not  your  thing,  go  hang  out  elsewhere  on  the  resort,"  says  McCloud,  a  stay-at-home  mom  from  Bolingbrook,  Illinois,  who  visits  all-inclusive  resorts  once  or  twice  per  year.  "These  all-inclusives  are  usually  huge  places,  and  there  are  plenty  of  places  to  go  and  things  to  do  that  do  not  involve  that!"50  states,  50  spots  for  2014It  doesn't  mean  you're  dullIt's  true  that  some  people  just  want  to  chill  out  on  vacation,  sitting  by  the  pool  or  beach  with  free-flowing  fruity  drinks.  There's  nothing  wrong  with  that,  especially  when  there's  an  Arctic  tundra  at  home.But  you  don't  have  to  stay  within  the  walls.  Step  out  and  explore  local  food  and  culture,  swim  with  the  dolphins  and  do  zip  lining  for  a  fee.  (Look  for  resort  credits  to  fund  those  excursions.)  If  you  want  that  local  flavor,  choose  a  resort  that's  not  miles  and  miles  from  the  closest  towns  and  attractions.Some  people  want  a  specific  sense  of  community  that  all-inclusives  can  provide,  whether  it's  a  focus  on  hedonism,  romance,  LGBT  families  or  sobriety.Sober  Vacations  International  has  taken  over  Club  Med  Turquoise  in  the  Turks  &  Caicos  the  week  ending  February  8,  2014.  Reserving  the  resort  allows  people  in  recovery  to  vacation  with  the  support  of  other  people  trying  to  stay  sober.There's  no  need  to  be  so  snideAnd  be  wary,  you  hip,  do-it-yourself  critics  of  the  all-inclusive  resort.  Right  now  you're  backpacking  through  Latin  America,  jumping  off  trains  in  Eastern  Europe  when  you  hear  about  a  cool  new  art  installation,  or  strolling  through  Tokyo  to  track  down  the  latest  underground  bar.Now  put  a  baby  in  your  Ergo  baby  carrier.Not  so  cool  anymore,  right?  A  few  years  from  now,  you  may  be  partnered  with  kids  in  diapers,  says  Lonely  Planet's  Hall.  Cool  is  less  important  than  a  full  night's  sleep,  teaching  your  daughter  to  swim  or  holding  your  spouse's  hand  as  you  watch  the  sunset."An  all-inclusive  may  be  the  way  to  go,"  he  says.Maybe  you'll  even  want  to  bring  the  grandparents.Have  you  been  to  an  all-inclusive  resort?

Then  her  cancer  came  back.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  When  Elizabeth  Joice  found  out  that  she  was  pregnant,  she  and  her  husband,  Max,  were  ecstatic.A  fertility  specialist  had  told  her  that  this  would  never  happen,  Max  says,  because  of  the  chemotherapy  Elizabeth  underwent  to  beat  sarcoma  in  2010."It  very  much  felt  like  a  miracle,"  he  says.  "Bringing  a  child  into  this  world  --  I  mean,  it  wasn't  just  important  for  me;  it  was  one  of  the  most  important  things  for  Liz."Then,  one  month  into  her  pregnancy,  Elizabeth's  cancer  returned,  he  says.Surgeons  removed  the  tumors  in  her  back,  but  she  needed  a  full-body  MRI  scan  to  know  whether  the  cancer  had  spread.  Because  an  MRI's  contrast  dyes  may  damage  a  developing  fetus,  she  faced  a  difficult  decision.  She  could  either  terminate  her  pregnancy  to  undergo  the  scan  or  continue  with  the  pregnancy  without  knowing  her  true  cancer  status."We  felt  that  if  we  terminated  this  pregnancy  and  did  these  scans,  if  it  turned  out  that  there  was  no  evidence  of  this  disease  after  the  scans,  then  we  would  have  possibly  given  up  our  only  chance  at  having  a  child  naturally  and  would  have  done  it  for  nothing,"  Max  said."It  was  a  calculated  risk.  We  knew  there  was  a  possibility  of  a  worst-case  scenario,  but  we  also  thought  there  was  a  good  chance  that  we  could  have  the  baby."Shortly  after  becoming  pregnant,  Elizabeth  was  introduced  to  filmmaker  Christopher  Henze.  His  upcoming  documentary  on  pregnancy  and  motherhood  will  include  the  Joices'  story."It  took  about  three  minutes  to  realize  that  Liz  was  a  stellar  human  being,  and  I  wanted  her  for  my  movie,"  Henze  said.  "I  was  impressed  by  the  way  she  looked  at  cancer  as  another  problem  to  be  solved."Even  though  a  shielded  chest  X-ray  taken  in  November  found  no  sign  of  cancer,  by  January,  she  was  having  trouble  breathing.  Another  X-ray  revealed  tumors  in  her  lungs.  Her  C-section  date  was  moved  up,  and  on  January  23  --  six  weeks  early  --  Lily  Joice  was  born."It  was  incredibly  difficult  to  want  to  enjoy  this  amazing  moment  as  much  as  you  possibly  can,"  Max  said.  "Yet  to  know  that  you're  facing  something  so  incredibly  dire,  and  the  chances  didn't  look  good  at  that  point."After  delivery,  doctors  found  cancer  in  Elizabeth's  heart,  abdomen  and  pelvis.She  died  in  the  hospital  on  March  9.  She  was  36."In  the  face  of  this  life-threatening  illness,"  her  husband  said,  "she  was  so  optimistic  and  so  strong  and  so  willing  to  go  through  whatever  fight  she  would  have  to  go  through  in  order  to  have  this  baby."Henze  delivered  a  eulogy  at  Elizabeth's  funeral."Lots  of  people  say  'Liz  was';  I  say  'Liz  is,'  "  Henze  said.  "Through  her  spirit  and  grace,  she  is  still  affecting  people,  and  she  will  through  the  movie,  will  continue  to  impact  people.  Liz  is."CNN's  Jennifer  Bixler  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

"The  government  of  India  will  respond  in  due  course,"  he  said  in  a  statement.She  was  originally  arrested  and  strip-searched  by  federal  agents  in  New  York  City  in  December  2013.  On  January  9,  a  federal  grand  jury  indicted  her  on  one  count  of  visa  fraud  and  one  count  of  making  false  statements,  the  same  charges  she  now  faces.Khobragade  filed  a  motion  to  dismiss  the  charges,  claiming  she  was  "cloaked  in  diplomatic  immunity  at  the  time  of  her  arrest,"  according  to  court  documents.A  federal  judge  agreed  on  Monday,  ruling  that  Khobragade  was  "appointed  a  Counselor  to  the  Permanent  Mission  of  India  to  the  United  Nations,  a  position  that  cloaked  her  with  full  diplomatic  immunity,"  according  to  court  documents.  She  was  appointed  to  that  position  on  January  8,  one  day  before  her  first  indictment."Even  if  Khobragade  had  no  immunity  at  the  time  of  her  arrest  and  has  none  now,  her  acquisition  of  immunity  during  the  pendency  of  proceedings  mandates  dismissal,"  U.S.  District  Judge  Shira  Scheindlin  wrote."The  government  may  not  proceed  on  an  indictment  obtained  when  Khobragade  was  immune  from  the  jurisdiction  of  the  court,"  Scheindlin  ruled.Arshack  on  Monday  said  Khobragade  was  pleased  "the  rule  of  law  has  prevailed."India's  external  affairs  spokesman,  Syed  Akbaruddin,  issued  a  statement  then  welcoming  the  ruling.Khobragade's  case  drew  international  attention,  with  Indian  officials  demanding  apologies  from  Washington,  and  the  United  States  announcing  it  would  withdraw  one  official  from  its  embassy  in  New  Delhi.CNN's  Allison  Malloy  in  New  York  and  Harmeet  Singh  in  New  Delhi  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

To  mark  this  occasion  of  feline  loss,  we  ask  that  all  minions  observe  a  moment  of  silent  contemplation  ......  thank  you  for  your  kind  attention.  This  moment  has  been  duly  noted  on  your  timecards  and  will  be  deducted  from  your  pay.That  is  all.Yes,  The  Colonel  is  dead.And  the  Internet  mourns  the  passing  of  a  truly  magnificent  animal.An  animal  who  struck  fear  into  the  hearts  of  lesser  beings.  An  animal  who  became  an  icon.  An  animal  who  routinely  pooped  in  his  own  fur."Bask,  I  say!  Bask  in  the  glory  of  my  partially  digested  Fancy  Feast!"Though  the  ever-scowling  Colonel  Meow  may  not  have  been  quite  as  world-famous  and  instantly  recognizable  as  Grumpy  Cat,  he  was  definitely  first.

While  listening  to  "O  Fortuna."To  the  Internet  world  he  was  an  "adorable  fearsome  dictator"  whose  toothy  anger-face  ruled  over  all  mankind.Not  bad  for  a  cat  of  humble  roots.  And  with  no  testicles.Colonel  Meow's  rise  to  power  started  in  a  roadside  gutter  --  sad,  scared,  and  alone.  And  not  completely  dissimilar  to  how  I  spend  my  weekends.  (Things  are  weird  at  home.)Eventually  rescued  from  the  mean  streets,  he  was  taken  in  by  the  Seattle  Himalayan  and  Persian  Society,  and  later  adopted  at  Petco  by  a  loving  human  named  Anna  Marie  Avey.Who  soon  became  known  simply  as  "Slave  Beast."Colonel  Meow's  true  rise  to  power  began  when  Avey  and  her  husband,  Eric  Rosario,  began  posting  images  of  him  on  Instagram.  Almost  immediately,  he  was  a  star,  and  The  Colonel  commanded  allegiance  from  a  growing  number  of  faithful  admirers.His  minions.And  though  he  didn't  actually  accomplish  much  during  his  reign  --  save  for  countless  naps  and  a  finely  developed  pallet  for  Scotch  --  Colonel  Meow  did,  however,  leave  this  world  with  at  least  one  true  medal  of  honor.He  holds  the  Guinness  World  Record  for  "cat  with  the  longest  fur."In  fact,  three  independent  vets  measured  and  confirmed  his  coat,  which  averaged  out  to  22.89  centimeters.That's  roughly  9  inches  of  furry  greatness.Now,  not  only  was  he  the  world's  angriest  cat,  he  was  also  the  fluffiest.  So  fluffy  you  could  die.Which,  if  those  were  his  wishes,  you  most  certainly  would.But  Colonel  Meow  also  had  a  gentle  side,  which  sort  of  reads  like  my  profile  on  Christian  Mingle.He  was  scared  of  the  things  he  coughed  up.  He  liked  to  be  held.  And  he  enjoyed  having  his  butt  scratched.And,  somewhat  surprisingly,  he  also  had  an  unexpected  best  friend  named  Boots  --  a  golden  retriever  he  lovingly  described  on  Facebook  as  "stupid."But,  mostly,  Colonel  Meow  was  fearsome.  And  powerful.  And  for  a  brief,  incredible  moment  in  time,  it  was  truly  The  Colonel's  world.The  rest  of  us  just  got  to  live  in  it.  I  chose  not  to  wear  pants.However,  in  November  2013,  it  all  came  crashing  down.  Colonel  Meow  suddenly  became  ill  and  was  hospitalized  with  heart  problems.  And  only  a  couple  months  later,  he  was  gone.Grumpy  Cat  responded  to  the  news  on  Twitter:  Rest  in  peace  @colonel_meow.  A  grumpy  day  indeed.  #RIPColonelMeowAnother  Internet-famous  cat,  Lil  Bub,  also  expressed  his  condolences:  Dear  @colonel_meow  --  You  are  without  question  the  most  regal  feline  I  have  ever  known.  See  you  in  space  dear  friend.And  space  is  exactly  where  Colonel  Meow  now  looks  down  upon  his  minions,  a  proud  and  regal  cat  floating  through  eternity.Slowly.

There  is  just  one  problem:  Everyone  you  know  wants  to  go  there.How  to  lose  the  crowds  when  seeking  an  ideal  tropical  getaway?  Forget  well-traveled  spots,  where  the  sprawling  hotels  are  thicker  than  coconut  palms.  If  you  really  want  to  leave  the  only  footprints  in  the  sand,  go  to  one  of  the  Caribbean's  lesser-known  islands.Petit  St.  Vincent,  for  example,  a  gem-like  private  island  resort  in  the  Grenadines,  falls  happily  under  the  radar  compared  to  its  sister  island,  Mustique."We  recently  had  a  guest  who  wanted  complete  privacy  for  the  two  weeks  that  he  was  here,"  says  Matt  Semark,  general  manager  of  Petit  St.  Vincent.  "That's  no  problem  at  a  place  like  this."  The  guest,  Semark  says,  sunned  and  swam  at  the  hidden  slice  of  beach  fronting  his  hibiscus-edged  cottage,  took  all  his  meals  on  his  own  spacious  deck  and  wasn't  faced  with  one  other  guest  during  his  stay.Departures:  Stunning  hotel  plunge  poolsWhile  not  every  under-hyped  Caribbean  island  can  offer  that  level  of  solitude,  there  are  many  that  hit  the  mark  or  come  close.Here  are  seven  peaceful  escapes:Cayo  EspantoJust  off  the  coast  of  Belize,  this  diminutive  private  island  --  at  just  four  acres,  it  contains  six  luxe  private  villas  and  one  overwater  bungalow  --  has  hosted  a  staggering  list  of  seclusion-seeking  A-listers  (Tiger  Woods  and  Leonardo  DiCaprio  among  them).  As  befits  such  a  clientele,  every  aspect  of  the  experience  here  can  be  tailored  to  guests'  whims.  The  chef  customizes  daily  menus,  and  staffers  arrange  outings  like  guided  bird-watching  treks,  tours  of  Mayan  ruins  and  beachside  aromatherapy  couples'  massages.  Rooms  start  at  $1,495;  910-323-8355;  aprivateisland.com.7  private  island  rentalsDominicaPart  of  the  Lesser  Antilles,  this  large,  jungle-covered  island  (much  of  which  is  a  protected  nature  preserve)  attracts  mostly  in-the-know  ecotravelers.  Stay  at  two-year-old  Secret  Bay  (rooms  from  $360;  767-445-4444;  secretbay.dm),  set  on  a  clifftop  on  the  island's  northwestern  coast  between  two  equally  dazzling  swimming  beaches.  (One  has  a  hidden  cave.)  Guests  stay  in  one  of  five  tree  house-style  villas  and  bungalows,  all  built  of  Guyanese  wood  with  floor-to-ceiling  windows  and  outdoor  showers.  Activities  include  guided  nature  hikes,  kayak  expeditions  and  yoga  in  an  open-air  pavilion.Departures:  Top  private  movie  theatersGuana  IslandThe  850  acres  that  comprise  this  British  Virgin  Island  are  home  to  more  than  50  bird,  14  reptile  and  200  plant  and  insect  species,  not  to  mention  the  myriad  sea  creatures  that  inhabit  its  waters.  (The  land  is  a  protected  wildlife  sanctuary.)  Guana's  single  private  resort  maintains  some  12  miles  of  walking  trails  that  allow  guests  to  explore  its  tropical  forests,  seven  beaches  and  sugar-plantation  ruins  on  foot.  The  resort  houses  just  19  cottages  and  five  lavish  villas  (the  latter  have  private  pools),  along  with  a  terrace  restaurant,  a  small  water-sport  center  and  a  bar  for  those  who  want  to  socialize.  Rooms  start  at  $695;  212-482-6247;  guana.com.Isla  HolboxDespite  its  proximity  to  the  perpetually  thronged  Riviera  Maya,  this  25-mile-long  island  off  the  northern  tip  of  Mexico's  Yucatán  Peninsula  has  managed  to  stay  sleepily  unspoiled.  Surprising,  given  that  Isla  Holbox  is  one  of  the  best  places  on  earth  to  snorkel  among  whale  sharks  --  enormous,  harmless  creatures  that  migrate  to  the  waters  here  each  year  between  June  and  September.  Of  the  20-odd  lodging  options,  CasaSandra  (rooms  from  $233;  52-984/875-2171)  --  an  elegant,  18-suite  Mr  &  Mrs  Smith  resort  with  a  top-notch  seafood  restaurant  and  daily  whale-shark  boat  trips  --  leads  the  charge.Departures:  10  top  guest  ranchesKamalame  CayOccupying  a  pristine,  96-acre  private  island  off  the  north  coast  of  Andros  in  the  Bahamas,  this  boutique  resort  is  still  run  by  the  same  family  that  built  it  in  the  1990s.  The  property,  though,  epitomizes  modern  barefoot  chic,  encompassing  19  breezy  rooms  and  suites  --  most  with  French  doors,  soaring  Balinese-style  peaked  roofs  and  verandas  overlooking  the  beach.  The  island  sits  adjacent  to  the  Andros  Barrier  Reef  (the  third  largest  in  the  world),  which  teems  with  sea  life;  guests  can  explore  with  scuba  and  snorkeling  excursions  from  the  on-site  dive  center,  guided  half-  or  full-day  bonefishing  trips  or  borrowed  kayaks  from  the  resort's  fleet.  Rooms  start  at  $407;  876-632-3213;  kamalame.com.Peter  IslandThough  it's  one  of  the  largest  British  Virgin  Islands,  the  nearly  2,000-acre  Peter  Island  is  private,  unlike  many  of  its  neighbors.  Yet  its  eponymous  resort  offers  the  sorts  of  amenities  one  would  find  at  much  larger  properties,  including  a  full-service,  15-slip  yacht  club;  a  10,000-square-foot  Ayurvedic  spa;  a  dive  shop  and  water-sports  center;  and  several  restaurants  and  bars  (one  of  which  hosts  a  weekly  vintner's  dinner).  Many  of  the  55  spacious  rooms,  suites  and  villas  are  set  directly  off  the  stunning  sweep  of  Deadman's  Beach.  Rooms  start  at  $385;  800-346-4451;  peterisland.com.Petit  St.  VincentPart  of  the  Grenadines,  this  115-acre  private  island  resort  is  a  luxurious  place  to  unplug.  There  are  no  phones  or  Internet  connectivity  in  the  22  seaside  stone-and-timber  villas,  nor  at  the  casual  beach  bar  or  the  sumptuous  tree-house  spa  or  along  the  nearly  two  miles  of  shoreline.  (There  is,  however,  WiFi  at  the  hilltop  restaurant  and  reception  area.)  Instead  of  checking  e-mails  or  uploading  Instagram  photos,  guests  can  enjoy  cruises  aboard  the  resort's  lovely  traditional  wood  sailing  sloop,  snorkeling  with  sea  turtles  in  the  nearby  Tobago  Cays  or  lazing  in  one  of  the  property's  ubiquitous  shady  hammocks.

Bad  hips  are  common  in  my  family,  and  years  of  sports  and  working  as  a  Baltimore  city  police  officer  had  taken  their  toll  sooner  than  I  expected."You  won't  be  able  to  run  again."  I  knew  that  one  statement  could  very  well  cost  me  my  livelihood;  as  a  police  officer,  you  have  to  be  able  to  run.I  was  34  years  young.  I  had  a  2-year-old  child.Sitting  in  the  doctor's  office,  I  cried.  I  was  too  young  not  to  run.  I  had  no  idea  what  I  was  going  to  do,  or  if  I  was  even  going  to  get  this  operation.My  doctor  told  me  that  if  I  didn't  have  surgery  I  would  be  bound  to  a  wheelchair  within  a  couple  of  months.So  on  September  23,  2003,  I  got  my  hip  replaced.Cancer  robbed  me  of  my  health;  now  I'm  taking  it  backOnce  I  recovered  from  surgery  I  made  up  in  my  mind  that  this  was  not  going  to  defeat  me.  My  favorite  Bible  verse  came  to  mind,  Philippians  4:13:  "I  can  do  all  things  through  Christ  which  strengtheneth  me."So  I  got  up  and  started  walking.  If  running  was  out  of  the  question,  I  was  going  to  do  everything  in  my  power  to  stay  active.Eight  years  later,  in  2011,  the  same  hip  started  to  give  me  problems  once  again,  and  the  doctor  told  me  I  needed  another  surgery.That  dying  patient  could  have  been  meAfter  my  second  hip  replacement,  I  knew  had  to  get  myself  together  and  beat  this  demon.  I  have  been  competitive  all  my  life.  More  determined  than  ever  to  prove  my  doctor  wrong,  I  got  a  trainer  and  enlisted  help  from  my  co-worker.My  trainer  started  me  off  with  cardio,  weight  training  and  a  healthier  diet.  My  co-worker  and  I  began  to  walk  outside,  then  very  slowly  began  to  run.  Just  baby  steps.  I  had  a  little  pain  in  my  hip  at  times,  but  nothing  stopped  me  from  doing  the  workouts.Over  time,  those  baby  steps  became  big  girl  steps.Never  did  I  think  I  would  love  running  as  much  as  I  do.  In  2013,  I  ran  my  very  first  race:  a  10K,  which  is  6.1  miles.  The  feeling  I  had  when  I  crossed  that  finish  line  was  unbelievable.  The  joy  I  felt  I  can't  explain.I  pushed  through  two  hip  replacements  to  run  five  5K  races  and  a  half  marathon.  Now  I'm  training  for  a  triathlon.  What's  your  excuse?You  see,  you  can  do  anything  if  you  put  your  mind  to  it.  Do  you  have  something  that  someone  told  you  you  couldn't  do?  Don't  believe  them.

And  those  difficult  decisions,  the  statement  continues,  "require  the  Academy  to  cut  segments  due  to  the  logistics  of  production."Initially,  Miles  was  going  to  appear  during  the  Oscars'  superhero  segment  along  with  Garfield.  Miles  has  become  about  as  famous  as  the  actor,  thanks  to  his  heroic  efforts  as  "BatKid"  last  fall.  Miles  has  been  fighting  leukemia  since  he  was  20  months  old,  and,  through  the  "Make-A-Wish"  foundation,  wanted  nothing  more  than  to  be  Batman  for  the  day.In  November  his  wish  was  granted,  as  San  Francisco  was  turned  into  Gotham  and  thousands  of  volunteers  --  including  President  Obama  --  rooted  for  Miles  and  pitched  in  to  give  him  plenty  of  crime-fighting  to  do.His  participation  in  the  Oscars  ceremony  would  have  been  a  treat,  for  both  Miles  and  the  viewers  at  home.But  on  March  5,  the  New  York  Post's  Page  Six  ran  a  story  implying  that  tension  between  Garfield  and  the  show's  producers  led  to  the  bit  being  pulled.Both  the  Academy  and  Garfield  have  disputed  those  claims,  saying  that  it  was  a  mutual  understanding  that  the  segment  needed  to  be  eliminated.Garfield's  lawyers  told  the  Post  that  "Andrew  did  nothing  but  give  his  time  to  Miles,"  and  that  it  was  producers  Zadan  and  Meron  who  "decided  the  bit  didn't  flow.  It  didn't  work.  It  wasn't  because  Andrew  refused  anything."And  according  to  the  Academy,  Garfield  "understood  that  his  segment  had  to  be  omitted,  and  he  drove  to  Disneyland  on  Monday  to  spend  time  with  5-year-old  Miles  Scott  and  his  family."CNN's  Carolyn  Sung  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

But  making  time  to  pursue  her  passion  is  as  much  of  a  challenge  for  Jeanne  Loring,  director  of  the  Center  for  Regenerative  Medicine  at  the  Scripps  Research  Institute  in  San  Diego,  as  it  is  for  anyone  else.Loring  and  her  husband  haven't  let  busy  careers  get  in  the  way  of  their  pastimes.  Instead,  they've  found  unique  ways  to  make  their  hobbies  work  for  them,  resisting  the  kinds  of  excuses  that  often  keep  people  from  pursuing  their  passions.  Excuses  like...But...  I  don't  have  time"We  could  just  work  forever,  all  the  time,"  observes  Loring.  "But  if  we  say,  'We're  leaving  at  this  time  and  not  changing  the  time  of  our  trip  because  the  eclipse  isn't  going  to  change,'  then  it  doesn't  matter  what's  happening  in  the  rest  of  the  world  or  whether  people  want  us  to  stick  around  for  a  meeting  or  whatever.  It's  just  off  the  table."upwave:  Making  time  for  yourself:  5  excuses  debunkedBut...  it's  too  expensiveBack  in  1979,  Loring  and  her  husband  drove  all  night  and  slept  on  a  friend's  floor  so  they  could  see  their  first  eclipse  (at  Oregon's  Columbia  River  Gorge).  Exotic,  pricier  locales  came  later.  A  lack  of  funds  doesn't  have  to  keep  you  from  following  your  bliss.But...  I'm  not  very  good  at  itIn  one  happiness  study,  social  psychologists  Lee  Ross  and  Sonja  Lybomirsky  found  that  happy  people  focus  on  their  own  performance  instead  of  getting  caught  in  the  comparison  trap.  Unhappy  people,  on  the  other  hand,  become  upset  when  someone  else  does  better  than  they  do  --  even  if  they  themselves  are  successful.upwave:  How  to  stop  comparing  yourself  to  othersThe  key  is  to  be  happy  with  what  you  have.  Loring  doesn't  let  her  amateur-photographer  status  keep  her  from  taking  pictures  of  the  spectacular  sights  she  sees.  "My  pictures  are  never  as  good  as  other  people's  pictures,  but  I  just  have  to  do  it,"  she  says.  "I  started  taking  pictures  with  a  manual  camera;  I  got  this  gigantic  lens  for  it.  For  the  first  few  eclipses,  I  used  that  one.  Now  I  have  a  camera  I  don't  really  use  very  much  unless  we  go  to  eclipses."  Loring  built  filters  for  it  using  cardboard,  electrical  tape  and  an  opaque  Mylar  material  --  not  exactly  the  equipment  of  an  expert,  but  good  enough  for  a  woman  pursuing  a  passion.But...  I  had  a  bad  experience  with  it  onceLife  events  can  be  remembered  in  either  a  negative  or  positive  light  --  it  all  depends  on  what  you  choose  to  highlight.  Says  Ross,  "You  can  say,  'Poor  me!  I've  had  this  unhappy  thing  [happen].'  Or  you  can  say,  'That  was  then.  Things  are  better  now.'"  Loring  recalls  her  1980s  trip  to  an  unexpectedly  chilly  Zambia  to  see  an  eclipse.  "The  temperature  [dropped]  20  degrees  over  a  few  minutes,"  she  says.  "[That's]  a  really  dramatic,  hard-to-ignore  kind  of  phenomenon."  But  according  to  Loring,  her  young  niece,  who  was  also  on  the  trip,  described  the  scene  this  way:  "The  cows  went  back  to  the  barn  and  the  night  birds  started  singing  and  all  the  day  birds  went  to  sleep."  See?  It's  simply  a  matter  of  perspective.upwave:  Does  a  positive  outlook  make  you  happy?But...  I'm  lonelyPursuing  a  hobby  that  makes  you  happy  can  eradicate  loneliness  because  it  gives  you  the  chance  to  connect  with  people  who  share  similar  interests.  Loring  and  her  husband  have  visited  Antarctica  and  Peru  with  friends  they  met  while  chasing  eclipses  over  the  years.  "If  we  don't  have  an  eclipse  to  go  to  in  a  particular  year...  we  go  on  another  trip  that  is  adventurous,"  she  says.upwave:  No  more  BUTS:  Go  on  an  adventureSo,  what  makes  you  feel  happy?  Is  it  making  music,  painting,  digging  in  a  garden?  Something  more  exotic?  Whatever  it  is,  ask  yourself:  What  am  I  going  to  do  today  to  make  it  happen?This  article  was  originally  published  on  upwave.com.©  2013  upwave,  All  Rights  Reserved.</TEXT></DOC>

They  were  heritage  breed  birds,  Bourbon  reds  whose  numbers  had  dwindled  to  dangerously  low  levels  as  the  broad-breasted  white  --  the  Butterball  --  dominated.At  the  time,  the  farmers  were  still  a  little  queasy  about  slaughtering  and  selling  livestock  they'd  raised.

But  by  giving  these  turkeys  a  productive  death,  they  explained,  they  were  actually  helping  them  survive.If  they  weren't  for  dinner,  these  birds  just  weren't  useful.  They  were  neither  cuddly  nor  well-behaved.  They  made  terrible  pets,  and  weren't  well-suited  for  life  in  the  wilderness.  They  weren't  destined  for  poultry  popularity,  either  --  maybe  your  grandparents  would  recognize  their  gamey  flavor,  but  it  was  nothing  like  the  gravy-slathered  protein  that  generations  had  gobbled  down  over  the  holidays.But  if  they  enticed  enough  Thanksgiving  cooks  to  prepare  them,  the  farmers  saw  a  win  for  biodiversity  and  the  birds.  Give  them  a  reason  to  exist,  and  these  turkeys  could  thrive.I  thought  of  those  birds  recently  when  College  Board  President  and  CEO  David  Coleman  explained  sweeping  changes  planned  for  the  SAT  exam.  Come  spring  2016,  the  essay  will  be  optional.  The  score  scale  will  return  to  familiar  ol'  1600.  The  test  prep  will  be  free,  and  delivered  via  Khan  Academy.And,  the  SAT  word  will  be  no  more,  Coleman  said.  Just  like  those  old-timey  turkeys,  it  seems  there's  limited  use  for  the  $5  words  we've  come  to  expect  from  the  SAT."Today,  when  we  say  that  someone  has  used  an  SAT  word,  it  often  means  a  word  you  have  not  heard  before  and  are  not  likely  to  soon  hear  again,"  Coleman  explained  in  his  announcement.You  know  these  words  if  you  took  the  test,  its  preparatory  cousin,  the  PSAT,  or  almost  any  college-minded  standardized  test.  You  flipped  through  their  definitions  on  flash  cards,  or  faced  them  in  a  spelling  bee,  if  you  were  that  kind  of  kid.  You  probably  still  use  a  number  of  them:  "threatened,"  "vigilant,"  "predicting,"  "ousting"  and  "strengthened"  all  appeared  on  an  SAT  test  in  2013.Of  course,  "bellicosity,"  "obduracy"  and  "garrulous"  were  on  the  test,  too.After  the  frenzy  and  stress  of  SAT  cramming,  the  words  become  kind  of  a  parenthetical  joke,  a  chance  to  finally  giggle  at  the  absurdity  of  it  all.  Drop  "mellifluous"  or  "loquacious"  into  a  sentence  after  the  college  applications  are  sent,  and  you  can  actually  stop  to  appreciate  it  --  "Hey,  I  just  used  an  SAT  word!"Coleman  said  he's  done  indulging  tricks  and  flash  cards  that  promise  to  beat  his  test,  especially  at  the  expense  of  deep,  analytical  reading  and  understanding.  If  the  college  exam  tests  only  obscure  vocabulary  words,  "students  stop  reading  and  start  flipping,"  he  said.The  redesigned  SAT  will  instead  focus  on  words  students  are  likely  to  use  over  and  over  again,  he  said,  like  "synthesis"  and  "empirical.""The  SAT  will  honor  the  best  work  of  our  classrooms  --  reading  widely  and  learning  how  words  work  in  their  different  contexts,"  he  said.  "We  aim  to  offer  worthy  challenges,  not  artificial  obstacles."But  I  wondered,  if  the  SAT  abandons  these  words,  what  will  become  of  "treacly"  and  "mendacious"?  Are  they  turkeys  on  the  verge  of  extinction?Hardly,  linguist  Geoffrey  Nunberg  explained.  The  SAT  wasn't  keeping  them  alive,  he  said,  and  flash  cards  weren't  doing  justice  to  many  words,  anyway.Sure,  those  quick  definitions  did  well  enough  for  a  multiple  choice  test.  "You  can  pick  'em  out  of  a  lineup,"  said  Nunberg,  who  teaches  in  University  of  California  Berkeley's  School  of  Information.  "If  you  see  'mendacious'  and  you  think  'dishonest,'  you've  got  the  main  idea."But  "empirical,"  he  said?  Now  that's  a  complex  word.  It's  got  varied  and  layered  meanings,  some  buried  deep  in  history,  or  evolving  only  now."Under  the  guise  of  providing  more  user-friendly,  fair  tests,  they're  merely  substituting  one  set  of  SAT  words  for  another,"  Nunberg  said.  "If  anything,  this  calls  for  more  tutoring,  and  more  background  than  the  old  words."He  suspects  that  students  might  remember  more  from  their  SAT  study  sessions  than  anybody  realizes,  but  the  words  are  even  less  forgettable  if  students  learn  them  through  reading  instead  of  flash  cards.  Regardless,  the  test  will  never  get  much  credit;  if  you  memorize  a  word  and  use  it  often  enough,  he  said,  you're  unlikely  to  be  able  to  pinpoint  that  you  learned  it  for  the  SAT.And  if  you  don't  use  it?"If  people  don't  use  the  word,"  Nunberg  said,  "it's  because  they  don't  need  the  word."There  are  no  guarantees  about  the  vocabulary  of  the  future  SAT.  The  College  Board  certainly  hasn't  released  a  list  of  banned  words,  and  it's  not  as  if  the  passages  will  suddenly  read  like  "Fun  with  Dick  and  Jane."  It  wouldn't  be  a  test,  Nunberg  said,  if  everybody  could  answer  all  the  questions  correctly."Everything  is  an  SAT  word  to  somebody,"  he  said.Consider  just  one  of  the  changes  coming  to  the  SAT  in  2016:  Each  exam  will  include  passages  from  meaningful  historic  documents  like  the  Declaration  of  Independence,  the  Federalist  Papers  and  the  Rev.  Martin  Luther  King  Jr.'s  "Letter  from  Birmingham  Jail."In  King's  nearly  7,000-word  letter,  he  dropped  "cognizant,"  "superficial,"  "moratorium,"  "unfettered,"  "ominous,"  "ordinance,"  "paternalistically,"  "incorrigible,"  "zeitgeist,"  "sanctimonious,"  "nullification,"  "gladiatorial,"  "scintillating"  and  "existential."  Any  of  them  could  be  called  an  "SAT  word."  Any  of  them  could  be  on  the  new  test.So,  word  lovers,  do  not  mourn  the  next  generation's  vocabulary.  Educators,  do  not  celebrate  the  end  of  flash  cards.  The  SAT  word  is  dead,  long  live  the  SAT  word.  These  turkeys  still  have  a  long  time  to  cook.What  do  you  think  of  the  changes  to  the  SAT?

He  is  author  of  the  forthcoming  book  "Outsider  Inside  the  Supreme  Court."  The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  the  author.(CNN)  --  The  Supreme  Court  on  Wednesday  reinforced  the  nation's  belief  in  freedom  and  its  constitutional  traditions  with  a  ruling  that  upheld  my  challenge  to  a  section  of  the  federal  election  campaign  law  that  restricted  citizens'  rights  to  express  their  views.That  outcome,  I  believe,  will  become  part  of  a  successful  attack  on  the  numbing  political  status  quo  in  Washington  and  encourage  activists  across  the  nation  who  have  fresh  ideas  to  improve  how  our  government  operates.I  am  grass-roots  proof  that  citizens  retain  some  influence  and—with  determination—can  achieve  positive  change.  I  hardly  suspected  such  an  outcome  in  late  2011  when  I  launched  my  legal  challenge.My  target  was  the  overall  limits  on  an  individual's  fully  disclosed  contributions  to  federal  candidates,  national  political  parties  and  political  action  committees.  I  did  not  challenge  the  specific  contribution  limits  in  each  category.This  case  is  not  about  limits  on  the  amount  of  money  you  may  contribute  to  an  individual  candidate.  It  is  about  your  right  to  contribute  that  amount  to  as  many  candidates  as  you  choose.  Allowing  individuals  to  donate  to  as  many  candidates  as  they  wish  would  draw  contributions  away  from  PACs  and  bring  money  directly  to  candidates,  giving  underdog  candidates  a  fair  chance  in  the  political  arena.Like  most  Americans,  I  had  little  knowledge  of  these  campaign  laws—including  how  the  Washington  insiders  passed  them,  interpreted  them  and  enforced  them.  I  have  spent  my  adult  life  as  an  electrical  engineer  in  the  Birmingham,  Alabama,  area  where  I  grew  up  and  eventually  created  a  small  business  that  has  fewer  than  two  dozen  employees.  I  was  too  busy  for  politics  until  five  years  ago,  at  age  42,  when  I  joined  many  other  Americans  who  were  disenchanted  by  what  they  saw  in  Washington  and  decided  to  take  action.Sally  Kohn:  With  ruling,  money  talks  even  louder  in  politicsThe  core  belief  that  has  driven  my  political  activity  and  my  legal  challenge  has  been  my  full  embrace  of  the  First  Amendment's  guarantee  of  free  speech.  During  my  political  science  course  as  a  freshman  at  Georgia  Tech  University,  I  learned  about  the  Supreme  Court's  landmark  1976  decision  that  political  activity  was  entitled  to  that  protection.  All  the  sitting  justices  joined,  at  least  in  part,  that  Buckley  vs.  Valeo  ruling,  which  found  that  free  and  open  debate—including  unlimited  campaign  expenditures—is  "integral  to  the  operation  of  the  system  of  government  established  by  our  Constitution."This  week's  ruling  by  Chief  Justice  John  Roberts  restated  many  of  those  vital  national  values.  Excessive  campaign  finance  restrictions,  he  wrote,  impermissibly  inject  the  government  "into  the  debate  over  who  should  govern."  He  pointedly  added,  "And  those  who  govern  should  be  the  last  people  to  help  decide  who  should  govern."It  doesn't  take  a  political  scientist  to  conclude  that  congressional  incumbents  have  been  the  chief  beneficiaries  of  these  restrictions.  Even  with  the  overwhelming  public  unhappiness  with  Congress,  they  typically  have  re-election  rates  of  roughly  95%.A  key  factor  is  that  the  current  system  makes  it  much  more  difficult  for  challengers  to  raise  money.  In  most  cases,  they  simply  lack  the  incumbents'  access  to  tap  into  Washington's  deep-pocketed  special  interests.This  status  quo,  which  has  been  created  chiefly  by  the  so-called  political  reformers,  has  had  the  perverse—but  seemingly  intended—effect  of  protecting  incumbents  in  both  parties,  except  for  infrequent  waves  of  voter  disgust.  My  objective  is  to  assist  challengers  in  raising  funds,  and  to  encourage  smarter  political  ideas.I  clearly  am  not  one  of  those  special  interests,  nor  am  I  one  of  the  billionaires  who  have  become  political  targets.  Friends  call  me  "your  neighbor  Shaun."  With  other  activists,  I  believe  that  we  can  change  our  politics  and  draw  it  closer  to  our  communities.Having  become  part  of  public  life,  I  have  learned  that  political  conflict  and  rhetoric  sometimes  can  be  hard-ball.  But  I  have  made  a  point  of  fully  respecting  other  players,  even  if  they  criticize  me.My  support  of  the  First  Amendment  in  this  case  helps  extend  those  rights  to  everybody.  With  the  Supreme  Court's  encouragement,  I  hope  the  nation  is  prepared  for  a  robust  and  wide-open  public  debate  to  address  our  problems.Follow  @CNNOpinion  on  TwitterJoin  us  at  Facebook/CNNOpinion</TEXT></DOC>

The  massive  project  is  estimated  to  have  cost  more  than  $50  billion.But  on  Monday,  construction  crews  were  still  hard  at  work  in  Gorki  Gorod,  a  cluster  of  six-  and  seven-story  buildings  on  the  banks  of  the  Mzymta  River,  a  short  distance  from  the  Olympic  ski  jump.Road  crews  were  hammering  in  paving  stones  on  a  sidewalk,  while  yellow  cranes  stretched  up  to  buildings  where  the  interior  was  clearly  still  under  construction.The  delays  appear  to  have  affected  at  least  one  international  hotelier.In  an  interview  with  the  Reuters  news  agency,  the  manager  of  Swissotel  Sochi  said  his  hotel  would  accept  its  first  customers  on  the  eve  of  the  opening  of  the  Olympics,  rather  than  in  January  as  had  originally  been  planned."It  was  slightly  delayed,  we  actually  planned  to  open  already  last  month,"  Swissotel's  Oliver  Kuhn  told  Reuters.  "Certainly  I  have  worked  in  areas  where  the  construction  speed  was  a  bit  faster  than  here,  but  at  the  end  of  the  day  we  have  reached  our  target  to  be  ready  for  the  Games."The  International  Olympic  Committee  is  downplaying  concerns."There  are  still  some  issues  to  be  solved  as  it  is  always  just  before  the  Games,  but  also  in  this  respect  we  are  in  contact  with  the  organizing  committee  and  we  hope  the  situation  will  be  solved  in  the  next  couple  of  days,"  IOC  president  Thomas  Bach  told  journalists.Athletes  have  been  arriving  to  this  Black  Sea  resort  in  recent  days.

The  company  announced  the  changes  to  its  rules  and  terms  of  service  on  Thursday  and  will  begin  enforcing  them  immediately.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Twitter  has  officially  banned  pornographic  content  on  Vine,  its  year-old  social-video  service.  The  company  announced  the  changes  to  its  rules  and  terms  of  service  on  Thursday  and  will  begin  enforcing  them  immediately.Just  days  after  Vine's  official  launch  in  January  of  last  year,  reports  surfaced  about  the  presence  of  porn  on  Vine,  a  service  for  sharing  6-second  long  videos  on  Twitter  and  with  other  Vine  users.  It  quickly  became  a  popular  spot  for  short  clips  of  sexually  explicit  content,  some  posted  by  well-known  porn  stars.For  the  past  year,  there  have  been  no  official  rules  against  pornographic  videos,  though  the  company  worked  to  keep  them  out  of  the  public  eye  by  suppressing  them  in  highly  visible  places  like  its  Editor's  Picks  and  most  popular  lists.  It  did  raise  the  minimum  age  for  using  Vine  from  12  years  old  to  17  years  old.  The  new  rating  in  Apple's  App  Store  meant  Vine  carried  a  disclaimer  that  warned  of  "frequent/intense  sexual  content  or  nudity."After  the  initial  flurry  of  concern,  the  dark  corner  of  Vine  was  mostly  forgotten  about  by  people  who  weren't  actively  seeking  out  salacious  content,  at  least  until  last  month,  when  a  young  man  rose  to  temporary  Internet  fame  when  he  filmed  himself  being  intimate  with  a  Pop  Tart  and  then  a  Hot  Pocket.  He  posted  the  videos  to  Vine,  though  they  were  quickly  taken  down.The  timing  is  likely  a  coincidence.  Twitter  said  the  change  in  policy  is  just  a  matter  of  the  type  of  content  that  fits  with  the  Vine  community."As  we've  watched  the  community  and  your  creativity  grow  and  evolve,  we've  found  that  there's  a  very  small  percentage  of  videos  that  are  not  a  good  fit  for  our  community,"  the  company  said  in  a  post  announcing  the  new  rules.The  new  rules  forbid  videos  of  sex  acts,  whether  they're  alone,  with  other  people  or  with  objects.  Sexually  explicit  animations  and  nudity  are  also  forbidden.  However,  Twitter  is  not  blocking  all  nudity.  It  makes  exceptions  for  any  nudity  that  is  documentary,  artistic  or  educational.  For  example,  breastfeeding  photos  will  still  be  allowed,  as  will  shots  of  "nude  protesters."  Sexually  suggestive  content  is  also  still  welcome,  as  long  as  it's  clothed.Twitter  is  not  assembling  a  full-time  Vine  porn  enforcement  task  force.

In  a  post  on  the  Proofpoint  site,  the  company  said  the  scam  involved  more  than  750,000  e-mails  from  more  than  100,000  appliances  that  had  been  commandeered  by  "thingbots,"  or  robotic  programs  that  can  be  remotely  installed  on  digital  devices.It  was  not  immediately  clear  Friday  which  victims  were  targeted  and  whether  the  scammers  were  successful  in  collecting  any  personal  information."Bot-nets  are  already  a  major  security  concern  and  the  emergence  of  thingbots  may  make  the  situation  much  worse,"  said  David  Knight,  general  manager  of  Proofpoint's  Information  Security  division.  "Many  of  these  devices  are  poorly  protected  at  best  and  consumers  have  virtually  no  way  to  detect  or  fix  infections  when  they  do  occur.  [We]  may  find  distributed  attacks  increasing  as  more  and  more  of  these  devices  come  online  and  attackers  find  additional  ways  to  exploit  them."Recent  years  have  seen  an  explosion  in  the  number  of  devices  fitted  with  Internet  connectivity,  from  eyewear  to  toothbrushes  to  refrigerators  and  beyond.  Earlier  this  week,  Google  paid  $3.2  billion  to  acquire  Nest,  a  company  that  makes  smart  home  thermostats.The  International  Data  Corporation  (IDC)  predicts  there  will  be  more  than  30  billion  connected  devices  in  the  world  by  2020.Proofpoint's  findings  suggest  that  just  as  personal  computers  can  be  unknowingly  compromised  and  used  to  launch  large-scale  cyberattacks,  so  can  any  smart  household  appliance.  And  poorly  protected  "smart"  devices  may  be  easier  to  infect  and  control  than  PCs,  laptops  or  tablets.A  sophisticated  hack  was  not  needed  to  compromise  the  appliances  in  this  attack.  Instead,  the  use  of  default  passwords  left  the  devices  completely  exposed  on  public  networks,  according  to  Proofpoint.The  company  also  noted  that  connected  appliances  typically  aren't  protected  by  anti-spam  or  anti-virus  software,  nor  are  they  routinely  monitored  for  security  breaches.</TEXT></DOC>

The  lawsuit  asks  that  her  parents  pay  the  remaining  tuition  for  her  last  semester  at  her  private  high  school,  pay  her  current  living  and  transportation  expenses,  commit  to  paying  her  college  tuition  and  pay  her  legal  fees  for  the  suit  she  filed  against  her  parents.Her  parents  say  she  left  home  because  she  didn't  want  to  obey  their  rules.Judge  Peter  Bogaard  denied  the  request  for  high  school  tuition  and  current  living  expenses  at  a  hearing  Tuesday  in  New  Jersey  State  Superior  Court.  Another  hearing  will  be  held  in  April  on  other  issues  in  the  suit,  including  whether  Canning  left  home  of  her  own  accord,  the  judge  said.Canning,  an  honor  student  and  cheerleader  at  Morris  Catholic  High  School  in  Denville,  says  in  court  documents  she  had  to  leave  her  parents'  home  because  of  emotional  and  psychological  mistreatment,  alleging,  among  other  things,  that  her  mother  called  her  "fat"  and  "porky"  and  that  her  father  threatened  to  beat  her."I  have  been  subjected  to  severe  verbal  and  physical  abuse  by  my  mother  and  father,"  Canning  wrote  in  a  court  certification.  "I  am  not  willingly  and  voluntarily  leaving  a  reasonable  situation  at  home  to  make  my  own  decisions.  I  had  to  leave  to  end  the  abuse."Canning  left  her  parents'  home  at  the  end  of  last  October.  After  spending  two  nights  at  her  boyfriend's  home,  she  moved  into  the  home  of  her  friend  in  a  nearby  town,  where  she  has  been  staying  ever  since,  according  to  court  documents  written  by  the  parents'  attorney.Fair  or  outrageous?  New  Jersey  teen  sues  her  parents  to  pay  up  for  collegeCanning  seeks  a  court's  official  declaration  that  she  is  unemancipated,  meaning  her  parents  would  still  be  required  to  support  her  financially.  She  also  is  suing  to  reimburse  her  friend's  parents,  John  and  Amy  Inglesino,  for  legal  fees  that  they  have  been  paying  since  the  lawsuit  was  initiated,  according  to  the  suit.Canning's  parents,  Sean  and  Elizabeth  Canning,  claim  that  allegations  of  abuse  are  completely  unfounded."We  were  always  her  support  team,  cheering  her  on  or  defending  her  whenever  she  had  a  problem,"  wrote  Elizabeth  Canning  in  a  court  certification.  She  claims  that  her  daughter  was  never  forced  out  of  the  family's  home,  but  rather  "took  it  upon  herself  to  run  away  so  that  she  could  live  her  life  without  any  parental  supervision  and  without  any  rules."Canning  was  suspended  from  school  for  truancy  last  October,  according  to  court  documents  filed  by  her  parents'  attorney,  Laurie  Rush-Masuret.  Her  parents  told  the  teen  that  she  could  no  longer  see  her  boyfriend,  who  was  also  suspended  from  school.  Car  and  phone  privileges  were  also  taken  away.  Once  she  learned  of  the  punishment,  Canning  cut  school  again  and  then  decided  to  run  away,  her  father  said  in  court  documents.Once  she  left  home,  her  parents  notified  Morris  Catholic  High  School  that  they  would  no  longer  pay  for  their  daughter's  tuition,  the  documents  state."They  stopped  paying  my  high  school  tuition  to  punish  the  school  and  me,  and  have  redirected  my  college  fund  indicating  their  refusal  to  afford  me  an  education,"  Rachel  Canning  stated  in  court  documents.The  situation  around  the  teen  and  her  family  initiated  an  investigation  by  New  Jersey's  Division  of  Child  Protection  and  Permanency  (DCPP),  which  received  allegations  that  Rachel  was  being  abused.  The  teen  wrote  in  court  documents  that  her  school  contacted  the  state  agency.When  DCPP  staffers  interviewed  the  teen,  her  parents,  and  her  two  younger  sisters,  they  ultimately  "determined  that  allegation  of  emotional  abuse  was  unfounded,"  a  letter  from  DCPP  states.Sean  Canning,  a  retired  Lincoln  Park  police  chief  and  current  business  administrator  for  the  town  of  Mount  Olive,  told  CNN  affiliate  WCBS  that  he  and  his  wife  are  "distraught.""We're  being  sued  by  our  child.  I'm  dumbfounded.  So  is  my  wife.  So  are  my  other  daughters,"  he  said.  "Living  in  our  house,  there's  very  few  things.  There's  minor  chores,  there's  curfews.  When  I  say  curfew,  it's  usually  after  11  o'clock  at  night."Sean  Canning  wrote  in  court  documents  that  the  Inglesinos,  for  taking  in  his  daughter,  had  "enabled  the  situation  to  an  absurd  level.  Under  the  guise  of  good  intentions,  they  have  arrogantly  placed  themselves  in  our  stead  and  operated  under  the  belief  that  their  parenting  style  is  superior  to  our  own."CNN's  attempts  to  reach  John  or  Amy  Inglesino  were  unsuccessful.Stephanie  Frangos  Hagan,  a  family  law  attorney  and  New  Jersey  State  Bar  Association  family  law  officer,  said  to  her  knowledge,  a  case  like  this  is  unprecedented.Though  Canning  is  18  years  old,  New  Jersey  law  does  not  consider  a  person  to  be  emancipated  unless  that  person  has  left  "the  scope  of  his  or  her  parents'  authority,"  according  to  Hagan."A  parent  is  not  obligated  to  contribute  to  the  support  of  an  emancipated  child,"  said  Hagan.  "A  child  is  emancipated  when  he  or  she  is  beyond  the  control  of  the  parents.  Is  she  truly  beyond  the  scope  of  her  parents'  authority,  as  a  result  of  her  own  voluntary  acts?  That's  for  the  judge  to  decide.""The  argument  (she)  is  making  is  that  she  didn't  leave  home  voluntary.  She's  saying  'I  was  thrown  out,'"  Hagan  said.Neither  Rachel  Canning  nor  her  parents  testified  at  Tuesday's  hearing,  but  it  saw  a  reunion  between  the  daughter  and  her  estranged  parents,  the  first  one  in  over  four  months.  While  Sean  Canning  was  seen  speaking  to  Rachel,  Elizabeth  was  seen  briefly  weeping  after  being  seated.The  parents'  attorney,  Rush-Masuret,  told  CNN  that  Elizabeth  Canning  is  too  upset  about  the  situation  to  even  talk  about  it.  She  said  the  Cannings  have  told  their  daughter  to  come  home,  and  she  has  refused."To  be  clear,  my  clients  never  abandoned  nor  abused  their  child  and  they  have  asked  her  to  come  home.  They  simply  sought  to  exert  their  own  parental  judgment  and  reasonable  household  rules  which  she  is  not  willing  to  accept,"  Rush-Masuret  said  in  court  Tuesday.Rachel  Canning's  attorney,  Tanya  N.  Helfand,  said  Sean  and  Elizabeth  Canning  are  being  "negligent  and  irresponsible.""Normal  healthy  parents  want  to  help  their  children.  They  want  their  children  to  go  to  college.  They  want  to  help  them  with  their  difficulties,"  Helfand  said  in  court."You  may  not  get  along  wonderfully  every  single  day  with  your  teenager.  That  doesn't  mean  that  you  abandon  them  and  you  say,  'Guess  what,  you're  on  your  own.'"Judge  Bogaard  denied  the  request  for  the  last  semester  of  high  school  tuition  because  the  school  said  she  could  continue  anyway,  since  she  is  an  honor  student.  And  Rachel  Canning  wrote  in  her  court  certification  that  "The  peer  ministers  at  Morris  Catholic  have  decided  to  raise  funds  to  pay  ...  tuition  so  I  don't  have  to  leave  early."As  for  why  he  denied  the  request  for  immediate  financial  assistance,  the  judge  indicated  he  didn't  see  an  emergency  situation,  and  would  make  further  decisions  at  the  next  hearing.The  teen  wrote  in  her  court  certification  that  she  aspires  to  be  a  biomedical  engineer.  Her  first  choice  for  college  is  the  University  of  Delaware,  from  which  she  has  yet  to  hear  back  from  regarding  her  admission  decision.  She  said  taking  legal  action  was  necessary  to  ensure  that  she  is  able  to  accomplish  her  future  goals."I  am  a  very  good  student.  I  have  no  drug  problems.  I  am  a  good  athlete.  I  work  at  a  job  outside  of  school,"  she  wrote.  "My  parents  simply  will  not  help  me  any  longer...(They)  should  be  required  to  provide  for  my  support  and  education  until  I  can  stand  on  my  own  two  feet.  In  order  to  do  this,  I  had  to  take  legal  action."Girl  costs  father  $80,000  with  'SUCK  IT'  Facebook  postCNN's  Ronni  Berke,  Jean  Casarez,  Lauren-Ashley  Morton  and  Tekella  Foster  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

NFL,  which  ended  the  2011  NFL  lockout.  He  also  represented  players  in  antitrust  actions  that  led  to  the  present  free  agency  and  salary  cap  systems  in  the  NBA.In  Monday's  lawsuit,  Kessler  represents  four  plaintiffs:  Clemson  University  football  player  Martin  Jenkins,  Rutgers  University  basketball  player  J.J.  Moore,  University  of  California  football  player  Bill  Tyndall,  who  played  his  senior  season  in  2013,  and  University  of  Texas-El  Paso  football  player  Kevin  Perry,  who  also  played  basketball  for  the  Miners  in  2011  and  2012.While  only  four  plaintiffs  are  named,  the  class-action  proposes  representing  all  Football  Bowl  Subdivision  players  and  all  Division  I  basketball  players.In  addition  to  the  NCAA,  the  lawsuit  --  which  the  National  College  Players  Association  is  backing  --  also  targets  the  so-called  "power  conferences":  the  Southeastern,  Big  Ten,  Big  12,  Pacific-12  and  Atlantic  Coast."Ten  years  ago  this  discussion  was  completely  different,"  Players  Association  President  Ramogi  Huma  said.  "There  were  a  lot  of  people  defending  the  NCAA  system.  Fast-forward  to  today,  very  few  people  are  defending  the  NCAA  and  its  practices."This  isn't  the  former  University  of  California-Los  Angeles  football  player's  first  foray  into  the  issue.  Along  with  organizing  the  All  Players  United  wrist  tape  effort  --  which  seeks  to  end  a  system  in  which  players  "forfeit  their  rights  and  endure  unnecessary  physical,  academic  and  financial  risks  as  a  condition  of  participating  in  NCAA  sports"  --  Huma  also  founded  the  College  Athlete  Players  Association.The  College  Athlete  Players  Association  supported  Northwestern  University  football  players'  attempts  to  unionize.  The  players  say  they  are  university  employees  who  are  forced  to  put  football  first  or  risk  losing  free  tuition.While  Monday's  lawsuit  aims  to  end  the  old  notion  of  amateurism  in  college  sports  and  reverse  NCAA  rules  that  forbid  colleges  from  sharing  with  their  players  the  billions  of  dollars  made  each  year  via  their  football  and  men's  basketball  programs,  the  lawsuit  does  not  guarantee  salaries  or  eliminate  scholarships.  Nor  does  it  call  for  a  trust  fund  or  mention  a  stipend.It  simply  would  give  a  university  the  option  of  paying  the  players  it  wants  most.  It  also  calls  for  individual  damages  for  the  player  plaintiffs."Instead  of  permitting  individual  institutions  to  compete  for  the  services  of  players  who  participate  in  their  major  college  sports  businesses,  the  NCAA  and  the  power  conferences  act  as  a  cartel  in  placing  a  cap  on  the  athletes'  compensation,"  Kessler  said  in  a  statement.  "These  restrictions  are  a  blatant  violation  of  antitrust  laws,  have  no  legitimate  pro-competitive  justification,  and  it  is  finally  time  to  bring  them  to  an  end."Value  in  educationThe  NCAA  contends  that  athletes  are  paid  in  the  form  of  a  free  education,  something  that  holds  a  lot  of  value  both  immediately  and  in  the  future.However,  proponents  of  Monday's  lawsuit  point  out  that  many  student  athletes  never  walk  across  the  stage  to  get  their  diploma,  and  the  percentage  of  Division  I  football  and  basketball  players  who  make  it  to  the  NFL  and  NBA  drafts  is  miniscule.In  October,  the  NCAA  released  a  report  saying  that  82%  of  Division  1  athletes  who  entered  school  in  2006  earned  their  degrees.  The  NCAA  lauded  the  graduation  rates  of  two  groups  of  student  athletes,  those  playing  for  Football  Bowl  Subdivision  teams  and  African-American  Division  I  men's  basketball  players,  whom  the  report  said  graduated  at  rates  of  71%  and  68%,  both  records,  according  to  the  NCAA.A  September  report  from  the  University  of  South  Carolina-based  College  Sport  Research  Institute  said  student  athlete  graduation  rates  still  hover  well  below  those  of  the  general  student  bodies.  According  to  its  "adjusted  graduation  gap"  reports,  players  in  the  10  conferences  making  up  the  Football  Bowl  subdivision  --  which  includes  the  five  conferences  named  in  Monday's  lawsuit  --  graduated  at  a  rate  18%  below  the  male  student  bodies  of  their  schools.  For  black  football  players,  the  rate  was  24%  below,  the  report  said.The  research  institute's  basketball  data  from  January  2013  also  showed  wide  gaps,  with  male  basketball  players  graduating  at  a  rate  20%  below  their  male  student  bodies  and  female  basketball  players  at  a  rate  9.2%  beneath  that  of  their  student  bodies.  If  you  consider  only  the  top  basketball  conference,  those  rates  jump  to  30.1%  for  men  and  13.4%  for  women,  according  to  the  institute's  findings.Meanwhile,  a  joint  study  between  Drexel  University  and  Huma's  organization  found  the  fair  market  value  of  the  average  collegiate  football  player  is  about  $120,000.  It  is  $265,000  for  the  average  men's  basketball  player,  the  study  said.The  average  scholarship,  Huma  said,  is  worth  $23,000."College  athletes,  they  earn  their  way  through  school.  This  is  not  a  gift.  They  put  their  bodies  on  the  line,"  Huma  said.  "I  believe  that  amateurism  is  a  myth.  This  is  a  multibillion  dollar  industry.  ...  We're  not  against  that,  but  to  exclude  players  from  the  spoils  is  un-American.  It's  illegal,  it's  inappropriate,  and  amateurism  at  this  point  is  being  used  as  a  tool  to  strip  the  players  of  their  fair  market  value."Not  everyone  thinks  paying  college  players  is  a  good  idea.  The  topic  has  been  debated  for  years  by  those  within  the  world  of  college  sport,  and  paying  players  has  generally  been  opposed  by  college  presidents,  athletic  directors  and,  of  course,  the  NCAA.They  all  hang  their  hat  on  the  education  argument.  At  Monday's  Knight  Commission  on  Intercollegiate  Athletics  meeting,  former  NFL  Commissioner  Paul  Tagliabue  said  paying  athletes  would  be  counterproductive  and  not  in  their  best  interests.Does  free  market  apply?But  Emmett  Gill,  a  former  consultant  with  the  NCAA  on  academic  reform  who  is  now  an  assistant  professor  at  North  Carolina  Central  University  in  Durham,  said  offering  compensation  could  have  a  positive  impact  on  athletes'  educations."If  students  are  able  to  participate  in  the  free  market,  it  will  allow  us  to  decide  what  athletes  are  there  for  an  education  and  what  athletes  are  there  for  a  minor  league  system  and  allow  us  to  develop  programs  for  each,"  he  said.The  small  percentage  of  athletes  who  play  on  full  scholarship  in  the  revenue-generating  sports  --  football  and  men's  basketball  --  could  be  offered  a  salary  as  an  incentive  to  play  at  a  particular  school,  he  said.But  the  rest  of  the  student  athletes,  the  majority  of  whom  realistically  will  never  be  offered  cash  --  because  most  aren't  even  offered  full  scholarships  --  could  also  benefit  from  a  free  market  because  it  would  open  the  door  for  endorsement  deals,  Gill  said."I  really  do  not  believe  that  paying  student  athletes  will  have  a  negative  impact  on  their  education,"  Gill  said.  "It  will  have  a  positive  impact."Huma  and  Kessler  said  they  believe  public  opinion  is  shifting  their  way.  They  acknowledge  that  a  few  years  ago,  it  would  have  been  less  likely  to  find  current  players  willing  to  put  their  names  on  a  lawsuit  like  this.But  as  former  NCAA  basketball  player  Ed  O'Bannon's  lawsuit  --  which  he  filed  to  take  back  the  rights  to  his  own  name  and  likeness  from  the  NCAA  --  has  moved  through  the  courts,  public  opinion  on  the  matter  of  athlete  compensation  is  shifting,  they  said.In  recent  years,  prominent  coaches  like  the  University  of  South  Carolina's  football  coach,  Steve  Spurrier,  have  come  out  in  favor  of  paying  players,  while  Kessler's  legal  team  even  has  a  convert,  Tim  Nevius,  a  former  NCAA  lead  investigator  who  is  now  playing  for  the  other  side.Whether  the  sports-loving  public  is  ready  to  hop  aboard  the  bandwagon  is  another  story.  A  Marist  College  Center  for  Sports  Communication  poll  conducted  last  year  showed  that  about  two-thirds  of  sports  fans,  college  football  fans  and  college  basketball  fans  concurred  that  a  scholarship  for  top  players  was  sufficient.  But  when  Seton  Hall  Sports  Poll  asked  a  similar  question  in  2007,  the  number  was  much  higher,  with  78%  of  those  responding  saying  college  athletes  should  not  be  paid  salaries.</TEXT></DOC>

In  that  sense,  a  Florida  jury's  recent  verdicts  --  and  nonverdicts  --  against  Michael  Dunn  demonstrate  a  fundamental  truth  about  trials.  They  are  not  only  unpredictable;  they  are  designed  that  way.The  case  against  Dunn  stemmed  from  an  incident  on  November  23,  2012.  Dunn,  a  47-year-old  white  man,  arrived  at  a  gas  station  in  Jacksonville,  Florida,  and  parked  next  to  an  SUV  that  contained  Davis  and  other  black  teenagers.  When  Dunn  complained  about  loud  music  coming  from  the  SUV,  words  were  exchanged  and  Dunn  ultimately  fired  a  gun  that  killed  Davis.  Dunn  said  he  saw  a  gun  barrel  pointing  out  of  the  SUV,  but  the  prosecution  said  there  was  no  gun.Dunn  was  found  guilty  of  three  counts  of  attempted  second-degree  murder  as  to  the  other  occupants  of  the  car,  but  the  jury  was  not  able  to  reach  a  verdict  on  the  first-degree  murder  charge  in  the  death  of  Jordan  Davis.In  the  eyes  of  critics,  this  case  was  a  "sure  thing"  for  the  prosecution,  and  anything  less  than  guilty  verdicts  across  the  board  is  now  considered  by  them  to  be  a  miscarriage  of  justice.  Guilty  verdicts  were  expected.That  sentiment  belies  a  fundamental  misunderstanding  about  the  criminal  justice  system:  With  juries,  there  is  no  such  thing  as  a  "sure  thing."No  one  can  accurately  predict  how  each  juror  might  perceive  the  evidence,  argue  a  case  in  deliberations  or  be  persuaded  by  his  or  her  fellow  jurors.  Jurors  can  and  do  bring  their  own  life  experiences  to  the  jury  room,  and  no  two  jurors  are  the  same.Yet  anyone  who  has  waited  for  a  jury's  verdict  has  engaged  in  the  same  helpless  jury  astrology  because  there  is  simply  no  hard  science  to  predict  their  behavior.  The  best  example  is  the  rabid  divination  of  the  meaning  of  juror  questions:  those  inscrutable,  handwritten  missives  intermittently  sent  out  to  the  judge  and  read  to  the  lawyers  in  chambers.Tonyaa  Weathersbee:  An  empty  verdict,  a  hollow  victoryThis  system  is  about  as  sophisticated  as  note-passing  in  grade-school  algebra,  but  just  a  few  lines  from  an  innocuous  jury  inquiry  will  leave  seasoned  attorneys  pondering  the  hidden  meaning  and  the  potential  direction  of  the  deliberations.  The  bottom  line  is  this:  Reading  these  tea  leaves  is  an  exercise  in  futility.  There's  no  way  to  predict  a  verdict  with  certainty.To  many  observers,  including  me,  this  was  a  strong  prosecution  case,  but  not  a  sure  thing.  In  fact,  it's  generally  only  the  close-call  cases  that  go  to  a  jury.  The  most  obvious  cases  of  guilt  or  nonguilt  should  result  in  plea  agreements  or  voluntary  withdrawals  by  the  prosecution.Simply  look  at  the  statistics.  The  vast  majority  of  all  cases,  criminal  and  civil,  are  resolved  before  trial.  Verdicts  are  simply  too  risky  for  either  side,  especially  to  put  up  a  case  that  they  believe  is  a  loser.  A  jury  trial  means  each  side  believes  their  theory  of  the  case  is  strong  enough  to  roll  the  dice  in  this  riskiest  game  of  all.Whether  you  agree  with  the  jury's  verdict  or  not,  these  verdicts  give  us  some  insight  into  the  jury's  thought  process.The  jury  convicted  on  attempted  second-degree  murder  for  shots  fired  at  the  other  passengers  in  the  SUV  with  Davis.  It  makes  sense.  By  Dunn's  own  concessions,  he  intentionally  shot  at  a  vehicle  speeding  away  from  him.  Even  if  Dunn's  testimony  were  completely  believed,  at  best  only  Davis  was  the  aggressor,  so  Dunn  had  a  minimal  self-defense  claim  against  the  other  occupants.But,  the  verdict  on  attempted  second-degree  murder  may  have  put  a  figurative  "cap"  on  Dunn's  level  of  intent.  In  other  words,  the  jury  may  have  agreed  that  Dunn's  level  of  intent  as  to  all  victims  was  consistent  --  perhaps  not  the  specific  intent  to  kill  characteristic  of  a  first-degree  murder,  but  something  slightly  less.In  the  case  of  second-degree  murder,  this  could  be  an  intentional  act  so  indifferent  to  human  life  it  evinced  a  depraved  mind.The  "depraved  heart"  variety  of  murder  is  often  analogized,  coincidentally  enough,  to  law  students  as  closing  your  eyes  and  shooting  into  a  crowd  with  a  gun.  It  may  be  true  that  you  did  not  actually  intend  to  hit  anyone,  but  the  act  was  so  likely  to  kill  that  your  level  of  intent  is  just  below  that  of  specific,  premeditated  murder.  That  law  school  example  used  to  explain  the  concept  to  students  is  eerily  similar  to  the  facts  here.While  it's  possible  that  the  jury  was  hung  up  trying  to  apply  the  law  of  self-defense,  it  may  also  be  that  the  jury  simply  had  trouble  with  the  definitions  of  homicide.  It's  understandable.  They  are  complicated  for  lawyers  and  lay  persons  alike.Florida's  standard  jury  instructions  are  available  online.  Take  a  look  at  each  of  the  suggested  instructions  for  the  different  degrees  of  murder  and  manslaughter.  They,  like  all  jury  instructions,  are  complicated.  They  do  not  get  much  less  complicated  just  because  the  judge  reads  them  slowly  and  out  loud  to  the  jury.  They  involve  abstract  concepts  and  seemingly  overlapping  definitions  of  nuanced  "states  of  mind."It's  very  likely  that  the  jury  was  hung  up  on  whether  self-defense  applied,  but  they  also  may  have  deadlocked  over  the  different  definitions  of  homicide.Despite  public  frustrations,  this  was  a  win  for  the  prosecution.  It  secured  a  successful  verdict  on  four  of  five  counts  that  will,  because  of  Florida's  minimum  mandatory  sentencing  scheme  and  the  defendant's  use  of  a  firearm,  send  Dunn  to  prison  for  at  least  60  to  75  years.  That's  day-for-day:  no  gain  time,  no  early  release  except  for  a  win  on  appeal.Plus,  the  prosecution  can  retry  Dunn  for  the  killing  of  Davis.  When  a  judge  discharges  a  jury  on  the  grounds  that  the  jury  cannot  reach  a  verdict,  the  double  jeopardy  clause  of  the  Fifth  Amendment  to  the  Constitution  does  not  bar  a  new  trial  of  the  defendant.The  double  jeopardy  clause  provides:  "[N]or  shall  any  person  be  subject  for  the  same  offense  to  be  twice  put  in  jeopardy  of  life  or  limb  in  criminal  ...  cases."  If  the  state  reprosecutes  the  Davis  killing,  Dunn  will  certainly  feel  as  if  he's  being  tried  twice  for  the  same  crime.  Constitutionally,  however,  a  retrial  following  a  deadlocked  jury  is  permissible.Defense  counsel  deserves  recognition  as  well.They  hung  a  jury  on  what  many  observers  expected  to  be  a  clear-cut  murder  conviction.  Even  without  the  wave  of  public  acrimony  against  the  defendant,  this  was  always  an  uphill  self-defense  case.  It  was  clear  from  the  trial  that  the  defense  prepared  this  case  and  the  client,  and  gave  Dunn  the  best  chance  at  a  not-guilty  verdict.  Overall,  a  good  job  with  bad  facts  for  the  defense.The  big  question  now  is  whether  we  will  see  the  state  of  Florida  retry  Dunn  for  the  murder  of  Davis.On  one  hand,  they  have  achieved  a  virtual  life  sentence  on  the  other  convictions,  which  achieves  one  of  the  philosophical  goals  of  punishment:  incapacitation  and  isolation  of  Dunn  from  the  community.It  does  not  achieve  another  goal  of  punishment  for  the  Davis  family:  retribution.  The  state  has  indicated  for  now  that  it  will  retry  Dunn,  but  if  it  does,  one  thing  will  remain  certain:There  are  no  sure  things  in  retrials,  either.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Danny  Cevallos.</TEXT></DOC>

But  it  was  her  emotional  speech  for  a  humanitarian  award  that  highlighted  the  2014  edition  of  the  awards  show.Hudson  accepted  the  favorite  humanitarian  award  with  her  sister  Julia  for  the  foundation  the  pair  started  in  the  name  of  Julia's  son,  Julian  D.  King,  after  his  2008  murder.  The  Hudson  sisters'  mother  and  brother  were  also  killed  in  the  crime.Jennifer  Hudson  said  she  was  inspired  by  performers  and  educators  she  saw  as  a  child.  She  wants  to  carry  the  message  on  to  a  new  generation,  she  said,  because  that  inspiration  made  a  difference  in  her  life."If  they  did  it,  then  I  can  do  it,  too,"  she  said  of  the  work.Hudson's  speech  was  one  of  the  few  notable  moments  at  the  2014  People's  Choice  Awards,  which  mark  the  beginning  of  what  the  denizens  of  Tinseltown  refer  to  as  "awards  season."  It  starts  a  flurry  of  kudofests,  including  Sunday's  Golden  Globes,  the  Screen  Actors  Guild  Awards,  the  Grammys  and  the  Oscars.Relive  the  conversation  on  our  People's  Choice  Awards  blogThe  show  clocked  in  at  two  hours  flat,  with  a  number  of  categories  other  awards  shows  might  consider  biggies  --  like  favorite  movie  --  unrevealed  during  the  broadcast.  (That  one  went  to  "Iron  Man  3,"  by  the  way.)But  nobody  can  complain  about  the  range  of  categories.  The  People's  Choice  Awards  are  given  for  TV  shows,  movies  and  music,  and  there  are  almost  60  categories.The  range  was  indicated  by  two  people  who  accepted  the  Waterford  crystal  trophies  --  one  a  newcomer  to  the  honors,  the  other  a  repeat  winner.The  former,  Britney  Spears,  may  have  won  her  share  of  MTV  Video  Music  Awards,  but  she'd  never  been  accepted  by  the  People's  Choice  Awards  until  Wednesday.Spears  --  who  recently  put  out  a  new  album,  "Britney  Jean"  --  was  named  favorite  pop  artist.She  walked  up  the  stage  steps  carefully,  almost  tottering  on  her  heels,  and  thanked  her  fans  and  her  management  team.If  Spears  was  a  newbie  at  this  People's  Choice  thing,  Ellen  DeGeneres  is  an  old  hand.The  talk-show  host  won  her  14th  People's  Choice  Award,  named  favorite  daytime  TV  host."There's  nothing  better  than  knowing  you  make  people  happy,"  said  DeGeneres  in  accepting  the  trophy.Bullock  dominatesPerhaps  the  night's  biggest  favorite  was  Sandra  Bullock,  who  won  favorite  movie  actress,  favorite  comedic  movie  actress  and  favorite  dramatic  movie  actress.And  the  winners  are  ...It  must  seem  "like  I  spend  lonely  Friday  nights  voting  for  myself,"  Bullock  joked.Justin  Timberlake  also  won,  for  favorite  album  ("The  20/20  Experience")  and  favorite  male  artist.A  gracious  Julianna  Margulies  accepted  one  of  the  trophies  for  her  show,  "The  Good  Wife,"  which  won  favorite  network  TV  drama,  and  another  for  co-star  Josh  Charles  (favorite  dramatic  TV  actor).  Charles,  she  revealed,  had  a  good  excuse  for  not  being  at  the  ceremony:  He  was  on  his  honeymoon  in  Thailand.The  awards  actually  started  before  the  broadcast.The  first  trophy  was  handed  out  on  the  red  carpet  as  stars'  entrances  streamed  over  the  Internet.  It  went  to  Netflix's  "Orange  Is  the  New  Black"  in  an  appropriate  category:  favorite  streaming  series.Later  on  the  carpet,  favorite  cable  TV  drama  went  to  "The  Walking  Dead"  and  Ian  Somerhalder  ("The  Vampire  Diaries")  accepted  an  award  for  best  sci-fi/fantasy  TV  actor.Broad  jokes  and  absurdityThe  show  formally  began  in  time-honored  awards  show  fashion:  with  an  overlong  sketch.  This  one  featured  a  number  of  nominees,  as  well  as  hosts  Kat  Dennings  and  Beth  Behrs  in  character  on  the  set  of  their  show,  "2  Broke  Girls."  The  sketch  was  followed  with  the  hosts  on  stage  at  Los  Angeles'  Nokia  Theatre  making  a  number  of  broad  jokes.  Tina  Fey  and  Amy  Poehler,  who  will  host  the  Golden  Globes  on  Sunday,  should  have  nothing  to  worry  about.Watch  "People's  Choice"  hosts  make  Conan  happy  over  accidental  boob  grabBut  for  all  the  absurdity,  the  People's  Choice  Awards  do  offer  a  snapshot  of  what's  popular.The  show  was  created  in  1975  by  producer  Bob  Stivers.  Consumer  products  company  Procter  &  Gamble  took  over  production  in  the  early  1980s  and  still  sponsors  the  show.  Some  categories  change  from  year  to  year;  one  year  featured  a  Nice  'n  Easy  Fans  Favorite  Hair.After  many  years  relying  on  Gallup  Polls,  the  People's  Choice  Awards  took  a  new  tack  in  2005.  The  nominations  are  now  based  on  sales,  industry  ratings,  box-office  grosses,  social  media  data  and  votes  from  peopleschoice.com.  According  to  the  hosts,  700  million  votes  were  cast.As  Stephen  Colbert  observed  in  a  taped  bit,  the  People's  Choice  Awards  aren't  given  out  by  "some  elite  academy  of  out-of-touch  plutocrats."  Colbert,  incidentally,  won  favorite  late-night  talk  show  host."(The)  People's  Choice  is  one  of  my  favorites,  because  it's  the  people  choosing  their  favorite  shows  and  their  favorite  movies,"  said  actress  Malin  Akerman.Nina  Dobrev  of  "The  Vampire  Diaries"  agreed.  "It  kind  of  is  the  ultimate  award,"  she  said.</TEXT></DOC>

That's  what  2014  is  all  about  for  President  Barack  Obama,  and  it  is  the  underlying  theme  of  tonight's  State  of  the  Union  address.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Washington  (CNN)  --  The  year  of  action.  That's  what  2014  is  all  about  for  President  Barack  Obama,  and  it  is  the  underlying  theme  of  Tuesday  night's  State  of  the  Union  address."Let's  make  this  a  year  of  action,"  Obama  will  say,  according  to  excerpts  released  in  advance  by  the  White  House.  That's  what  most  Americans  want  --  for  all  of  us  in  this  chamber  to  focus  on  their  lives,  their  hopes,  their  aspirations."It's  an  optimistic  goal  for  an  president  with  a  43%  approval  rating  entering  his  sixth  year  in  office  and  facing  a  determined  opposition  otherwise  known  as  the  House  of  Representatives.Understanding  the  reality  and  the  challenges  before  him,  Obama  vows  to  accomplish  parts  of  his  agenda  without  Congress."What  I  offer  tonight  is  a  set  of  concrete,  practical  proposals  to  speed  up  growth,  strengthen  the  middle  class,  and  build  new  ladders  of  opportunity  into  the  middle  class,"  he  will  say,  according  to  the  excerpts."Some  require  Congressional  action,  and  I'm  eager  to  work  with  all  of  you.  But  America  does  not  stand  still,  and  neither  will  I,  so  wherever  and  whenever  I  can  take  steps  without  legislation  to  expand  opportunity  for  more  American  families,  that's  what  I'm  going  to  do,"  Obama  will  say.DefianceSpeaking  from  the  lectern  inside  the  House  chamber  for  his  fifth  State  of  the  Union  address  in  what  his  aides  call  an  "optimistic"  speech,  Obama  will  outline  his  goals  and  priorities  that  include  economic  opportunity,  energy  and  education.He  will  also  make  an  impassioned  plea  for  comprehensive  immigration  reform  and  will  not  attack  congressional  Republicans  for  failing  to  act  on  it,  according  to  a  source  familiar  with  the  speech.  However,  he  will  make  an  argument  for  why  it  makes  good  economic  sense.Separately,  the  President  is  also  expected  to  unveil  a  proposal  for  a  new  type  of  account  that  allows  Americans  to  save  for  retirement.  Details  of  the  plan  were  not  immediately  available.This  year's  State  of  the  Union  is  a  defining  test  for  ObamaObama  is  also  expected  to  talk  not  only  about  what  he  wants  to  get  done,  but  how  he's  going  to  do  it.He  will  tell  Americans  tuning  in  via  television,  smart  phone  and  social  media  that  he  will  use  more  traditional  methods  to  accomplish  his  goals.  According  to  White  House  talking  points,  Obama  plans  to  use  "a  phone"  and  "a  pen"  to  move  his  agenda  forward.Brazile:  Obama's  message:  A  dysfunctional  Congress,  but  we'll  get  it  done  anywayIn  other  words,  with  up  to  535  members  of  Congress  sitting  in  the  same  room  during  his  speech,  the  President  plans  to  tell  them  that  he's  going  to  go  around  them.  One  way  is  by  using  his  pen  to  sign  executive  orders  --  unilateral  presidential  directives.The  Republican  Party  immediately  balked.  Speaking  to  reporters  Tuesday  morning,  House  Speaker  John  Boehner  said  Republicans  are  "just  not  going  to  sit  here  and  let  the  president  trample  all  over  us."Brazile:  Obama's  message:  A  dysfunctional  Congress,  but  we'll  get  it  done  anywayInsultBased  on  the  President's  announcement  and  the  Republican  response,  the  next  year  could  be  no  different  than  previous  as  the  two  parties  could  butt  heads  on  many  issues."If  the  President  is  serious  about  a  year  of  action,  it  would  be  nice  if  he  would  just  reach  out  and  work  with  us,"  Boehner  said.In  reality,  however,  Obama's  announcement  is  no  different  than  his  immediate  predecessors  who  used  executive  orders  often.President  George  W.  Bush  ordered  197  executive  actions  at  this  point  in  his  presidency  and  President  Bill  Clinton  implemented  238  in  his  first  five  years  in  office.  Both  exceed  the  number  of  Obama's  executive  orders,  which  is  167  so  far.8  memorable  State  of  the  Union  momentsAnd  he  has  the  public  on  his  side.  In  a  recent  Washington  Post/  ABC  News  poll,  52%  of  respondents  said  the  President  should  use  executive  orders,  including  69%  of  Democrats  who  say  so.ActionHe  announced  an  executive  order  impacting  the  minimum  wage,  an  issue  that  has  not  received  a  lot  of  traction  yet  in  Congress  as  Republicans  largely  oppose  any  federal  increase,  saying  it  will  place  a  burden  on  employers.Why  Obama  is  playing  a  weak  hand  tonightUnder  his  executive  order,  new  federal  contract  workers  are  to  be  paid  $10.10  per  hour,  an  increase  of  nearly  $3  for  hires  contracted  for  low-wage  positions  such  as  cooks,  custodians  and  janitors.Obama  senior  adviser  Valerie  Jarrett  said  on  CNN's  New  Day  that  the  President  supports  a  bill  pending  in  Congress  that  would  increase  the  minimum  wage  for  all  workers  to  $10.10."At  the  same  time  he  doesn't  want  to  sit  waiting  when  there  are  too  many  people  who  are  contractors  for  the  federal  government  who  are  raising  their  children  in  poverty,"  she  said.Before  he  even  delivers  his  speech,  Obama  aso  picked  up  the  phone  to  advance  his  agenda.  While  Congress  has  yet  to  to  extend  jobless  benefits  for  the  long-term  unemployed  that  has  impacted  more  than  a  million  people,  Obama  reached  out  to  major  corporations  that  they  support  "best  practices"  against  discrimination  against  long-term  unemployed  job  applicants.Lockheed  Martin,  Xerox,  Deloitte  and  Siemens  AG  announced  that  they  would  participate.John  Edwards  says  Dems  should  do  more  on  povertyStatementsState  of  the  Union  guests  are  the  personification  of  political  statements.The  President  and  First  Lady  Michelle  Obama  have  invited  guests  to  promote  their  policy  priorities  for  the  year  or  highlight  their  accomplishmentsSitting  in  the  President's  and  first  lady's  box  include  Cristian  Avila,  a  "Dreamer"  and  immigration  reform  proponent  faster,  highlighting  the  President's  push  for  immigration  reform;  Kentucky  Gov.

"When  the  restaurant  owners  came  up,  Darren  took  the  blame."Lerena  was  giving  evidence  in  relation  to  a  lesser  charge  brought  against  Pistorius  of  discharging  a  weapon  in  a  public  place.  The  main  charge  he  faces  is  murder  in  the  death  of  his  girlfriend,  model  Reeva  Steenkamp,  on  Valentine's  Day  2013.Pistorius  has  pleaded  not  guilty,  saying  it  was  a  tragic  error  and  he  mistook  her  for  an  intruder  when  he  shot  her  through  a  locked  toilet  door.South  Africa's  legal  system  in  the  spotlightDefense  pokes  holesThe  prosecution  has  sought  to  portray  the  running  star  as  trigger-happy.  Pistorius  has  also  pleaded  not  guilty  to  the  Tashas  gun  offense  charge,  and  to  a  similar  charge  of  putting  a  bullet  through  the  sun  roof  of  a  car  in  a  separate  incident.His  defense  team  poked  holes  in  the  testimony  of  yet  another  witness  who  said  he  heard  shouts  and  shooting  from  the  Olympian's  home  the  night  Steenkamp  was  killed.Defense  lawyer  Barry  Roux  has  tried  to  show  that  some  of  the  witnesses  have  tailored  their  testimony  to  match  one  another's.  Wednesday's  witness  was  Pistorius'  neighbor  Charl  Johnson.His  wife,  Michelle  Burger,  has  already  testified  to  hearing  shouts  from  Pistorius'  house  before  a  series  of  gunshots  around  3  a.m.Johnson  told  investigators  he  and  his  wife  didn't  discuss  their  versions  of  events  with  each  other.  But  on  the  stand,  Johnson  said  he  did  discuss  how  many  shots  he  and  his  wife  heard  and  the  timing  of  those  shots."You  and  your  wife  could  just  as  well  have  stood  together  in  the  witness  box,"  Roux  remarked.  For  witnesses  to  be  considered  reliable,  they  have  to  maintain  independent  versions  of  events,  Roux  said.  "You  failed,  Mr.  Johnson,"  he  said.The  lawyer  then  grilled  Johnson  on  whether  what  he  heard  that  night  was  indeed  gunshots.  Roux  said  the  sounds  could  have  been  Pistorius  trying  to  break  down  the  bathroom  door  with  a  cricket  bat.Wednesday's  session  was  shorter  than  the  previous  days.  Johnson  agreed  to  provide  notes  he  took  on  the  night  of  the  shooting  to  the  court.Defense  attorney  quizzes  neighbor  over  screams'Petrifying  screams'On  Tuesday,  Roux  was  particularly  effective  in  casting  doubt  on  Burger's  claim  that  she  heard  a  panic-stricken  woman  screaming  in  fear  for  her  life  before  four  gunshots  rang  out."We  know  Reeva  was  in  the  toilet.  We  know  it  was  locked,"  he  said.  "You  could  hear  increased  fear,  anxiety?  ...  You  heard  that  out  of  a  closed  toilet  in  a  house  177  meters  away?"  he  demanded.Burger  said  that  was  correct.  Roux  said  the  defense  had  tested  it  and  it  was  impossible.Burger  called  the  screams  "petrifying"  and  broke  down  in  tears  on  the  stand,  saying:  "It  was  awful  to  hear  the  shots."A  second  witness,  another  of  Pistorius'  neighbors,  told  the  court  Tuesday  she  also  was  awoken  by  shouting  on  the  night  Steenkamp  was  killed.  In  brief  testimony,  Estelle  van  der  Merwe  said  she  heard  loud  voices  that  went  on  for  about  an  hour  and  put  a  pillow  over  her  head  to  try  to  get  back  to  sleep.  She  said  she  heard  four  sounds  but  could  not  be  sure  what  they  were.Johnson  on  the  standThen  it  was  Johnson's  turn  on  the  stand.Describing  what  he  heard  from  his  home  that  night,  he  said  the  "intensity  and  fear  in  (the  woman's)  voice  escalated  and  it  was  clear  that  her  life  was  in  danger.""That's  when  the  first  shots  were  fired.  I  remember  hearing  a  succession  of  shots,"  Johnson  said.  "I  heard  the  lady  scream  again  and  the  last  scream  faded  moments  after  the  last  shot  was  fired."Prosecutor  Gerrie  Nel,  reading  a  report  from  an  expert,  told  the  court  that  of  the  four  bullets  that  were  fired  toward  Steenkamp:  "The  fourth  bullet  hit  her  in  the  head.  She  then  died."At  this  remark,  Pistorius  clutched  his  head  in  his  hands.In  full:  Pistorius'  affidavit  to  courtPleading  not  guiltyPistorius  pleaded  not  guilty  Monday  to  one  charge  of  murder  and  a  firearms  charge  associated  with  Steenkamp's  killing,  as  well  as  the  two  gun  indictments  unrelated  to  Steenkamp.The  trial  is  expected  to  take  at  least  three  weeks.In  South  Africa,  which  abolished  jury  trials  in  1969,  premeditated  murder  carries  a  mandatory  life  sentence,  with  a  minimum  of  25  years.  Pistorius  also  could  get  five  years  for  each  gun  indictment  and  15  years  for  the  firearms  charge.If  he  isn't  convicted  of  premeditated  murder,  the  sprinter  could  face  a  lesser  charge  of  "culpable  homicide,"  a  crime  based  on  negligence,  and  could  be  looking  at  up  to  15  years  on  that  charge,  experts  say.Dream  couplePistorius,  now  27,  and  Steenkamp,  29  when  she  died,  were  a  young,  attractive,  high-profile  couple  popular  in  South  Africa's  social  circles.Pistorius,  whose  nickname  the  "Blade  Runner"  reflects  the  special  prostheses  he  uses  while  running,  won  six  Paralympic  gold  medals  and  became  the  first  double-amputee  runner  to  compete  in  the  Olympics,  in  London  in  2012.Cover  girl  Steenkamp,  who  was  soon  to  star  in  a  TV  reality  show,  was  on  the  cusp  of  becoming  a  celebrity  in  her  own  right.  But  on  Valentine's  Day  2013  Steenkamp  lay  lifeless  in  a  pool  of  blood  on  the  floor  of  her  boyfriend's  house  in  an  upscale  gated  community  in  Pretoria.Moments  before,  Pistorius  said,  he  had  pointed  his  9  mm  pistol  toward  an  upstairs  toilet  room  and  fired  four  bullets  through  the  locked  door.In  court  documents,  Pistorius  has  said  he  heard  a  noise  from  the  bathroom  in  the  middle  of  the  night  and  --  feeling  vulnerable  without  his  prosthetic  legs  on  --  charged  toward  the  bathroom  on  his  stumps.He  has  said  he  shot  through  the  toilet  door  in  order  to  protect  himself  and  Steenkamp."I  felt  a  sense  of  terror  rushing  over  me,"  he  said  in  his  court  affidavit.  "There  are  no  burglar  bars  across  the  bathroom  window,  and  I  knew  that  contractors  who  worked  at  my  house  had  left  the  ladders  outside.""It  filled  me  with  horror  and  fear  of  an  intruder  or  intruders  being  inside  the  toilet.  I  thought  he  or  they  must  have  entered  through  the  unprotected  window.  As  I  did  not  have  my  prosthetic  legs  on  and  felt  extremely  vulnerable,  I  knew  I  had  to  protect  Reeva  and  myself."Prosecutors  are  painting  a  different  picture.  They  say  the  pair  had  an  argument  and  that  Steenkamp  locked  herself  in  the  toilet.At  last  year's  bail  hearing,  the  state  said  Pistorius  put  on  his  prosthetic  legs,  collected  his  gun  from  under  the  bed  and  walked  down  the  hall  leading  from  the  bedroom  to  the  bathroom  before  unloading  a  flurry  of  shots  through  the  door.Pistorius  is  not  claiming  self-defense;  he  is  claiming  to  have  been  mistaken  about  his  need  for  self-defense.  He  is  denying  that  he  intentionally,  unlawfully  killed  Steenkamp.  He  has  never  denied  killing  her.The  case  has  put  the  spotlight  on  South  Africa's  rampant  gun  violence  and  high  crime  rates.Roughly  45  people  are  murdered  every  day,  according  to  police  statistics,  and  the  number  of  home  burglaries  is  up  70%  in  the  last  decade.In  2012,  more  than  half  of  South  Africans  told  the  country's  police  force  that  they  were  afraid  of  having  their  homes  broken  into.  In  his  affidavit,  Pistorius  said  he  had  been  the  victim  of  violence  and  burglaries  before,  including  death  threats.CNN's  Richard  Allen  Green  reported  from  Pretoria.

That  is  the  word  they  use  time  and  again,"  he  said,  urging  Sciutto  to  read  the  actual  text  of  the  agreement.  "If  you  find  a  single,  a  single  word,  that  even  closely  resembles  dismantling  or  could  be  defined  as  dismantling  in  the  entire  text,  then  I  would  take  back  my  comment."He  repeated  that  "we  are  not  dismantling  any  centrifuges,  we're  not  dismantling  any  equipment,  we're  simply  not  producing,  not  enriching  over  5%.""You  don't  need  to  over-emphasize  it,"  Zarif  said  of  the  White  House  language.Iranian  and  U.S.  officials  have  tried  to  sell  the  nuclear  agreement  to  domestic  opponents  in  their  respective  countries  who  could  scuttle  the  first  major  diplomatic  achievement  involving  their  countries  in  more  than  three  decades.Iranian  officials  have  called  the  pact  a  victory  and  said  it  failed  to  halt  the  nation's  nuclear  development  program,  while  U.S.  officials  say  the  agreement  essentially  froze  Iran's  nuclear  program  and  rolled  back  some  capabilities.CNN  Chief  National  Security  Correspondent  Jim  Sciutto  reported  this  story  from  Davos,  Switzerland.

Stephen  Sigmund  is  the  executive  director  of  the  Global  Gateway  Alliance.(CNN)  --  Vice  President  Joe  Biden  was  right  to  call  attention  to  New  York's  LaGuardia  Airport.  From  the  dilapidated  state  of  LaGuardia's  Central  Terminal  Building  to  the  minimal  public  transport  links  and  outdated  air  traffic  control  system,  the  metro  area's  airports  are  in  desperate  need  of  modernization.But  now  it's  time  for  Biden  and  other  leaders  to  put  their  money  where  their  rhetoric  is.  The  Federal  Government  and  local  politicians  must  step  up  and  take  sustained  action.And  the  goal  should  be  to  fix  the  problem,  not  point  fingers.  Despite  its  outdated  condition,  LaGuardia  serves  25  million  passengers  a  year.  As  the  closest  airport  to  Manhattan,  it  is  coveted  by  airlines.Moreover,  New  York  City's  three  major  airports  serve  more  than  110  million  people  a  year,  account  for  500,000  jobs  and  contribute  $63  billion  to  our  regional  economy,  according  to  a  November  2013  study  from  Global  Gateway  Alliance  and  Partnership  for  New  York  City.  And  they  are  the  largest  global  gateway  to  the  world  for  international  travelers,  with  U.S.  Customs  data  showing  that  John  F.  Kennedy  International  Airport  handles  the  most  international  visitors  and  Newark  International  Airport  the  fifth  most.  As  such,  the  airports  serve  as  a  symbol  for  the  entire  United  States.Airports  are  responsible  for  the  first  and  last  impressions  visitors  have,  and  in  New  York,  some  54  million  tourists  visited  last  year.  They  are  fundamentally  vital  to  our  economy,  tourism  industry  and  our  global  reputation.As  the  vice  president  pointed  out,  New  York's  airports  are  a  symbol  of  underinvestment  in  infrastructure  throughout  the  country.  When  the  Beatles  landed  in  New  York  50  years  ago  last  week,  our  airports  were  a  symbol  of  the  modern,  efficient  and  forward-looking  transportation  infrastructure  in  the  United  States.  Now,  they  are  the  embodiment  of  our  falling  behind  the  rest  of  the  world.Cities  all  over  the  world  have  recognized  the  significance  of  their  airports  and  have  invested  in  state-of-the-art  technology  and  infrastructure.  Our  own  Global  Gateway  Alliance  survey  showed  that  airports  from  Singapore  to  Paris  are  providing  innovative  amenities  such  as  40  foot  slides,  ice  skating  rinks  and  on  airport  baby  strollers  to  ensure  that  passengers  have  the  best  possible  experience.The  same  survey  showed  LaGuardia  and  New  York  area  airports  at  the  bottom  of  the  list  of  passenger  amenities.The  bottom  line  is  we  to  have  to  invest  in  our  airports  to  avoid  losing  out  to  national  and  international  competitors  and  to  provide  a  better  quality  of  life  for  those  millions  of  passengers.At  LaGuardia,  here's  how:--  21st  century  terminals:  LaGuardia's  Central  Terminal  Building,  built  in  1964,  is  a  prime  example  of  an  outdated  terminal  desperately  in  need  of  redevelopment,  which  is  why  it's  so  important  for  the  Port  Authority  to  deliver  on  the  promise  of  a  modern,  efficient  and  innovative  terminal.  There  are  also  significant  space  constraints  with  only  two  short  runways  and  limited  parking,  which  are  challenges  that  need  to  be  addressed.--  Better  passenger  amenities:  Frequently  voted  the  worst  airport  in  the  U.S.  by  passengers,  LaGuardia  is  definitely  not  known  for  its  amenities.  All  of  the  New  York  area  airports  would  benefit  from  providing  what  are  now  basic  services,  such  as  free  Wi-Fi,  which  would  help  business  travelers,  and  leave  visitors  with  a  better  impression  of  their  time  in  New  York.--  Improved  transportation  links:  Public  transportation  access  to  all  of  New  York's  airports  is  behind  other  world  class  cities,  which  have  one  seat  train  rides  directly  from  the  city  center  to  the  airport.  Options  for  getting  to  LaGuardia  via  public  transportation  are  very  limited,  but  a  Bus  Rapid  Transit  system,  with  dedicated  lanes  and  just  a  few  stops  to  the  airport,  would  help  remedy  that.  This  service  would  remove  the  threat  of  traffic  delays  normally  associated  with  buses  and  provide  a  convenient  and  reliable  direct  ride  to  the  airport.  Reviving  long  dormant  plans  for  a  direct  subway  extension  to  LaGuardia  are  also  worth  exploring.--  Bring  NextGen  to  New  York  first:  LaGuardia,  along  with  JFK  and  Newark,  is  the  most  delayed  airport  traffic  control  system  in  the  country.  Every  day,  our  airspace  contributes  to  one  half  to  three  quarters  of  all  delays  around  the  country.  The  solution  is  NextGen,  the  new  satellite-based  air  traffic  control  system.  Replacing  the  old  1960s  radar  technology  means  fewer  delays  on  the  ground  and  in  the  air.

According  to  a  study  published  in  the  New  England  Journal  of  Medicine,  a  big  part  of  a  child's  obesity  risk  is  established  by  age  5.But  what  does  "healthy"  really  look  like  for  a  2-  to  5-year-old  child?  Should  you  be  counting  calories  or  hitting  the  gym(boree)?  And  if  your  kid  is  a  picky  eater  --  as  most  are  --  how  can  you  ensure  they're  getting  the  essential  nutrients?A  recent  study  published  in  JAMA,  the  journal  of  the  American  Medical  Association,  found  obesity  rates  among  children  2  to  5  years  old  decreased  43%  between  2003-2004  and  2011-2012,  while  most  other  age  groups  saw  little  to  no  decline.  The  decline  may  be  due  to  young  parents  who  are  becoming  more  educated  about  the  risks  of  childhood  obesity  and  are  actively  looking  to  prevent  it,  said  Wendy  Palmer,  a  registered  dietitian  at  Children's  Healthcare  of  Atlanta.The  first  thing  parents  should  know  is  whether  their  children  are  currently  at  a  healthy  weight,  Palmer  said.  Obesity  can  be  hard  to  gauge  in  young  kids."You  might  look  at  a  child  and  think  there's  not  a  weight  problem  at  all,  or  you  might  think  there  is  and  there's  not,"  she  said.Palmer  says  body  mass  index,  or  BMI,  is  the  best  indicator  of  a  child's  weight  status.  The  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  defines  childhood  obesity  as  "a  BMI  at  or  above  the  95th  percentile  for  children  of  the  same  age  and  sex."Parents  can  measure  their  children's  BMI  at  home  using  various  online  tools.While  BMI  is  a  helpful  number,  it's  also  important  to  focus  on  a  child's  growth  pattern,  Palmer  says.  Some  children  are  consistently  bigger  and  heavier  than  others  and  may  still  be  healthy.  But  when  children  are  getting  heavier  over  time,  it  can  be  an  early  warning  sign  of  a  weight  issue.Parents  are  essential  to  helping  children  learn  to  make  healthy  lifestyle  choices.  With  kids,  the  focus  should  be  on  providing  a  balance  of  nutrients."You  hear  a  lot  about  calories,"  Palmer  said.  "For  kids  these  ages,  it's  not  about  calories,  it's  more  about  them  having  a  wide  variety  of  foods."Get  kids  started  eating  regular,  healthy  meals.  We  all  know  breakfast  is  important  --  and  it  could  be  even  more  so  down  the  road.  A  2013  study  by  the  Arkansas  Children's  Nutrition  Center  found  children  who  ate  breakfast  used  less  mental  effort  to  solve  math  problems  and  scored  higher  on  tests  than  students  who  did  not  eat  breakfast.Children's  Healthcare  of  Atlanta  recommends  following  the  MyPlate  guidelines  outlined  by  the  USDA,  which  suggest  filling  half  of  every  plate  with  fruits  and  vegetables  and  dividing  the  other  half  between  whole  grains  and  lean  protein.Palmer  said  following  the  MyPlate  guidelines  can  be  tricky  with  children,  especially  when  preparing  breakfast.  She  recommends  including  a  protein  source.  For  example,  a  healthy  breakfast  for  your  toddler  might  be  whole  wheat  toast,  eggs  and  a  glass  of  low-fat  milk.For  pickier  eaters,  making  food  visually  appealing  will  help,  said  childhood  obesity  expert  and  registered  dietitian  Melissa  Halas-Liang."If  the  food  is  presented  in  a  colorful,  attractive  way  that  a  young  kid  can  pick  it  up  easily  ...  they're  more  likely  to  enjoy  and  eat  that  food,"  she  said.So  take  that  slice  of  whole  wheat  toast,  spread  it  with  nut  butter  for  protein,  and  garnish  it  with  sliced  fruit  in  the  shape  of  a  smiley  face.Some  children  may  never  grow  to  like  breakfast  food,  Halas-Liang  says,  so  parents  may  have  to  make  other  healthy  foods  their  child  enjoys,  such  as  brown  rice  fried  with  olive  oil,  an  egg  and  assorted  vegetables  and  serve  them  for  breakfast.Getting  young  children  excited  about  food  by  making  it  fun  and  offering  a  variety  of  tastes,  colors,  shapes,  textures  and  temperatures  can  help  them  eat  better  at  all  meals,  Halas-Liang  says.  Children  who  regularly  reject  meals  should  be  actively  involved  in  helping  pick  and  cook  them.Palmer  says  a  healthy,  nutrient-filled  diet  works  best  to  combat  obesity  when  in  conjunction  with  regular  exercise.Two-  to  5  -year-olds  should  be  getting  around  60  minutes  of  exercise  every  day,  Palmer  says.  But  that  doesn't  have  to  be  all  at  once  --  it  could  be  broken  up  throughout  the  day.  For  young  children,  it's  less  about  exercise  and  more  about  moving  their  bodies,  she  says,  so  active  play  is  usually  enough.It's  important  for  parents  to  play  along  with  their  children,  rather  than  force  them  into  it,  Palmer  says.  Parents  who  present  active  play  as  fun  and  participate  in  the  games  with  their  children  are  more  successful  at  getting  them  moving  and  engaged.</TEXT></DOC>

She  was  wrong.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  Kelly  Wallace  is  CNN's  digital  correspondent  and  editor-at-large  covering  family,  career  and  life.  She  is  a  mom  of  two.  Read  her  other  columns  and  follow  her  reports  at  CNN  Parents  and  on  Twitter.(CNN)  --  Before  sitting  down  with  "Princeton  mom"  Susan  Patton,  I  was  fairly  certain  there  was  nothing  I  would  find  redeeming  about  her  or  her  new  book,  "Marry  Smart,"  with  its  message  that  women  should  spend  75%  of  their  time  in  college  looking  for  a  man.After  all,  her  letter  to  the  "Daily  Princetonian"  last  year,  which  went  viral,  outraged  many  women,  myself  included,  with  its  message  that  a  woman  should  find  a  husband  on  campus  before  she  graduates.What?  Haven't  we  come  a  long  way,  baby,  from  the  days  when  a  woman's  only  focus  was  marriage  and  motherhood?After  my  hourlong  conversation  and  polite  give  and  take  with  Patton,  a  59-year-old  human  resources  consultant  and  executive  coach,  I  found  myself  still  not  agreeing  with  much  of  what  she  thinks  but  understanding  the  reasoning  behind  her  efforts  to  get  the  conversation  going.I  remember  seeing  a  magazine  piece  shortly  after  I  graduated  college  in  the  late  1980s  that  pictured  a  40-something  business  woman  with  a  title  something  along  the  lines  of  "I  Forgot  to  Have  Kids."Dating  checklists:  practical  or  nitpicky?That  image,  and  the  harsh  reality  at  that  time  for  many  highly  successful  professional  women,  stayed  with  me  for  years.  I  continued  my  career  as  a  fairly  hard-driving  news  reporter,  but  in  the  back  of  my  mind,  I  knew  that  I  wanted  children  and  didn't  want  to  wake  up  one  day  regretting  that  I  never  made  motherhood  a  priority.In  a  small  but  highly  controversial  way,  Patton  may  be  doing  something  similar  for  young  women  in  college  who  want  to  get  married  and  have  kids  someday.  "Honey,  keep  this  in  mind.  You  cannot  wait  forever  to  get  married  and  have  children,"  she  tells  them,  citing  declining  fertility  rates  for  women  in  their  30s.While  I  understand  Patton's  desire  to  have  young  women  feel  more  comfortable  admitting  whether  they  want  motherhood  in  addition  to  (or  in  the  absence  of)  a  career,  I  wondered  if  her  delivery,  and  her  words,  are  doing  more  to  set  modern  women  back.Single  woman  seeking  part-time  lover?Patton,  who  is  divorced  and  whose  sons  followed  her  to  Princeton  (one  is  still  an  undergraduate),  didn't  mince  words  during  our  conversation.  An  edited  version  of  our  talk  is  below:Kelly:  Do  you  consider  yourself  a  feminist?Patton:  Of  course,  I  am  fully  supportive  of  equal  rights  and  equal  opportunity  for  women,  and  I  recognize  that  I  am  one  of  the  earliest  beneficiaries  of  the  good  works  of  the  women's  movement.  ...However,  feminism  has  taken  a  turn  to  the  dark  side.  Feminists  have  become  antagonistic.  They've  become  bullying  of  women  who  aspire  to  traditional  roles,  women  who  want  anything  for  themselves  different  from  what  the  feminists,  the  very  strident  feminists'  doctrine,  is  directing  them  towards.Kelly:  Forget  the  feminist  label.  Many  modern  women  like  myself  believe  in  empowering  women  to  make  the  choices  they  want  to  make,  and  that  many  women  would  choose  a  career  and  marriage  and  motherhood,  too.Are  people  without  kids  happier?Patton:  In  my  experience,  I  certainly  agree  that  modern  women  today  do  want  marriage  and  motherhood.  The  problem  is  they're  afraid  to  say  so  because  of  the  vitriol,  because  of  this  antagonist  feminist  doctrine  that  would  have  them  believe  that  marriage  and  motherhood  is  somehow  not  cool.  ...  It's  so  retro.  It's  so  backwards.  It's  so  1950s.Kelly:  I  don't  know  if  people  would  say  it's  so  retro.  ...  You  want  to  be  empowered  to  have  the  career  choices  you  want  to  have  as  well  as  be  a  mother  and  be  in  a  relationship  if  you  want  marriage  and  family,  too.Patton:  If  you  delay  starting  a  family  and  finding  a  husband  until  your  mid-30s,  a  few  things  happen.  One,  from  the  perspective  of  your  fertility,  you're  out  of  luck  or  maybe  you're  out  of  luck.  ...The  other  component  of  this,  so  you're  35,  who  are  you  going  to  be  looking  at  to  marry?  I'm  going  to  say  most  women  who  are  35  are  going  to  be  looking  for  a  man  around  the  same  age,  or  maybe  a  year  or  two  older.  So  let's  take  the  man  of  36.  He's  quite  happy  to  actually  be  with  a  woman  10  years  younger.Kelly:  You  say  women  should  spend  75%  of  their  time  in  college  looking  for  a  man  versus  25%  on  their  career.  How  is  that  not  setting  women  back  professionally  in  terms  of  their  future  careers  that  you  admit  are  important?Patton:  I  don't  think  it  hurts  them  at  all  because  you  can  make  up  lost  time  at  work.  Work  a  little  harder,  it's  OK.  You  can  make  up  that  lost  time  if  you  are  focused  on  your  personal  happiness,  which  I  guarantee  you  will  outlast  your  professional  happiness.  Your  career  is  going  to  come  to  an  end  eventually.Kelly:  Had  I  married  any  of  my  boyfriends  in  college,  I'd  be  divorced.Patton:  I've  heard  this  argument  before,  that  in  your  early  20s,  you  don't  know  who  you  are  going  to  evolve  into  by  the  time  you're  30.  If  you  wait  until  you're  30  to  get  married,  you  don't  know  who  you  are  going  to  evolve  into  by  the  time  that  you  're  40,  but  I  can  guarantee  you  it'll  be  somebody  very  different  than  you  were  when  you  were  30.  ...I  think  the  smartest  thing  that  a  young  woman  or  a  young  man  can  do  is  find  a  life  partner  who  shares  your  values,  who  shares  your  love  of  learning,  who  shares  your  intellectual  curiosity,  who  will  applaud  you,  who  will  encourage  you,  and  who  you  can  grow  with  and  evolve  with  through  the  decades.Kelly:  I'm  lucky.  I  got  married  at  36.Patton:  Right  under  the  wire.Kelly:  You  talk  about  "Marrying  Smart"  and  spending  more  time  in  college  to  find  that  right  person,  but  you  have  to  believe  it's  also  very  important  for  women,  at  the  same  time,  to  be  fulfilled  and  find  what  they  want  because  their  marriage  could  end;  50%  of  marriages  end  in  divorce.Patton:  I'm  saying  by  all  means  develop  your  career,  develop  your  professional  self  because  that's  critically  important.  ...  Women  have  to  know  that  they  are  responsible  for  their  own  safety.  They're  responsible  for  their  own  happiness.  I  am  not  saying  a  man  is  going  to  make  you  happy.  I'm  not  saying  that  a  marriage  will  make  you  happy.  I  hope  it  does,  but  don't  expect  that.Don't  expect  to  only  be  happy  because  of  your  marriage.  Happiness  comes  from  within  clearly,  and  obviously  nobody  knows  better  than  a  divorced  person  how  happy  a  marriage  can  make  you  (or)  not.Kelly:  I  cracked  up  when  I  read  what  you  wrote:  "Be  aware  of  marrying  a  dumb  guy  for  good  sex.  The  sex  won't  improve,  and  he'll  never  get  smarter."Patton:  There  are  two  barnyard  analogies  that  I  cite  regularly.  The  first  is  men  will  not  buy  the  cow  if  the  milk  is  free,  and  that's  the  truth.  If  you  give  men  sex  without  commitment,  you  have  eliminated  the  incentive  for  them  to  commit.  ...An  equally  important  barnyard  analogy  has  to  do  with  just  what  you're  talking  about:  the  bad  guys,  the  crazy  boys,  just  the  men  you  know  you  shouldn't  spend  time  with.  I'm  telling  women  avoid  wasting  time  with  the  pigs  for  the  sake  of  a  little  sausage.Kelly:  Can't  stop  laughing.Patton:  It's  absolutely  true.  I  understand  that  women  have  needs,  but  not  with  that.Kelly:  You  basically  say  if  you  require  major  (cosmetic)  bodywork,  get  it  done  in  high  school.  That's  pretty  outrageous.  We  want  to  encourage  our  girls  to  love  themselves.  The  last  thing  we  want  to  do  is  push  them  to  have  plastic  surgery.Patton:  I  would  never  have  plastic  surgery,  and  I  wouldn't  recommend  it  for  anybody  except  if  you  have  a  tragic  flaw,  something  that  enters  the  room  before  you  do  such  that  you  are  hounded  by  it,  such  that  it  so  impacts  your  self-image.Kelly:  How  do  your  sons  feel  about  your  newfound  celebrity  and  your  views?Patton:  There's  not  a  thing  that  I've  said  that  they  haven't  heard  me  say  for  decades.  They  are  delighted  that  I  found  another  platform  by  which  to  share  my  views  with  a  broader  audience,  and  they  are  absolutely  delighted  that  I  am  having  so  much  fun  doing  it.Kelly:  You  have  to  have  a  pretty  thick  skin,  I  think,  to  put  yourself  out  there  with  a  very  controversial  position  and  not  feel  the  blowback.Patton:  It  doesn't  bother  me  at  all  because  I  am  so  completely  confident  in  what  I'm  saying.  ...  There  was  nothing  in  this  for  me  other  than  my  absolute  conviction  that  this  is  a  message  that  our  young  women  need  because  all  they're  hearing  is  you  have  to  focus  on  work,  work,  work.Kelly:  Do  you  feel  misunderstood  by  many  women  who  are  criticizing  you  and  who  say  you  are  setting  women  back?Patton:  Well,  they  clearly  haven't  read  what  I've  written.  They've  controverted  what  I've  said  for  their  own  purposes,  or  they're  so  caught  up  in  trying  to  look  politically  correct  that  they've  gone  in  a  different  direction  from  where  I'm  writing.  I'm  not  criticizing  anybody.  I'm  not  suggesting  that  you  not  pursue  a  career.  I'm  just  saying  if  you  know  this  is  what  you  want,  plan  for  it  because  it  doesn't  just  happen.Kelly:  Many  people  think  you  are  evil.Patton:  I'm  not  the  one  that's  evil.  I'm  trying  to  encourage  a  conversation.  I'm  trying  to  bring  to  the  fore  a  dialogue  that's  been  suppressed.  It's  the  feminists  that  are  looking  to  continue  to  suppress  the  conversation.  That's  evil.What  do  you  think  of  Patton's  argument  that  women  who  want  to  get  married  should  look  for  a  husband  in  college?

It  wasn't  that  she  always  loved  school,  or  that  she  had  a  big  test  coming  up  and  needed  her  teacher's  help.  No,  the  student  from  Thomas  Middle  School  in  Arlington  Heights,  Illinois,  was  sad  to  miss  out  on  her  "genius  hour."That's  an  80-minute  period  every  Monday  during  which  Emily  and  her  classmates  work  on  projects  entirely  of  their  choosing.  Over  months  of  study,  Emily  and  her  friends  have  spent  their  time  researching  running  shoes  --  what  people  prefer  and  why."It's  definitely  the  highlight  of  my  week,"  says  Emily,  12.  "It's  not  a  project  a  teacher  assigned,  it's  something  that  actually  interests  you,  and  it  gets  you  learning  in  different  ways  from  what  we  do  the  rest  of  the  day  at  school."Her  classroom's  "genius  hour"  was  inspired  by  Google's  20%  time  initiative,  which  allows  employees  to  dedicate  20%  of  working  hours  to  their  own  ideas.  The  concept  is  now  catching  on  in  schools,  usually  rooted  in  the  idea  of  student-led  passion  projects  with  a  focus  on  creating  and  sharing.Teachers  said  it's  part  of  a  larger  movement  in  education  to  promote  student-driven  learning,  ensuring  that  young  people  learn  to  think  for  themselves.  Educators  across  grade  levels  are  asking  students  to  come  up  with  their  own  questions,  do  their  own  research  and  form  their  own  conclusions.Nicholas  Provenzano's  students  at  Grosse  Pointe  South  High  School  in  Michigan  maintain  20  Time  blogs  where  they  post  weekly  about  projects  ranging  from  documenting  Detroit,  going  vegetarian,  learning  Polish  and  how  to  make  T-shirts.Provenzano  was  also  inspired  by  conversations  on  Twitter,  and  launched  20  Time  this  fall  after  a  summer  of  planning  and  setting  guidelines  for  students  to  follow.  A  key  one  on  his  list  of  "commandments":  "Failure  IS  an  option."Amid  pressure  to  pass  tests  and  succeed,  letting  students  know  that  failure  is  acceptable  allows  them  to  take  risks,  he  said."With  genius  hour,  failure  is  an  acceptable  result  and  the  emphasis  is  in  learning  from  failure.  This  allows  student  to  push  themselves  and  take  risks.  Traditional  learning  environments  do  not  support  that  approach,"  he  said."I  asked  my  students  what  they  liked  about  this  project  and  the  most  common  response  was  that  they  loved  the  freedom  to  explore  what  they  are  passionate  about  instead  of  just  doing  the  work  they  have  been  assigned  by  teachers.  That  freedom  is  what  motivates  them  to  explore  big  ideas  and  take  ownership  of  their  learning."In  an  era  when  standardized  tests  dominate  education  conversations,  it  can  be  tough  for  teachers  to  sell  administrators,  parents  and  even  students  on  the  idea.  But  there's  a  lot  for  students  to  learn  when  they  have  some  freedom,  teachers  said.  It's  one  hour  of  the  week  when  failure  isn't  just  an  option  --  it's  a  learning  opportunity."It's  getting  kids  to  learn  on  their  own  and  become  lifelong  learners,"  said  Joy  Kirr,  Emily  Born's  teacher  in  Arlington  Heights,  Illinois,  and  a  genius  hour  evangelist.  "They're  not  going  to  have  teachers  to  help  them  throughout  life.  They're  going  to  be  on  their  own."Selling  the  idea  to  parentsInspired  by  a  talk  about  design  thinking  in  schools,  Kirr  began  in  February  2012  to  dedicate  one  class  period  each  week  to  student-driven  learning.She  didn't  give  it  a  name;  she  simply  told  students  she  wanted  to  try  something  different  to  encourage  more  reading.  Instead  of  assigning  books,  students  would  choose  their  own,  and  discuss  them  with  the  class.Some  students  were  excited,  but  others  were  confused.  Two  girls  actually  cried,  Kirr  said."They  were  so  into  grades  and  being  told  what  to  do,  and  they  thought  quarterly  book  projects  were  fine,"  she  said.  "All  I  wanted  to  do  was  take  fabricated  teacher  assignments  and  make  them  more  student-led."Those  weekly  open  reading  session  evolved  into  time  for  students  to  work  on  projects  of  their  own  choosing."At  first,  I  said,  'Let's  just  read  and  share  what  we  read,'"  Kirr  said.  Now  she  tells  them  to  "read,  be  inspired  by  what  you  read,  and  act  on  it,"  an  idea  she  picked  up  from  Iowa  educator  Erin  Olson.Over  time,  Kirr  said,  she  recognized  the  need  to  build  in  more  structure  in  order  to  keep  students  on  task.  Now,  genius  hour  includes  regular  one-on-one  conferences,  biweekly  goal-setting  and  self-evaluation.  Upon  completion,  students  share  what  they  learned  in  a  class  presentation.  Kirr  and  a  colleague  work  continuously  to  make  sure  the  projects  meet  the  school's  curriculum  standards,  especially  to  make  students  into  better  readers,  writers,  communicators  and  listeners.Kirr  also  learned  the  importance  of  educating  parents  early  and  often.  As  unfamiliar  as  genius  hour  seemed  for  kids,  it's  even  less  familiar  to  adults.  Kirr  reflects  on  genius  hour  on  her  personal  blog  and  celebrates  students'  progress  on  her  classroom  blog.She  includes  updates  in  biweekly  emails  to  parents  and  offered  a  detailed  explanation  during  a  curriculum  night  early  in  the  school  year.That's  where  she  sold  Emily  Born's  mother  on  the  idea.As  a  mother  of  three  and  substitute  teacher,  Sara  Born  wondered  how  her  Kirr  would  manage  a  room  of  students  working  on  different  projects.  But  she  found  Kirr's  emphasis  on  one-on-one  conferences  reassuring,  has  seen  the  follow-through,  she  said."Mrs.  Kirr  described  conferencing  with  kids,  not  to  tell  them  what  to  do  but  to  lead  them  in  right  direction,  and  she  has  stayed  true  to  that,"  she  said.Plus,  she  likes  that  genius  hour  is  ongoing.  Most  of  the  time,  students  complete  assignments  and  immediately  forget  about  them.  Because  it's  student-driven,  they  make  decisions  to  pivot  on  their  own."Sometimes,  the  ideas  fail  and  they  move  on.  They  have  to  learn  to  adapt  and  I  love  that,"  Sara  Born  said.On  a  practical  level,  her  daughter  is  learning  to  brainstorm,  interview  people,  write  professional  letters  and  collect  data  --  all  with  a  larger  goal  than  just  finishing  a  worksheet.Perhaps  most  significantly,  her  daughter  was  "heartbroken"  when  she  had  to  miss  school  this  year  because  of  snow  days."How  can  you  not  love  something  that  makes  your  kid  enjoy  going  to  school?"  she  said.Early  on,  Emily  said  it  wasn't  so  easy.  She  struggled  to  come  up  with  an  idea  until  she  and  her  friends  found  themselves  discussing  which  sneaker  brands  were  best.  That,  they  decided,  would  be  the  perfect  subject  to  explore  on  their  own.They  searched  for  an  answer  online  but  realized  that  sneaker  preference  was  a  matter  of  opinion.  So,  they  shifted  the  focus  of  their  project.  They  came  up  with  a  list  of  questions  and  surveyed  students.  Then,  with  their  teacher's  help,  they  posted  an  online  survey  and  got  students,  parents  and  teachers  from  other  schools  to  respond.After  a  few  months  of  gathering  opinions,  they  hit  another  wall:  What  to  do  next?  They  decided  to  put  the  sneakers  through  more  empirical  testing  with  the  help  of  their  science  teacher.  To  get  the  sneakers,  they  wrote  letters  asking  for  samples  from  eight  brands  that  had  come  up  in  their  surveys.It  was  intimidating  at  first,  Emily  said.  Never  before  had  she  written  a  formal  letter  or  called  a  company  to  request  information."It  helped  me  get  over  fear  of  talking  to  someone  important,"  she  said.  "It's  helped  me  in  so  many  ways."For  one,  it  has  helped  her  learn  to  brainstorm  and  interact  with  others  and  have  confidence  in  her  own  ideas  "instead  of  agreeing  with  others,"  she  said.Oh,  and,  she  learned  a  lot  about  sneakers:  Color  and  style  mean  a  lot  to  consumers,  she  discovered,  but  comfort,  support  and  function  are  important,  too,  especially  among  runners.  She  was  stunned  to  learn  that  some  people  have  shoes  just  to  use  on  treadmills  or  on  the  street.Personally,  she  said,  she's  not  sold  on  the  idea  of  multiple  sneakers  for  different  purposes  --  but  maybe  it's  worth  more  study.Selling  the  idea  to  studentsFor  students,  the  toughest  part  of  a  personal  project  is  coming  up  with  the  idea.  Schools  just  haven't  trained  them  to  think  that  way,  teachers  said.In  Julie  Oliver's  third-grade  classroom  at  Warner  Elementary  School  in  Spring  Arbor,  Michigan,  she  keeps  the  expectations  posted  for  all  to  see:  "I  will  learn,  I  will  work,  and  I  will  share."Inspired  by  teachers  who  shared  their  experiences  on  Twitter,  Oliver  started  experimenting  with  genius  hour  in  the  fall.  She  and  another  teacher  came  up  with  a  list  of  ideas  about  early  Michigan  landforms  and  state  symbols  for  students  to  research  and  create  a  presentation.  During  the  holiday  season,  the  topic  was  Christmas,  which  led  to  reports  about  Christmas  in  other  countries,  different  names  for  Santa  Claus  around  the  world  and  a  decoration  created  in  the  Japanese  holiday  tradition.  In  January,  students  came  up  with  their  own  ideas,  leading  to  a  Pinewood  Derby  car,  tree  frog  research  and  a  dollhouse  made  out  of  cardboard."I  learned  that  sometimes  you  don't  have  enough  time  for  all  the  stuff  you  want  to  do,"  said  8-year-old  Jesse  Pratt,  who  designed  a  marble  run  at  school  and  built  it  at  home  with  his  father.  "I  thought  it  would  turn  out  differently,  but  it's  actually  pretty  cool  the  other  way  it  turned  out."Executing  the  projects  has  been  a  series  of  "baby  steps,"  teacher  Oliver  said,  and  there  are  kinks  to  work  out  this  first  year.  She's  considering  keeping  a  list  of  projects  for  students  who  have  a  hard  time  coming  up  with  their  own.  She's  also  learning  about  how  to  be  flexible  while  managing  a  classroom  of  students  on  different  timetables.  Extra  eyes  and  hands  would  be  helpful,  she  said,  especially  for  children  "who  don't  do  well  with  freedom."Still,  she's  encouraged  by  her  students'  response  and  how  they  "beg"  for  genius-hour  time.  For  now,  it's  split  between  45  minutes  on  Thursdays  and  another  20  on  Fridays."The  thing  that  I  really  really  love  is  that  this  is  student-driven,"  Oliver  said.  "The  child  gets  to  decide  what  types  of  things  interest  him  or  her  and  run  with  it.  They  are  encouraged  to  think  outside  the  box,  be  creative,  and  be  risk-takers.  It  is  OK  to  fail  and  try  again."Thomas  Middle  School's  Kirr  tried  to  inspire  students  with  a  video  explaining  30-day  projects,  in  which  students  take  on  a  task  or  goal  and  commit  to  it  for  30  days.The  video  inspired  Izzy  Kurbat's  genius-hour  project:  drawing  pictures  50  days  in  a  row  based  on  a  list  of  themes  she  brainstormed  with  classmates.  Once  she  finished  the  pictures,  she  moved  on  to  her  next  project:  writing  a  novel  based  in  part  on  the  fantasy  world  she  created  in  her  images.Izzy  likes  the  project  because  school  can  be  "rigid,"  she  said,  offering  few  opportunities  to  learn  about  topics  of  interest  to  her,  and  fewer  opportunities  to  work  closely  with  teachers  and  classmates.  But  this  is  still  a  school  assignment,  with  goals  and  deadlines."It's  not  like  you  say  'I'm  gonna  write  a  novel,'  then  five  years  later  you  still  haven't  done  it,"  she  said.  "You  have  to  do  it."Her  mother  said  the  project  boosted  her  daughter's  confidence  in  her  artistic  ability.  Being  able  to  pursue  her  passion  for  fantasy  and  science  fiction  in  school  --  and  to  have  the  project  supported  so  enthusiastically  by  her  teacher  --  validates  what  she  loves,  Mary  Kurbat  said."It's  an  hour  your  kid  gets  to  learn  about  herself,  and  that  is  really  important  at  this  age,  when  she's  trying  to  figure  out  her  place  in  world,"  she  said."There's  not  a  lot  of  freedom  in  education  right  now.  There's  still  so  much  emphasis  on  standardized  testing.  This  is  a  tiny  little  bit  of  freedom  in  a  safe  environment  to  explore  and  push  boundaries  and  there  are  no  bad  repercussions."Would  you  want  your  child's  classroom  to  try  a  "genius  hour"?

Great  director!  Why  did  that  movie  flop?Stallone  picked  up  a  worst  actor  Razzie  nomination  for  three  2013  films  --  "Bullet  to  the  Head,"  "Escape  Plan"  and  "Grudge  Match."  It's  his  record-breaking  31st  nomination.Depp,  on  the  other  hand,  had  never  been  singled  out  by  the  Razzies  before.  That  changed  this  year,  thanks  to  "The  Lone  Ranger,"  the  big  summer  bomb  in  which  Depp  played  Tonto.  Depp  is  up  for  worst  actor.The  worst  picture  nominees  are  "After  Earth,"  "Grown  Ups  2,"  "The  Lone  Ranger,"  "A  Madea  Christmas"  (star  Tyler  Perry  is  also  up  for  worst  actress)  and  "Movie  43."In  addition  to  Depp,  worst  actor  nominations  went  out  to  Sandler,  Stallone,  Ashton  Kutcher  ("Jobs")  and  Jaden  Smith  ("After  Earth").Worst  actress  nominations  include  Perry,  Lohan  ("The  Canyons"),  Halle  Berry  ("The  Call"  and  "Movie  43"),  Selena  Gomez  ("The  Getaway")  and  Naomi  Watts  ("Diana"  and  "Movie  43").Other  nominations  went  to  Larry  the  Cable  Guy,  who  picked  up  two,  for  worst  supporting  actor  and  worst  screen  combo,  a  joint  nomination  with  "Madea  Christmas"  co-star  Tyler  Perry;  Lady  Gaga,  up  for  worst  supporting  actress  for  "Machete  Kills";  and  "the  13  people  who  directed  'Movie  43.'"Votes  were  received  from  750  Golden  Raspberry  Award  Foundation  members,  and  worst  screen  combo  was  voted  on  by  62,000  RottenTomatoes.com  participants.</TEXT></DOC>

Wednesday  night  when  he  incorrectly  answered  the  final  question  of  the  night.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(EW.com)  --  Who  was  the  last  male  monarch  who  had  not  previously  been  Prince  of  Wales?  Don't  know  the  answer  off  the  top  of  your  head?  Neither  did  Arthur  Chu,  who  ended  his  11-game  winning  streak  on  Jeopardy!  Wednesday  night  when  he  incorrectly  answered  the  final  question  of  the  night.Chu  lost  to  Diana  Peloquin,  someone  who  the  controversial  Jeopardy!  star  calls  "a  bit  devious"  (in  a  good  way).  We  caught  up  with  him  over  the  phone  to  see  how  he's  feeling,  who  his  favorite  movie  villain  is,  and  who  he  took  some  selfies  with  before  heading  back  home  to  Ohio.What  happened  [Wednesday]  night?Well,  I  lost.  I  think  Alex  Trebek  actually  pointed  it  out;  he  saw  how  I  was  feeling  that  day.  I  was  really  fatigued,  and  I  was  sort  of  losing  my  mojo.  And  Diana,  to  her  credit,  picked  up  on  the  strategy  I  was  using,  and  she  used  it  herself  to  great  effect.You  said  she  picked  up  on  your  strategy  —  was  she  the  first  competitor  to  do  that?Other  people  tried  to  do  it,  but  I  think  some  people  weren't  prepared  to  play  in  a  way  different  than  they'd  practiced.  Diana  had  the  advantage  that  she  watched  me  for  a  whole  day  before  having  to  play  because  she  was  an  alternate  the  day  before,  and  so  she  had  that  time  to  prepare  and  she's  also  a  little  bit  devious.  She's  a  very  clever  person,  I  hope  she  does  well  in  her  future  games.You  have  this  title  as  a  Jeopardy!  villain,  do  you  remember  the  first  time  you  saw  a  mention  of  that  in  media?There  was  someone  who  wrote  a  tweet,  I  think  they  were  being  tongue-in-cheek,  they  posted  a  picture  of  my  face  and  were  like,  'This  is  the  face  of  a  Jeopardy!  villain,  can  anyone  stop  him?'  And  that  meme  sort  of  ran  out  of  control.EW:  'Jeopardy!'  champ  Arthur  Chu's  winning  streak  ends  --  VIDEOYou've  humorously  embraced  that  title  of  villain.  Did  it  get  to  you  at  first,  or  was  your  initial  reaction,  "oh,  that's  funny"?It's  really  more  of  an  antihero  thing.  People  are  saying,  antiheroes  are  big  now,  people  say  I'm  the  Walter  White  of  Jeopardy!,  or  like  I  was  Moneyballing  Jeopardy!.  It  was  something  that  made  Jeopardy!  different  for  a  while  and  I  think  a  lot  of  people  appreciated  that.  There  was  this  awesome  video  by  these  Taiwanese  animators  that  shows  me  as  literally  a  super  villain  with  super  powers.  I  loved  that.  I  said,  that  justifies  this  whole  media  thing  by  itself.If  you  could  be  any  TV  or  movie  villain,  who  would  you  be?I  always  sympathize  with  Syndrome  in  The  Incredibles  because  it  totally  was  like,  if  you  don't  have  super  powers,  why  not  use  your  brain  to  try  to  figure  out  a  way  to  give  yourself  super  powers?  I  don't  see  why  that's  a  bad  thing.  Ken  Jennings  might  have  just  been  much  naturally  better  than  me  at  Jeopardy!,  but  shouldn't  we  be  encouraging  people  that  if  you  don't  necessarily  have  the  natural  talents  to  exceed  at  something  without  trying,  than  succeed  at  it  by  trying.  So  the  fact  that  The  Incredibles  showed  the  bad  guy  Syndrome  as  evil  because  he  wanted  to  give  everyone  the  chance  to  have  super  powers,  that  never  sat  well  with  me.  I  see  it  from  the  other  perspective:  If  you  can  use  your  brain,  and  figure  out  inventions  or  tricks  to  compensate  for  your  natural  disadvantages,  that's  what  science  is  about,  that's  what  progress  is  about.So  do  you  have  any  natural  talents?[LAUGHS]  There's  no  way  to  get  money  in  Jeopardy!  without  knowing  the  answers  to  questions.  But  it's  just  like  any  other  sport.  It's  not  just  about  athletics,  it's  about  the  playbook.  Everyone  who  plays  in  the  NFL  is  good  enough  to  play  in  the  NFL  for  the  most  part,  and  then  it  comes  down  to  which  team  was  better  coached,  which  team  had  the  better  strategy  going  into  the  game,  which  team  used  their  resources  most  effectively.  And  I  don't  see  a  game  show  as  being  any  different.Who  could  you  tell  about  your  winning  streak  after  the  taping?I  ended  up  telling  my  family  over  Christmas,  because  I  had  to  explain  why  I  could  afford  to  buy  my  brother  a  TV.  [LAUGHS]  A  lot  of  my  friends  said  they  were  sure  that  I'd  lost  on  my  first  episode;  they  said  they  were  sure  the  way  I  was  promoting  it,  like  telling  everybody  to  come  watch  it  with  me,  like,  'that  must  have  been  his  only  game,  he  must  want  people  to  support  him.'  [LAUGHS]EW:  Public  service  announcement:  It's  time  to  cram  for  the  'Jeopardy!'  online  testWhat  category  would  you  ace,  no  question?[LAUGHS]  A  category  on,  let's  see,  text  adventure  computer  games  from  the  1980s.  I  would  smoke  that  category.  That's  something  I  know  way  too  much  about  compared  to  how  important  it  is  in  life,  but  that's  one  of  my  expert  categories.What  entertainment  are  you  into,  what  are  you  watching?My  wife  and  I  really  liked  Orange  is  the  New  Black,  we  really  liked  Alpha  House  on  Amazon,  and  Betas,  also  on  Amazon.  Actually,  one  of  the  best  things  about  Betas  is  this  quote,  where  there's  a  character  named  David  Chu,  and  he  says  this  awesome  thing  that  I  wish  I'd  thought  of  it  earlier.  But  this  would  be  my  quote  for  people  who  don't  like  watching  me  play  on  Jeopardy!:  'That  sounds  like  a  'you'  problem,  like  a  Chu  problem.'  So  that's  my  tagline.Do  you  talk  to  Diana?I  messaged  her  on  Monday,  saying,  'are  you  ready  for  what  the  media  is  going  to  do  to  you  on  Wednseday?'  because  I  hadn't  anticipated  the  story  about  me  would  blow  up  so  big.  And  she  was  like,  'No,  I  have  no  idea  what  to  do!  I'm  freaking  out!'  And  I  was  like,  'you'll  be  fine.'  [LAUGHS]  What  was  really  cool  was  that  I  happened  to  run  into  her  mom  and  her  best  friend  in  the  airport  when  I  was  going  to  fly  back  to  Ohio  after  the  taping  and  they  actually,  they  had  nothing  but  good  things  to  say.  We  took  some  selfies  and  everything  and  it  was  cool.So  how  are  you  feeling?Obviously,  I  wish  I  had  gone  on  to  be  Ken  Jennings.  But  we  can't  all  be  Ken  Jennings.  In  fact,  the  evidence  suggests  most  of  us  can't  be  Ken  Jennings.  I  don't  know  how  he  did  it.  I  like  to  think  I'm  the  best  mere  mortal  in  Jeopardy!.  There's  Dave  Madden,  then  there  is  Ken  Jennings,  who  isn't  human.  It's  like  if  we  were  doing  basketball  rankings,  I'd  be  the  best  normal  basketball  player  in  history  and  then  you'd  have  Michael  Jordan  and  you  know,  Ken  Jennings  would  be  like,  God  or  something.You're  like  the  the  Jeopardy!  champion  of  the  people,  basically.Yeah,  yeah.  I've  had  people  say  that.  They're  like,  Ken  Jennings  seemed  like  he  wasn't  trying,  it  seemed  like  it  was  easy  for  him.  Whereas  for  you,  this  guy  was  saying  to  me,  for  you  it  seemed  like  you  struggled  a  lot.  So  it  was  much  more  human,  it  made  me  feel  like  I  could  do  that.  And  I  was  like,  that's  the  message  I  want  to  send  to  people.See  the  original  story  at  EW.com.CLICK  HERE  to  Try  2  RISK  FREE  issues  of  Entertainment  Weekly©  2011  Entertainment  Weekly  and  Time  Inc.

The  same  one  that  has  the  biggest  stockpile  of  Chinese  artifacts.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  With  23  million  people  crammed  onto  an  island  that  covers  just  more  than  36,000  square  kilometers,  Taiwan  ranks  among  the  20  most  densely  populated  places  in  the  world.Although  the  industrious  island  has  built  a  global  reputation  for  cheap  electronics,  this  is  one  Asian  tiger  that  offers  far  more  than  stickers  on  the  backs  of  calculators.Economically  there's  little  it  has  left  to  prove,  but  Taiwanese  people  remain  a  proud  and  determined  bunch.Here  are  10  things  they  do  better  than  anyone  else.1.  Night  marketsFor  an  island  smaller  in  area  than  Switzerland,  Taiwan  sure  has  a  lot  of  night  markets  --  an  estimated  300  island-wide.These  open-air  bazaars  are  particularly  loved  for  street  food,  referred  to  locally  as  xiao-chi,  literally  "small  eats."Perennial  favorites  are  oyster  omelets,  stinky  tofu  and  an  assortment  of  snacks  on  a  stick  straight  off  the  grill.Specialty  drinks  range  from  bubble  tea  to  shots  of  snake  blood.According  to  the  Taiwan  Tourism  Bureau,  some  70%  of  tourists  to  Taiwan  will  visit  a  night  market.The  top  three  Facebook  check-ins  for  2013  in  Taiwan  were  all  night  markets;  Tainan  Flower  Night  Market  (12th  globally)  nabbed  the  top  spot,  followed  by  Luodong  and  Feng  Chia  night  markets  in  Yilan  and  Taichung,  respectively.MORE:  The  10  best  dishes  from  Taiwan's  night  markets2.  Themed  restaurantsIf  literal  toilet  humor  (eating  out  of  miniature  urinals  and  toilet  bowls)  is  your  idea  of  an  amuse  bouche,  Taiwan  provides  a  belly  full  of  laughs.Modern  Toilet  restaurants  address  taboos  pertaining  to  dining  etiquette,  posing  witty  rhetoric  on  websites  such  as:  "To  eat  or  to  pee?  Now  that  is  the  question."At  the  other  extreme,  you  can  get  a  cutesy  overdose  at  a  Hello  Kitty  namesake  cafe,  where  everything  from  burger  buns  to  soup  bowls  is  shaped  like  the  mouthless  cartoon  cat.  (For  more  on  the  kitty  obsession,  read  point  9  below.)What's  that?  Can't  get  enough  pink  and  glitter?That's  OK,  because  Taiwan  is  home  to  the  world's  first  Barbie-themed  restaurant,  with  Mattel-approved  smotherings  of  pink  plastic  and  frilly  tutus.Previous  themed  restaurants  in  Taiwan  have  included  a  cafe  based  on  an  Airbus  A380,  complete  with  trolly  dollies  serving  food  and  drinks  from  a  cart,  as  well  as  restaurants  with  jail,  hospital  and  school-inspired  themes.3.  Free  WiFiSince  2011,  Taiwanese  citizens  have  been  able  to  log  onto  iTaiwan,  the  island's  free  WiFi  network.Taiwan  is  one  of  the  first  places  in  the  world  to  offer  free  WiFi  on  a  mass  scale.In  June  2013,  the  service  was  rolled  out  to  tourists  in  four  of  the  five  largest  cities,  using  more  than  4,400  hotspots.Visitors  can  sign  up  for  an  iTaiwan  account  with  their  passport  at  Taiwan  Tourism  Bureau  centers  and  offices  in  transportation  stations,  then  receive  complimentary  WiFi  in  Taipei,  New  Taipei,  Taichung  and  Tainan.More:  Taiwan  offers  free  WiFi  to  all  foreign  tourists4.  Chinese  artifactsYou  might  think  it'd  be  in  Beijing  or  Shanghai,  but  the  National  Palace  Museum  in  Taipei  houses  the  largest  collection  of  Chinese  artifacts  and  artwork  in  the  world.The  impressive  permanent  collection  comprises  more  than  650,000  items.Chinese  history  is  told  through  bronze  statues,  jade  carvings,  calligraphy,  lacquerware  and  other  historical  pieces  --  many  of  which  belonged  to  Chinese  imperial  families  --  including  an  intriguingly  life-like,  meat-shaped  stone  and  a  jadeite  cabbage.Despite  several  rounds  of  building  expansion,  only  a  fraction  of  the  collection  is  on  display  (no  more  than  10,000  items  at  any  one  time),  making  the  museum  worth  returning  to  several  times  a  year.MORE:  5  Taipei  hotels  with  megabucks  art  collections5.  Animated  newsWith  an  army  of  about  400  animators,  Next  Media  Animation  (NMA),  a  Taiwan-based  animation  studio,  can  turn  any  news  story  into  a  cartoon  in  as  fast  as  90  minutes  ('making-of'  video  here).More  impressively  --  the  videos  are  usually  satirical,  outrageous  and  hilarious.The  studio,  created  by  a  Hong  Kong  media  tycoon,  takes  infotainment  to  another  level.Founded  in  2007  to  create  CGI-animated  videos  for  news  without  real  footage  for  Apple  Daily  News  in  Hong  Kong  and  Taiwan,  the  talents  of  Taiwan's  animators  were  exposed  to  the  world  with  the  2009  release  of  their  hilarious  video  of  what  might  have  happened  during  Tiger  Woods'  infamous  car  crash.In  the  video,  now  ex-wife  Elin  Nordegren  chases  Tiger  Woods'  car  with  a  golf  club  after  finding  out  about  Woods'  affair.After  the  video  went  viral,  the  company  decided  to  service  international  audiences  in  Japanese  and  English.Some  of  the  team's  most  popular  recent  works  include  a  video  about  the  execution  of  Kim  Jong-un's  uncle  and  a  review  of  five  stories  that  must  die  in  2014.6.  Mock  meatOne  of  the  world's  most  vegetarian-friendly  destinations,  Taiwan  offers  6,000  or  so  restaurants  serving  an  impressive  variety  of  delicious  vegetarian  fare  to  feed  the  10%  of  the  country  that  shuns  meat.But  while  it  can't  beat  India  in  terms  of  the  abundance  and  variety  of  vegetarian  dishes  on  offer,  Taiwan  is  the  best  place  to  hit  when  you're  craving  meat  but  don't  actually  want  to  eat  any.  That's  right,  we're  talking  about  mock  meat.Given  how  important  flesh  is  to  the  traditional  Chinese  diet,  it's  no  surprise  Taiwan's  fake  meat  --  usually  made  of  soy  protein  or  wheat  gluten  --  can  fool  even  hardcore  carnivores.Yes,  there  have  been  scandals  that  revealed  actual  meat  inside  supposed  mock  meat  dishes.  But  it's  is  a  thriving  industry  here  and  is  considered  a  staple  across  Taiwan.Mock  meat  stir-fries  in  particular  taste  surprisingly  like  the  real  thing.MORE:  40  Taiwanese  foods  we  can't  live  without7.

National  health  coverageIn  a  year  when  the  Obamacare  debacle  played  out  in  global  headlines,  it's  worth  to  noting  that  Taiwan  has  what  many  call  the  best  universal  healthcare  system  in  the  world.Legal  residents  can  visit  any  specialist  in  the  country.Docs  anywhere  will  pull  up  their  entire  medical  record  via  smart  card,  consult  and  prescribe  Chinese  medicine  and/or  prescription  drugs.Fees  are  billed  directly  to  and  reimbursed  by  the  National  Health  Insurance  Administration,  whose  2%  administrative  costs  are  the  lowest  in  the  world.MORE:  CNNGo  in  Kaohsiung:  Taiwan's  largest  port  and  coolest  art9.

Little  dumplingsYes,  we  recognize  xiaolongbao  as  a  delicacy  homegrown  in  Shanghai,  but  Taiwan  is  slowly  taking  over  the  dumpling  world,  one  broth-filled  bite  at  a  time.Starting  from  a  single  shop  in  Taipei,  Din  Tai  Fung  now  serves  its  famed  xiaolongbao  in  destinations  as  far  flung  as  Australia,  Thailand  and  the  United  States.Two  of  its  Hong  Kong  branches  have  earned  a  coveted  Michelin  star,  with  the  mothership  Xinyi  store  in  Taipei  sneaking  into  the  Miele  Guide.Not  bad  for  a  chain  restaurant,  and  not  a  "fancy"  one  at  that.When  Tom  Cruise  visited  Taiwan  in  2013,  he  joined  in  on  the  18-pleats-per-dumpling  action  with  a  cooking  class  at  the  shop's  Taipei  101  branch.Even  better?

It  happens,  but  when  it  happens  to  Justin  Bieber,  it's  beyond  a  big  deal.The  teen  idol  is  just  the  latest  young  star  to  run  afoul  of  both  the  police  and  public  relations  folks.  But  is  it  to  be  expected  when  a  teen  has  both  fame  and  access  to  so  much  wealth?Tons  of  young  stars  with  more  money  than  years  behind  them  have  run  into  such  troubles  before.  For  many,  standing  on  the  precipice  of  adulthood  or  just  over  that  line,  has  appeared  to  trigger  a  spate  of  issuesIn  recent  years,  Lindsay  Lohan,  Chris  Brown  and  Amanda  Bynes  have  dominated  headlines  with  legal  issues  and  rehab  stints."These  kids  don't  have  their  identities  set  and  no  one  says  'no,'"  said  Sherrie  Campbell,  a  psychologist  and  author  of  the  book,  "Loving  Yourself:  The  Mastery  of  Being  Your  Own  Person.""These  kids  get  all  this  money  and  they  stop  feeling  themselves  so  they  act  out  and  they  act  out  until  they  get  in  trouble,  almost  in  that  they  have  to  lose  everything  in  order  to  experience  what  they  have,"  she  said.Bieber  has  had  both.According  to  Forbes,  as  of  June  2013  the  19-year-old  had  earnings  of  $58  million.  Since  being  discovered  on  YouTube  in  2008,  the  singer  had  enjoyed  an  almost  squeaky  clean  image  until  last  year.Then  the  dogs  from  bad  publicity  hell  were  unleashed.From  being  accused  of  public  urination  to  rumors  of  a  visit  to  a  Brazilian  brothel  and  the  run-ins  with  police  (authorities  recently  swarmed  his  mansion  is  Calabasas,  California,  as  part  of  a  vandalism  investigation),  Bieber  spent  most  of  2013  in  the  news  for  alleged  bad  behavior.His  musical  mentor  Usher  Raymond,  a  former  teen  star  himself,  told  MTV  in  December  2013  that  his  young  protege  was  experiencing  the  pains  of  growing  up  in  the  spotlight."With  success  comes  great  responsibility.  And  being  able  to  grow  up  in  it  and  unfortunately  be  analyzed  in  front  of  the  world  for  just  growing  up,  I  think  they  will  be  able  to  see  the  truth,"  Usher  said.  "And  they  can  make  an  assessment  based  off  of  what  his  reality  looks  like."Lately,  Bieber's  reality  is  not  looking  so  great.Meet  Justin  Bieber's  inner  circleFormer  child  star  Danny  Bonaduce  said  on  his  Seattle  radio  show  on  KZOK-FM  Thursday  that  Bieber's  recent  arrest  could  be  just  what  the  embattled  teen  star  needs  right  now."This  is  the  best  thing  that  could  have  happened  to  him,"  said  Bonaduce,  who  in  the  past  has  struggled  with  addiction  and  legal  troubles.  "Speaking  from  personal  experience,  this  could  save  his  life."Some  of  his  fellow  celebrities  have  condemned  his  behavior  while  others  have  offered  support.  Psychologist  Sherrie  Campbell  pointed  out  that  "fame  is  its  own  addiction"  and  said  celebs  are  often  under  the  pressure  of  the  public's  expectations."I  think  sometimes  these  stars  think  they  have  to  live  up  to  their  own  image  to  the  point  that  they  almost  becomes  fans  of  their  own  image,"  she  said.Bieber  arrest:  Celebs  offer  sympathy,  but  jokes,  tooFor  some  young  celebs,  that  type  of  skid  is  almost  a  rite  of  passage  at  this  point.  Britney  Spears  went  from  pop  princess  to  investigated  mother  when  in  2006  she  was  videotaped  driving  with  her  then-infant  son  Sean  in  her  lap.  A  deputy  was  sent  to  Spears'  home  to  investigate,  though  no  charges  resulted  from  the  incident.What  followed  was  a  year  of  outrageous  behavior  including  the  infamous  hair  shaving  incident,  and  Spears'  father  being  awarded  conservatorship  over  her  fortune.  Since  then,  Spears  has  managed  to  turn  her  life  around,  bagged  a  gig  as  a  judge  on  "The  X  Factor"  for  a  season,  as  well  as  a  new  boyfriend,  album  and  Las  Vegas  residency.Other  celebs  have  not  bounced  back  as  well  as  Spears.See  Britney  Spears  through  the  yearsLindsay  Lohan  recently  announced  she  will  be  starring  in  and  producing  a  new  film,  and  there's  a  six-episode  documentary  series  on  the  way.  But  her  last  film  bombed  and  her  career  is  nowhere  near  what  it  once  was.  Likewise,  Chris  Brown's  reputation  has  never  fully  recovered  from  his  2009  arrest  following  the  attack  on  then-girlfriend  Rihanna  just  before  the  Grammys.  In  October  2013,  Brown  was  arrested  in  Washington  on  suspicion  of  punching  a  man,  and  then  he  was  kicked  out  of  a  rehab  facility  for  "acting  violently."Now  Bieber  finds  himself  a  member  of  the  club  of  Hollywood's  young,  rich  and  infamous  whose  mugshots  join  their  paparazzi  shots.  His  being  accused  of  drag  racing  in  a  sports  car  comes  just  months  after  an  outpouring  of  sorrow  for  "Fast  &  Furious"  star  Paul  Walker,  who  died  in  a  crash  where  speed  was  a  factor.It  remains  to  be  seen  what  the  singer's  response  will  be  to  his  latest  troubles.  In  the  past,  he  has  been  less  than  repentant,  telling  The  Hollywood  Reporter  in  November  about  those  who  criticize  his  behavior,  "I  don't  give  a  f***.""Not  'I  don't  give  a  f***'  to  just  be  reckless  and  do  whatever,  but  'I  don't  give  a  f***  what  they  say,"  Bieber  reportedly  said.</TEXT></DOC>

Is  he  simply  riding  a  tide  of  Russian  patriotic  fervor  over  Crimea?  Is  he  a  rational  actor  aware  of  the  delicate  balances  within  the  international  system,  or  as  one  observer  put  it,  "drunk  on  power"  and  oblivious  to  sanctions?These  are  the  questions  preoccupying  western  governments  and  Russia's  neighbors,  after  the  swift  annexation  of  Crimea  and  Russian  military  maneuvers  close  to  the  Ukrainian  border.There  were  some  tantalizing  clues  in  Putin's  pugnacious  speech  to  the  Duma  this  week.  He  described  the  fall  of  the  Soviet  Union  as  unfortunate  --  because  it  had  separated  Russians.  "The  Russian  nation  became  one  of  the  biggest,  if  not  the  biggest  ethnic  group  in  the  world  to  be  divided  by  borders,"  he  said."It  was  only  when  Crimea  ended  up  as  part  of  a  different  country  that  Russia  realized  that  it  was  not  simply  robbed,  it  was  plundered."  He  went  on  to  say,  "if  you  compress  the  spring  all  the  way  to  its  limit,  it  will  snap  back  hard."Heady,  populist  rhetoric  --  but  it  has  propelled  the  Russian  President  to  his  highest  approval  rating  --  71%  --  in  recent  years,  according  to  the  Russian  Public  Opinion  Research  Center.Putin  said  Russia  had  no  intention  of  violating  Ukraine's  sovereignty  (beyond  the  5%  of  its  territory  it  has  absorbed  this  week.)  "Do  not  believe  those  who  want  you  to  fear  Russia,  shouting  that  other  regions  will  follow  Crimea,"  he  told  Ukrainians.But  he  then  said  this:  "It  should  be  above  all  in  Ukraine's  own  interest  to  ensure  that  these  people's  rights  and  interests  are  fully  protected.  This  is  the  guarantee  of  Ukraine's  state  stability  and  territorial  integrity."In  other  words,  if  the  Kremlin  believes  Russians  are  being  discriminated  against,  Ukraine's  independence  is  no  longer  assured.Those  words  will  have  echoed  across  parts  of  the  former  Soviet  Union  with  large  Russian  populations:  Moldova  (10%),  Lithuania  (6%),  Latvia  (27%)  and  Estonia  (25%).  Will  the  Russian  region  of  Transnistria  in  Moldova  begin  agitating  for  its  own  referendum?  Will  oblasts  (regions)  of  eastern  Ukraine  demand  their  own  vote?Transnistria  is  already  beyond  the  control  of  the  Moldovan  government.  Just  as  a  statue  of  Lenin  overlooks  the  main  square  in  the  Crimean  capital,  Simferopol,  so  another  stands  outside  Transnistria's  regional  assembly  in  Tiraspol.  In  a  2006  referendum  more  than  95%  of  voters  said  they  wanted  to  be  reunited  with  Russia.The  assumption  at  NATO  headquarters  is  that  Putin  won't  stop  at  Crimea.  Secretary  General  Anders  Fogh  Rasmussen  described  the  annexation  of  Crimea  as  "21st  century  revisionism,  attempts  to  turn  back  the  clock,  to  draw  new  dividing  lines  on  our  map,  to  monopolize  markets,  subdue  populations."NATO  has  already  stepped  up  air  policing  over  the  Baltic  states  --  all  members  of  the  Alliance.Nor  does  the  White  House  see  Crimea  as  Putin's  end-game.  In  imposing  sanctions  against  figures  close  to  Putin,  President  Obama  stressed  Thursday  that  further  Russian  incursions  would  trigger  a  third  round  of  sanctions  targeting  key  sectors  of  the  Russian  economy.One  of  Putin's  reasons  for  ignoring  the  warnings  so  far  is  history,  as  he  made  clear  in  front  of  the  Duma.  On  Kosovo,  NATO  expansion,  Libya  and  other  issues,  he  said,  the  West  had  lied  to  and  deceived  Russia.  He  didn't  use  the  word  payback,  but  he  didn't  need  to.Gradually,  pro-Western  governments  have  taken  power  around  Russia,  across  the  Baltics,  now  in  Ukraine  --  feeding  the  age-old  Russian  fear  of  encirlement.  Indeed  Putin  asked  the  Duma  this  week:  what  if  Sevastopol  in  Crimea  --  with  its  glorious  place  in  Russian  military  history  --  had  become  a  NATO  base  within  Ukraine?  A  line  had  to  be  drawn.But  that  line  has  only  hastened  the  signing  of  Ukraine's  association  agreement  with  the  European  Union.  In  signing  the  agreement  Friday,  the  President  of  the  European  Council,  Herman  van  Rompuy,  pointedly  said  it  was  a  response  to  "the  popular  yearning  for  a  decent  life  as  a  nation,  for  a  European  way  of  life."  The  subtext  was  that  Putin's  Russia  was  on  the  wrong  side  of  history  --  anti-democratic,  corrupt,  without  values.Putin's  cliqueAnother  reason  for  Putin's  embrace  of  high-octane  nationalism,  according  to  some  analysts,  is  that  he  increasingly  relies  on  a  small  inner  circle,  where  there  are  few  voices  of  caution  or  dissent.  There  was  a  sign  of  this  when  Russian  Foreign  Minister  Sergei  Lavrov  met  US  Secretary  of  State  John  Kerry  in  London  recently.  U.S.  officials  were  surprised  that  Lavrov  --  despite  his  enormous  experience  --  had  no  mandate  to  negotiate  or  even  discuss  aspects  of  the  crisis.  Lavrov  announced  Friday  that  the  President  would  personally  supervize  the  reintegration  of  Crimea.Alexei  Kudrin  was  known  to  speak  his  mind  as  Finance  Minister  from  2000-2011.  He  believes  the  consequences  of  sanctions  and  market  anxiety  may  cost  Russia  $200  billion  this  year  in  capital  flight.  The  ruble  has  already  lost  10%  of  its  value  this  year  and  the  credit  rating  agency  Fitch's  said  Friday  that  "Since  U.S.  and  EU  banks  and  investors  may  well  be  reluctant  to  lend  to  Russia  under  the  current  circumstances,  the  economy  may  slow  further  and  the  private  sector  may  require  official  support."  Economists  now  expect  the  Russian  economy  to  stagnate  and  perhaps  slide  into  recession.That  hurts  people  closest  to  the  Russian  President,  the  billionaires  who  control  large  chunks  of  the  Russian  economy.  Major  companies  like  Metalloinvest  and  state  banks  like  VTB  need  access  to  capital  markets.  Will  Putin  feel  their  pain,  or  must  the  oligarchs  also  make  patriotic  sacrifices?Another  unknown  is  whether  the  Kremlin  feels  the  West  has  the  stomach  for  serious,  lasting  sanctions.  After  the  Russian  incursion  into  Georgia  in  2008,  when  South  Ossetia  was  essentially  annexed,  there  was  brief  and  mild  retribution.  The  list  of  individuals  sanctioned  by  the  U.S.  and  European  Union  this  time  round  may  make  a  greater  impact.  But  the  avenues  for  dialogue  -  through  NATO,  the  European  Union,  the  G8,  the  United  Nations  --  are  closing  down."Business  as  usual,"  says  NATO  chief  Rasmussen,  "is  not  an  option."Perhaps  the  biggest  question  is  whether  Putin  accepts  that  Russia  in  the  21st  century  must  be  fully  integrated  into  the  international  economy  --  as  a  member  of  the  World  Trade  Organization,  with  a  convertible  currency  and  a  rule  of  law  that  allows  and  encourages  companies  to  do  business  there.  Or  does  he  believe  Russia  is  strong  enough  to  stand  aloof  in  the  knowledge  that  the  world  (and  especially  Europe)  can't  do  without  its  oil,  gas  and  minerals?  Similarly,  does  he  see  the  value  of  international  co-operation  on  Iran's  nuclear  program  or  Syria?  Russia  has  no  desire  to  see  a  nuclear-armed  Iran,  nor  Syria  taken  over  by  jihadist  militants.  But  co-operation  with  the  West  does  not  follow.Despite  the  fact  that  his  "cashiers"  are  now  sanctioned,  and  his  attempts  to  prevent  Ukraine  from  drifting  westward  have  backfired,  Putin's  muscular  defiance  --  so  popular  at  home  and  in  Crimea  --  portrays  the  West  as  Russia's  natural  adversary,  not  its  potential  partner.</TEXT></DOC>

"We  had  the  most  modern  infrastructure  in  the  world."In  March,  the  UK-based  Skytrax  consultancy  released  its  annual  list  of  the  world's  top  100  airports.The  highest  ranking  any  U.S.  airport  managed  to  muster  was  No.  27,  achieved  by  the  relatively  small  Cincinnati/Northern  Kentucky  International  Airport.Now,  The  Economist  has  joined  the  dogpile.After  combing  through  data  on  more  than  a  million  flights  in  2013,  the  venerable  British  magazine  concludes  in  its  current  issue  that  U.S.  airports  are  "awful,"  beset  by  "soggy  pizza,  surly  security  staff  and  endless  queues."The  Economist  article  poses  the  million-  (or,  rather,  multimillion-)  dollar  question:  "Why  are  foreign  airports  better  than  America's?"Perhaps  indicative  of  the  global  traveling  public's  dismissal  of  the  standards  at  U.S.  airports,  the  online  article  doesn't  bother  to  provide  an  answer.Best  eats  at  20  busiest  U.S.  airportsHope  for  U.S.  airports?  Well  ...  maybe"There's  no  question  that  U.S.  airports  suffer  from  an  image  problem  globally,  and  the  main  culprit  is  our  nation's  lack  of  dedicated  infrastructure  investment,  particularly  in  its  aviation  infrastructure,"  Airports  Council  International  North  America  President  and  CEO  Kevin  M.  Burke  said."Many  of  our  airports  are  operating  well  beyond  the  capacity  for  which  they  were  originally  intended  several  decades  ago,  and  this  is  the  reason  why  air  travelers  --  international  and  domestic  --  experience  crowded  terminals  and  outdated  facilities."The  other  source  of  harm  to  our  global  reputation  has  been  the  unacceptably  long  waiting  times  to  process  through  customs  at  U.S.  international  airports."Burke  is  optimistic  about  correcting  the  problems,  pointing  to  a  recent  U.S.  Customs  and  Border  Protection  announcement  that  it  will  add  2,000  officers,  many  assigned  to  airports."ACI-NA  has  been  working  with  Congress  for  additional  staffing,  and  with  international  traffic  on  the  rise,  this  increase  could  not  have  come  at  a  more  critical  time  for  U.S.  airports,"  Burke  said.Hong  Kong  airport  glory  days,  breathtaking  photosMeager  public  funding  bedevils  performance,  improvementAt  the  root  of  many  problems  experienced  by  travelers  at  U.S.  airports  is  an  atypical  system  of  governance  and  finance.Unlike  many  of  their  overseas  counterparts,  U.S.  airports  are  predominantly  owned  and  operated  by  city,  county  or  state  governments."This  means  that  how  they  are  funded  is  far  more  restricted  than  the  rest  of  the  world,"  Burke  said.  "For  our  large  hub  airports,  their  primary  source  of  funding  for  capital  improvement  projects  is  the  Passenger  Facility  Charge."The  charge  is  a  nominal  user  fee  paid  by  passengers  upon  purchase  of  airline  tickets  in  the  United  States,  "virtually  all  of  which,"  according  to  Burke,  is  returned  to  the  airport  for  investment  in  infrastructure  projects.10  of  the  world's  top  airport  loungesThe  problem  is,  the  fee  no  longer  amounts  to  as  much  as  it  once  did."The  PFC's  ceiling  of  $4.50  hasn't  been  raised  since  2000,  and  this  has  meant  that  its  purchasing  power  has  eroded  by  roughly  half  due  to  inflation  over  the  past  14  years,"  says  Burke.Lack  of  Passenger  Facility  Charge  punch  has  hindered  significant  improvements  and  updates  at  many  major  U.S.  airports.Despite  all  this,  Burke,  and  perhaps  at  least  some  of  the  millions  of  visitors  who  continue  to  pour  into  U.S.  airports  each  year,  remains  bullish  about  the  future  of  U.S.  airports.But  can  U.S.  airports  realistically  improve  vis-a-vis  their  international  counterparts  in,  say,  the  next  five  to  10  years?"Yes,  but  it's  going  to  take  an  unwavering  commitment  to  upgrading  our  infrastructure,"  Burke  said.  "It's  crucial  that  Congress  and  the  American  public  recognize  that  infrastructure  investment  in  airports  is  reinvestment  in  the  communities  they  connect  to  rest  of  the  world."And  in  an  increasingly  global  marketplace,  the  U.S.  will  require  world-leading  airports  to  stay  competitive."Or,  by  now,  simply  to  catch  up  to  a  field  that  has  already,  by  many  estimates,  flown  far  ahead  of  them.And  the  world's  best  airport  is  ...</TEXT></DOC>

The  main  question  will  ask  whether  voters  want  the  region  to  secede  from  Ukraine  and  become  part  of  Russia.  Previously,  a  referendum  had  been  scheduled  for  March  30  on  the  less  politically  charged  question  of  whether  Crimea  should  have  greater  autonomy  within  Ukraine.If,  as  expected,  a  majority  endorses  secession,  the  story  will  change  overnight  from  one  about  Russia's  unprovoked  military  invasion  to  one  about  a  minority's  right  to  self-determination.  That  is  the  Kremlin's  plan.European  leaders,  already  having  trouble  agreeing  on  a  response  to  naked  aggression,  will  find  it  much  harder  to  oppose  the  popular  will  of  the  Crimean  people.  At  that  point,  risky  actions  to  force  Crimea  back  into  Ukraine  will  become  difficult  for  Western  politicians  to  explain  to  their  own  domestic  voters.The  legal  status  of  the  planned  referendum  is  more  than  murky.  Ukrainian  acting  president  Oleksandr  Turchynov  has  called  it  a  "farce"  and  a  "crime  against  the  nation."  But,  for  democratic  politicians  --  and  the  societies  they  represent  --  going  against  a  majority  vote  is  never  easy.If  Russia  can  change  the  subject  in  this  way,  Crimean  secession  will  become  an  established  fact.  Putin,  who  assured  journalists  on  Tuesday  that  Russia  did  not  mean  to  annex  Crimea,  will  then  be  able  to  claim  that  he  was  "forced  to  yield  to  the  will  of  the  people."With  just  a  few  days  to  turn  the  situation  around,  temporizing  needs  to  stop.  Allowing  Russia  "more  time"  at  this  point,  as  some  European  leaders  have  proposed,  is  exactly  what  the  West  should  not  do.  That  Russia's  Crimean  clients  have  moved  the  referendum  date  forward  suggests  nervousness  in  Moscow  --  and  a  recognition  that  time  is  of  the  essence.In  the  remaining  time  before  March  16,  the  West  must  convince  both  the  Kremlin-connected  Russian  elite  and  the  population  of  Crimea  that  the  region's  secession  to  Russia  would  be  a  mistake.  Direct  threats  are  counterproductive,  but  clearly  and  calmly  articulating  the  consequences  of  such  a  move  can  produce  results.First,  all  the  European  Union  states  plus  the  United  States  should  make  absolutely  clear  that  they  will  not  recognize  the  results  of  a  referendum  held  while  armed  bands  of  "self-defense  forces"  roam  Crimea.  Any  decision  to  secede  that  results  from  such  a  referendum  will  be  considered  illegitimate.To  increase  Moscow's  isolation,  it  is  worth  exploring  whether  a  large  majority  would  support  a  resolution  in  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly  --  of  course,  Russia  would  veto  in  the  Security  Council  --  reasserting  the  inviolability  of  borders  in  this  case.Second,  the  EU  and  U.S.  should  announce  that  economic  relations  would  be  frozen  between  the  West  and  a  Crimea  in  legal  limbo  following  secession.  In  part,  this  freeze  would  be  enforced  by  the  markets  themselves.Crimea's  tourism  industry  would  have  to  forget  about  attracting  Western  visitors  to  the  region's  beaches.  International  investors  would  demand  huge  risk  premiums.  But  Western  restrictions  on  investment  and  trade  with  Crimea  could  amplify  the  effect.  The  region's  agricultural  produce  could  be  banned  from  European  and  Ukrainian  markets.Crimeans  must  be  helped  to  understand  the  choice  they  face:  between  becoming  another  Abkhazia  --  a  failed  statelet  on  intravenous  drip  from  Moscow  --  or  a  flourishing  region  within  the  new,  broader  Europe.  The  EU  should  quickly  earmark  some  portion  of  the  11  billion  euros  already  promised  to  Ukraine  for  projects  to  develop  Crimea's  economy  if  it  remains  Ukrainian.Third,  the  United  States  should  work  out  a  set  of  restrictions  to  place  on  Russian  banks  and  corporations  that  do  business  in  a  Crimea  that  has  illegally  seceded.  As  economist  Anders  Aslund  has  pointed  out,  existing  rules  against  money  laundering  could  be  enforced  more  rigorously  against  various  Russian  entities.All  of  this  needs  to  be  done  rapidly.  While  Washington  has  reacted  quickly  as  the  crisis  unfolded,  the  EU  has  suffered  from  its  chronic  lack  of  central  decision-making  authority.  The  next  few  days  constitute  a  test.If  Brussels  cannot  forge  a  strong,  common  position  in  time,  then  management  of  future  crises  will  simply  revert  to  the  foreign  ministries  of  Germany,  France,  and  Britain,  with  the  EU's  foreign  policy  role  narrowed  to  coordinating  long-term  policies.While  spelling  out  the  costs  that  threaten  the  Crimean  population  and  the  Russian  political  elite,  Western  leaders  must  continue  to  devise  "off-ramps"  to  outcomes  that  Putin  could  conceivably  accept,  but  that,  nevertheless,  will  not  be  seen  as  rewarding  aggression.The  West  can  call  for  a  significant  increase  in  Crimea's  political  autonomy  within  Ukraine,  negotiated  with  Kiev.  U.S.  and  European  leaders  should  also  speak  out  far  more  audibly  in  favor  of  minority  language  and  cultural  rights.  They  should  have  responded  with  outrage  when  the  Rada,  Ukraine's  parliament,  canceled  the  status  of  Russian  as  an  official  language  and  should  now  praise  the  promised  veto  of  this  law.It  may  still  be  possible  to  prevent  the  illegal  annexation  of  Crimea.  Putin  is  sensitive  to  the  danger  of  splits  within  his  political  elite.  The  West  must  show  him  that  he  has  underestimated  the  extent  of  political  isolation  and  economic  disruption  that  annexation  would  cause.  It  must  work  on  winning  the  hearts  and  minds  of  the  Crimean  population.

I  thought  it  was  a  giant  joke  at  my  expense,"  said  the  prolific  actor  Saturday  during  a  talk  at  the  South  by  Southwest  Interactive  festival  here.  "I  appreciate  it  now.  But  I  was  very  resistant  to  it  (at  first)."The  game,  which  celebrates  its  20th  anniversary  this  year,  requires  players  to  link  celebrities  to  Bacon,  in  as  few  steps  as  possible,  via  the  movies  they  have  in  common.  The  more  odd  or  random  the  celebrity,  the  better.  For  example,  O.J.  Simpson  was  in  "The  Naked  Gun  33⅓"  with  Olympia  Dukakis,  who  was  in  "Picture  Perfect"  with  Kevin  Bacon.Inspired  by  "six  degrees  of  separation,"  the  theory  that  nobody  is  more  than  six  relationships  away  from  any  other  person  in  the  world,  the  game  was  dreamed  up  in  1994  by  Brian  Turtle  and  two  classmates  at  Albright  College  in  Reading,  Pennsylvania.  They  were  watching  "Footloose"  on  TV  when  it  was  followed  by  another  Kevin  Bacon  movie,  and  then  another."It  was  just  one  of  those  lightbulb  moments,"  said  Turtle,  who  joined  Bacon  onstage  at  SXSW.  "It  was  like,  'This  guy  is  everywhere!  He's  the  center  of  the  entertainment  universe.'  "After  it  spread  among  their  friends,  Turtle  and  his  co-creators,  Craig  Fass  and  Mike  Ginelli,  managed  to  get  booked  on  Jon  Stewart's  then-MTV  show  to  explain  the  game.Meanwhile,  Bacon  was  becoming  aware  of  it,  too."I  started  to  kind  of  hear  about  it  in  strange  ways,"  said  the  actor,  still  boyish  at  55.  "People  would  come  up  to  me  and  touch  me  and  say,  'I'm  one  degree!'  I  didn't  really  know  what  was  going  on."Bacon  thought  the  game  would  be  a  fad.  But  it  endured,  and  he  eventually  embraced  it."I  don't  think  it's  a  great  testament  to  my  ability  (as  an  actor),"  he  said.  "My  movies  just  happen  to  be  on  a  lot."In  2007  Bacon  launched  SixDegrees.org,  a  charitable  organization  that  connects  celebrities  with  good  causes  for  fundraising  purposes.The  "Six  Degrees"  game  has  also  inspired  a  website,  The  Oracle  of  Bacon,  which  lets  people  type  in  any  actor's  name  to  see  how  closely  they  link  with  the  "Footloose"  actor.  The  site  assigns  each  celeb  a  "Bacon  number"  to  show  the  number  of  degrees  of  separation  between  the  two.Google  now  lets  users  type  "Bacon  number"  in  the  search  field,  followed  by  an  actor's  name,  to  produce  the  same  result.It's  rare  to  find  a  veteran  actor  who  is  not  linked  to  Bacon  in  some  way,  and  rarer  still  to  find  a  Bacon  number  of  4  or  higher.  It  helps  that  Bacon  has  appeared  in  more  than  65  movies,  including  many  with  large  ensemble  casts  such  as  "Diner,"  "Flatliners,"  "JFK,"  "A  Few  Good  Men,"  "Sleepers,"  "Mystic  River"  and  "X-Men:  First  Class."Bacon,  currently  filming  the  second  season  of  his  Fox  drama  "The  Following,"  admitted  Saturday  that  he  occasionally  needs  to  use  The  Oracle  of  Bacon  himself."Whether  it's  my  age  or  my  misspent  youth,  sometimes  I  forget  whether  I've  worked  with  somebody  or  not,"  he  said.  "I'll  look  at  the  call  sheet,  check  the  name,  and  then  I'll  check  their  Bacon  number.  That  way  I  can  go  on  the  set  and  say,  'Good  to  see  you,'  or  'Good  to  see  you  again.'"Several  other  celebrities  with  tenuous  ties  to  Bacon  joined  him  onstage  Saturday,  including  actress  Felicia  Day,  who  noted  that  "'Six  Degrees  of  Kevin  Bacon'  is  really  the  idea  of  social  media  before  there  was  social  media."The  talk  closed  with  fellow  panelist  Lance  Ulanoff,  editor  of  tech  site  Mashable,  shooting  a  Vine  video  of  Bacon  with  the  audience  waving  in  the  background.  That  way,  Bacon  said,  everyone  in  attendance  in  Austin  is  now  just  one  degree  of  separation  away  from  him.Assange  to  SXSW:  We're  all  being  watched</TEXT></DOC>

Previously,  you  could  work  around  Twitter's  lack  of  image  tags  by  just  mentioning  people  from  the  photo  in  the  tweet  itself.  But  with  precious  few  characters  to  work  with,  that  could  gobble  up  a  lot  of  tweet  real  estate,  especially  if  you  were  taking  crowded  group  selfies.Image  tagging  is  not  an  original  idea.  Facebook  has  offered  photo  tagging  features  for  a  long  time  and  Instagram  added  its  own  photo-tagging  option  last  year.Twitter  also  is  now  making  it  possible  to  pack  more  images  into  messages  with  a  new  collage  option  that  lets  you  share  up  to  four  photos  in  a  single  tweet.  Select  the  images  and  it  will  tile  them  into  a  neat  rectangle.  Previously  you  would  need  a  third-party  app  to  make  a  collage.These  are  just  the  latest  features  to  make  the  jump  between  major  social  networks,  which  happily  borrow  the  most  popular  aspects  of  competing  services.  Last  summer,  Facebook  copied  one  of  Twitter's  best  features  when  it  added  clickable  hashtags  to  its  newsfeed,  and  it  tried  to  clone  Snapchat  with  its  Poke  application.  When  Twitter  added  short,  6-second  videos  with  its  Vine  service,  Instagram  quickly  followed  suit  with  15-second  videos.The  new  Twitter  image  tags  won't  count  against  a  tweet's  140-character  limit.  Any  tagged  images  will  pop  up  under  the  Interactions  tab,  just  like  regular  tweets  in  which  you  are  mentioned.Twitter  is  rolling  out  the  new  features  to  users  starting  with  its  Android  and  iPhone  apps.  Once  you  have  the  new  powers,  you  can  start  identifying  friends  in  images  by  selecting  an  image  and  then  hitting  the  "who's  in  this  photo?"  link  below  it.If  you're  not  comfortable  being  tagged  in  images,  immediately  take  a  trip  to  the  Twitter  privacy  settings.  The  default  setting  for  the  photo  tagging  is  "Allow  anyone  to  tag  me  in  photos."  It  can  be  changed  so  that  only  people  you  already  follow  can  tag  you,  or  it  can  be  turned  off  completely.  It's  also  easy  to  untag  yourself  from  any  photos.  Tap  the  three  dots  below  the  tweet  and  select  "Remove  tag  from  photo."People  who  have  their  Twitter  accounts  set  to  private  can  only  tag  people  who  follow  them,  and  the  default  privacy  setting  for  protected  accounts  is  to  not  allow  people  to  tag  them  in  images  at  all.  If  you've  blocked  someone  on  Twitter,  they  cannot  tag  you.</TEXT></DOC>

But  imagine  first  spending  months  or  years  going  from  doctor  to  doctor,  trying  to  figure  out  what's  wrong.  Then,  in  the  end,  being  diagnosed  with  a  disease  few  people  have  ever  heard  of.Now  think  about  all  that  happening  when  you're  just  a  kid.Nearly  30  million  people  in  the  United  States  have  a  rare  disease.  What  qualifies  something  as  a  rare?  It's  a  specific  disease  or  disorder  that  affects  fewer  than  200,000  Americans,  according  to  the  National  Institutes  of  Health's  Office  of  Rare  Diseases  Research.  Scientists  have  identified  more  than  6,800  of  these  diseases  worldwide.In  honor  of  Rare  Disease  Day,  CNN  asked  readers  to  submit  their  stories.  We  were  inspired  by  these  children  living  with  rare  diseases.  They  endure  stares,  disbelief  and  debilitating  symptoms  as  they  find  joy  in  life's  simple  pleasures.  Here  are  a  few  of  their  stories:Mitochondrial  myopathyThe  fact  that  Sam  Brinneman,  16,  is  alive  and  well  is  inspiring  all  on  its  own,  says  his  mom,  Chris.  The  Brinnemans  knew  something  was  wrong  within  days  of  Sam's  birth  --  he  had  a  weak  cry,  wasn't  nursing  well  and  was  "floppy,"  Chris  says.  It  took  three  years  for  doctors  to  diagnose  Sam  with  mitochondrial  myopathy.Since  then,  Sam  has  exceeded  everyone's  expectations.  He's  currently  a  sophomore  at  a  rigorous  college-prep  high  school  in  Fort  Wayne,  Indiana.  He  participates  on  the  school's  speech  team  and  in  architecture  club.  Last  year  he  was  the  state's  Goodwill  Ambassador  for  the  Muscular  Dystrophy  Association."He  was  so  deathly  ill  at  times  as  an  infant  and  toddler,  that  he  constantly  amazes  me  with  his  abilities,"  Chris  said.  "The  thing  that  makes  me  most  proud  is  the  fact  that  he  teaches  acceptance  wherever  he  goes.  Because  he  is  so  open  about  his  disease  and  so  willing  to  share,  he  has  rarely  --  next  to  never  --  been  teased  by  his  peers."Sam  struggles  on  a  daily  basis  to  get  enough  calories  for  optimal  nutrition.  He  wears  a  breathing  machine  to  bed  to  treat  his  sleep  apnea.  His  parents  are  diligent  about  keeping  him  away  from  sick  people,  as  his  immune  system  is  weak.Yet  Sam  never  uses  his  disease  as  an  excuse,  his  mom  says.  "He  has  spoken  with  groups  of  all  sizes,  spreading  the  message  about  (mitochondrial  diseases),  including  the  need  for  quicker  diagnosis,  the  need  for  treatment  and  the  hope  for  a  cure."Read  more  about  Sam's  story  on  iReportCyclic  vomiting  syndrome"I  never  expected  my  little  girl  to  have  to  fight  a  battle  with  a  foe  she  couldn't  see,"  Tricia  Andersen  said.  But  when  her  daughter,  Ali,  was  13  months  old,  she  started  throwing  up  and  couldn't  stop.  For  a  day  and  a  half,  Tricia  watched  as  Ali  retched  painfully  and  was  admitted  to  the  hospital  for  dehydration.  When  she  was  discharged  the  vomiting  episodes  continued  --  every  three  weeks  like  clockwork.After  a  year  of  doctors'  visits,  Ali  was  finally  diagnosed  with  cyclic  vomiting  syndrome.  It  took  the  family  another  six  months  and  a  trip  to  another  state  to  find  a  medication  combination  that  would  work  to  ease  her  symptoms.  Even  then,  she  was  hospitalized  half  a  dozen  times  by  the  time  she  was  9.Ali  is  now  11  years  old,  and  doesn't  let  CVS  dictate  her  life,  Tricia  says.  She  does  robotics  at  school,  plays  basketball  and  participates  in  several  track  and  field  events,  even  though  she  has  to  wear  an  ice  vest  to  keep  her  body  temperature  from  getting  too  high."She  gets  involved  with  the  activities  that  make  her  happy,"  her  mom  said.  "[This]  allows  her  to  be  a  'normal'  kid  despite  having  a  chronic  illness.  Having  CVS  is  a  part  of  her  life,  not  what  controls  it."Read  more  about  Ali's  story  on  iReportCutaneous  mastocytosisWhen  Kellie  and  Josh  Ewell  saw  their  baby,  Gage,  for  the  first  time,  they  were  shocked."His  sweet  body  [was]  covered  from  the  tip  of  his  head  to  the  soles  of  his  feet  with  blisters,  hives,  knots,  and  raw  places  where  the  blisters  had  come  open,"  Kellie  wrote  on  iReport.  "His  skin  the  texture  of  an  orange  and  fire-engine  red."Gage,  now  2,  has  pediatric  diffuse  cutaneous  mastocystosis.  An  overabundance  of  mast  cells  in  his  body  causes  severe  allergic  reactions  to  just  about  everything.  His  skin  turns  purple,  he  struggles  to  breathe  and  his  parents  can  only  watch  as  he  tears  at  his  skin,  trying  to  find  some  relief.  He  is  in  constant  pain,  Kellie  says.Despite  his  illness,  Gage  is  "a  little  boy  anxious  to  learn  and  explore  the  world,"  his  mom  said.  He  loves  people,  laughing,  playing  outside  and  with  the  family  boxer,  Colt.  He  has  never  known  a  life  without  itching,  aches  or  pains,  but  doesn't  let  that  stop  him."I  want  him  to  be  anything  that  he  wants  to  be  and  go  after  any  dream  that  he  has,"  Kellie  said.  "I  never  want  him  to  hold  back  out  of  fear  of  what  might  happen."Read  more  about  Gage's  story  on  iReportArthrogryposis  multiplex  congenitaKailen  Carpenter  is  a  ladies'  man.  The  12-year-old  learned  early  that  women  love  to  help  him  with  things  like  carrying  his  lunch  tray  or  holding  his  hand  as  he  climbs  steps  --  and  takes  full  advantage  of  their  companionship.Kailen  was  diagnosed  with  arthrogryposis  multiplex  congenita,  a  condition  that  affects  joint  movement,  shortly  after  birth.  The  condition  was  caused  by  his  cramped  quarters  next  to  his  twin  in  utero,  his  mom  Kayawna  says.His  arms  are  locked  in  a  straight  position.  He  cannot  bend  his  arms  to  put  on  his  clothes,  use  a  knife  and  fork,  comb  his  hair  or  touch  his  face.  Yet  he  teaches  everyone  around  him  the  meaning  of  perseverance,  she  says.He's  also  a  terrific  dancer  and  a  nearly  straight-A  student."This  is  an  able-bodied  world,  and  people  like  me  have  to  learn  how  to  live  in  it,"  Kailen  said.  "I  can't  move  like  you  do,  but  I  hold  my  own...  (People)  should  take  every  day  and  live  it  like  you're  awesome.  I  do."Read  more  about  Kailen's  story  on  iReportLeukodystrophyMRI  scans  of  Ryan  Wright's  brain  show  he  has  the  white  matter  of  a  6-month-old  baby.  Yet  he  speaks  in  five-  to  six-word  sentences,  rides  his  bike  and  goes  to  preschool.Ryan  is  4  years  old.He  was  recently  diagnosed  with  a  rare  form  of  leukodystrophy,  a  progressive  genetic  disorder  that  affects  the  development  of  myelin  in  his  brain.  Myelin  is  fatty  tissue  that  protects  the  brain's  nerve  fibers.  The  disorder  affects  Ryan's  balance  and  muscle  strength,  and  causes  hand  and  eye  tremors.His  parents  try  to  keep  his  life  as  normal  as  possible  in  between  therapy  sessions.  He  sees  an  eye  doctor  every  three  months,  and  a  neurologist  and  geneticist  every  six  months."It  is  very  hard  to  tell  the  prognosis  for  children  with  leukodystrophy,"  his  mom,  Tricia,  said.  "Some  children  stay  the  same  for  the  rest  of  their  lives,  some  children  decline  fast,  and  some  children  decline  slow."Ryan  never  gives  up,  Tricia  says,  and  is  fiercely  independent.  His  geneticist  says  these  traits  will  keep  Ryan  healthy  longer.Read  more  about  Ryan's  story  on  iReportJuvenile  dermatomyositisTristan  Coffey  is  5  years  old.  In  July,  he  developed  a  mysterious  rash  on  his  hands.  Three  months  later,  he  was  diagnosed  with  juvenile  dermatomyositis,  a  rare  autoimmune  disorder.His  immune  system  is  attacking  itself,  causing  painful  inflammation  in  his  joints,  muscles  and  internal  organs.  The  Coffeys  call  it  the  "invisible  illness"  because  except  for  the  rashes  on  Tristan's  hands  and  feet,  there  is  little  obvious  to  the  eye."Everyone  looks  at  him  and  says  'Oh,  he  looks  so  great,'  but  they  can't  see  his  body  attacking  his  heart,  or  his  liver,  or  his  veins,  or  his  muscles,"  his  mom  Brianna  said.  "They  can't  see  how  much  he  is  in  the  hospital,  all  that  he  endures,  all  the  treatments."Juvenile  dermatomyositis  is  treatable,  but  not  curable.  Tristan  takes  11  to  14  medications  a  day.  He  has  a  catheter  port  in  his  chest  for  weekly  steroid  infusions  and  monthly  IVIg  therapy.  These  medications  cause  huge  mood  swings,  and  limit  Tristan's  ability  to  be  outdoors  in  the  sun.Despite  all  this,  Tristan  is  always  first  in  line  to  play  soccer  and  at  the  playground  with  his  friends.  He's  also  one  of  the  funniest  kids  you'll  ever  meet,  Brianna  says.  "He  will  always  light  up  a  room,  the  hospital,  the  grocery  store  --  wherever  we  may  be."He's  also  super  sensitive  to  other  people's  feelings,  she  says.  "Occasionally  he  will  catch  me  crying.  He  will  put  his  little  hands  on  my  cheeks  and  wipe  away  my  tears  and  say  "Mom,  I  just  love  you  and  I'm  going  to  be  OK.  Don't  cry,  Mom."Read  more  about  Tristan's  story  on  iReport</TEXT></DOC>

Playing  in  3,775  theaters,  most  of  which  were  in  3-D,  "LEGO"  scored  an  incredible  $18,307  per  location  average,  and,  including  overseas  profits  ($18.1  million  from  34  territories),  "The  LEGO  Movie"  has  already  stacked  up  $87.2  million.'The  Lego  Movie':  Did  it  make  you  cry?"The  LEGO  Movie"  is  Warner  Bros.'  first  animated  release  in  three  years.  Village  Roadshow  co-financed  the  pic.  Featuring  the  vocal  talents  of  Chris  Pratt  as  Emmet  the  construction  worker,  Will  Ferrell  as  the  evil  Lord  Business,  Elizabeth  Banks  as  the  brilliant  Wyldstyle,  Liam  Neeson  as  Bad  Cop,  and  Will  Arnett  as  Batman,  "LEGO"  resonated  with  both  adults  and  children  —  60  percent  of  the  audience  was  over  18  years  old.  A  sequel  is  reportedly  already  in  the  works.But  it  wasn't  just  families  and  kids  who  headed  out  to  the  theaters  this  weekend.  George  Clooney's  $70  million  WWII  pic  "The  Monuments  Men"  (CinemaScore:  B+)  exceeded  expectations  and  took  in  an  estimated  $22.7  million  from  3,083  locations.  Based  on  a  true  story,  "The  Monuments  Men"  follows  a  team  tasked  with  recovering  art  from  the  Nazis  and  returning  it  to  their  rightful  owners  and  stars  Clooney,  Matt  Damon,  Bill  Murray,  John  Goodman  and  Cate  Blanchett.  The  audience  was  divided  fairly  evenly  (48  percent  male),  and  75  percent  of  attendees  were  over  35  years  old.The  Sony  release,  from  Columbia  Pictures  and  Fox  2000  Pictures,  boasted  a  $7,363  per  screen  average,  which  put  it  solidly  in  between  "Argo's"  ($19.5  million)  and  "Captain  Phillips'"  ($25.7  million)  opening  weekends.  After  all  the  fuss  around  the  delayed  release,  it  seems  that  pushing  "Monuments  Men"  out  of  the  holidays  (and  awards  season)  was  the  best  thing  it  could  have  done  in  terms  of  earnings  and  mustering  up  an  undistracted  audience.  It's  also  an  all-time  high  opener  for  Clooney  as  a  director  --  "The  Ides  of  March"  opened  at  $10.5  million  and  "Leatherheads"  at  $12.7  million.Jennifer  Aniston  gets  in  line  for  'Cake'The  Kevin  Hart/Ice  Cube  comedy  "Ride  Along"  fell  21.9  percent  from  last  weekend  and  snagged  the  third  place  spot  after  three  weekends  at  No.  1  with  $9.4  million.  This  places  the  PG-13  rated  $25  million  Universal  pic  at  a  $105.2  million  domestic  total.  Universal  had  success  opening  2013′s  "Identity  Thief"  in  the  early  part  of  the  year.  That  film  went  on  to  net  about  $134.5  million  after  17  weeks  in  theaters  (11  on  over  1,000  screens).  "Ride  Along"  could  definitely  beat  that.  For  Hart's  starring  roles,  crossing  $100  million  is  a  career  high,  too.  "Think  Like  a  Man"  topped  out  at  $91.5  million  in  2012.  Hart  has  three  more  releases  slated  for  this  year,  including  next  weekend's  "About  Last  Night."Disney's  "Frozen"  picked  up  throughout  the  weekend  to  take  the  fourth  place  spot  with  an  estimated  $6.91  million,  bringing  its  domestic  total  to  a  mind-blowing  $368.7  million.  The  animated  musical  dropped  22.6  percent  from  last  weekend  —  which  is  still  incredibly  impressive  considering  the  stiff  competition  from  the  "LEGO"  opening.  Globally,  "Frozen"  passed  the  $900  million  mark  this  past  weekend,  making  it  the  28th  highest  grossing  film  of  all  time  and  the  fourth  highest  grossing  animated  release.John  Green's  favorite  fan  reactions  to  'The  Fault  in  Our  Stars'  trailerFinally,  "That  Awkward  Moment"  continues  to  have  modest  success  in  its  second  weekend  in  theaters,  dropping  36.6  percent  from  its  disappointing  Super  Bowl  weekend  opening.  In  fifth  place,  the  Zac  Efron,  Miles  Teller,  and  Michael  B.  Jordan  bromantic  comedy  earned  about  $5.54  million,  for  a  $16.85  million  domestic  total.1.  "The  Lego  Movie"  —  $69.11  million2.  "The  Monuments  Men"  —  $22.7  million3.  "Ride  Along"  —  $9.4  million4.  "Frozen"  —  $6.91  million5.  "That  Awkward  Moment"  —  $5.54  millionOutside  of  the  top  five,  poor  "Vampire  Academy"  (CinemaScore:  B)  opened  to  a  dismal  $4.1  million  this  weekend  on  2,767  screens.  The  Weinstein  Company  needed  at  least  double-digit  earnings  to  consider  franchise  potential,  but  it  looks  like  Richelle  Mead's  series  will  go  the  way  of  recent  big  screen  YA  disappointments  such  as  "Beautiful  Creatures"  and  "The  Mortal  Instruments."See  the  original  story  at  EW.com.CLICK  HERE  to  Try  2  RISK  FREE  issues  of  Entertainment  Weekly©  2011  Entertainment  Weekly  and  Time  Inc.

Last  week,  a  text  message  was  blasted  to  frequent  customers  noting  that  "new  sexy  &  beautiful  girls  R  in  town  waiting  for  u."  The  enterprise  also  ran  numerous  advertisements  on  the  Internet  and  on  public  access  television.Last  year  alone,  the  ring  made  $3  million  dollars  in  credit  card  sales,  authorities  said.Schneiderman  said  the  ring  involved  thousands  of  clients  and  hundreds  of  prostitutes,  primarily  women  from  Korea  brought  by  ring  members  to  the  United  States."Every  two  months  they  would  bring  in  a  new  wave  of  girls  and  they  increased  the  importation...  because  of  the  increase  in  demand  that  accompanies  the  Super  Bowl,"  Schneiderman  told  CNN's  Deborah  Feyerick.Schneiderman  said  authorities  were  identifying  the  sex  trafficking  victims  "to  try  to  get  them  out  of  this  cycle  of  captivity,  poverty  and  abuse.""This  is  not  viewed  any  longer  as  a  victimless  crime,"  he  said.  "This  is  viewed  as  something  where  woman  are  seized  in  their  own  countries,  they're  blackmailed  and  held  in  captivity.  This  is  a  crime  with  a  lot  of  victims.  We  are  approaching  these  cases  now  by  identifying  the  woman  as  victims,  not  perpetrators."Intercepted  conversations  involving  the  ring  revealed  that  it  used  various  code  names  for  cocaine,  including  "party,"  "jewelry,"  "powder,"  "maek"  and  "Soojaebi,"  a  Korean  noodle  and  vegetable  soup,  the  statement  said.  The  prostitutes  delivered  the  cocaine  to  the  customers  in  what  was  referred  to  as  a  "party  pack."The  enterprise  allegedly  generated  millions  of  dollars  in  illegal  proceeds  and  planned  to  target  high-end  clientele  coming  to  the  New  York  area  for  the  Super  Bowl  this  weekend.The  11-month  investigation  involved  undercover  investigators,  physical  and  electronic  surveillance  and  reviews  of  business  records,  the  statement  said.  The  attorney  general's  Organized  Crime  Task  Force  and  the  New  York  Police  found  that  the  criminal  enterprise  spanned  Manhattan,  Brooklyn,  Long  Island,  Queens  and  several  states.  The  operation  was  based  in  Manhattan.Customers  were  charged  for  sex  and  drugs  as  a  package  deal,  "sometimes  billing  for  cocaine  in  an  equivalent  number  of  'hours'  of  prostitution,"  the  statement  said.The  ring  commonly  supplied  customers  with  large  quantities  of  drugs  to  get  them  impaired,  authorities  said.  Then  the  room  would  be  flooded  with  additional  prostitutes,  and  the  customer's  credit  cards  would  be  charged,  at  times  upward  of  $10,000  for  one  night.  Through  front  businesses,  the  ring  would  charge  credit  cards  for  goods  and  services  not  actually  provided  in  order  to  hide  the  purchases  of  cocaine  and  sex.Most  of  the  18  suspects  were  arrested  but  some  were  still  being  sought.

However,  Kerry's  initial  goal  of  an  agreement  by  the  end  of  April  has  morphed  into  a  possible  framework  for  further  talks  through  the  end  of  2014.Psaki  said  Kerry  decided  it  would  be  productive  to  return  to  the  region  this  week  after  consulting  with  a  U.S.  team  that  is  negotiating  with  the  Israelis  and  the  Palestinians  to  end  their  decades-long  conflict."Over  the  course  of  the  last  eight  months,  the  Israelis  and  Palestinians  have  both  made  tough  choices,  and  as  we  work  with  them  to  determine  the  next  steps,  it  is  important  they  remember  that  only  peace  will  bring  the  Israeli  and  Palestinian  people  both  the  security  and  economic  prosperity  they  all  deserve,"  Psaki  said.Kerry's  trip  comes  after  President  Barack  Obama  hosted  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Benjamin  Netanyahu  and  Palestinian  Authority  President  Mahmoud  Abbas  for  separate  White  House  talks  earlier  this  month.While  both  sides  have  signaled  agreement  with  the  concept  of  a  two-state  solution,  in  which  Israel  and  an  independent  Palestinian  nation  would  live  side  by  side,  they  remain  at  odds  over  how  to  make  that  happen.Areas  of  disagreement  include  borders,  security  issues,  the  status  of  Jerusalem,  and  the  rights  of  Palestinians  who  left  or  fled  their  homes  in  what  is  now  Israel.READ:  John  Kerry  defies  the  odds  with  intense  drive  for  Middle  East  peaceREAD:  Time  running  out  for  even  a  framework  for  Middle  East  talksCNN"s  Tom  Cohen  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Are  you  two  compatible  under  the  covers?Ask  yourself  these  four  questions:1.  Are  you  awakened  more  than  once  each  night  by  snoring,  bathroom  trips,  accidental  jabs  or  night  talking?2.  Do  you  two  go  to  sleep  and  wake  up  at  different  times?3.  Would  you  describe  your  overall  sleep  habits  --  length  of  sleep,  nap  habits,  comfort  needs  --  as  different  from  your  partner's?4.  During  the  night,  do  you  yell  something  like,  "Please  for  the  love  of...!"  on  a  regular  basis?If  you  answered  yes  to  two  or  more  questions,  read  on.upwave:  14  tips  for  better  sleepIn  my  case,  I  answered  all  four  questions  with  a  maniacal  YES.  My  husband  and  I  are  now  happy  newlyweds,  but  I  discovered  two  months  after  shacking  up  with  him  that  I  was  dreading  the  nightly  wake-ups  when  he  slid  into  bed  two  hours  after  me.  I  awoke  for  his  every  bathroom  trip,  and  when  he  tossed,  I  turned.  I  pleaded  defeat  to  his  habit  of  leaving  his  phone  on  overnight  --  we're  recent  West  Coast  transplants,  which  means  that  East  Coast  friends  regularly  call  at  6:15  a.m.  (Typical  voice  mail:  "Oh  shoot  man,  it's  really  early  there,  isn't  it.  I  forgot.  But  anyway...")Before  our  marriage,  I  had  considered  my  sleep  habits  to  be  unremarkable:  I  prefer  a  dark  quiet  room  where  no  one  moves  or  makes  noise  for  eight  hours.  This  is  not  my  husband's  M.O.  He  opens  doors  and  turns  on  lights  (albeit  quietly).  His  morning  motto  is,  "Why  hit  snooze  once  when  you  could  hit  it  five  times?"  He  eventually  developed  a  term  for  my  anger:  "sleep  hostility."upwave:  Is  the  snooze  button  bad  for  you?And  so  I  moved  out.  Out  of  the  room,  that  is,  and  into  the  guest  bedroom.  I  painted  it  a  decidedly  feminine  shade  of  purple,  and  went  there  to  get  some  sleep.  Real  sleep,  especially  on  nights  I  really  need  it,  like  before  career-changing  presentations  or  early-morning  meetings.  Done.  I  sleep  there  two  or  three  nights  a  week.I  can't  say  enough  positive  things  about  the  two-bedroom  solution.  First  off,  our  sex  life  has  only  improved;  since  we  miss  each  other,  sleeping  in  my  husband's  room  now  truly  feels  like  a  date.  Now  that  I  enjoy  eight  hours  of  uninterrupted  sleep  at  least  twice  a  week,  my  mood  is  better  --  and  so  is  our  quality  of  life.  The  separate  room  also  allows  me  a  place  to  talk  full  volume  on  the  phone,  or  bite  my  nails  over  late-night  deadlines.  In  short:  It's  my  woman  cave.My  husband  and  I  are  far  from  the  only  sufferers  of  dysfunctional  couples'  sleep.  William  Dement,  a  physician  and  professor  of  psychiatry  and  behavioral  science  at  Stanford  University  who  holds  doctorates  in  physiology  and  sleep  medicine,  suggests  that  the  first  step  to  addressing  your  sleep  woes  is  to  identify  what,  specifically,  is  waking  you  up."Sleep  disturbances  are  highly  individual,"  he  says.  "The  same  things  that  don't  bother  some  people  really  do  bother  others."  Keep  a  pad  and  paper  next  to  your  bed  and  write  down  what  jolts  you  awake.  Kicking?  Snoring?  Bathroom  trips?  Talking?  Cold?  Overheating?  Cuddling  gone  wrong?upwave:  Is  sleeping  separately  better  for  some  couples?If  your  awakenings  come  from  physical  jostling,  consider  a  larger  bed.  "We've  done  studies  with  couples,  and  if  the  bed  is  big  enough,  there  really  is  no  disturbance  at  all,"  says  Dr.  Dement.  "But  if  they're  not  able  to  afford  a  king  or  even  a  queen-size  bed,  when  someone  rolls  over,  it  disturbs  the  other  person."If  the  culprit  is  noise,  consider  an  age-old  solution.  "Really  good  ear  plugs  handle  many  problems,"  says  Dement.  Temperature  issues  can  be  solved  with  his-and-her  comforters.And  if  all  else  fails,  head  to  your  own  room  --  preferably  along  with  a  white  noise  machine  like  those  frequently  seen  in  therapists'  offices,  which  also  happens  to  muffle  toilet  flushes,  all  manner  of  canine  tomfoolery  and  husbands  sticking  their  heads  into  your  cave  to  see  if  you  want  to  have  a  little  late-night  date...This  article  was  originally  published  on  upwave.com.©  2013  upwave,  All  Rights  Reserved.</TEXT></DOC>

Why?  Because  they  are  wonderful—and  they  work.Real  Simple:  Don't  sweat  the  small  stuffWhether  their  formulas  have  changed  with  the  times  or  stayed  delightfully  the  same,  these  12  miracle  workers  deserve  a  permanent  place  in  the  medicine  cabinet.SkinEstée  Lauder  Advanced  Night  Repair:  Introduced  in  1982,  this  one-of-a-kind  serum  gave  new  meaning  to  the  term  "beauty  sleep."  The  formula,  which  is  hyaluronic  acid--based,  is  said  to  help  enhance  skin's  natural  renewal  process,  which  peaks  at  nighttime.Calgon  Bubble  Bath:  With  an  unforgettable  1960s  ad  campaign  ("Take  me  away!"),  Calgon's  fragrant  soaks  introduced  the  concept  of  bathroom  as  sanctuary.FYI:  The  company  started  out  as  a  water-softener  brand  in  1933.  The  name  Calgon  is  derived  from  "CALcium  GONe."Real  Simple:  Relax  more,  stress  lessQ-tips:  In  1923  Leo  Gerstenzang  conceived  the  idea  of  a  "ready  to  use"  cotton  swab  after  watching  his  wife  wrap  cotton  around  a  toothpick  to  clean  their  baby's  ears.  The  swabs'  uses  continue  to  evolve,  as  in  the  introduction  of  Q-tips  Precision  Tips  in  2011.  "Q-tips  were  my  first  beauty  tool.  I've  used  them  on  everyone  from  my  babies  to  Beyoncé,"  says  Mally  Roncal,  the  creator  of  Mally  Beauty.Dove  Beauty  Bar:  Soap  dates  back  to  at  least  600  B.C.,  but  until  1957,  when  the  Dove  Beauty  Bar  was  introduced,  it  was  always  considered  drying.  Touted  as  the  first  soap-free  cleanser  on  the  market,  the  Dove  bar  was  innovative  in  that  it  cleansed  without  stripping  skin.FYI:  It  is  Dove's  best-selling  product  globally,  with  more  than  1.2  billion  sold  annually.Vaseline:  In  1870,  after  watching  oil  riggers  use  a  paraffin-like  wax  to  help  heal  their  burns,  Robert  Chesebrough  introduced  "Vaseline  Petroleum  Jelly"  to  the  public.FYI:  In  the  1920s,  movie  stars  used  Vaseline  on  their  teeth  to  help  them  shine  on-screen.ChapStick:  In  the  1800s,  Charles  Browne  Fleet  created  the  first  ChapStick  by  wrapping  lip  balm  in  foil.  Now  it  comes  in  four  classic  flavors  (plus  limited  editions,  like  Citrus  Jelly  Bean).Real  Simple:  How  to  do  relaxation  breathingFYI:  During  the  Watergate  break-in,  empty  tubes  of  ChapStick  were  used  to  conceal  microphones.Oil  of  Olay  Beauty  Fluid:  In  the  early  1950s,  a  chemist  named  Graham  Wulff  and  his  wife,  Dinah,  developed  a  new  kind  of  facial  moisturizer  that  was  meant  to  mimic  sebum.  Ironically,  in  2000  the  "Oil  of"  was  dropped  to  represent  the  light  texture  of  the  lotion  more  accurately.Pond's  Cold  Cream:  With  50  percent  moisturizer,  this  cream  cleanser  removes  makeup  while  providing  hydrating  comfort.  Since  1905  the  all-in-one  product  has  amassed  a  cult  following  that  spans  generations  of  women.FYI:  In  2010  sales  in  the  United  Kingdom  quadrupled  after  pop  star  Kylie  Minogue  gave  it  her  seal  of  approval.Aquaphor:  Introduced  in  1945,  the  balm  was  first  used  as  a  base  for  preparing  other  emulsions.  It  was  revamped  as  a  multipurpose  salve  and,  in  1998,  became  known  as  the  "Healing  Ointment"  that  we  use  today.FYI:  It  has  just  seven  (fragrance-free)  ingredients.Real  Simple:  How  to  feel  better  every  dayCetaphil  Gentle  Skin  Cleanser:  Since  1947  this  mild  wash  has  remained  a  dermatologist  favorite.  Soap-  and  fragrance-free,  the  gentle  formula  (developed  by  a  pharmacist)  is  safe  for  all  skin  types  and  is  now  available  in  travel-friendly  cloths.Clinique  Facial  Soap  Bar:  Born  in  1968,  this  now  ubiquitous  cleansing  bar  was  (and  still  is)  part  of  the  three-step  skin-care  system  Clinique  is  famous  for.  Formulated  by  dermatologists,  the  bar  creates  a  soft,  nondrying  lather.FYI:  A  liquid  version  was  introduced  in  2006.Bioré  Strips:  Launched  in  1997,  the  strips  were  a  first  of  their  kind  to  remove  blackheads  without  squeezing.  The  secret?  Special  ingredients  that  bond  to  dirt  and  oil  trapped  in  pores.  "Using  Bioré  Strips  was  such  a  horrific  yet  liberating  experience,"  says  Jerrod  Blandino,  the  cofounder  of  Too  Faced  cosmetics.HairNora  Ephron  once  said  that  the  secret  upside  of  death  was  not  having  to  worry  about  your  hair  anymore.  These  seven  stalwarts  have  helped  grace  legions  of  fans  with  hair  they  can  live  with  (and  even  love).Real  Simple:  The  psychology  of  social  mediaAquaNet:  Dubbed  the  "all-weather  hair  spray,"  this  product  is  famous  for  providing  a  firm,  lasting  hold  in  any  climate.FYI:  AquaNet  is  prominently  featured  in  a  memorable  scene  in  1989's  When  Harry  Met  Sally...,  where  Meg  Ryan's  Sally  sets  her  hair  on  a  car  trip  to  New  York  City.Dippity-do:  Invented  in  1965  for  setting  curls,  the  gel,  with  its  unique,  jellylike  texture,  later  gained  popularity  among  young  men.  Subsequently  the  packaging  went  from  a  jar  to  a  blue  squeeze  bottle,  which  can  still  be  found  on  shelves  today.FYI:  When  he  was  a  teen,  the  late  rocker  Eric  Carr,  of  Kiss,  reportedly  drenched  his  hair  in  Dippity-do  and  pulled  a  stocking  over  his  head  before  bed  in  an  attempt  to  get  his  curly  hair  to  lie  flat,  like  the  Beatles'.Johnson's  Baby  Shampoo:  In  1953,  more  than  60  years  after  Johnson  &  Johnson  first  sold  baby  powder,  the  family-friendly  company  introduced  a  mild  shampoo  for  kids.  The  unique  formula,  later  trademarked  as  "No  more  tears,"  gently  cleans  hair  without  soap  and  doesn't  sting  the  eyes.FYI:  An  updated  formula,  free  of  formaldehyde-releasing  preservatives,  hit  shelves  in  early  2014.John  Frieda  Frizz-Ease:  This  serum  was  the  first  to  target  frizz  on  hair  of  any  texture.  "When  Frizz-Ease  came  out,"  says  hairstylist  Harry  Josh,  "it  instantly  became  a  staple  in  every  stylist's  kit.  Decades  later  it's  still  an  essential  part  of  my  arsenal."Clairol  Professional  Shimmer  Lights  Shampoo:  Predating  the  explosion  of  color-enhancing  and  preserving  shampoos  and  conditioners,  this  instant  classic  has  been  around  for  more  than  30  years,  keeping  hair  of  all  shades  (blond,  brunet,  red,  and  gray)  vibrant.Aveda  Shampure:  Featuring  25  pure  flower  and  plant  essences,  this  aromatic  hair  cleanser  has  a  soothing  scent  that  has  since  become  a  signature  for  the  brand  and  its  many  spa  locations.FYI:  Each  year  100  million  gallons  of  Shampure  are  purchased  worldwide.Herbal  Essences  Shampoo:  You  may,  ahem,  recall  the  commercials.  In  fact,  the  "organic  experience"  shampoo  did  have  green  beginnings,  at  least  in  a  literal  sense:  The  original  formula  was  green  in  color  and  had  a  woodsy  scent  unlike  that  of  any  other  product.Makeup  and  fragranceApply  the  right  color,  spritz  on  a  sublime  scent,  and  you'll  not  only  look  and  smell  ready  to  take  on  your  day—you'll  also  feel  it.  These  items  continue  to  provide  us  with  transformative  experiences.Coty  Airspun  Face  Powder:  In  1935  beauty  pioneer  François  Coty  helped  design  a  pretty  tin  for  his  scented  loose  powder.  Oil-  and  fragrance-free  formulas  have  been  introduced  since  then,  but  the  charming  powder  puff--adorned  package  remains  virtually  the  same.White  Diamonds  Elizabeth  Taylor:  As  an  homage  to  the  rocks  she  loved,  the  actress  sought  to  provide  women  with  a  sense  of  "sparkle  and  uplift"  each  time  they  sprayed  on  her  perfume.FYI:  Since  its  launch  in  1991,  it  remains  one  of  the  most  successful  celebrity  fragrances  of  all  time.Chanel  No.  5:  Setting  out  to  create  a  scent  for  the  modern  women  for  whom  she  designed  clothing,  Coco  Chanel  enlisted  the  help  of  Ernest  Beaux,  a  perfumer  who  worked  for  the  Russian  royal  family.  After  several  months,  Beaux  presented  Chanel  with  an  array  of  samples,  and  she  picked  one  corresponding  to  her  lucky  number,  five.MAC  Cosmetics  Lip  Pencil  in  Spice:  Praised  as  the  "perfect  nude"  by  countless  makeup  artists,  this  toffee  lip  pencil  first  gained  popularity  in  the  1990s,  when  supermodel  Linda  Evangelista  publicly  professed  her  devotion.  Because  of  its  ongoing  popularity,  the  pencil  is  a  part  of  MAC's  permanent  collection.  It  can  be  worn  alone  or  as  a  base  to  warm  up  cool-toned  lip  colors.Maybelline  New  York  Great  Lash  Mascara:  Introduced  in  1971,  it  is  sold  once  every  1.3  seconds  in  the  United  States.FYI:  Maybelline  is  a  mix  of  Mabel  (sister  of  the  company's  founder)  and  Vaseline  (an  ingredient  in  the  first  modern  mascara).Laura  Mercier  Secret  Camouflage:  This  concealing  duo  (one  shade  matches  your  skin;  the  other  matches  your  undertones)  provides  natural-looking  coverage.FYI:  It  was  inspired  by  a  treatment  Mercier  discovered  through  a  plastic  surgeon  to  minimize  redness  from  burns.Dr.  Pepper  Lip  Smacker:  In  1973  Jess  Bell  created  the  first  flavored  lip  gloss.  Forty  years  and  800-plus  flavors  later,  the  balms  are  still  a  fan  favorite.  "Whenever  I  went  to  the  store  with  my  mom,  I  would  sneak  one  into  the  basket  and  coyly  ask,  'How  did  that  get  in  there?'  "  says  Kerry  Cole,  the  style  director  of  Becca  Cosmetics.Which  of  these  products  have  you  used?

The  show's  fourth  season  kicks  off  on  PBS  on  Sunday,  and  1922  promises  to  be  another  scandal-filled  time  for  the  Crawley  family  and  their  busy  staff.The  season  just  ended  in  the  UK,  but  now  American  fans  will  have  their  chance  to  get  wrapped  up  in  the  latest  drama  brewing  within  those  British  walls.  Season  3  brought  us  tragic  deaths,  new  additions  to  the  family  and  staff,  and  Shirley  MacLaine.  What  will  the  next  set  of  episodes  hold?Here  are  the  five  things  we  are  looking  forward  to  over  the  next  eight  weeks:1.  How  will  Lady  Mary  move  on  from  tragedy?Season  3  ended  with  a  bang.  Hours  after  Lady  Mary  gave  birth  to  a  son,  her  husband,  Matthew,  was  killed  in  a  car  crash.  Season  4  picks  up  six  months  after  the  accident,  and  we  will  find  out  how  the  eldest  of  the  Crawley  siblings  is  handling  life  as  a  widowed  mother.  Is  she  still  in  mourning  or  working  to  find  the  perfect  suitor?  Mary's  biggest  plight  in  the  series  has  been  her  search  for  the  right  man,  and  now  she's  got  to  consider  picking  it  up  again,  this  time  with  a  small  piece  of  baggage.  Perhaps  she  will  devote  all  her  time  and  energy  to  her  new  son.  Or  will  she  resent  the  child  as  a  constant  reminder  of  her  lost  love?Matthew  was  in  the  midst  of  making  changes  at  Downton  to  help  the  Abbey  regain  its  financial  footing,  and  now  his  wife  must  take  on  those  duties.  Our  guess  is,  the  warmth  brought  out  by  Matthew  has  since  frozen  over.  Expect  to  see  the  cold,  emotionally  closed-off  Mary  we  knew  so  well  at  the  beginning  of  the  series.  Also,  we  will  almost  certainly  see  Mary  don  nothing  but  black.  She  is  in  mourning,  after  all.2.  Diversity  at  Downton!That's  right,  after  three  seasons,  we  will  finally  see  a  person  of  color  on  the  show!  Downton  has  never  been  known  for  its  diversity,  but  viewers  know  social  change  is  on  the  horizon.  It  was  only  a  matter  of  time  before  it  creeps  into  those  hallowed  halls.  While  Diddy's  casting  may  have  been  nothing  more  than  a  Funny  or  Die  joke,  season  4  will  in  fact  include  the  show's  first  recurring  black  character.  Gary  Carr  has  been  cast  as  a  charismatic  jazz  singer  and  will  hopefully  give  us  a  glimpse  into  the  characters'  feelings  about  the  changing  face  of  race  in  the  1920s.  With  Cousin  Rose's  penchant  for  jazz  clubs  revealed  in  the  finale,  it's  a  safe  bet  the  two  will  cross  paths  this  season.3.  Will  this  be  the  last  we  see  of  Cousin  Isobel?With  Matthew  gone,  what  does  that  mean  for  his  dear  mother?  Isobel  has  played  a  major  part  in  the  series  since  her  son's  introduction  in  season  1.  Now  that  we  must  get  used  to  life  without  Matthew,  how  much  longer  will  we  get  to  spend  with  the  family  he  brought  with  him?  Fans  will  surely  get  a  glimpse  into  Isobel's  grieving  period  since  the  huge  loss.  It  will  be  interesting  to  see  whether  she  remains  a  lead  character  on  the  series  with  only  a  grandson  connecting  her  to  Downton.  With  Mary  inevitably  trapped  in  a  state  of  depression,  perhaps  it  will  be  Isobel  who  comes  to  her  rescue  and  helps  raise  the  newborn  heir.4.  How  much  time  will  we  have  to  spend  with  Cousin  Rose?Viewers  were  introduced  to  Lady  Rose  at  the  tail  end  of  season  3,  and  the  rebellious  teen  didn't  make  the  best  impression.  She  had  been  invited  to  stay  at  Downton  while  her  parents  travel  to  India.  If  the  previews  are  anything  to  go  by,  we're  going  to  see  much  more  of  the  troublemaker  in  coming  episodes.  With  a  dark  cloud  still  hanging  over  the  Abbey  after  the  shocking  deaths  of  both  Matthew  and  Lady  Sybil,  Rose  might  provide  a  much-needed  bright  spot  to  the  house.5.  What's  next  for  Downton's  downstairs?Season  3  wrapped  with  most  of  Downton's  downstairs  players  riding  cloud  nine.  Bates  and  Anna  have  become  the  show's  most  loving  pair  since  the  former's  release  from  prison.  Daisy,  Alfred  and  Ivy  became  involved  in  an  innocent  love  triangle.  Even  the  conniving  Thomas  made  peace  with  those  he's  wronged.  The  finale  gave  the  staff  a  chance  to  get  out  of  their  uniforms  and  spend  some  time  bonding  in  the  sun.Expect  some  major  changes  within  the  hard-working  team  in  the  new  season.  A  major  player  will  be  taking  time  away  from  Downton,  making  room  for  a  few  shakeups.  Since  Branson's  been  living  as  a  widower  for  nearly  two  years,  the  former  chauffeur  may  have  to  pay  special  attention  to  the  latest  addition.  And  with  Molesley  now  jobless,  Matthew's  former  butler  and  valet  will  be  in  search  of  new  work.Did  we  mention  fans  can  expect  both  special  guest  star  Paul  Giamatti  and  another  helping  of  Shirley  MacLaine  in  the  roles  of  Harold  Levinson  and  his  mother,  Martha?  There's  nothing  we  look  forward  to  more  than  one-liner  standoffs  between  Martha  and  the  Dowager  Countess.  There's  never  a  dull  moment  at  Downton!</TEXT></DOC>

Don  Prince  told  CNN.Bieber's  representatives  declined  to  comment  when  contacted  by  CNN.If  investigators  find  enough  evidence  that  Bieber,  19,  threw  the  eggs  that  splattered  against  his  next-door  neighbor's  home,  they  could  refer  the  matter  to  the  district  attorney's  office  for  possible  prosecution,  Prince  said.The  cost  of  repairing  the  damage  to  the  house  is  a  key  factor  in  determining  the  severity  of  the  charge.  It  could  be  felony  vandalism  if  the  eggs  caused  more  than  $950  in  damage,  he  said.The  Oaks,  an  exclusive  gated  community  in  Calabasas,  California,  is  at  the  center  of  the  accusations.  Bieber  moved  into  a  $6.5  million  mansion  there  two  years  ago.  An  impressive  list  of  the  rich  and  famous  --  including  Michael  Jackson's  mother  and  children  --  live  in  the  neighborhood,  about  30  miles  west  of  downtown  Los  Angeles.His  neighbors  have  complained  about  Bieber  several  times  in  the  past  year,  including  in  May  when  two  neighbors  called  the  sheriff  to  report  he  was  speeding  down  residential  streets,  a  sheriff's  spokesman  said.Deputies  visited  Bieber's  home  in  response,  but  the  singer  refused  to  talk  to  them,  sheriff's  department  spokesman  Steve  Whitmore  said.Retired  NFL  star  Keyshawn  Johnson  went  to  Bieber's  home  then  to  counsel  him  about  the  dangers  of  going  too  fast  on  the  residential  streets,  but  Bieber  wouldn't  speak  to  him,  Johnson's  rep  told  CNN  in  May.A  neighbor  accused  Bieber  of  spitting  on  him  and  making  threats  during  a  heated  confrontation  outside  his  home  last  March,  Whitmore  said.  It  prompted  a  sheriff's  probe,  but  no  charges  followed.CNN's  Carolyn  Sung  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Where  once  ticket  prices  included  checked  baggage,  inflight  meals  and  seat  selection,  increasingly,  those  items  are  add-ons  geared  towards  generating  extra  income  for  carriers.According  to  a  recent  survey  by  Fly.com,  there  are  actually  some  luxuries  passengers  are  willing  to  shell  out  for  --  they're  just  not  always  in  line  with  what  airlines  actually  charge."Overall,  fees  are  here  to  stay,  and  as  we  continue  to  see  a  debundling  of  fares,  passengers  will  increasingly  be  asked  to  pay  for  various  services  that  previously  they  didn't,"  says  Warren  Chang,  vice  president  and  general  manager  of  Fly.com."There's  an  overall  perception  that  consumers  feel  they're  being  nickel  and  dimed,  and  it's  important  for  airlines  to  express  what  value  they  are  presenting."Give  passengers  what  they  wantAccording  to  Fly.com's  survey,  the  most  widespread  fees  are  also  some  of  the  least  popular.While  U.S.  airlines  collected  $2.5  billion  from  checked  baggage  fees  between  January  and  September  2013,  89%  of  respondent  said  it's  important  for  them  to  be  able  to  check  their  bag  for  free.Also,  with  the  exception  of  Hawaiian  Airlines,  all  U.S.  carriers  now  charge  for  in-flight  meals  on  domestic  flights,  even  though  nearly  half  of  those  surveyed  classified  free  food  as  an  important  perk.If  airlines  dropped  these  fees,  they  could  recoup  in  other  areas.  Fly.com  also  found  that  20%  of  respondents  would  pay  for  a  first  class  meal  in  coach  class,  a  service  that  few  carriers  offer."In  my  view,  that's  something  that  would  be  a  real  win-win  for  the  airlines.  It  doesn't  devalue  first  class,  as  people  aren't  just  paying  for  the  meal,  but  for  the  exclusivity,  for  more  space,  for  better  service  and  amenities.  First-class  meals  would  enhance  the  flying  experience  in  coach  without  detracting  from  the  experience  in  first,"  he  adds.Put  it  in  the  binCramped  storage  space  is  not  only  a  headache  for  passengers,  it's  poses  a  financial  loss  for  carriers  as  well.While  customers  malaise  through  the  aisles,  holding  up  boarding  in  an  attempt  to  fit  their  carry-ons  on  the  plane,  airlines  are  losing  money  (slow  boarding  costs  them  approximately  $10  million  yearly).  Increasingly,  airlines  have  started  charging  for  carry-on  luggage,  a  fee  that  is,  understandably,  not  popular  with  passengers.Frequent  flyers  have  another  solution  in  mind.  Rather  than  pay  to  bring  luggage  on-board,  they'd  rather  spend  extra  for  roomier  overhead  bins.  Of  those  surveyed,  42%  said  this  is  a  service  they  would  happily  splurge  on."No  airline  allows  you  to  buy  designated  overhead  bin  space,  but  based  on  our  findings,  it's  definitely  something  they  should  consider,"  says  Chang.Why  wi-fi?While  airlines  are  investing  heavily  in  upgrading  their  systems  to  offer  passengers  wi-fi,  many  of  those  surveyed  expressed  it's  not  really  a  feature  that  matters  to  them.  Only  30%  said  they  would  pay  extra  for  wi-fi,  a  number  that  surprised  Chang."With  large  populations  having  their  own  smart  phones,  I  would  have  thought  they'd  want  to  bring  their  own  entertainment  systems  on  board,  but  that  wasn't  something  our  survey  found,"  he  says.A  little  extra  for  comfortAs  plane  seats  continue  to  shrink,  it's  probably  no  surprise  that  most  fliers  are  willing  to  pay  for  a  little  extra  room.Nearly  90%  of  passengers  said  they  wanted  more  comfortable  seats,  and  45%  said  they'd  pay  for  extra  legroom.  A  good  chunk  were  willing  to  go  even  further;  34%  of  travelers  would  pay  to  prevent  the  seat  in  front  of  them  from  reclining  and  26%  would  pay  to  have  an  empty  middle  seat  next  to  them.Some  of  the  perks  respondents  wanted  would  be  a  challenge  for  airlines  to  implement:  13%  of  those  polled  said  they'd  pay  to  have  control  of  their  armrests,  4%  said  they'd  shell  out  for  the  right  to  control  the  window  shade,  and  4%  said  they'd  pay  to  be  first  in  line  for  the  restrooms.Read:  Airlines  auction  off  business  class  seatsRead:  Making  the  most  of  your  frequent  flier  programRead:  American  Airlines  ends  bereavement  fares</TEXT></DOC>

Most  were  minted  in  San  Francisco.Coincidence?Sure  is,  said  Adam  Stump,  spokesman  for  the  U.S.  Mint."We  do  not  have  any  information  linking  the  Saddle  Ridge  Hoard  coins  to  any  thefts  at  any  United  States  Mint  facility,"  he  told  CNN.The  spokesman  was  responding  to  the  latest  wave  of  speculation  that  kicked  off  after  The  San  Francisco  Chronicle  published  a  report  Monday,  suggesting  a  turn-of-the-century  heist  could  explain  the  possible  provenance  of  the  coins.Separately,  Stump  told  the  newspaper:  "We've  done  quite  a  bit  of  research,  and  we've  got  a  crack  team  of  lawyers,  and  trust  me,  if  this  was  U.S.  government  property  we'd  be  going  after  it."The  coins  from  the  1901  heist  were  never  found.The  so-called  Saddle  Ridge  Hoard  was  discovered  by  a  husband  and  wife  in  February  2013  on  their  property  in  Northern  California.Though  the  coins  have  a  face  value  of  approximately  $28,000,  experts  believe  they  could  fetch  in  excess  of  $10  million.The  treasure  is  known  as  the  Saddle  Ridge  Hoard  because  it  was  discovered  near  a  hill  the  couple  called  Saddle  Ridge.A  golden  mysteryThe  husband  and  wife  were  walking  their  dog  when  they  spotted  something  metal  on  the  ground.  They  dug  and  eventually  discovered  eight  metal  cans,  containing  more  than  1,400  gold  coins.Restoring  and  cleaning  the  coins  has  taken  months.No  one  knows  how  they  got  there,  or  whom  the  coins  might  have  belonged  to.Don  Kagin,  of  Kagin's,  Inc.,  is  assisting  the  owners,  who  wish  to  remain  anonymous."The  best  theory  is  that  --  and  this  is  collaborated  somewhat  with  doing  some  research,  title  searches,  etc.  from  back  in  1800s  --  that  someone  in  the  mining  business,  as  he  got  his  remuneration,  his  bonuses,  whatever,  he  would  take  the  gold  from  the  banks  and  put  it  into  the  ground  in  these  cans,"  he  told  CNN."Back  then,  they  didn't  always  trust  the  banks."Kagin  dismissed  the  idea  that  the  coins  could  be  connected  to  the  turn-of-the-century  heist."If  you  had  robbed  the  U.S.  Mint  in  1901,  you'd  have  1901,  1900,  1899  coins.  But  instead  what  you  have  here  are  coins  from  1894  and  before,"  he  said."We  vetted  this  long  time  ago.  We  know  the  story  of  Dimmick.  The  only  thing  that  is  remotely  similar  is  the  amount  of  value."The  coins,  in  $5,  $10  and  $20  denominations,  date  from  1847  to  1894.  Many  are  in  pristine  condition,  including  at  least  14  coins  that  are  considered  the  finest  known  for  their  date  and  mint  mark.A  highlight  from  the  hoard  is  an  1866-S  No  Motto  Double  Eagle,  valued  at  close  to  $1  million."Nothing  resonates  like  buried  treasure,"  Kagin  said,  as  a  smile  broke  across  his  face.  "These  are  not  just  coins,  but  they  are  artifacts.  They  tell  a  story  ...  They  speak  to  us.  It's  like  holding  history  in  your  hands."The  couple  is  planning  to  sell  most  of  the  collection.  Some  will  be  sold  on  Kagin's  website,  but  most  on  Amazon,  probably  in  May."Unlike  other  hoards  and  treasures,  this  one  includes  a  great  variety  of  coins  struck  over  many  different  years,  and  many  of  the  coins  are  still  in  pristine  condition,"  Kagin  said."And  add  to  that  a  wonderful  human  interest  story:  this  family  literally  found  the  pot  of  gold  at  the  end  of  the  rainbow."These  coins  could  change  historyRare  coin  collection  set  to  make  a  mintBought  for  $3  at  yard  sale,  bowl  sells  for  $2.2  millionFisherman  hooks  statue  of  ancient  Greek  god  ApolloCNN's  Dan  Simon  and  Steve  Forrest  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

"The  real  pain  is  in  my  heart  and  that  will  take  a  long  time,  if  ever,  to  get  over."Reeves,  71,  got  into  an  altercation  with  Chad  Oulson  because  he  was  texting  the  couple's  babysitter  during  the  previews  for  "Lone  Survivor,"  police  said.The  6-foot-1,  270-pound  Reeves,  who  was  also  with  his  wife  for  the  matinee  at  the  Grove  16  Theatre  in  suburban  Tampa,  left  the  auditorium,  apparently  to  complain  to  management,  police  said.  Reeves  returned  "irritated,"  a  witness  said.  The  argument  continued  and  popcorn  was  thrown.According  to  the  incident  report,  Reeves  told  police  he  was  hit  with  an  "unknown  object"  in  the  face,  and  then,  fearing  he  was  being  attacked,  pulled  a  handgun  from  his  pocket  and  shot  Chad  Oulson.In  aftermath  of  shooting,  heroes  responded"It  was  a  couple  of  words.  No  threats.  No  harm.  No  nothing,"  Nicole  Oulson  said  on  ABC.  "We're  both  very  respectful  when  the  movie  is  on,  that  we  put  our  phones  away,  so  he  took  a  couple  of  seconds  just  to  check  the  phone  to  make  sure  there  were  no  messages  about  our  daughter."A  defense  attorney,  who  tried  and  failed  to  get  a  judge  to  grant  the  Reeves  bail,  said  that  the  former  police  officer  was  the  victim  and  that  Chad  Oulson  was  the  agressor.Nicole  Oulson's  attorney,  TJ  Grimaldi,  dismissed  that  idea.It  shouldn't  matter  what  Chad  Oulson  threw  at  Reeves,  the  attorney  told  CNN."There  is  absolutely  no  reason  that  this  should  have  escalated  to  the  level  that  it  did,  especially  as  quickly  as  it  did,"  the  attorney  told  "Good  Morning  America."Couple  describes  encounter  with  Curtis  Reeves</TEXT></DOC>

But  others  didn't  always  see  her  pain  the  same  way.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  When  Chris  Doheny  met  Sarah  Fox,  he  was  uncharacteristically  hopeful  about  the  future  --  a  successful  double  lung  transplant  in  June  2010  to  help  with  his  cystic  fibrosis  meant  things  were  looking  up,  Fox  says.She  was  also  hopeful;  Fox  had  recently  been  on  the  "the  worst  Internet  date  of  all  time"  when  she  met  the  Georgetown  University  grad  at  a  concert  through  mutual  friends.But  after  two  years  of  dating  Fox,  Doheny,  31,  died  in  February  2013  due  to  complications  from  cystic  fibrosis."We  had  talked  about  a  future,  and  I  think  that  Chris  knew  more  than  I  did  that  we  didn't  have  one,"  Fox  says.  "I  was  maybe  a  little  naïve."Fox  has  one  word  to  describe  Doheny's  death:  devastating.Unmarried  companions  can  face  the  same  grief  and  desolation  that  a  husband  or  wife  does  at  the  loss  of  a  partner.  But  the  suffering  of  a  girlfriend  or  boyfriend  may  be  minimized  by  others,  who  assume  it  shouldn't  last  so  long  or  hurt  so  deeply  --  as  in,  "Well,  he  was  only  your  boyfriend."Fox  says  the  "girlfriend"  label  has  been  a  particular  struggle  after  Doheny's  death:  "What  do  I  call  him  now?  He's  not  my  ex-boyfriend  because  we  never  broke  up,  but  he's  also  not  my  boyfriend."Fox  recalls  a  co-worker  telling  her:  "At  least  now  you  can  move  on  and  find  someone  else."Nancy  Berns,  a  sociology  professor  at  Drake  University  and  author  of  "Closure:  The  Rush  to  End  Grief  and  What  It  Costs  Us,"  advises  against  starting  any  statement  of  sympathy  with  "at  least.""They  think  they're  trying  to  help  by  minimizing  the  pain,  but  it  doesn't  affirm  that  you're  hurting  --  and  that  I  respect  that  you're  hurting,"  Berns  says.During  Doheny's  period  of  declining  health,  Fox  sought  out  a  grief  counselor  who  specialized  in  dealing  with  a  spousal  death  as  the  best  viable  option  --  a  step,  she  calls,  "extremely  helpful"  as  "it  was  very  stressful  to  watch  him  deteriorate."Berns  says  grief  is  a  normal,  healthy  response  to  a  loss  no  matter  the  relationship,  and  things  get  murky  if  the  depth  of  grieving  becomes  connected  to  how  long  a  relationship  endured  or  whether  it  was  legally  binding.She  added  that  our  culture  also  needs  to  eliminate  the  notion  that  grief  ends.  What's  more  helpful  is  learning  to  live  with  a  loss:  "Grieving  helps  us  identify  what  we  lost  and  express  the  love  that  we  had."Losing  a  unmarried  partner  in  the  public  eye  can  mean  a  greater  level  of  scrutiny  and  a  heightened  set  of  expectations.  The  public  wonders  how  a  celebrity  will  respond  to  such  a  loss  --  recent  examples  include  Lea  Michele  after  the  death  of  her  boyfriend  and  "Glee"  co-star  Cory  Monteith  and  Mick  Jagger  and  deceased  fashion  designer  L'Wren  Scott.In  her  first  televised  appearance  after  Monteith's  death,  Michele  dedicated  her  Teen  Choice  Award  to  him."For  all  of  you  out  there  who  loved  and  admired  Cory  as  much  as  I  did,  I  promise  that,  with  your  love,  we're  going  to  get  through  this  together,"  she  said  through  tears.Berns  says  the  heightened  attention  happens  in  part  because  other  people's  pain  is  uncomfortable,  even  taboo.  We  want  a  clean,  clear  statement  about  the  loss  and  reaction  from  the  surviving  half  of  a  well-known  couple  to  sew  up  the  narrative.  Instead  of  trying  to  hurry  the  grieving  process  up  or  tiptoe  around  it,  the  public  should  allow  people  to  grieve  and  speak  in  their  own  time.There  are  practical  matters,  too.  Some  unmarried  partners  leave  clear  instructions  on  how  to  include  loved  ones  in  family  decisions  after  their  passing,  such  as  a  last  will,  while  some  do  not.  The  latter  can  leave  a  boyfriend  or  girlfriend  adrift.Berns  notes  it  is  helpful  for  a  grieving  partner  when  the  family  allows  him  or  her  in  on  decisions  such  as  funeral  planning.  She  advises  those  who  have  lost  a  partner  to  make  clear  early  on  they  want  to  be  included  in  honoring  their  loved  one.Fox  says  she  had  a  good  relationship  with  Doheny's  parents  and  was  able  to  help  with  his  memorial.  The  couple  had  bonded  over  their  love  of  reading,  and  Doheny  left  behind  an  unpublished  novel.  So  Fox  helped  establish  the  Christopher  Doheny  Award  at  the  New  York  Mercantile  Library's  Center  for  Fiction,  which  is  granted  to  a  writer  who  has  dealt  with  a  life-threatening  illness  firsthand  or  via  a  close  relative  or  friend.Sometimes  it  helps  to  hold  onto  a  tangible  piece  of  a  relationship.In  September  2011,  Allen  "Skip"  Haughay  Jr.  and  his  horse  Regal  Bull  were  fatally  struck  by  a  pickup  on  the  way  to  a  party  a  half-mile  away  from  his  farm  --  leaving  behind  his  partner  of  almost  three  years,  Abel  Urbina.The  two  weren't  married.  They  wanted  to  wait  for  Proposition  8,  a  voter-approved  ballot  measure  that  made  same-sex  marriage  illegal  in  California,  to  be  overturned.  Haughay  did  not  have  a  will,  so  his  assets  went  to  his  mother,  who  did  not  want  to  keep  the  ranch  that  her  son  had  filled  with  horses,  pigs  and  donkeys.A  few  months  before  his  death,  Haughay  was  diagnosed  with  gastrointestinal  cancer  and  said  he  wanted  Urbina  to  take  care  of  the  animals  should  he  die.Urbina  ended  up  selling  his  place  in  downtown  San  Jose,  California,  and  buying  Haughay's  three-acre  property  in  nearby  Morgan  Hill  --  along  with  all  the  animals  --  to  honor  that  wish."And  they're  still  there,  they're  still  happy,"  Urbina  says.Berns,  the  sociologist,  says  if  you  can  embrace  or  reclaim  a  ritual  or  special  place,  such  as  the  farm,  it's  a  way  of  feeling  connected  that's  more  active  than  just  sitting  alone,  being  sad.For  Fox,  that  meant  carrying  a  tiny  portion  of  Doheny's  ashes  along  the  Camino  de  Santiago,  a  500-mile  hike  through  Spain  and  France.  As  his  health  deteriorated,  Doheny  asked  her  to  take  his  ashes  along  on  the  trek  after  he  passed  away  because  he  regretted  not  being  able  to  travel  with  her  more.Berns  says  that  moving  forward  --  whether  entering  a  new  relationship  or  just  going  out  and  having  fun  again  --  is  honoring  the  deceased  loved  one.Urbina  says  since  he  and  Haughay  weren't  married,  people  had  more  gumption  to  ask  when  he  would  date  again."You  have  to  move  on  when  you're  ready  to  move  on,"  he  says.  "I  need  to  move  on  because,  knowing  Skip,  he  would  not  have  wanted  me  to  curl  up  in  a  ball  and  cry  for  a  whole  year  and  be  miserable."Fox  says  she  and  Doheny  only  broached  the  subject  once."It  was  really  hard  for  Chris,"  she  says.  "He  obviously  wanted  me  to  be  happy,  but  he  really  wanted  it  to  be  with  him."Have  you  dealt  with  the  loss  of  a  partner?

An  aviator's  priorities  are  to  maintain  control  of  the  airplane  above  all  else.  An  emergency  could  easily  consume  100%  of  a  crew's  efforts.  To  an  airline  pilot,  the  absence  of  radio  calls  to  personnel  on  the  ground  that  could  do  little  to  help  the  immediate  situation  is  no  surprise.This  investigation  may  face  many  parallels  to  Air  France  447,  an  Airbus  A330  that  crashed  in  an  area  beyond  radar  coverage  in  the  ocean  north  of  Brazil  in  June  2009.  Like  the  Air  France  plane,  the  Malaysia  Airlines  aircraft  was  a  state-of-the-art,  fly-by-wire  airplane  (a  Boeing  777)  with  an  excellent  safety  record.The  Air  France  flight's  string  of  events  was  precipitated  by  onboard  faults  that  were  automatically  transmitted  to  the  airline's  headquarters  during  its  final  minutes.  While  they  lacked  any  flight  parameters,  these  maintenance  fault  messages  gave  key  clues,  though  not  a  definitive  cause  of  that  accident,  before  any  wreckage  was  found.Flight  data  recorders  are  keyThe  recovery  of  the  Malaysia  aircraft's  flight  data  and  cockpit  voice  recorders  would  be  important  in  determining  the  cause  of  the  accident.Flight  data  recorders  contain  data  from  more  than  1,000  aircraft  parameters,  including  altitude,  vertical  speed,  airspeed,  heading,  control  positions  and  parameters  of  the  engines  and  most  of  the  aircraft's  onboard  systems,  captured  several  times  per  second.  The  cockpit  voice  recorder  archives  the  last  hours  of  not  just  cockpit  voices  and  sounds  but  also  all  radio  and  onboard  inter-airplane  communications.A  multinational  team  of  expert  investigators  will  be  looking  far  beyond  just  the  flight  recorders.  The  detailed  history  of  the  flight  crew  and  the  airplane  will  be  closely  reviewed  as  well  who  was  traveling  on  two  reportedly  stolen  passports.Once  the  wreckage  is  located,  an  examination  of  the  debris  and  its  distribution  will  tell  investigators  if  the  airplane  was  intact  upon  impact  and  the  angle  at  which  it  hit.  Metallurgical  and  chemical  analysis  of  the  parts  will  determine  the  stresses  and  angles  that  caused  the  parts  to  fail,  and  if  explosives  were  present.  These  findings  of  fact  will  drive  the  creation  of  theories  by  investigators  about  what  caused  the  loss  of  the  airplane  and  its  passengers.As  an  example  of  investigators'  capabilities,  we  can  look  at  the  case  of  Pan  Am  103,  a  B-747  brought  down  over  Scotland  in  December  1988.  Investigators  were  able  to  identify  in  amazing  detail  the  sequence  of  events  and  even  the  individual  suitcase  and  radio  that  held  the  explosives  that  destroyed  the  airplane.Opinion:  When  passenger  jets  mysteriously  disappearDifficulty  of  the  searchMalaysia  Airlines  Flight  370's  route  heading  north  from  Kuala  Lumpur  was  over  sparsely  populated  and  heavily  forested  mountainous  areas  of  Malaysia  and  the  Gulf  of  Thailand.Reports  of  a  possible  course  reversal  observed  on  radar  could  be  the  result  of  intentional  crew  actions  but  not  necessarily.  During  Air  France  447's  3½-minute  descent  to  the  Atlantic  Ocean,  it  too  changed  its  heading  by  more  than  180  degrees,  but  it  was  an  unintentional  side  effect  as  the  crew  struggled  to  gain  control  of  the  airplane.The  distance  between  the  north  shore  of  Malaysia  and  the  southern  shore  of  Vietnam  of  250  miles  is  about  equal  to  the  distance  between  Philadelphia  and  Pittsburgh.  The  flight's  last  telemetry  data,  as  reported  by  flightaware.com,  shows  the  airplane  at  35,000  feet.Even  with  a  dual  engine  failure,  a  Boeing  777  is  capable  of  gliding  about  120  miles  from  that  altitude.  This  yields  a  search  area  roughly  the  size  of  Pennsylvania,  with  few  clues  within  that  area  where  remains  of  the  aircraft  might  be.The  visual  search  for  any  pieces  of  the  airplane  that  may  be  floating  or  visible  through  dense  jungle  is  under  way  and  indeed  a  daunting  task.In  the  case  of  the  Air  France  plane,  it  was  five  days  of  intensive  searching  before  the  first  floating  wreckage  was  found.  It  took  nearly  two  years  to  locate  the  remains  of  the  aircraft  on  the  ocean  floor  12,000  feet  below,  broken  into  thousands  of  pieces  by  the  impact  with  the  water.Location  of  the  wreckage  may  be  aided  by  underwater  locator  beacons  on  the  airplane's  flight  recorders,  if  they  have  not  been  damaged  in  the  impact  like  those  on  the  French  plane  were.In  contrast,  the  Gulf  of  Thailand  has  a  maximum  depth  of  only  260  feet,  with  the  average  being  about  150  feet.  If  the  aircraft  is  in  the  water,  it  should  make  recovery  easier  than  the  long  and  expensive  effort  to  bring  up  key  parts  of  the  Air  France  plane  from  the  2½-mile  deep  ocean,  where  most  of  the  airplane  and  many  of  its  victims  remain.The  wreckage  of  the  Air  France  flight  was  located  in  April  2011,  with  the  flight  recorders  recovered  and  analyzed  that  May.  The  cause  of  the  crash  was  the  crew's  loss  of  control  of  the  airplane  after  the  speed  sensor  probes  became  clogged  while  flying  through  a  storm  in  the  tropics.  It  caused  the  loss  of  reliable  airspeed  indications,  the  autopilot  to  disconnect  and  the  flight  controls  to  degrade.The  investigation  of  Malaysia  Airlines  Flight  370  will  be  sure  to  take  many  months,  if  not  years.  We  will  know  the  truth  of  what  happened  when  the  aircraft  is  found  and  the  recorders  and  wreckage  are  analyzed.  In  the  meantime,  speculation  is  often  inaccurate  and  unproductive.Follow  us  on  Twitter  @CNNOpinion.Join  us  on  Facebook/CNNOpinion.The  opinions  expressed  in  this  commentary  are  solely  those  of  Bill  Palmer.</TEXT></DOC>

Oh,  my!</TITLE><TIME>Mon,  27  Jan  2014  08:56:05  EST</TIME><ABSTRACT>We  all  feel  like  hibernating  this  winter,  staying  inside  and  curling  up  with  our  pets  and  a  cup  of  cocoa.  Yet  there  are  dogsledding  rides  to  take,  winter  elk  to  spot  and  drinks  to  toast  the  ugliest  bottom-feeding  fish  in  the  land.  Embrace  winter  on  these  10  animal  adventures.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  We  all  feel  like  hibernating  this  winter.The  arctic  chill  has  us  huddled  together  with  our  dogs,  cats  and  humans  on  sofas  across  the  land,  venturing  out  only  for  that  required  dog  walk.  Yet  the  brisk  air  is  invigorating  for  some  living  things  —  maybe  even  you.So,  party  with  your  dog,  toast  the  ugliest  fish  in  the  world  or  walk  into  the  wilderness  to  spot  bald  eagles  or  elk.  Here  are  10  animal-focused  ideas  for  winter:A  cold  water  plunge  for  your  poochDogs  and  humans  alike  get  to  dive  into  the  Atlantic  Ocean  during  the  Polar  Plunge  Festival  on  the  Rehoboth  Beach,  Delaware,  boardwalk  (January  31-February  2).  Don't  worry:  leashed  pooches  only  go  into  the  water  as  much  as  they  like.  The  $25  pooch  registration  fee  includes  an  official  Pooch  Plunge  dog  bandana.  This  Special  Olympics  fundraiser  also  includes  a  5K  Run  to  the  Plunge  and  an  ice  sculpting  demonstration.Run  those  huskies  into  the  woodsFor  a  more  active  experience  with  dogs  born  to  run,  head  to  Maine  for  your  introduction  to  dogsledding.  No  matter  that  you've  never  raced  in  the  Alaskan  Iditarod.  Even  kids  can  take  charge  of  the  dogs  during  these  February  half-day  adventures  into  the  Maine  wilderness,  which  includes  meeting  the  huskies,  a  15-  to  25-mile  mush  and  a  midday  stop  to  build  a  fire  and  feed  the  dogs.  There  are  also  full-day  and  even  two-day  programs.  Half-day  prices  start  at  $400  for  a  group  of  up  to  four  people.This  dog  race  really  countsWant  to  see  the  real  deal?  This  Valentine's  Day  weekend,  come  to  Helena,  Montana,  for  the  Race  to  the  Sky  qualifying  race  for  the  Alaskan  Iditarod.  The  350-mile  adult  race  starts  at  Camp  Rimini,  where  soldiers  and  sled  dogs  trained  during  World  War  II  and  winds  through  the  state's  Rocky  Mountains.  There's  also  a  100-mile  adult  race  and  a  100-mile  junior  race.  One  of  the  nonprofit  organizer's  missions  this  year  is  to  assist  groups  working  to  bring  retired  military  dogs  home.  The  host  town  of  Helena  also  turns  150  years  old  this  year,  so  it's  bound  to  be  an  even  bigger  party  than  usual.The  ugliest  fish  in  the  worldOne  of  the  ugliest  bottom-dwelling  fish  known  to  humans,  the  eelpout,  gets  its  own  festival  in  the  tiny  town  of  Walker,  Minnesota,  population  1,500.  Even  the  name  of  the  lake  --  Leech  --  is  ugly.  But  that  doesn't  stop  more  than  10,000  festival  participants  and  visitors  from  filling  the  town  from  February  20-23  for  the  2014  International  Eelpout  Festival.  Come  for  the  Eelpout  Fishfry  and  stay  for  the  Eelpout  Curling,  the  EelPout  500  races  or  the  fishing  show.A  more  refined  animal  spottingGet  up  early  to  see  elk  in  their  natural  habitat  near  Buckhorn  Lake  State  Resort  Park,  Kentucky.  The  tour  leaves  the  resort  for  the  elk  reserve  around  5:30  a.m.,  and  guests  should  bring  snacks,  cameras  and  binoculars  to  capture  their  elk.  The  tour  returns  to  the  resort  by  noon.  Head  to  the  resort  park  the  night  before  to  stay  the  night  and  attend  a  pre-tour  natural  history  program.  The  package  price  of  $90  per  single  or  $120  per  couple  includes  one  night's  room,  continental  breakfast  and  transportation  to  and  from  the  elk  preserve  the  next  morning.  The  tour  is  available  February  1,  2,  22  and  23.The  national  bird  soars  across  many  statesThe  American  bald  eagle,  the  official  bird  emblem  of  the  United  States,  loves  to  spend  the  winter  in  some  pretty  cold  states.  If  you're  in  the  middle  of  the  country,  head  to  Oklahoma's  Sequoyah  National  Wildlife  Refuge  to  spot  the  mighty  bird  or  Beavers  Bend  State  Park  to  find  bald  eagles  hunting  for  food,  fishing  or  nesting.  (There  are  sometimes  tours.)  In  Connecticut,  join  the  state  Audubon  Society  for  an  eagle-spotting  cruise.  In  the  upper  Midwest,  spot  bald  eagles  soaring  over  several  Illinois  towns.A  banner  year  for  this  Arctic  Circle  residentWe're  not  promising  that  you'll  spot  the  Snowy  Owl  at  Norman  Bird  Sanctuary  in  Rhode  Island.  But  it's  worth  a  try  this  February  to  find  the  elusive  Arctic  Circle  bird,  which  has  been  traveling  south  in  unusually  high  numbers  this  winter.  Bring  your  own  binoculars  to  the  sanctuary's  free  guided  bird  walks  on  February  2  and  February  16.  We  hear  from  Rhode  Island  officials  that  it  could  be  a  banner  year  for  sightings.Alaskan  animals  come  out  to  playMoose,  wolves  and  caribou  don't  sleep  through  Alaska's  long,  cold  and  dark  winter,  and  animal  spotters  have  a  special  treat  this  year:  The  National  Park  Service  will  plow  the  Denali  National  Park  &  Preserve  road  west  of  park  headquarters  in  mid-February,  a  month  earlier  than  usual  (and  the  earliest  it's  ever  been  opened)  so  winter  sports  enthusiasts  can  play  in  the  snow.  Party  with  the  community  surrounding  the  park  at  Winterfest  (February  21-23).Groundhog  Day  predicts  the  end  of  winterWant  to  know  when  winter  will  finally  end?  Join  the  crowds  on  the  walk  to  Gobbler's  Knob  to  spot  the  most  anticipated  winter  animal  of  all,  Punxsutawney  Phil.  He's  expected  to  appear  early  on  February  2,  Groundhog  Day,  to  let  the  world  know  how  much  more  winter  we  can  expect.  The  festival  marking  his  appearance  includes  breakfast  with  Phil  and  s'mores  with  the  Inner  Circle,  the  local  dignitaries  who  plan  Groundhog  Day  events  and  care  for  Phil.Saddle  up  for  the  rodeoYou  say  you're  done  with  winter  and  prefer  warm-weather  activity?  It  can  be  a  tad  warmer  in  San  Antonio  where  the  San  Antonio  Stock  Show  and  Rodeo  (February  6-23)  hosts  horse  and  livestock  shows,  auctions  and  sales  of  horses  and  other  livestock,  rodeo  performances,  exhibits,  a  carnival  and  concerts  after  the  show.

That  information  combined  with  known  radar  data  and  knowledge  of  fuel  range  leads  officials  to  believe  the  plane  may  have  made  it  to  that  ocean,  which  is  in  the  opposite  direction  of  the  plane's  original  route.That  possibility  is  the  latest  twist  in  a  case  that's  baffled  investigators  and  grabbed  global  attention  for  days.  Information  about  the  missing  flight  has  been  hard  to  come  by,  and  numerous  leads  have  been  revealed  by  some  officials  only  to  be  debunked  by  others  hours  later.There  are  conflicting  reports  about  this  latest  lead  as  well.Earlier  Thursday  the  Malaysian  government  denied  a  Wall  Street  Journal  report  that  the  plane  was  transmitting  data  after  the  last  transponder  signal.And  a  senior  aviation  source  with  detailed  knowledge  of  the  matter  also  told  CNN's  Richard  Quest  on  Thursday  that  there  was  no  technical  data  suggesting  the  airplane  continued  flying  for  four  hours,  and  said  specifically  that  the  Wall  Street  Journal  account  was  wrong.But  U.S.  officials  maintained  Thursday  afternoon  that  the  engine  data  was  being  actively  pursued  in  the  plane  investigation.There's  still  plenty  of  room  for  skepticism.The  Malaysians  haven't  determined  without  a  doubt  the  data  is  from  the  missing  flight,  according  to  the  senior  U.S.  official,  leaving  open  the  possibility  that  it's  a  reading  from  another  flight  that  was  nearby."It  appears  the  plane  was  flying  most  of  that  time,"  the  senior  U.S.  official  said.  The  "indication"  that  the  plane  kept  flying  is  not  based  on  U.S.  government  information  but  rather  based  on  radar  readings  and  plane  data.There  is  reason  to  believe  the  plane  flew  for  four  hours,  the  officials  said,  but  there  is  no  specific  indication  where  the  plane  actually  is.This  new  information  has  now  led  to  a  decision  to  move  the  USS  Kidd  into  the  Indian  Ocean  to  begin  searching  that  area,  the  official  said.The  Navy  destroyer  is  now  on  its  way  there  at  the  request  of  the  Malaysian  government,  Cmdr.  William  Marks  of  the  U.S.  7th  Fleet  told  CNN's  Wolf  Blitzer  Thursday."We're  not  out  here  freelancing,  and  it's  not  just  something  the  U.S.  Navy  thinks  and  no  one  else,"  Marks  said.  "So  this  was  by  request  of  the  Malaysian  government.  They  asked  the  Navy  to  move  our  ship  to  the  west  into  the  Strait  of  Malacca.  ...  It  is  coordinated,  but  certain  ships  and  aircraft  stay  in  the  east,  and  some  go  to  the  west.  And  we're  moving  to  the  west."Mary  Schiavo,  former  inspector  general  for  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation,  said  even  though  it's  unclear  how  accurate  the  latest  information  is,  authorities  have  no  choice  but  to  pursue  it."Well  I  think  basically  given  that  there  is  some  information  --  how  reliable  or  not  --  we  have  to  respond,"  she  said.  "There  is  no  way  we  cannot  follow  up  on  this  lead.  It  would  be  inhumane.  And  it  might  turn  out  to  be  just  the  lead  we  need.  ...  There  isn't  much,  but  I  think  we  have  to  do  it."So  are  we  any  closer  to  knowing  whether  a  mechanical  problem,  terrorism  or  hijacking  could  be  tied  to  the  plane's  disappearance?Not  really,  said  Evy  Poumpouras,  a  former  Secret  Service  agent."The  sad  thing  here  is,  we  don't  have  enough  information  to  say,  'It's  not  this,  it's  not  that,'"  she  told  CNN's  Don  Lemon.  "We're  still  at  the  point,  six  days  later,  it  could  be  anything,  and  that's  the  frustrating  thing."Engine  data  controversyMultiple  bursts  of  data  were  received  indicating  the  plane  was  flying  over  the  Indian  Ocean,  the  senior  U.S.  official  told  CNN.But  there's  another  confusing  twist.  An  emergency  beacon  that  would  have  sent  data  if  the  plane  was  about  to  impact  the  ocean  apparently  did  not  go  off,  the  official  said,  suggesting  perhaps  the  plane  was  still  likely  in  some  stable  flight  pattern  when  it  disappeared.White  House  spokesman  Jay  Carney  didn't  go  into  details  when  he  discussed  the  search  for  the  plane  Thursday,  but  he  said  "some  new  information  that's  not  necessarily  conclusive"  could  lead  U.S.  searchers  to  the  Indian  Ocean."We  are  looking  at  information,  pursuing  possible  leads,  working  within  the  investigation  being  led  by  the  Malaysian  government,  and  it  is  my  understanding  that  one  possible  piece  of  information  or  collection  of  pieces  of  information  has  led  to  the  possibility  that  a  new  search  area  may  be  opened,"  Carney  said.Originally,  a  report  from  The  Wall  Street  Journal  said  data  from  the  plane's  Rolls-Royce  engine  had  raised  questions  among  some  U.S.  officials  about  whether  the  plane  had  been  steered  off  course  "with  the  intention  of  using  it  later  for  another  purpose,"  the  newspaper  reported,  citing  a  "person  familiar  with  the  matter."The  newspaper  later  corrected  its  story,  saying  that  data  leading  investigators  to  believe  the  plane  had  flown  for  up  to  five  hours  came  from  the  plane's  satellite-communication  link,  which  the  newspaper  said  is  "designed  to  automatically  transmit  the  status  of  certain  onboard  systems  to  the  ground."Malaysia's  acting  Transportation  Minister  Hishammuddin  Hussein  rejected  the  Wall  Street  Journal  report  at  a  news  conference  Thursday,  reiterating  that  the  plane  sent  its  last  transmissions  at  1:07  a.m.  Saturday.And  Malaysia  Airlines  Chief  Executive  Ahmad  Jauhari  Yahya  said  that  Rolls-Royce  and  Boeing  have  reported  that  they  didn't  receive  transmissions  of  any  kind  after  1:07  a.m.  Saturday.  Air  traffic  controllers  lost  contact  with  the  plane  shortly  afterward,  around  1:30  a.m.Erin  Atan,  a  spokeswoman  for  Rolls-Royce  in  Asia,  declined  to  comment  on  the  matter,  telling  CNN  it  was  "an  official  air  accident  investigation."Authorities  have  not  ruled  out  the  possibility  the  plane  continued  to  fly,  however.  And  given  the  lack  of  evidence,  all  options  remain  on  the  table.The  report  threatened  to  open  the  door  to  a  fresh  round  of  theories  about  what  has  become  of  the  plane,  which  vanished  while  flying  over  Southeast  Asia  on  its  way  from  Kuala  Lumpur  to  Beijing.Four  more  hours  in  the  air  could  have  put  the  plane  many  hundreds  of  miles  beyond  the  area  currently  being  searched.But  one  aviation  industry  observer  expressed  skepticism  about  the  report  even  before  the  denials  by  officials."I  find  this  very,  very  difficult  to  believe,"  Tom  Ballantyne,  chief  correspondent  for  the  magazine  Orient  Aviation,  told  CNN.  "That  this  aircraft  could  have  flown  on  for  four  hours  after  it  disappeared  and  not  have  been  picked  up  by  someone's  radar  and  not  have  been  seen  by  anyone,  it's  almost  unbelievable."See  more  of  our  coverage  on  missing  Malaysia  Airlines  Flight  370Search  getting  harderThe  news  came  after  Vietnamese  and  Chinese  search  crews  found  nothing  where  Chinese  satellite  photographs  released  Wednesday  showed  large  floating  objects  in  the  South  China  Sea.The  spot  is  between  Malaysia  and  Vietnam  and  not  far  from  the  plane's  expected  flight  path.China's  State  Administration  for  Science,  Technology  and  Industry  for  National  Defense  described  the  images  as  showing  "a  suspected  crash  site."But  Chinese  authorities  later  said  the  release  of  the  satellite  images  was  a  mistake  and  that  they  didn't  show  any  debris  relating  to  the  plane,  Hishammuddin  said.The  mystery  over  the  fate  of  the  passenger  jet,  a  Boeing  777-200,  and  the  239  people  it  was  carrying  has  so  far  left  government  officials  and  aviation  experts  flummoxed."With  every  passing  day  the  task  becomes  more  difficult,"  Hishammuddin  said.Searchers  have  already  been  combing  a  vast  area  of  sea  and  land  for  traces  of  the  plane.  But  so  far,  with  the  search  well  into  its  sixth  day,  their  efforts  have  been  fruitless.Malaysian  officials  say  they  are  still  trying  to  determine  if  a  radar  blip  detected  heading  west  soon  after  the  plane  lost  contact  was  in  fact  the  missing  jet.If  it  was,  the  plane  would  have  been  hundreds  of  miles  off  its  original  flight  path  and  headed  in  the  wrong  direction.  Malaysian  officials  say  they  have  asked  U.S.  experts  to  help  them  analyze  the  radar  data.Meanwhile,  India  is  joining  the  multinational  search,  dispatching  two  of  its  naval  ships  off  the  remote  Andaman  and  Nicobar  islands,  a  military  spokesman  told  CNN.Last  known  wordsAlso  on  Thursday,  a  Malaysian  aviation  official  told  CNN  that  the  last  known  words  from  the  flight  crew  of  the  missing  plane  were  "All  right,  good  night."Malaysian  civil  aviation  officer  Zulazri  Mohd  Ahnuar  said  he  couldn't  confirm  which  member  of  the  flight  crew  sent  the  message,  which  was  transmitted  from  the  plane  back  to  Malaysian  flight  controllers  as  the  aircraft  transferred  into  Vietnamese  airspace  early  Saturday.For  the  families  of  those  on  board  the  missing  plane,  the  wait  for  news  is  torturous.Danica  Weeks  is  trying  to  keep  it  together  for  her  two  young  sons,  though  the  possibility  of  life  without  husband  Paul,  who  was  on  the  plane,  is  sometimes  overwhelming.  She's  clinging  to  hope  even  though,  as  Weeks  told  CNN's  Piers  Morgan,  it's  "not  looking  good.""Every  day,  it  just  seems  like  it's  an  eternity,  it's  an  absolute  eternity,"  Weeks  said  from  Australia.  "We  can  only  go  minute  by  minute  ...  and  hope  something  comes  soon."Timeline  of  Malaysia  Airlines  Flight  370How  you  can  help  find  the  planeMalaysia  Airlines  Flight  370:  What  we  know  and  don't  knowWhat  is  a  transponder?CNN's  Pamela  Brown,  Michael  Pearson,  Jethro  Mullen,  Sarah  Aarthun,  Elizabeth  Joseph,  Brian  Walker,  Simon  Harrison,  Greg  Botelho  and  Harmeet  Shah  Singh  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

Share  your  photos  with  CNN  iReport.(CNN)  --  At  first  glance,  the  contorted  limbs  and  faceless  forms  in  Patrice  Letarnec's  photographs  look  like  a  wackier  version  of  the  1990s  trend  of  wearing  your  clothes  backwards.But  Letarnec's  photo  series  "Walking  Upside  Down,"  which  features  people  doing  handstands  with  their  clothes  on  upside  down,  is  a  far  departure  from  hip-hop  sensation  Kriss  Kross'  dated  fashion  trend.  The  French  photographer  explains  that  the  silliness  of  his  images  is  actually  a  form  of  social  commentary.His  photo  series  was  inspired  by  the  French  expression  "marcher  sur  la  tête"--  walking  on  your  head,  a  colloquial  phrase  for  acting  foolishly."Walking  on  your  head  shows  the  absurdity  of  human  behavior,"  he  told  CNN  through  a  translator.  "We  do  silly  things,  humans  do  silly  things."The  characters  of  his  photo  series  are  set  in  public  spaces  throughout  Paris.  Letarnec  wanted  to  highlight  the  architecture  of  French  buildings  against  the  absurd  poses  that  his  characters  were  doing.  The  combination  of  strangely  intriguing  poses  and  whimsical  Parisian  settings  became  instantly  popular  after  he  uploaded  his  photographs  to  his  tumblr  with  various  bloggers  reposting  his  images  onlineHe  came  up  with  the  concept  in  December  2013  and  drew  out  poses  that  he  wanted  his  characters  to  be  in  for  the  photographs.  While  attempting  to  do  a  handstand  against  a  wall  in  his  Nantes  studio,  he  realized  he  needed  skilled  people  who  were  capable  of  standing  on  their  hands  for  this  type  of  photo  shoot.  Letarnec  contacted  Parisian  schools  to  find  dancers  who  were  interested  in  being  a  part  of  his  project.His  inquiries  were  greeted  with  enthusiasm,  and  several  dancers  lined  up  to  participate.  But  they  did  face  some  interesting  challenges."During  the  series,  one  of  the  dancers  said  they  could  not  do  the  walking  handstands  because  in  order  to  walk  on  their  hands  they  had  to  see  the  horizon.  And  in  the  series,  their  heads  are  covered  by  clothing,"  he  said."I  was  so  nervous  this  project  wasn't  going  to  happen."But  after  several  takes,  the  dancers  grew  comfortable  with  the  walking  handstands  and  started  loosening  up,  adding  their  own  personal  movements  to  the  photographs.  The  44-year-old  artist  was  thrilled  to  see  his  characters  add  their  own  interpretation  to  the  series.Letarnec  currently  works  at  an  ad  agency  and  said  his  true  passion  isn't  necessarily  photography,  but  contemporary  art.  For  him,  photography  is  a  medium  to  capture  an  idea,  like  this  one.He  was  drawn  to  his  "Walking  Upside  Down"  project  because  he  wanted  take  a  surreal  idea,  and  shoot  it  in  a  realistic  way,  without  using  any  lighting  effects  or  photo  editing  software  in  his  work."In  the  U.S.  people  might  see  this  just  as  a  series  of  silly  photos,  but  it's  a  social  commentary,"  he  said.  "I  tried  to  show  a  funny  way  to  send  a  message  about  human  behavior.  I  think  French  people  may  be  more  sensitive  to  these  photos  because  of  the  expression."Either  way,  Letarnec  said  he  embraces  the  idea  that  people  find  the  series  fun,  and  said  the  photos  are  supposed  to  seem  silly.</TEXT></DOC>

Ten  years  and  1.2  billion  users  into  its  existence,  any  argument  otherwise  rings  hollow.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>(CNN)  --  Ten  years  and  1.2  billion  users  into  its  existence,  there's  no  question  that  Facebook  has  changed  our  lives.Whether  it  was  an  inspired  vision,  deft  execution,  a  bit  of  dumb  luck  or  a  combination  of  all  three,  Mark  Zuckerberg's  social  juggernaut  has  ingrained  itself  into  the  daily  lives  of  digital-age  users  in  a  way  that  forebears  like  MySpace  and  contemporaries  like  Twitter  could  only  imagine.Which  is  not  to  say  it's  all  "likes"  and  "shares"  and  happy  kid  pics.  As  with  any  new  (or  newly  discovered)  technology,  the  impact  of  the  end  product  is  largely  in  the  hands  of  the  user.  We  are,  after  all,  only  human  --  with  all  the  joy  and  sadness,  decency  and  ugliness  that  that  entails.So  here,  as  Facebook  turns  10  on  Tuesday,  is  a  look  back  at  five  ways  the  social  network  has  changed  us  --  for  better  and  for  worse.Share!  Share!  Share!The  good:  Wedding  announcements?  Thing  of  the  past.  Birth  announcement?  Just  slap  an  Instagram  shot  of  that  bouncing  baby  boy  or  girl  on  your  timeline.Dating?  Graduated?  Bought  a  house?  Got  a  puppy?  Same  deal.We  take  it  for  granted  now,  but  the  ability  to  share  major  events  with  all  the  people  closest  to  you  with  a  single  click  of  the  mouse  is  unprecedented.There  were  the  Myspaces  of  the  world  before  Facebook.  But  mom,  your  second  cousin  and  Aunt  Jenny  weren't  on  them.And  it's  not  just  the  good  stuff,  either.  Changing  that  relationship  status  to  "single"  can  save  you  from  those  awkward  "How's  Joey  doing?  You  two  are  so  cute  together!"  conversations.The  bad:  Overshare!  Overshare!  Overshare!Seriously.  Ten  years  in,  some  folks  haven't  figured  out  what  everyone  on  their  friends  list  wants,  or  needs,  to  know.OK,  sometimes  those  pictures  of  your  dinner  look  delicious.  Sometimes.But  the  detailed  updates  on  your  mundane  day  are  mind-numbing  and  the  play-by-play  of  your  3-year-old's  potty  training  is  just  --  too  much.We  all  want  to  know  you  got  a  wedding  ring.  The  fact  that  you  just  polished  the  one  you've  had  for  14  years?  Not  so  much.The  past  is  not  really  pastThe  good:  When  a  site  has  1.2  billion  users  (OK,  we  all  know  some  of  those  are  multiple  or  abandoned  accounts,  so  let's  say  at  least  a  cool  billion)  it's  a  pretty  amazing  database  of  the  world's  Web-enabled  population.That  means  your  odds  of  finding  just  about  anybody  are  a  heck  of  a  lot  better  than  they  were  10  years  ago.There  have  been  the  remarkable  tales,  like  the  woman  who  --  after  years  of  failed  efforts  --  reunited  after  44  years  with  her  birth  mother.  How  long  did  it  take  on  Facebook?  Two  days.For  most  of  us,  it's  less  dramatic  than  that.  Childhood  friends  who  moved  long  ago,  college  roommates  who  drifted  away,  even  former  teachers  who  served  as  inspirations  are  now  but  a  quick  search  away.  There's  no  doubt  we  have  friends  because  of  Facebook  that  we  wouldn't  have  otherwise.The  bad:  Sometimes,  drifting  apart  isn't  a  bad  thing.Yes,  your  old  high-school  classmates  got  annoying  and  your  cousin's  politics  disgust  you.  But  we're  not  talking  about  that.We're  talking  about  exes.  And  past  flirtations.  And  cheating.Nostalgia  is  part  of  life.  But,  with  Facebook,  getting  nostalgic  about  an  old  crush  or  flame  could  lead  to  a  late-night  Facebook  message.  Or,  you  know,  a  poke."I  see  Facebook  issues  breaking  up  marriages  all  the  time,"  Gary  Traystman,  a  divorce  attorney  in  New  London,  Connecticut,  told  the  Wall  Street  Journal.More  than  80%  of  U.S.  divorce  attorneys  say  they've  seen  an  increase  in  cases  involving  social  media,  according  to  the  American  Academy  of  Matrimonial  Lawyers,  and  one-third  of  all  divorce  filings  last  year  contained  the  word  Facebook,  according  to  a  survey  by  Divorce  Online.Temptation  is  always  out  there.  But  with  Facebook,  it  can  be  a  little  too  convenient.It  makes  you  happyThe  good:  In  2009,  a  survey  of  2,600  college  students  by  researchers  at  the  University  of  Texas  showed  that  those  who  were  the  heaviest  users  of  Facebook  were  the  most  satisfied  with  their  lives.  They  also  were  more  likely  to  be  engaged  socially  and  politically.More  recently,  a  University  of  Wisconsin  study  showed  that,  after  five  minutes  of  looking  at  their  own  shiny  Facebook  profiles,  users  experienced  a  significant  boost  in  self-esteem.  A  2011  Cornell  University  study  delivered  similar  results."For  many  people,  there's  an  automatic  assumption  that  the  Internet  is  bad,"  associate  professor  Jeffrey  Hancock  said  at  the  time.  "This  is  one  of  the  first  studies  to  show  that  there's  a  psychological  benefit  of  Facebook."The  bad:  Or  maybe  it  makes  you  unhappy.Other  studies  have  looked  at  aspects  of  Facebook  use  and  the  results  have  been  less  encouraging.Last  year,  a  University  of  Michigan  researcher  found  that  looking  at  posts  by  Facebook  friends  --  you  know,  the  photos  of  smiling  kids  on  vacation  in  the  Caribbean  or  announcements  about  promotions,  engagements  and  awesome  nights  on  the  town  --  can  make  us  feel  sadder  about  our  own  humdrum  lives."On  the  surface,  Facebook  provides  an  invaluable  resource  for  fulfilling  the  basic  human  need  for  social  connection,"  the  study  reads.  "Rather  than  enhancing  well-being,  however,  these  findings  suggest  that  Facebook  may  undermine  it."As  with  many  things,  your  mileage  may  very.  But  what's  clear  is  that  Facebook  has  become  such  a  part  of  our  lives  that  it  tweaks  our  emotions,  for  better  or  worse.Every  day  is  a  reunionThe  good:  Reuniting  with  classmates  from  high  school  or  college  has  never  been  easier.  Pre-Facebook,  a  class  reunion  committee  looking  to  celebrate  five,  10  or  20  years  post-diploma  faced  a  thankless  task."Where  does  Jennifer  live  these  days?"  "Who  has  Steven's  phone  number?"  "Do  you  know  Wanda's  married  name?"Now?  One  Facebook  event  invitation  and  you  can  focus  on  booking  the  best  '80s  cover  band  available.The  bad:  If  every  day  is  a  reunion,  why  have  a  reunion?Actually  reuniting  with  old  classmates  is  losing  some  of  its  appeal  when  we  know  the  names  of  the  former  theater  club  president's  three  kids  and  which  character  from  "The  Hunger  Games"  she'd  be.Timothy  Davis,  co-founder  of  reunion  website  Classreport.com,  told  the  Baltimore  Sun  that  he  has  noticed  a  drop-off  in  the  number  of  reunions  in  recent  years,  particularly  among  folks  in  their  mid-  to  late  20s."People  I  haven't  talked  to  in  years  will  see  my  wedding  pictures  on  Facebook,  then  I'll  see  them  in  person  and  we  won't  say  one  word  to  each  other  ...,"  Rebecca  Miller,  a  23-year-old  whose  five-year  reunion  fizzled  to  a  small  party  at  the  class  president's  house,  told  the  paper.  "Why  go  to  a  high  school  reunion  when  you're  going  to  stand  around  and  go,  'So,  how  did  that  doctor's  appointment  go  yesterday?'"PrivacyThe  good:  For  those  willing  to  find  and  use  them,  Facebook  provides  tools  that  let  you  select  who  sees  what.So,  while  grandma  is  welcome  to  look  at  those  pics  of  the  kids  playing  in  the  snow,  she  might  not  need  to  be  privy  to  your  strongly  worded  rant  about  the  cable  guy  who  is  two  days  late.  You  can  direct  that  one  instead  to  buddies  with  a  proper  appreciation  for  your  expansive  vocabulary.Rival  Twitter  is  designed  by  default  to  be  a  public  forum,  where  you  broadcast  your  140-character  pearls  of  wisdom  to  the  world.  Facebook  allows  that,  too,  but  is  more  geared  toward  limiting  your  thoughts  to  certain  family  and  friends.The  bad:  Well,  you  know.Security  breaches  have  been  a  reality  of  many  websites'  growth.  But  as  its  user  base  grew  dramatically,  Facebook's  problems  (like  the  time  CEO  and  founder  Mark  Zuckerberg  got  his  own  page  hacked)  played  out  in  front  of  a  massive,  and  nervous,  audience.While  Facebook  has  privacy  settings  that  let  users  protect  information,  some  privacy  advocates  say  the  network  doesn't  make  them  easy  enough  to  find  and  use.  (Facebook  has  worked  to  ease  those  concerns,  especially  for  younger  users).At  the  end  of  the  day,  Facebook  benefits  when  you  decide  to  share  more  openly.  The  details  about  your  life  that  you  share  on  Facebook  are  rounded  up  and  compiled  into  a  profile  of  you  that  helps  advertisers  target  you  with  things  they  think  you'll  like.So,  when  you  announced  your  pregnancy  and  were,  soon  after,  bombarded  with  Facebook  ads  for  a  bunch  of  baby  stuff?  That  was  no  coincidence.To  be  clear,  Facebook  is  not  handing  advertisers  information  about  you  personally.  But,  somewhere,  there  exists  a  nameless  profile  of  a  user  with  your  hometown,  gender,  age  and  likes  and  dislikes,  just  waiting  to  be  used  for  marketing  purposes.That,  in  a  nutshell,  is  the  entry  fee  to  use  this  remarkable  social  tool.  Yes,  Facebook  has  changed  the  way  we  communicate.  Whether  it  is  truly  cost-free  remains  another  question.</TEXT></DOC>

Gates  also  said  Le's  family  has  been  through  a  lot  in  recent  years,  first  losing  their  home  in  Hurricane  Katrina,  then  their  shrimping  business  was  financially  hurt  by  the  Deepwater  Horizon  Oil  Spill.Authorities  said  Rashad  Charjuan  Owens  drove  into  people  and  vehicles  at  the  festival  while  he  was  intoxicated  early  Thursday.  Owens,  21,  was  charged  last  week  with  two  counts  of  capital  murder.Police  said  Owens  drove  into  the  crowds  after  refusing  to  stop  for  an  officer  who  tried  to  pull  him  over.Besides  the  first  two  people  who  died,  23  people  were  initially  hospitalized,  some  with  multiple  internal  injuries.  Most  of  the  victims  are  in  their  20s,  said  Dr.  Christopher  Ziebell,  medical  director  at  the  University  Medical  Center  Brackenridge.A  Travis  County  grand  jury  will  determine  whether  Owens  will  face  any  more  charges  because  of  the  third  death,  Bremner  said.CNN's  John  Branch,  Jason  Hanna  and  Justin  Lear  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>

He,  too,  wore  a  paper  bag  over  his  head  --  one  saying  "SUPER  FAMOUS"  instead  of  LaBeouf's  "I  AM  NOT  FAMOUS  ANYMORE"  --  but  eagerly  apologized  for  "all  the  world's  ills"  and  even  offered  one  guy  a  taste  of  his  sandwich.O'Connell  explained  to  BuzzFeed  that  he  wasn't  doing  it  to  upset  LaBeouf  --  in  fact,  he  found  the  actor's  exhibit  pretty  inspiring."Everyone's  talking  about  it,  whether  you  want  to  call  it  art  or  a  real  apology,  it's  hilarious,"  O'Connell  said.  "He's  getting  people  talking.  I'm  all  for  this  artsy  gallery  thing.  It's  fun  to  parody  because  all  I  have  to  do  here  is  sit  with  a  bag  on  my  head,  crying,  and  saying,  'I  sowwy.'  But  I  have  to  tell  you;  it's  freeing  to  continually  apologize  like  he  does.  I  get  it."Emile  Hirsch  does  too.  The  "Lone  Survivor"  actor  went  on  a  tweet-spree  Wednesday  airing  all  of  his  regrets."I  AM  NOT  FAMOUS  TO  BEGIN  WITH,"  Hirsch  joked.  "I  AM  BEGINNING  TO  FEEL  SLIGHTLY  MORE  FAMOUS.  ...  I  TAKE  IT  BACK,  STILL  NOT  FAMOUS."And  then:  "I  AM...CONFUSED  ABOUT  HOW  FAMOUS  OR  NOT  FAMOUS  I  MIGHT  POTENTIALLY  BE...ANYMORE...  I  AM...ACCIDENTALLY  ON  CAPS."Just  in  case  LaBeouf  thinks  Hirsch  is  laughing  at  him  instead  of  with  him,  the  actor  clarified  that  "IN  ALL  FAMOUSNESS  THOUGH,  I  LOVE  SHIA,  WHETHER  OR  NOT  HE'S  FAMOUS.  ...  I  AM  SORRY  I  EVEN  SAID  SORRY.  NOT  GONNA  LIE,  I  AM  ONLY  ABOUT  FIFTY  PERCENT  SURE  OF  MY  ORIGINAL  (FIRST)  SORRY."In  December,  LaBeouf  was  accused  of  plagiarizing  Daniel  Clowes'  "Justin  M  Damiano,"  in  his  short  film,  "HowardCantour.com."  The  actor  at  first  said  that  he'd  been  so  absorbed  in  the  creative  process  he  neglected  to  give  Clowes  proper  accreditation,  but  then  he  was  also  accused  of  plagiarizing  his  apologies.All  of  these  regrets  makes  us  wonder:  who  do  you  want  to  see  apologize  next?</TEXT></DOC>

At  a  remote  border  outpost,  scientists  are  making  a  last  stand  against  the  disease.</ABSTRACT><TEXT>Editor's  note:  CNN.com  is  showcasing  the  work  of  Mosaic,  a  new  digital  publication  that  explores  the  science  of  life.  It's  produced  by  the  Wellcome  Trust,  a  global  charitable  foundation  that  supports  research  in  biology,  medicine  and  the  medical  humanities,  with  the  goal  of  improving  human  and  animal  health.  The  content  is  produced  solely  by  Mosaic,  and  we  will  be  posting  some  of  its  most  thought-provoking  work.(CNN)  --  The  meandering  Moei  river  marks  the  natural  boundary  between  Thailand  and  Myanmar.  Its  muddy  waters  are  at  their  fullest,  but  Francois  Nosten  still  crosses  them  in  just  a  minute,  aboard  a  narrow,  wooden  boat.  In  the  dry  season,  he  could  wade  across.  As  he  steps  onto  the  western  riverbank,  in  Myanmar,  he  passes  no  checkpoint  and  presents  no  passport.The  air  is  cool.  After  months  of  rain,  the  surrounding  jungle  pops  with  vivid  lime  and  emerald  hues.  Nosten  climbs  a  set  of  wooden  slats  that  wind  away  from  the  bank,  up  a  muddy  slope.  His  pace,  as  ever,  seems  relaxed  and  out  of  kilter  with  his  almost  permanently  grave  expression  and  urgent  purpose.  Nosten,  a  rangy  Frenchman  with  tousled  brown  hair  and  glasses,  is  one  of  the  world's  leading  experts  on  malaria.  He  is  here  to  avert  a  looming  disaster.  At  the  top  of  the  slope,  he  reaches  a  small  village  of  simple  wooden  buildings  with  tin  and  thatch  roofs.  This  is  Hka  Naw  Tah,  home  to  around  400  people  and  a  testing  ground  for  Nosten's  bold  plan  to  completely  stamp  out  malaria  from  this  critical  corner  of  the  world.Malaria  is  the  work  of  the  single-celled  Plasmodium  parasites,  and  Plasmodium  falciparum  chief  among  them.  They  spread  between  people  through  the  bites  of  mosquitoes,  invading  first  the  liver,  then  the  red  blood  cells.  The  first  symptoms  are  generic  and  flu-like:  fever,  headache,  sweats  and  chills,  vomiting.  At  that  point,  the  immune  system  usually  curtails  the  infection.  But  if  the  parasites  spread  to  the  kidneys,  lungs  and  brain,  things  go  downhill  quickly.  Organs  start  failing.  Infected  red  blood  cells  clog  the  brain's  blood  vessels,  depriving  it  of  oxygen  and  leading  to  seizures,  unconsciousness  and  death.When  Nosten  first  arrived  in  Southeast  Asia  almost  30  years  ago,  malaria  was  the  biggest  killer  in  the  region.  Artemisinin  changed  everything.  Spectacularly  fast  and  effective,  the  drug  arrived  on  the  scene  in  1994,  when  options  for  treating  malaria  were  running  out.  Since  then,  "cases  have  just  gone  down,  down,  down,"  says  Nosten.  "I've  never  seen  so  few  in  the  rainy  season  --  a  few  hundred  this  year  compared  to  tens  of  thousands  before."But  he  has  no  time  for  celebration.  Artemisinin  used  to  clear  P.  falciparum  in  a  day;  now,  it  can  take  several.  The  parasite  has  started  to  become  resistant.  The  wonder  drug  is  failing.  It  is  the  latest  reprise  of  a  decades-long  theme:  we  attack  malaria  with  a  new  drug,  it  mounts  an  evolutionary  riposte.Back  in  his  office,  Nosten  pulls  up  a  map  showing  the  current  whereabouts  of  the  resistant  parasites.  Three  colored  bands  highlight  the  borders  between  Cambodia  and  Vietnam,  Cambodia  and  Thailand,  and  Thailand  and  Myanmar  (Burma).  Borders.  Bold  lines  on  maps,  but  invisible  in  reality.  A  river  that  can  be  crossed  in  a  rickety  boat  is  no  barrier  to  a  parasite  that  rides  in  the  salivary  glands  of  mosquitoes  or  the  red  blood  cells  of  humans.History  tells  us  what  happens  next.  Over  the  last  century,  almost  every  frontline  antimalarial  drug  --  chloroquine,  sulfadoxine,  pyrimethamine  --  has  become  obsolete  because  of  defiant  parasites  that  emerged  from  western  Cambodia.  From  this  cradle  of  resistance,  the  parasites  gradually  spread  west  to  Africa,  causing  the  deaths  of  millions.  Malaria  already  kills  around  660,000  people  every  year,  and  most  of  them  are  African  kids.If  artemisinin  resistance  reached  that  continent,  it  would  be  catastrophic,  especially  since  there  are  no  good  replacement  drugs  on  the  immediate  horizon.Nosten  thinks  that  without  radical  measures,  resistance  will  spread  to  India  and  Bangladesh.  Once  that  happens,  it  will  be  too  late.  Those  countries  are  too  big,  too  populous,  too  uneven  in  their  health  services  to  even  dream  about  containing  the  resistant  parasites.  Once  there,  they  will  inevitably  spread  further.  He  thinks  it  will  happen  in  three  years,  maybe  four.  "Look  at  the  speed  of  change  on  this  border.  It's  exponential.  It's  not  going  to  take  10  or  15  years  to  reach  Bangladesh.  It'll  take  just  a  few.  We  have  to  do  something  before  it's  too  late."Hundreds  of  scientists  are  developing  innovative  new  ways  of  dealing  with  malaria,  from  potential  vaccines  to  new  drugs,  genetically  modified  mosquitoes  to  lethal  fungi.  As  Nosten  sees  it,  none  of  these  will  be  ready  in  time.  The  only  way  of  stopping  artemisinin  resistance,  he  says,  is  to  completely  remove  malaria  from  its  cradle  of  resistance.  "If  you  want  to  eliminate  artemisinin  resistance,  you  have  to  eliminate  malaria,"  says  Nosten.  Not  control  it,  not  contain  it.  Eliminate  it.That  makes  the  Moei  river  more  than  a  border  between  nations.  It's  Stalingrad.  It's  Thermopylae.  It's  the  last  chance  for  halting  the  creeping  obsolescence  of  our  best  remaining  drug.  What  happens  here  will  decide  the  fate  of  millions.Eradicating  malariaThe  world  tried  to  eliminate  malaria  60  years  ago.  Malaria  was  a  global  affliction  back  then,  infecting  hundreds  of  thousands  of  troops  during  World  War  II.  This  helped  motivate  a  swell  of  postwar  research.  To  fight  the  disease,  in  1946  the  USA  created  what  is  now  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC),  the  country's  premier  public  health  institute.  After  a  decisive  national  eradication  program,  the  nation  became  malaria-free  in  1951.  Brazil  had  also  controlled  a  burgeoning  malaria  epidemic  with  insecticides.Meanwhile,  new  weapons  had  emerged.  The  long-lasting  insecticide  DDT  was  already  being  widely  used  and  killed  mosquitoes  easily.  A  new  drug  called  chloroquine  did  the  same  to  Plasmodium.  Armed  with  these  tools  and  buoyed  by  earlier  successes,  the  World  Health  Organization  formally  launched  the  Global  Malaria  Eradication  Program  in  1955.  DDT  was  sprayed  in  countless  homes.  Chloroquine  was  even  added  to  table  salt  in  some  countries.  It  was  as  ambitious  a  public  health  initiative  as  has  ever  been  attempted.It  worked  to  a  point.  Malaria  fell  dramatically  in  Taiwan,  Sri  Lanka,  India,  the  Caribbean,  the  Balkans,  and  parts  of  the  south  Pacific.  But  ultimately  the  problem  was  too  big,  the  plan  too  ambitious.  It  barely  made  a  dent  in  sub-Saharan  Africa,  where  public  health  infrastructure  was  poor  and  malaria  was  most  prevalent.  And  its  twin  pillars  soon  crumbled  as  P.  falciparum  evolved  resistance  to  chloroquine  and  mosquitoes  evolved  resistance  to  DDT.  The  disease  bounced  back  across  much  of  Asia  and  the  western  Pacific.In  1969,  the  eradication  program  was  finally  abandoned.  Despite  several  successes,  its  overall  failure  had  a  chilling  impact  on  malaria  research.  Investments  from  richer  (and  now  unaffected)  countries  dwindled,  save  for  a  spike  of  interest  during  the  Vietnam  War.  The  best  minds  in  the  field  left  for  fresher  challenges.  Malaria,  now  a  tropical  disease  of  poor  people,  became  unfashionable.'If  you  want  to  travel,  be  a  doctor'Francois  Nosten  always  wanted  to  travel.  His  father,  a  sailor  on  merchant  ships,  returned  home  with  stories  of  far-flung  adventures  and  instilled  a  deep  wanderlust.  Nosten's  original  plan  was  to  work  on  overseas  development  projects,  but  one  of  his  teachers  pushed  him  down  a  different  path.  "He  said  the  best  thing  you  can  do  if  you  want  to  travel  anywhere  is  to  be  a  doctor.  That's  why  I  started  medical  school."  As  soon  as  he  graduated,  he  joined  Médecins  Sans  Frontières  and  started  living  the  dream.  He  flew  off  to  Africa  and  Southeast  Asia,  before  arriving  in  Thailand  in  1983.  There,  he  started  treating  refugees  from  Myanmar  in  camps  along  the  Thai  border.In  1985,  an  English  visitor  arrived  at  the  camps  and  Nosten  took  him  for  a  random  tourist  until  he  started  asking  insightful  questions  about  malaria.  That  man  was  Nick  White.  A  British  clinician,  he  was  drawn  to  Bangkok  in  1980  by  the  allure  of  the  tropics  and  a  perverse  desire  to  study  something  unfashionable.  The  University  of  Oxford  had  just  set  up  a  new  tropical  medicine  research  unit  in  collaboration  with  Bangkok's  Mahidol  University,  and  White  was  the  third  to  join."The  rosbif  and  the  frog",  as  Nosten  puts  it,  bonded  over  an  interest  in  malaria,  a  desire  to  knuckle  down  and  get  things  done,  and  a  similar  grouchy  conviviality.  They  formed  a  close  friendship  and  started  working  together.In  1986,  they  set  up  a  field  station  for  White's  Bangkok  research  unit:  little  more  than  a  centrifuge  and  microscope  within  Nosten's  rickety  house.  Three  years  later,  Nosten  moved  to  Shoklo,  the  largest  refugee  camp  along  the  Thai--Myanmar  border  and  home  to  around  9,000  people.  Most  were  Karen  --  the  third  largest  of  Myanmar's  130  or  so  ethnic  groups  --  who  were  fleeing  persecution  from  the  majority  Bamar  government.  Nosten  worked  out  of  a  bamboo  hospital  --  the  first  Shoklo  Malaria  Research  Unit.Malaria  was  rife.  Floods  were  regular.  Military  leaders  from  both  Thailand  and  Myanmar  occasionally  ordered  Nosten  to  leave.  Without  any  electricity,  he  often  had  to  use  a  mirror  to  angle  sunlight  into  his  microscope.  He  loved  it.  "I'm  not  a  city  person,"  he  says.  "I  couldn't  survive  in  Bangkok  very  well.  I  wasn't  alone  in  Shoklo  but  it  was  sufficiently  remote."  The  immediacy  of  the  job  and  the  lack  of  bureaucracy  also  appealed.  He  could  try  out  new  treatments  and  see  their  impact  right  away.  He  trained  local  people  to  detect  Plasmodium  under  a  microscope  and  help  with  research.  He  even  met  his  future  wife  --  a  Karen  teacher  named  Colley  Paw,  who  is  now  one  of  his  right-hand  researchers  (White  was  the  best  man  at  their  wedding).  These  were  the  best  years  of  his  life.The  Shoklo  years  ended  in  1995  after  a  splinter  faction  of  Karen  started  regularly  attacking  the  camps,  in  a  bid  to  force  the  refugees  back  into  Myanmar.  "They  came  in  and  started  shooting,"  says  Nosten.  "We  once  had  to  hide  in  a  hole  for  the  night,  with  bullets  flying  around."  The  Thai  military,  unable  to  defend  the  scattered  camps,  consolidated  them  into  a  single  site  called  Mae  La  --  a  dense  lattice  of  thatch-roofed  houses  built  on  stilts,  which  now  contains  almost  50,000  people.  Nosten  went  with  them.He  has  since  expanded  the  Shoklo  Unit  into  a  huge  hand  that  stretches  across  the  region.  Its  palm  is  a  central  laboratory  in  the  town  of  Mae  Sot,  where  Nosten  lives,  and  the  fingers  are  clinics  situated  in  border  settlements,  each  with  trained  personnel  and  sophisticated  facilities.  The  one  in  Mae  La  has  a  $250,000  neonatal  care  machine,  and  can  cope  with  everything  short  of  major  surgery.  Nosten  has  also  set  up  small  "malaria  posts"  along  the  border.  These  are  typically  just  volunteer  farmers  with  a  box  of  diagnostic  tests  and  medicine  in  their  house."I  don't  know  anybody  else  who  could  have  done  what  Francois  has  done,"  says  White.  "He'll  underplay  the  difficulties  but  between  the  physical  dangers,  politics,  logistical  nightmares,  and  the  fraught  conditions  of  the  refugees,  it's  not  been  easy.  He's  not  a  shrinking  violet."Thanks  to  Nosten's  network,  locals  know  where  to  go  if  they  feel  unwell,  and  they  are  never  far  from  treatments.  That  is  vital.  If  infected  people  are  treated  within  48  hours  of  their  first  symptoms,  their  parasites  die  before  they  get  a  chance  to  enter  another  mosquito  and  the  cycle  of  malaria  breaks.  "You  deploy  early  identification  and  treatment,  and  malaria  goes  away,"  says  Nosten.  "Everywhere  we've  done  this,  it's  worked."Wonder  drugVictories  in  malaria  are  often  short-lived.  When  Nosten  and  White  teamed  up  in  the  1980s,  their  first  success  was  showing  that  a  new  drug  called  mefloquine  was  excellent  at  curing  malaria,  and  at  preventing  it  in  pregnant  women.  Most  drugs  had  fallen  to  resistant  parasites  and  the  last  effective  one  --  quinine  --  involved  a  week  of  nasty  side-effects.  Mefloquine  was  a  godsend.But  within  five  years,  P.  falciparum  had  started  to  resist  it  too.  "We  tried  different  things  like  increasing  the  dose,  but  we  were  clearly  losing  the  drug,"  says  Nosten.  "We  saw  more  and  more  treatment  failures,  patients  coming  back  weeks  later  with  the  same  malaria.  We  were  really  worried  that  we  wouldn't  have  any  more  options."Salvation  came  from  China.  In  1967,  Chairman  Mao  Zedong  launched  a  covert  military  initiative  to  discover  new  antimalarial  drugs,  partly  to  help  his  North  Vietnamese  allies,  who  were  losing  troops  to  the  disease.  It  was  called  Project  523.  A  team  of  some  600  scientists  scoured  200  herbs  used  in  traditional  Chinese  medicine  for  possible  antimalarial  chemicals.  They  found  a  clear  winner  in  1971  --  a  common  herb  called  qing  hao  (Artemisia  annua  or  sweet  wormwood).  Using  hints  from  a  2,000-year-old  recipe  for  treating  hemorrhoids,  they  isolated  the  herb's  active  ingredient,  characterized  it,  tested  it  in  humans  and  animals,  and  created  synthetic  versions.  "This  was  in  the  aftermath  of  the  Cultural  Revolution,"  says  White.  "Society  had  been  ripped  apart,  there  was  still  a  lot  of  oppression,  and  facilities  were  poor.  But  they  did  some  extremely  good  chemistry."The  results  were  miraculous.  The  new  drug  annihilated  even  severe  forms  of  chloroquine-resistant  malaria,  and  did  so  with  unparalleled  speed  and  no  side-effects.  The  team  named  it  Qinghaosu.  The  West  would  know  it  as  artemisinin.  Or,  at  least,  they  would  when  they  found  out  about  it.Project  523  was  shrouded  in  secrecy,  and  few  results  were  published.  Qinghaosu  was  already  being  widely  used  in  China  and  Vietnam  when  the  first  English  description  appeared  in  the  Chinese  Medical  Journal  in  1979.Western  scientists,  suspicious  about  Chinese  journals  and  traditional  medicine,  greeted  it  with  skepticism  and  wasted  time  trying  to  develop  their  own  less  effective  versions.  The  Chinese,  meanwhile,  were  reluctant  to  share  their  new  drug  with  Cold  War  enemies.During  this  political  stalemate,  White  saw  a  tattered  copy  of  the  1979  paper.  He  travelled  to  China  in  1981,  and  returned  with  a  vial  of  the  drug,  which  he  still  keeps  in  a  drawer  in  his  office.  He  and  Nosten  began  studying  it,  working  out  the  right  doses,  and  testing  the  various  derivatives.They  realized  that  artemisinin's  only  shortcoming  was  a  lack  of  stamina.  People  clear  it  so  quickly  from  their  bodies  that  they  need  seven  daily  doses  to  completely  cure  themselves.  Few  complete  the  full  course.  White's  ingenious  solution  was  to  pair  the  new  drug  with  mefloquine  --  a  slower-acting  but  longer-lasting  partner.  Artemisinin  would  land  a  brutal  shock-and-awe  strike  that  destroyed  the  majority  of  parasites,  mefloquine  would  mop  up  the  survivors.  If  any  parasites  resisted  the  artemisinin  assault,  mefloquine  would  finish  them  off.  Plasmodium  would  need  to  resist  both  drugs  to  survive  the  double  whammy,  and  White  deemed  that  unlikely.  Just  three  days  of  this  artemisinin  combination  therapy  (ACT)  was  enough  to  treat  virtually  every  case  of  malaria.  In  theory,  ACTs  should  have  been  resistance-proof.Nosten  started  using  them  along  the  Thai--Myanmar  border  in  1994  and  immediately  saw  results.  Quinine  took  days  to  clear  the  parasites  and  left  people  bed-ridden  for  a  week  with  dizzy  spells.  ACTs  had  them  returning  to  work  after  24  hours.But  victories  in  malaria  are  often  short-lived.  In  the  early  2000s,  the  team  started  hearing  rumours  from  western  Cambodia  that  ACTs  were  becoming  less  effective.  White  tried  to  stay  calm.  He  had  heard  plenty  of  false  alarms  about  incurable  Cambodian  patients,  but  it  always  turned  out  that  they  were  taking  counterfeit  drugs.  "I  was  just  hoping  it  was  another  of  those,"  he  says.It  was  not.  In  2006,  Harald  Noedl  from  the  Medical  University  of  Vienna  started  checking  out  the  rumors  for  himself.  In  the  Cambodian  village  of  Ta  Sanh,  he  treated  60  malaria  patients  with  artesunate  (an  artemisinin  derivative)  and  found  that  two  of  them  carried  exceptionally  stubborn  parasites.  These  infections  cleared  in  four  to  six  days,  rather  than  the  usual  two.  And  even  though  the  patients  stayed  in  a  clinic  outside  any  malaria  hotspots,  their  parasites  returned  a  few  weeks  later."I  first  presented  those  data  in  November  2007  and  as  expected,  people  were  very  skeptical,"  says  Noedl.  After  all,  a  pair  of  patients  is  an  epidemiological  blip.  Still,  this  was  worrying  enough  to  prompt  White's  team  to  run  their  own  study  in  another  nearby  village.  They  got  even  worse  news.  The  40  people  they  treated  with  artesunate  took  an  average  of  3.5  days  to  clear  their  parasites,  and  six  of  them  suffered  from  rebounding  infections  within  a  month.  "Rapid  parasite  clearance  is  the  hallmark  of  artemisinins,"  says  Arjen  Dondorp,  one  of  White's  colleagues  based  in  Bangkok.  "That  property  suddenly  disappeared."Despite  the  hopes  that  ACTs  would  forestall  artemisinin's  expiry,  resistance  had  arrived,  just  as  it  had  done  for  other  antimalarials.  And,  as  if  to  rub  salt  in  the  wound,  it  had  come  from  the  same  damn  place.Continue  to  part  2The  Shoklo  Malaria  Research  Unit  and  Dominic  Kwiatkowski  receive  funding  from  the  Wellcome  Trust,  which  publishes  Mosaic.Copyright  2014  The  Wellcome  Trust.

Coates  was  having  excruciating  pain  and  rectal  bleeding  in  2011.  For  a  year  the  Army  veteran  went  to  several  VA  clinics  and  hospitals  in  South  Carolina,  trying  to  get  help.  But  the  VA's  diagnosis  was  hemorrhoids,  and  aside  from  simple  pain  medication  he  was  told  he  might  need  a  colonoscopy.Congress  demands  answers  on  VA  deaths"The  problem  was  getting  worse  and  I  was  having  more  pain,"  Coates  said,  talking  about  one  specific  VA  doctor  who  he  saw  every  few  months.  "She  again  examined  me  and  gave  me  some  prescriptions  for  other  things  as  far  as  pain  and  stuff  like  that  and  I  noticed  again  she  made  another  comment  --  'may  need  colonoscopy.'"I  told  her  that  something  needed  to  be  done,"  said  Coates.  "But  nothing  was  ever  set  up  ...  a  consult  was  never  set  up.""I  had  already  been  in  pain  and  suffering  from  this  problem  for  over  six  months  and  it  wasn't  getting  better,"  Coates  said.  "I  told  her  that  if  you  were  in  as  much  pain  as  I  was  and  had  been  going  through  you  wouldn't  wait  another  two  months  to  see  what's  going  on.  You  would  probably  do  it  this  week."Coates  waited  months,  even  begging  for  an  appointment  to  have  his  colonoscopy.  But  he  only  found  himself  on  a  growing  list  of  veterans  also  waiting  for  appointments  and  procedures.  He  was  finally  told  he  could  have  a  colonoscopy,  many  months  later."I  took  it  upon  my  own  self  to  call  the  department  that  scheduled  that  and  ask  them  about  it.  And  they  said  this  was  the  earliest  appointment  that  I  could  get.  And  I  explained  to  the  lady  what  I  had  already  been  through  and  how  much  pain  I  had,  and  I  said  if  I  wait  this  long  there  might  not  be  ...  (anything)  we  can  do  about  it  then.  I  could  be  even  dead  by  then.  And  the  only  thing  she  could  tell  me  was  'I  understand  that,  sir,  but  I  don't  have  any  control  over  that.'  "Finally  about  a  year  after  first  complaining  to  his  doctors  of  the  pain,  Coates  got  a  colonoscopy  and  doctors  discovered  a  cancerous  tumor  the  size  of  a  baseball.The  now  44-year-old  veteran  is  undergoing  chemotherapy  in  an  effort  to  save  his  life.It  is  unclear  whether  anyone  responsible  at  the  VA  has  been  fired,  demoted  or  even  admonished  for  the  delays  in  care  and  treatment.  Some  of  the  people  responsible  may  have  even  received  bonuses  in  recent  years  for  their  work,  despite  the  delays  in  care  or  treatment  for  the  veterans.According  to  the  document  obtained  by  CNN,  10  veterans  are  confirmed  to  have  died  in  the  South  Carolina  and  Georgia  region  alone.  And  the  document  shows  29  vets  or  their  families  were  sent  the  disclosures,  notifying  them  they  had  serious  "adverse  events"  because  of  delayed  care.  And  according  to  the  document  the  problems  go  far  beyond  Georgia  or  South  Carolina.In  the  Florida  region,  five  veterans  are  dead,  and  14  vets  or  their  families  were  sent  the  disclosures,  notified  that  they  suffered  "adverse  events"  because  of  delayed  or  denied  care  or  diagnosis,  according  to  the  exclusive  document.In  the  Rocky  Mountain  region,  two  veterans  died,  and  four  families  were  sent  the  disclosures  or  notified.  In  the  Texas  region,  seven  vets  or  their  families  were  sent  disclosures  about  adverse  events  and  serious  injuries  suffered  because  of  delayed  care.Coates  filed  a  legal  claim,  citing  the  "failure  of  the  Columbia  (South  Carolina)  VA  Medical  Center  to  timely  diagnose  his  rectal  cancer."  The  VA  settled,  but  admitted  no  wrong-doing."I  don't  know  what  my  outcome  is  going  to  be,"  said  Coates."I  just  try  to  live  every  day  like  it's  my  last  day."The  new  document  obtained  by  CNN  shows  a  worse  problem  than  has  previously  been  made  public  by  the  VA.As  CNN  has  previously  reported,  as  many  as  7,000  veterans  were  on  a  backlog  list  --  waiting  too  long  for  colonscopies  or  endoscopies  --  at  VA  facilities  in  Columbia,  South  Carolina  and  Augusta,  Georgia.After  CNN's  detailed  accounting  of  dela-related  deaths  at  the  Columbia  and  Augusta  VA  hospitals,  a  bi-partisan  group  of  Congressmen  visited  the  hospitals,  demanding  answers."We  have  a  duty  to  make  sure  that  the  veterans  who  serve  get  the  best  health  care  possible,"  said  Rep.  John  Barrow,  D-Georgia.  "And  it  is  very  obvious  that  for  too  long  and  for  too  many  folks  that  hasn't  happened."The  VA  said  the  backlog  at  those  two  hospitals  has  been  solved,  but  that  is  not  a  good  enough  explanation  for  Rep.  Jeff  Miller,  the  chair  of  the  House  Veterans  Affairs  Committee."The  fact  that  we've  had  veterans  who  have  died  in  the  very  facilities  that  are  supposed  to  be  taking  care  of  them,  and  not  by  natural  means,  by  means  that  could  have  been  prevented  is  egregious,"  said  Miller,  R-Florida.  "And  it's  not  acceptable."Miller  said  the  VA,  from  the  top  down,  has  consistently  ignored  his  committee's  requests  to  find  out  who  is  responsible.  Even  with  the  delays  in  care  which  have  led  to  deaths  and  serious  injuries,  the  congressman  said  not  a  single  person  has  been  fired  or  even  demoted,  and  in  fact  some  of  those  responsible  may  have  even  gotten  bonuses."I  grieve  for  the  families  who  lost  loved  ones  that  could  have  been  with  them  this  Christmas  that  would  be  celebrating  2014  today  had  the  backlog  not  existed,"  said  Miller.  "That's  not  what  anybody  in  this  country  wants  for  our  veterans."He  said  the  lack  of  accountability  is  what  angers  him  most."That's  why  we  asked  the  question  again  today,  with  members  of  the  South  Carolina  delegation  and  Georgia  delegation,  tell  us  exactly  who  was  disciplined  and  how.  I  don't  want  to  hear  the  excuse  anymore  that  'It  was  multi-faceted.  ...There  were  many  people  involved'  "  said  Miller."Well  if  there  were  many  people  involved  then  they  all  need  to  go.  We  are  not  asking  for  one  particular  person,  we  want  to  know  exactly  why  things  happened  and  who  was  held  responsible,  At  this  point  publicly,  we  haven't  seen  anybody  held  responsible."CNN  has  made  repeated  requests  for  interviews  with  top  officials  at  the  VA,  including  President  Obama's  appointed  head  of  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs,  Secretary  Eric  Shinseki.  The  requests  have  all  been  denied,  or  ignored.The  VA  did  issue  a  written  statement  from  Dr.  Robert  Petzel,  the  Under  Secretary  for  Health  at  the  department  of  Veterans  Affairs.  In  the  statement,  Petzel  wrote  that  "The  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  cares  deeply  for  every  Veteran  we  are  privileged  to  serve.  Our  goal  is  to  provide  the  best  quality,  safe  and  effective  health  care  our  Veterans  have  earned  and  deserve.  We  take  seriously  any  issue  that  occurs  at  any  one  of  the  more  than  1,700  VA  health  care  facilities  across  the  country."He  also  stated:  "As  a  result  of  the  consult  delay  issue  VA  discovered  at  two  of  our  medical  centers,  the  Veterans  Health  Administration  (VHA)  conducted  a  national  review  of  consults  across  the  system.  We  have  redesigned  the  consult  process  to  better  monitor  consult  timeliness.  We  continue  to  take  action  to  strengthen  oversight  mechanisms  and  prevent  a  similar  delay  at  another  VA  medical  center.  We  take  any  issue  of  this  nature  extremely  seriously  and  offer  our  sincerest  condolences  to  families  and  individuals  who  have  been  affected  and  lost  a  loved  one."In  August  2007,  presidential  candidate  Barack  Obama  gave  a  campaign  speech  to  veterans  specifically  addressing  wait  lists,  denied  care  and  poor  treatment  of  vets.  He  promised  his  administration  would  be  different."No  veteran  should  have  to  fill  out  a  23-page  claim  to  get  care,  or  wait  months  --  even  years  --  to  get  an  appointment  at  the  VA,"  said  then-candidate  Obama."When  we  fail  to  keep  faith  with  our  veterans,  the  bond  between  our  nation  and  our  nation's  heroes  becomes  frayed.  When  a  veteran  is  denied  care,  we  are  all  dishonored."But  Coates  said  for  him  the  speech  is  an  empty  promise."Someone  needs  to  stand  and  face  the  person  who  suffered  and  the  veterans  who  have  died  and  say,  'Hey  it  was  me,  I  let  the  ball  drop,'  "  he  said."How  many  lives  are  we  going  to  lose  from  this?""When  is  it  going  to  be  corrected?"</TEXT></DOC>

There  is  a  greater  focus  on  photos  and  content  cards.  It  moves  away  from  a  strictly  vertical  timeline  too.  Click  the  image  below  to  enlarge.It's  common  for  Twitter  to  quietly  test  new  features  and  design  updates  before  tweaking  or  rolling  it  out  to  a  larger  user  base.

Although  Petronzio  isn't  verified  on  the  site,  there's  an  option  for  the  stream  to  show  "Tweets"  and  "Tweets  and  replies"  for  every  user  —  a  feature  typically  reserved  for  those  with  the  blue  check  mark.Other  profile  pages  viewed  from  an  account  with  the  new  design  are  automatically  made  to  look  like  this  too.

Russia  is  the  European  Union's  third-largest  trading  partner  after  the  United  States  and  China.  Germany  relies  heavily  on  Russian  energy.Visa  bans,  which  were  expanded  by  the  State  Department,  were  already  in  place  for  some  Russian  and  Ukrainian  officials.President  Barack  Obama  also  signed  an  executive  order  allowing  the  U.S.  government  to  impose  a  host  of  sanctions  on  both  individuals  and  entities  deemed  to  be  violating  Ukraine's  sovereignty  and  territorial  integrity.If  Russia  continues  "this  violation  of  international  law"  in  Ukraine,  "the  resolve  of  the  United  States  and  our  allies  and  the  international  community  will  remain  firm,"  Obama  said  in  remarks  at  the  White  House.His  executive  order  provides  the  legal  basis  for  sanctions  against  specific  people  and  entities,  though  the  United  States  would  do  so  "based  on  the  situation  on  the  ground"  in  Ukraine,  a  senior  administration  official  told  CNN.It  targets  those  responsible  for  or  complicit  in  actions  that  "undermine  democratic  processes  and  institutions  in  Ukraine,"  the  executive  order  states.No  names  were  revealed,  but  Russian  President  Vladimir  Putin  was  not  on  the  list,  officials  said.Any  sanctions  would  range  from  freezing  assets  and  blocking  property  under  U.S.  jurisdiction  to  preventing  American  companies  from  doing  business  with  any  person  or  entity  listed.The  Obama  administration  had  previously  put  trade  and  investment  pact  talks  with  Russia  on  hold.Separately,  Europe  also  threatened  sanctions  if  the  crisis  cannot  be  resolved  diplomatically  through  talks  between  Moscow  and  Kiev.The  European  Council,  an  arm  of  the  European  Union,  said  it  would  suspend  bilateral  talks  with  Russia  on  visa  matters,  and  also  threatened  travel  bans,  asset  freezes  and  cancellation  of  the  EU-Russia  summit  if  there  is  no  timely  diplomatic  progress.It  also  threatened  "severe  and  far-reaching"  economic  consequences  if  Russia  further  destabilizes  the  situation.Also  in  Washington,  a  congressional  committee  was  set  to  vote  later  in  the  day  on  a  resolution  condemning  Russia's  actions  and  urging  the  United  States  to  pursue  a  broad  range  of  economic  and  other  sanctions.Military  ties,  G8U.S.  action  also  extends  militarily  to  boost  support  for  allies  in  the  region.The  Pentagon  added  six  fighter  jets  to  the  four  currently  on  a  NATO  mission  in  the  Baltics  and  the  guided-missile  destroyer  USS  Truxtun  is  about  to  take  part  in  a  previously  scheduled  exercise  in  the  Black  Sea.In  addition,  the  Pentagon  has  suspended  military  exercises  with  Russia,  and  the  Obama  administration  has  suspended  preparations  for  the  upcoming  G8  summit  of  industrialized  nations  in  the  Black  Sea  resort  of  Sochi,  the  site  of  the  just-completed  Winter  Olympics.Russian  lawmakers  are  drafting  a  law  that  would  allow  the  nation  to  confiscate  assets  belonging  to  U.S.  and  European  companies  if  sanctions  are  slapped  on  Moscow,  Russian  state  media  reported.U.S.  intelligence  under  fire  over  UkraineFive  possible  ways  to  end  the  Ukraine  crisisLabott  reported  from  Rome  and  Kosinski  from  New  York;  CNN  Money's  Mark  Thompson  and  Pierre  Meilhan  contributed  to  this  report.</TEXT></DOC>
